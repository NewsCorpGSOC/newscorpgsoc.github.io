NASA: Mystery Of Life’s Handedness Deepens	The mystery of why life uses molecules with specific orientations has deepened with a NASA-funded discovery that RNA — a key molecule thought to have potentially held the instructions for life before DNA emerged — can favor making the building blocks of proteins in either the left-hand or the right-hand orientation. Resolving this mystery could provide clues to the origin of life. The findings appear in research recently published in Nature Communications. Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life, used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes (catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions). Just as the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in limitless combinations to make words, life uses 20 different amino acid building blocks in a huge variety of arrangements to make millions of different proteins. Some amino acid molecules can be built in two ways, such that mirror-image versions exist, like your hands, and life uses the left-handed variety of these amino acids. Although life based on right-handed amino acids would presumably work fine, the two mirror images are rarely mixed in biology, a characteristic of life called homochirality. It is a mystery to scientists why life chose the left-handed variety over the right-handed one. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that holds the instructions for building and running a living organism. However, DNA is complex and specialized; it 'subcontracts' the work of reading the instructions to RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules and building proteins to ribosome molecules. DNA’s specialization and complexity lead scientists to think that something simpler should have preceded it billions of years ago during the early evolution of life. A leading candidate for this is RNA, which can both store genetic information and build proteins. The hypothesis that RNA may have preceded DNA is called the 'RNA world' hypothesis. If the RNA world proposition is correct, then perhaps something about RNA caused it to favor building left-handed proteins over right-handed ones. However, the new work did not support this idea, deepening the mystery of why life went with left-handed proteins. The experiment tested RNA molecules that act like enzymes to build proteins, called ribozymes. 'The experiment demonstrated that ribozymes can favor either left- or right-handed amino acids, indicating that RNA worlds, in general, would not necessarily have a strong bias for the form of amino acids we observe in biology now,' said Irene Chen, of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Samueli School of Engineering, corresponding author of the Nature Communications paper. In the experiment, the researchers simulated what could have been early-Earth conditions of the RNA world. They incubated a solution containing ribozymes and amino acid precursors to see the relative percentages of the right-handed and left-handed amino acid, phenylalanine, that it would help produce. They tested 15 different ribozyme combinations and found that ribozymes can favor either left-handed or right-handed amino acids. This suggested that RNA did not initially have a predisposed chemical bias for one form of amino acids. This lack of preference challenges the notion that early life was predisposed to select left-handed-amino acids, which dominate in modern proteins. 'The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures,' said co-author Alberto Vázquez-Salazar, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar and member of Chen’s research group. Earth’s prebiotic history lies beyond the oldest part of the fossil record, which has been erased by plate tectonics, the slow churning of Earth’s crust. During that time, the planet was likely bombarded by asteroids, which may have delivered some of life’s building blocks, such as amino acids. In parallel to chemical experiments, other origin-of-life researchers have been looking at molecular evidence from meteorites and asteroids. 'Understanding the chemical properties of life helps us know what to look for in our search for life across the solar system,' said co-author Jason Dworkin, senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and director of Goddard’s Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory. Dworkin is the project scientist on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which extracted samples from the asteroid Bennu and delivered them to Earth last year for further study. 'We are analyzing OSIRIS-REx samples for the chirality (handedness) of individual amino acids, and in the future, samples from Mars will also be tested in laboratories for evidence of life including ribozymes and proteins,' said Dworkin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lTFYJ05qC5UZ	2024-11-21T15:20:08-08:00	
What Are The Effects Of Historic Lithium Mining On Water Quality?	Lithium ore and mining waste from a historic lithium mine located west of Charlotte, North Carolina, are unlikely to contaminate surrounding waters with common pollutants such as arsenic and lead, according to a new study. However, high levels of other metals — namely, lithium, rubidium and cesium — do occur in waters associated with the mine. The new findings, from Avner Vengosh, distinguished professor of environmental quality at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, shed light on potential water quality impacts of legacy, or historic, lithium mining. They also provide baseline data for future studies exploring how reopening lithium mines in the N.C. piedmont will likely affect the water quality of drinking water resources nearby. 'The world is increasingly relying on lithium for the green-energy transition, but previous studies on the environmental effects of hard-rock lithium mining show mixed results,' Vengosh said. 'This study provides new, important data to clarify the possible environmental impacts. The area where the Kings Mountain Mine is located was once the largest lithium-producing region in the world. Situated in wooded, rural terrain of the piedmont, the mine opened in the 1950s and was abandoned in the 1980s, when more accessible lithium deposits drew prospectors to South America. The lithium at Kings Mountain primarily exists in granite-like rock called pegmatite, bound to a green-tinged mineral called spodumene. For their study, the researchers collected samples of pegmatite and waste rocks from in and around the mine, as well as samples of tailings — crushed rocks left over from historic spodumene extraction. They also sampled groundwater from the mine and surface water from Kings Creek, which flows from the mine. Samples from various piedmont streams provided baseline data on water quality. The researchers pulverized rock samples and mixed them in a solution designed to test how various contaminants might enter the surrounding environment. These laboratory experiments simulate how contaminants in the rocks would leach out under natural conditions. The researchers then analyzed the solutions, as well as the surface water and groundwater samples, for a wide range of metals commonly used to evaluate water quality. The study was published online in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Leaching experiments and water samples analyzed in the study showed common regulated contaminants — including arsenic, lead, copper and nickel — at levels below drinking water and ecological standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'The fact that we don’t see these toxic contaminants was, in some way, a relief, because it suggests that future lithium exploration in North Carolina would not cause major negative water quality effects with respect to these elements,' Vengosh said. However, the team found high levels of other metals in the mine site relative to their concentrations in the piedmont water resources. 'We detected elevated concentrations of lithium, which was expected, but also found rubidium and cesium at levels you normally don’t see in natural waters, and that are not federally regulated,' said first author Gordon Williams, a Ph.D. student in Vengosh’s lab and the Division of Earth and Climate Sciences. 'An outstanding question, then, is how these elements affect human and environmental health.' Leaching experiments and evidence from water samples also indicated that the legacy lithium mine does not contribute to environmentally harmful acidic runoff commonly associated with other mining operations, like coal mining. Rather, interactions between the ore and waste rock samples and water led to temporary alkaline, or basic, conditions. The study did not address the effects of active lithium mining and processing on water quality, the authors emphasized. 'Excavating and crushing ore is just one aspect of lithium mining. Processing — which requires a chemical treatment to separate lithium from spodumene — may include additional chemicals that could potentially affect water quality,' Williams said. 'When lithium mining ramps up again in this area, processing could have impacts on local water resources that we didn’t measure,' he cautioned. The researchers are now extending their study by assessing drinking water quality across a band of lithium-rich geological terrain in the piedmont. By sampling private wells and surface water, they can better understand the potential impacts of lithium mining on water quality in North Carolina. The study was funded by the Duke University Climate Research Innovation Seed Program (CRISP) and the Albemarle Corporation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lUNufprwgocM	2024-11-21T15:18:04-08:00	
Fewer Than 7% Of Global Hotspots For Whale-Ship Collisions Have P...	According to the fossil record, cetaceans — whales, dolphins and their relatives — evolved from four-legged land mammals that returned to the oceans beginning some 50 million years ago. Today, their descendants are threatened by a different land-based mammal that has also returned to the sea: humans. Thousands of whales are injured or killed each year after being struck by ships, particularly the large container vessels that ferry 80% of the world’s traded goods across the oceans. Collisions are the leading cause of death worldwide for large whale species. Yet global data on ship strikes of whales are hard to come by — impeding efforts to protect vulnerable whale species. A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales. In the paper, published online in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges. 'This translates to ships traveling thousands of times the distance to the moon and back within these species’ ranges each and every year, and this problem is only projected to increase as global trade grows in the coming decades,' said senior author Briana Abrahms, a UW assistant professor of biology and researcher with the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Whale-ship collisions have typically only been studied at a local or regional level — like off the east and west coasts of the continental U.S., and patterns of risk remain unknown for large areas,' said lead author Anna Nisi, a UW postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Our study is an attempt to fill those knowledge gaps and understand the risk of ship strikes on a global level. It’s important to understand where these collisions are likely to occur because there are some really simple interventions that can substantially reduce collision risk.' The team found that only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas. 'As much as we found cause for concern, we also found some big silver linings,' said Abrahms. 'For example, implementing management measures across only an additional 2.6% of the ocean’s surface would protect all of the highest-risk collision hotspots we identified.' 'Trade-offs between industrial and conservation outcomes are not usually this optimal,' said co-author Heather Welch, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of California, Santa Cruz. 'Oftentimes industrial activities must be greatly limited to achieve conservation goals, or vice versa. In this case, there is a potentially large conservation benefit to whales for not much cost to the shipping industry.' Those highest-risk areas for the four while species included in the study lie largely along coastal areas in the Mediterranean, portions of the Americas, southern Africa and parts of Asia. The international team behind the study, which includes researchers across five continents, looked at the waters where these four whale species live, feed and migrate by pooling data from disparate sources — including government surveys, sightings by members of the public, tagging studies and even whaling records. The team collected some 435,000 unique whale sightings. They then combined this novel database with information on the courses of 176,000 cargo vessels from 2017 to 2022 — tracked by each ship’s automatic identification system and processed using an algorithm from Global Fishing Watch — to identify where whales and ships are most likely to meet. The study uncovered regions already known to be high-risk areas for ship strikes: North America’s Pacific coast, Panama, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. But it also identified understudied regions at high risk for whale-ship collisions, including southern Africa; South America along the coasts of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Ecuador; the Azores; and East Asia off the coasts of China, Japan and South Korea. The team found that mandatory measures to reduce whale-ship collisions were very rare, overlapping just 0.54% of blue whale hotspots and 0.27% of humpback hotspots, and not overlapping any fin or sperm whale hotspots. Though many collision hotspots fell within marine protected areas, these preserves often lack speed limits for vessels, as they were largely established to curb fishing and industrial pollution. For all four species the vast majority of hotpots for whale-ship strikes — more than 95% — hugged coastlines, falling within a nation’s exclusive economic zone. That means that each country could implement its own protection measures in coordination with the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization. 'From the standpoint of conservation, the fact that most high-risk areas lie within exclusive economic zones is actually encouraging,' said Nisi. 'It means individual countries have the ability to protect the riskiest areas.' Of the limited measures now in place, most are along the Pacific coast of North America and in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to speed reduction, other options to reduce whale-ship strikes include changing vessel routings away from where whales are located, or creating alert systems to notify authorities and mariners when whales are nearby. 'Lowering vessel speed in hotspots also carries additional benefits, such as reducing underwater noise pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting air pollution, which helps people living in coastal areas,' said Nisi. The authors hope their global study could spur local or regional research to map out the hotspot zones in finer detail, inform advocacy efforts and consider the impact of climate change, which will change both whale and ship distributions as sea ice melts and ecosystems shift. 'Protecting whales from the impact of ship strikes is a huge global challenge. We’ve seen the benefits of slowing ships down at local scales through programs like ‘Blue Whales Blue Skies’ in California. Scaling up such programs will require a concerted effort by conservation organizations, governments and shipping companies,' said co-author Jono Wilson, director of ocean science at the California Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, which helped identify the need for this study and secured its funding. 'Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems. Through this study we have measurable insights into ship-collision hotspots and risk and where we need to focus to make the most impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lQcUS7HS2lRa	2024-11-21T15:15:31-08:00	
Bye-Bye Microplastics: New Plastic Is Recyclable And Fully Ocean-...	Researchers led by Takuzo Aida at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) have developed a new durable plastic that won’t pollute our oceans. The new material is as strong as conventional plastics and biodegradable, but what makes it special is that it breaks down in seawater. The new plastic is therefore expected to help reduce harmful microplastic pollution that accumulates in oceans and soil and eventually enters the food chain. The experimental findings were published in Science. Scientists have been trying to develop safe and sustainable materials that can replace traditional plastics, which are non-sustainable and harm the environment. While some recyclable and biodegradable plastics exist, one big problem remains. Current biodegradable plastics like PLA often find their way into the ocean where they cannot be degraded because they are water insoluble. As a result, microplastics—plastic bits smaller than 5 mm—are harming aquatic life and finding their way into the food chain, including our own bodies. In their new study, Aida and his team focused on solving this problem with supramolecular plastics—polymers with structures held together by reversible interactions. The new plastics were made by combining two ionic monomers that form cross-linked salt bridges, which provide strength and flexibility. In the initial tests, one of the monomers was a common food additive called sodium hexametaphosphate and the other was any of several guanidinium ion-based monomers. Both monomers can be metabolized by bacteria, ensuring biodegradability once the plastic is dissolved into its components. 'While the reversable nature of the bonds in supramolecular plastics have been thought to make them weak and unstable,' says Aida, 'our new materials are just the opposite.' In the new material, the salt bridges structure is irreversible unless exposed to electrolytes like those found in seawater. The key discovery was how to create these selectively irreversible cross links. As with oil with water, after mixing the two monomers together in water, the researchers observed two separated liquids. One was thick and viscous and contained the important structural cross linked salt bridges, while the other was watery and contained salt ions. For example, when sodium hexametaphosphate and alkyl diguanidinium sulfate were used, sodium sulphate salt was expelled into the watery layer. The final plastic, alkyl SP₂, was made by drying what remained in the thick viscous liquid layer. The 'desalting' turned out to be the critical step; without it, the resulting dried material was a brittle crystal, unfit for use. Resalting the plastic by placing it in salt water caused the interactions to reverse and the plastic’s structure destabilized in a matter of hours. Thus, having created a strong and durable plastic that can still be dissolved under certain conditions, the researchers next tested the plastic’s quality. The new plastics are non-toxic and non-flammable—meaning no CO2 emissions—and can be reshaped at temperatures above 120°C like other thermoplastics. By testing different types of guanidinium sulfates, the team was able to generate plastics that had varying hardnesses and tensile strengths, all comparable or better than conventional plastics. This means that the new type of plastic can be customized for need; hard scratch resistant plastics, rubber silicone-like plastics, strong weight-bearing plastics, or low tensile flexible plastics are all possible. The researchers also created ocean-degradable plastics using polysaccharides that form cross-linked salt bridges with guanidinium monomers. Plastics like these can be used in 3D printing as well as medical or health-related applications. Lastly, the researchers investigated the new plastic’s recyclability and biodegradability. After dissolving the initial new plastic in salt water, they were able to recover 91% of the hexametaphosphate and 82% of the guanidinium as powders, indicating that recycling is easy and efficient. In soil, sheets of the new plastic degraded completely over the course of 10 days, supplying the soil with phosphorous and nitrogen similar to a fertilizer. 'With this new material, we have created a new family of plastics that are strong, stable, recyclable, can serve multiple functions, and importantly, do not generate microplastics,' says Aida.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MmdfIEfsRign	2024-11-21T15:13:35-08:00	
Quantum-Inspired Design Boosts Efficiency Of Heat-To-Electricity ...	Researchers at Rice University have found a new way to improve a key element of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, which convert heat into electricity via light. Using an unconventional approach inspired by quantum physics, Rice engineer Gururaj Naik and his team designed a thermal emitter that can deliver high efficiencies within practical design parameters.The research could inform the development of thermal-energy electrical storage, which holds promise as an affordable, grid-scale alternative to batteries. More broadly, efficient TPV technologies could facilitate renewable energy growth ⎯ an essential component of the transition to a net-zero world. Another major benefit of better TPV systems is recouping waste heat from industrial processes, making them more sustainable. To put this in context, up to 20-50% of the heat used to transform raw materials into consumer goods ends up being wasted, costing the United States economy over $200 billion annually.TPV systems involve two main components ⎯ photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert light into electricity and thermal emitters that turn heat into light. Both of these components have to work well in order for the system to be efficient, but efforts to optimize them have focused more on the PV cell. 'Using conventional design approaches limits thermal emitters’ design space, and what you end up with is one of two scenarios: practical, low-performance devices or high-performance emitters that are hard to integrate in real-world applications,' said Naik, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. In a new study published in npj Nanophotonics, Naik and his former Ph.D. student Ciril Samuel Prasad ⎯ who has since earned a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering from Rice and has taken on a role as a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ⎯ demonstrated a new thermal emitter that promises efficiencies of over 60% despite being application-ready. 'We essentially showed how to achieve the best possible performance for the emitter given realistic, practical design constraints,' said Prasad, who is the first author on the study.The emitter is composed of a tungsten metal sheet, a thin layer of a spacer material and a network of silicon nanocylinders. When heated, the base layers accumulate thermal radiation, which can be thought of as a bath of photons. The tiny resonators sitting on top 'talk' to each other in a way that allows them to 'pluck photon by photon' from this bath, controlling the brightness and bandwidth of the light sent to the PV cell.'Instead of focusing on the performance of single-resonator systems, we instead took into account the way these resonators interact, which opened up new possibilities,' Naik explained. 'This gave us control over how the photons are stored and released.' This selective emission, achieved through insights from quantum physics, maximizes energy conversion and allows for higher efficiencies than previously possible, operating at the limit of the materials’ properties. To improve on the newly achieved 60% efficiency, new materials with better properties would need to be developed or discovered.These gains could make TPV a competitive alternative to other energy storage and conversion technologies like lithium-ion batteries, particularly in scenarios where long-term energy storage is needed. Naik noted that this innovation has significant implications for industries that generate large amounts of waste heat such as nuclear power plants and manufacturing facilities.'I feel confident that what we have demonstrated here, coupled with a very efficient low bandgap PV cell, has very promising potential,' Naik said. 'Based on my own experience working with NASA and launching a startup in the renewable energy space, I think that energy conversion technologies are very much in need today.'The team’s technology could also be used in space applications such as powering rovers on Mars.'If our approach could lead to an increase in efficiency from 2% to 5% in such systems, that would represent a significant boost for missions that rely on efficient power generation in extreme environments,' Naik said.The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1935446) and the U.S. Army Research Office.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-21T15:11:27-08:00	
Exploring The Impact Of Offshore Wind On Whale Deaths	In the winter of 2022-2023, nearly a dozen whales died off the coast of New Jersey, near the sites of several proposed wind farms. Their deaths prompted concern that related survey work being conducted in the area somehow contributed to their deaths. In pursuit of clean energy goals and to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions, developers are increasingly exploring building wind turbines in the waters off the East Coast of the United States. Three offshore wind farms are already in operation, with several more planned or underway. These wind farms stand to generate a significant amount of carbon-free electricity, which can help coastal states meet their decarbonization goals. The increased presence of these turbines in coastal waters, along with the noise from construction and surveys, has led to concerns of their impact on marine life. In particular, cetaceans such as whales and dolphins are likely to be sensitive to the noises and increased marine traffic brought by these turbines. However, the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal oversight agency, states there is no evidence linking the whales that died in the New Jersey region in the winter of 2022-2023 to wind energy development. According to necropsies performed on recovered whales, many of them died from collisions with ships. The Marine Mammal Commission notes that this is not a particularly unusual occurrence, nor is the number of whale deaths in this period higher than average. A rise in ship strikes over the last decade is mostly due to a simple combination of more whales plus more ships. 'In the case of a lot of whales, population recoveries since the cessation of commercial whaling are coincident with increasing shipping traffic and increasing fishing efforts,' said Stocker. 'This is resulting in increased interactions between whales and the industrialization of the ocean.' Stocker, however, is concerned that the increased presence of survey ships in and around New Jersey waters may have exacerbated this issue. 'Were the ship strikes just a coincidence?' asked Stocker. 'Or were they a product of compromised whale vigilance due to aggregated stress factors?' Survey ships are employed by wind farm developers to map the seafloor in preparation for construction. These ships use underwater acoustic devices in their efforts, which can stress marine mammals such as whales. While one survey ship likely has little effect, Stocker highlights that 11 different surveys were operating in the region from December 2022 to March 2023, and that the cumulative impact of these surveys has not been properly evaluated. Stocker hopes his session will spark a discussion among attendees with the goal of identifying approaches to minimize whale deaths in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeEK_t_OqF2dsQ36glFESvq	2024-11-21T15:09:31-08:00	
Astronomers Take The First Close-Up Picture Of A Star Outside Our...	For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way,' says Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Located a staggering 160 000 light-years from us, the star WOH G64 was imaged thanks to the impressive sharpness offered by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (ESO’s VLTI). The new observations reveal a star puffing out gas and dust, in the last stages before it becomes a supernova. 'We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star,' says Ohnaka, the lead author of a study reporting the observations published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 'We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion.' While astronomers have taken about two dozen zoomed-in images of stars in our galaxy, unveiling their properties, countless other stars dwell within other galaxies, so far away that observing even one of them in detail has been extremely challenging. Up until now. The newly imaged star, WOH G64, lies within the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the small galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Astronomers have known about this star for decades and have appropriately dubbed it the ‘behemoth star’. With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 is classified as a red supergiant. Ohnaka’s team had long been interested in this behemoth star. Back in 2005 and 2007, they used ESO’s VLTI in Chile’s Atacama Desert to learn more about the star’s features, and carried on studying it in the years since. But an actual image of the star had remained elusive. For the desired picture, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI’s second-generation instruments, GRAVITY. After comparing their new results with other previous observations of WOH G64, they were surprised to find that the star had become dimmer over the past decade. 'We have found that the star has been experiencing a significant change in the last 10 years, providing us with a rare opportunity to witness a star’s life in real time,' says Gerd Weigelt, an astronomy professor at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany and a co-author of the study. In their final life stages, red supergiants like WOH G64 shed their outer layers of gas and dust in a process that can last thousands of years. 'This star is one of the most extreme of its kind, and any drastic change may bring it closer to an explosive end,' adds co-author Jacco van Loon, Keele Observatory Director at Keele University, UK, who has been observing WOH G64 since the 1990s. The team thinks that these shed materials may also be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the dust cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched-out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models. The team believes that the cocoon’s egg-like shape could be explained by either the star’s shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star. As the star becomes fainter, taking other close-up pictures of it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for the VLTI. Nonetheless, planned updates to the telescope’s instrumentation, such as the future GRAVITY+, promise to change this soon. 'Similar follow-up observations with ESO instruments will be important for understanding what is going on in the star,' concludes Ohnaka.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXKJpqYMBg15l	2024-11-21T15:07:18-08:00	
Research Highlights The Pressures Human Activities Place On Tropi...	The tropical coastlines of Southeast Asia are home to some of the most important and biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet. However, they are also among its most vulnerable, with areas of coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass beds under increasing threat from a wide range of human activities. To try and better understand those potential threats, a study by an international team of researchers has provided the first detailed assessment of activities taking place within coastal and marine habitats and the impact they have on those ecosystems. The research focused on case study sites in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, including marine protected areas in UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserves as well as a Marine Park. Of the 26 activities that were examined, it found that particular fishing techniques – and tourism and recreation – posed the greatest threat to the ecosystems. The fishing practices, including trawling and the use of gill and seine nets, were shown to cause physical pressures such as abrasion, smothering, siltation and total habitat loss. Meanwhile tourism activities resulted in different pressures such as organic enrichment, litter and pollution, in particular affecting coral reef habitats. With fishing and tourism being critical to the region’s economy, the researchers hope that highlighting their potential to impact specific locations could help ensure they can be conducted in a more sustainable manner in the future. The study, published in the British Ecological Society’s Journal of Applied Ecology, was led by researchers from the University of Plymouth together and involved colleagues from across Southeast Asia. It was carried out as part of Blue Communities, a £6.7million programme funded through the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) in partnership with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Dr Fiona Culhane, who carried out the research as part of a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Plymouth, and is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Marine Institute in Ireland, is the study’s lead author. She said: 'These sites are globally significant for their high marine biodiversity, but are at high risk of pressures from human activities. This work, carried out in collaboration with local communities and in-country researchers, has demonstrated that different locations experience different risks, according to the level of human activities in the sea. By better understanding how human activities are impacting various marine habitats, and the ecosystem services they provide, we can provide local stakeholders and marine managers with clearer evidence that they can use to inform future action.' Professor Melanie Austen, Professor of Ocean and Society at the University of Plymouth and lead of the Blue Communities programme, added: 'This study is a powerful example of strong collaboration between researchers from the Global South and Global North. Its aim, and that of the entire programme, has been to provide much needed analysis and information to help coastal communities live within the environmental limits of the natural marine resources.' In addition to forms of fishing and tourism, the research explored the importance and impact of activities including waste disposal, sand mining, aquaculture, coastal infrastructure development, and antique exploration. It then mapped whether, and to what extent, each activity caused forms of disruption including light, noise and water pollution, as well as physical damage to the coastline and seabed and the habitats they contained. Across the different countries, there was variation in the activities posing the greatest pressures with, for example, high risk coming from seine nets in Vietnam, fish farming in Malaysia and pots, traps and barricades in the Philippines. There were also differences across the main habitat types, with trawling and blast finishing among the activities posing the greatest risk to coral reefs, while shrimp farming placed the greatest pressure on mangroves, and trawling and tourism introduced the highest risk to seagrass. Dr Amy Y. Then, Associate Professor in the Institute of Biological Sciences at the Universiti Malaya in Malaysia, said: 'Findings from this paper challenge the way we think about spatially managing multiple economic activities and their impacts on vital coastal ecosystems. By identifying interactions between these activities and the habitats where they take place, we are able to make better marine spatial management decisions to ensure sustainability and resilience of these socio-ecological systems and their functioning.' Dr Radisti Praptiwi, researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, added 'This is an important study, especially in the context of data poor regions such as Indonesia. Research on understanding the impact chains linking activities and pressures to the marine environment can not only help identify the types of activities and habitats to be prioritised for management purposes, but also highlights areas for further research required for evidence-based policymaking.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXLwW2N6rpCd5	2024-11-21T15:04:50-08:00	
North Korea’s Troop Deployment To Russia: A Threat To Global Secu...	The deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to support Russia in its conflict with Ukraine poses significant threats to international security and geopolitical stability. This manoeuvre not only escalates the ongoing conflict but also further aligns authoritarian states against democratic nations, thereby challenging established international norms and the fragile global balance of power. Immediate and coordinated action from the international community is essential to avert catastrophic consequences. North Korea's involvement would intensify hostilities, embolden other authoritarian regimes to act with impunity, and potentially incite widespread instability throughout Eastern Europe and beyond. This analysis posits that such an intervention constitutes a profound threat to international security and order, necessitating urgent diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and mitigate the risks of escalation. North Korea's potential troop deployment is particularly concerning because it would directly violate United Nations sanctions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's militaristic ambitions and destabilising activities. This action would undermine the credibility of the United Nations and challenge the broader framework of international law that prohibits the external militarisation of conflicts. Furthermore, it would legitimise the use of proxy forces by authoritarian regimes to influence regional conflicts, thereby undermining the principle of state sovereignty.Russia's acceptance of North Korean troops reflects its desperation to bolster its military efforts amid increasing resistance from Ukrainian forces supported by Western allies. The involvement of North Korean troops could significantly alter the dynamics of the conflict, compelling Ukraine to adapt to a more formidable military challenge while complicating logistical and strategic considerations for its Western supporters.North Korea's motivations for this deployment appear rooted in strategic calculations. First, the North seeks to reinforce its alliance with Russia, a critical supporter during its period of international isolation and economic sanctions. In return, Russia may offer North Korea advanced weapons technology, energy resources, or diplomatic protection at the United Nations, thereby strengthening a burgeoning alliance of authoritarian states opposing Western dominance. Second, North Korea likely views this as an opportunity to showcase its military capabilities and attain a more influential position in global geopolitics. By actively participating in a significant international conflict, Pyongyang may aim to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States and other powers concerning its nuclear programme and the sanctions imposed on it. Third, North Korea may perceive this engagement as a chance to evaluate its military in real combat scenarios, potentially bolstering its domestic image among its populace and military elites. The implications of such a deployment extend significantly beyond the battlefield. Regionally, it would heighten tensions in East Asia, where nations such as South Korea and Japan are already apprehensive regarding North Korea's aggressive posture and military threats. The potential involvement of North Korean troops in Ukraine might prompt these countries to enhance their military preparedness, potentially triggering an arms race in the region. Additionally, China, North Korea’s traditional ally, would encounter a complex dilemma. While Beijing may prefer a stronger Russia to counterbalance U.S. influence, it could also express concern regarding the destabilising effects of Pyongyang’s actions and the risk of increasing international scrutiny on its role in global geopolitics. Globally, North Korea’s intervention would establish a precedent that emboldens other states to disregard international norms. Authoritarian regimes may feel more empowered to engage in military actions, whether to support allied governments or suppress opposition movements abroad. This erosion of international law could usher in an era of heightened conflict and instability, undermining decades of efforts to establish a rules-based global order. For Western powers, North Korea’s involvement creates a strategic dilemma, compelling nations such as the United States, the European Union, and NATO to determine the extent to which they are willing to counter not only Russia but also its external supporters. A miscalculation in this context could escalate the conflict into a broader war involving multiple major powers. To address this crisis, the international community must take prompt steps to prevent North Korea from deploying troops and to mitigate broader escalation risks. Diplomacy should serve as the primary tool. Direct engagement with North Korea may prove challenging; however, neutral countries could act as intermediaries to convey the consequences of such a move. Offering Pyongyang economic incentives or security assurances in exchange for refraining from intervention might represent a viable pathway. Concurrently, the United Nations must reassert its authority by convening an emergency session to address potential sanctions violations and to issue a strong condemnation against any external military involvement in the Ukraine conflict.Furthermore, the West should enhance its support for Ukraine by increasing the supply of advanced weaponry and intelligence to equip Kyiv to counter any escalation. Simultaneously, efforts should be directed toward economically and diplomatically pressuring Russia. Strengthening sanctions on Russian entities and individuals involved in facilitating troop deployments, combined with intensified efforts to isolate Moscow on the global stage, could deter further reliance on foreign military support. Establishing multilateral dialogue platforms involving nations from East Asia and Europe could also facilitate addressing the broader implications of North Korea’s actions and create mechanisms for de-escalation. In conclusion, the potential deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in Ukraine signifies a critical juncture in global politics, carrying extensive implications for international security and order. This situation underscores the increasing alignment of authoritarian regimes that are prepared to challenge established norms through overt militarism. The international community must respond with decisiveness to mitigate this development, employing a strategic blend of diplomatic engagement, economic pressure, and military preparedness. While the immediate focus should be on deterring North Korea’s involvement, long-term strategies must prioritise the reinforcement of international law principles and the promotion of cooperation to address the root causes of such conflicts. A unified multilateral approach is imperative to maintain global stability and uphold the values of peace and sovereignty that underpin the international system.

The Puzzle Of Meaning: Wittgenstein’s Revolution And His Philosop...	Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His groundbreaking works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) and Philosophical Investigations (1953), laid the foundation for two distinct phases of his thought—commonly referred to as the 'early Wittgenstein' and the 'later Wittgenstein.' His ideas profoundly shaped several domains of philosophy, including logic, language, epistemology, and metaphysics, influencing a wide range of philosophers and intellectual movements. This article explores Wittgenstein's core ideas and his impact on philosophy, shedding light on the intellectuals and movements he influenced. The Core Ideas of Wittgenstein 1. The Early Wittgenstein: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein's Tractatus addresses the relationship between language, thought, and reality. It is built on the premise that the world is composed of facts, not objects, and that language represents these facts through logical propositions. Key Ideas Picture Theory of Language Wittgenstein argues that language functions as a 'picture' of reality. A proposition mirrors a possible state of affairs, meaning that language and the world share a logical structure. For instance, the sentence 'The cat is on the mat' corresponds to the fact that a cat is indeed on the mat. Logical Atomism Influenced by Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein proposed that the world consists of atomic facts—basic, indivisible components—and language's purpose is to map these facts. Limits of Language Wittgenstein famously concluded the Tractatus with the aphorism: 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.' He suggests that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic questions lie beyond the bounds of meaningful language. This work influenced the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists, who sought to ground philosophy in logical analysis and empirical verification. 2. The Later Wittgenstein: Philosophical Investigations In his later work, Wittgenstein shifted focus, critiquing his earlier views and emphasizing the social and practical aspects of language. Key Ideas Language Games Wittgenstein argued that the meaning of words arises from their use in various 'language games'—contexts of activity governed by rules. Language is not a fixed system but a fluid, social phenomenon where meaning depends on context. Rule-Following and Practices He explored how individuals understand and follow rules, emphasizing shared practices rather than abstract logic as the foundation of communication. Family Resemblance Instead of fixed definitions, Wittgenstein introduced the idea that concepts often share overlapping similarities, like members of a family, without having a single, unifying essence. Critique of Private Language Wittgenstein rejected the idea of a purely private language, arguing that language inherently requires public criteria for meaning. This phase of Wittgenstein's thought influenced ordinary language philosophy and broader philosophical debates on meaning and understanding. Philosophers Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) Although Russell influenced Wittgenstein during the latter's early years, Wittgenstein's Tractatus left a deep impression on Russell. He adopted and later critiqued Wittgenstein's logical atomism in his own works. Russell struggled with Wittgenstein's assertion that certain topics, such as ethics, are inexpressible. 2. The Vienna Circle Wittgenstein's early ideas strongly influenced the Vienna Circle, a group of logical positivists including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath. They embraced his notion of the limits of language and sought to construct a philosophy based on scientific principles. Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) Carnap applied Wittgenstein's ideas to his project of logical syntax, although he diverged on metaphysical issues, adopting a more empiricist stance. 3. Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976) Ryle, a prominent figure in ordinary language philosophy, engaged with Wittgenstein's later works. His Concept of Mind reflected Wittgenstein's critique of dualism and the private language argument. 4. J.L. Austin (1911–1960) Austin's speech act theory owes much to Wittgenstein's focus on the practical use of language. Austin examined how utterances perform actions, aligning with Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games. 5. Peter Strawson (1919–2006) Strawson's descriptive metaphysics was influenced by Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the emphasis on ordinary language as a guide to philosophical inquiry. 6. Saul Kripke (1940–2022) Kripke's Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language is one of the most significant interpretations of Wittgenstein's later work. Kripke presented a skeptical reading, questioning how rules are followed and understood, sparking debates in epistemology and the philosophy of language. 7. Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001) A student of Wittgenstein, Anscombe translated the Tractatus into English and engaged deeply with his ideas. Her works on intention and ethics reflect Wittgensteinian insights into human action and meaning. 8. Norman Malcolm (1911–1990) Malcolm, another student of Wittgenstein, contributed to the understanding of the later Wittgenstein, particularly his views on memory and the mind. 9. Stanley Cavell (1926–2018) Cavell explored Wittgenstein's later philosophy in relation to skepticism and ordinary language. His works, such as The Claim of Reason, extended Wittgensteinian ideas into aesthetics and ethics. 10. John Searle (1932–2022) Searle's philosophy of language and mind, particularly his theory of speech acts, draws on Wittgenstein's analysis of language use. 11. Richard Rorty (1931–2007) Rorty integrated Wittgenstein's later philosophy into his critique of traditional epistemology, advocating for a pragmatic approach that aligns with Wittgenstein's anti-essentialism. 12. Michel Foucault (1926–1984) Although not directly linked, Foucault's concept of discourse reflects Wittgenstein's emphasis on the social and contextual dimensions of language. 13. Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) Derrida's deconstruction shares affinities with Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the focus on meaning as contextual and contingent. 14. Hilary Putnam (1926–2016) Putnam engaged with Wittgenstein's ideas in his critique of metaphysical realism and his exploration of the philosophy of mind and language. 15. D.Z. Phillips (1934–2006) Phillips applied Wittgenstein's ideas to philosophy of religion, rejecting metaphysical approaches and focusing on the use of religious language. Movements Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Logical Positivism Wittgenstein's early work shaped the agenda of logical positivism, although he later distanced himself from their strict empiricism. 2. Ordinary Language Philosophy The later Wittgenstein inspired philosophers like Austin and Ryle, emphasizing the analysis of everyday language. 3. Postmodernism Wittgenstein's critique of grand theories and focus on contextual meaning resonated with postmodernist thinkers. 4. Philosophy of Mind His ideas on rule-following, private language, and mental states influenced debates in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Critiques and Counterpoints While Wittgenstein's ideas were transformative, they also faced criticism. Karl Popper critiqued Wittgenstein's view of philosophy as merely descriptive, arguing for a more critical and problem-solving approach. Noam Chomsky rejected Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games, advocating for a universal grammar rooted in cognitive structures. Conclusion Ludwig Wittgenstein's legacy lies in his dual contributions to philosophy- the logical precision of the Tractatus and the dynamic, contextual approach of the Philosophical Investigations. His influence extends across multiple fields, from analytic philosophy to postmodernism, and his ideas continue to inspire and challenge philosophers. By reimagining the boundaries of language and thought, Wittgenstein reshaped the philosophical landscape, leaving an enduring mark on intellectual history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgG3YrJqnlYH9	2024-11-21T09:28:18-08:00	
Ukraine Accuses Russia Of Firing Intercontinental Ballistic Missi...	(RFE/RL) -- Russia launched a massive missile attack early on November 21 on Ukraine that caused damage in at least two regions, Ukraine's air force and regional leaders reported, as the whole country was under an air-raid alert for several hours. The Russian attack, which Kyiv said included the use of an intercontinental ballistic missile, comes just days after reports that Ukraine used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS systems to strike military targets deeper inside Russia following the long-sought approval by President Joe Biden. 'On the morning of November 21, 2024...Russian troops attacked the city of Dnipro (facilities and critical infrastructure) with missiles of various types. In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation,' the Ukrainian Air Force said in its statement on Telegram. The Kremlin has refused to comment on the alleged firing of the ICBM, which, if proved, would be the first use of such a weapon in war. ICBMs are designed to deliver long-distance nuclear strikes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram, 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is. And how afraid he is.' 'All characteristics -- speed, altitude -- [point to an] intercontinental ballistic missile,' Zelenskiy said. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry walked back the air force's definitive statement, saying Kyiv is still determining what type of missile struck in Dnipro. 'If it is confirmed that specifically an intercontinental ballistic missile was used, then we believe it can be said that Putin's Russia has degraded to the status of North Korea,' ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said. Military analysts, however, were cautious about labeling the missile as an ICBM, noting such missiles can also be classified as intermediate-range missiles when their payloads are increased and ranges decreased. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said that, if confirmed, the use of an ICBM would be 'extremely serious.' The Pentagon did not immediately return a request for comment. The main target of the Russian attack was the southeastern region of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine's most important industrial region, and its capital, the city of Dnipro. Ukraine's air force said that besides the ICBM, Russian aircraft also launched a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile and seven subsonic Kh-101 cruise missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 missiles, the air force reported. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said his region bore the brunt of the Russian attack. 'Since early in the morning, the aggressor massively attacked our region,' Lysak reported on Telegram, adding that preliminary information showed that an industrial facility was damaged in the regional capital, Dnipro, where two fires were started by the attack. Explosions were also reported in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region. Moscow's use of a large number of sophisticated missiles as opposed to the usual drone attacks appears to be in response to Ukraine's gaining approval to use some Western-donated long-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia. On November 20, Russian military bloggers and a source cited by Reuters reported that Ukraine had fired up to 12 Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles into Russia's Kursk region, part of which has been under Ukrainian control following a surprise incursion by Ukrainian troops in August. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to confirm whether the missiles had been used. Previously, London had given permission to use the Storm Shadows, which have a 250-kilometer range, within Ukraine's territory. Earlier this week, Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike a military facility in Russia's Bryansk region after Biden was reported as giving his OK. The White House has not officially confirmed the approval and Ukraine hasn't directly acknowledged the use of ATACMS on Russian targets. Russia has long warned that Ukraine's use Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside its territory would mark a serious escalation of the conflict. On November 21, Moscow said a new U.S. missile defence base in the Polish town of Redzikowo near the Baltic coast, which was opened on November 13 as part of a broader NATO missile shield, will lead to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger. 'This is another frankly provocative step in a series of deeply destabilising actions by the Americans and their allies in the North Atlantic alliance in the strategic sphere,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 'This leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger,' Zakharova said. Poland rejected the claim, saying there were no nuclear missiles at the base. 'It is a base that serves the purpose of defense, not attack,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said on November 21.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgHAEKF7rf7CP	2024-11-21T09:26:49-08:00	
The Mainstream Media’s Big Lie Never Stops – OpEd	Eduardo Porter joined the chorus of people telling us that the inequality of the last four decades was just the result of the free market in his Washington Post column. As Porter puts it: 'A paper last year by economists from Princeton and Columbia argues that Democrats started losing the working class back in the 1970s, when they bought into the notion that the government should let market forces rip, dropping the New Deal approach of improving workers’ lot via strong unions, job guarantees, minimum wages and protectionism — and instead assisting the economy’s losers via taxes and transfers.' He then argues that this is the source of the rise in working class support for authoritarianism. The problem with this line is that we did not let market forces rip. Government-granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the market. They are hugely important in the economy, likely shifting more than $1 trillion a year ($8,000 a family) from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from these monopoles. Higher drug prices are the most visible transfer, but these monopolies also add hugely to the price of a wide range of other items like computers, software, smartphones. Then we also have government support for the financial industry. This was most visible during the financial crisis when the government directly saved many of the largest financial corporations in the country from bankruptcy. There are many other supports for the financial industry, such as deposit insurance, which are less visible. This sector is the source of many of the largest fortunes in the economy. We also have rules of corporate governance that allow CEOs and other top executives to rip off the companies they work for. This allows hugely bloated pay at the top which comes at the expense of ordinary workers. These rules are not 'letting the market rip.' They are written by politicians who get campaign contributions from top executives. Also 'free trade' has never meant free trade in highly paid professions like physicians’ and dentists’ services. If these highly paid professionals were subject to the same sort of competition as autoworkers and textiles workers their pay would be considerably lower, and healthcare would be cheaper for the rest of us. I go into these issues in more detail in my book Rigged (it’s free), but the basic point should be clear. There is a widely repeated lie that inequality was driven by the natural workings of the market. The reality is that politicians of both parties worked to structure the market to bring about more unequal outcomes. The media and most of the academic establishment actively push this lie at every opportunity. And people are pissed. To be clear, I’m sure that almost none of them know anything about patent policy or the rules of corporate governance. They just know that the rules are structured against them, and they are absolutely right. And elite outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Atlantic won’t let anyone make this obvious point in the spaces they control.

The World Monetary Order: From Currency Globalization To Currency...	The world economic order began to undergo a profound shift after Russia launched its war against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response. Not only is the architecture of the global economy changing, but also the global monetary system. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-led unipolar world order was fueling the process of hyper-globalization. For its part, hyper-globalization has largely contributed to the maintenance of that unipolar world order, which primarily stems from the interconnectedness of globalization and world order. The unipolar world order and hyper-globalization played a central role in determining the global monetary system, with the US dollar commanding leadership in world trade as the primary reserve currency. By 2000, over 70% of all foreign-exchange reserves were held in US dollars, and its dominance in international trade led exporters and importers to increasingly rely on dollar-denominated borrowing. Based on this, the US dollar, as the world’s main reserve currency, was employed to advance US interests. Hyper-globalization, in turn, strengthened the position of the US dollar in the global economy. In this context, the clear dominance of the US dollar in both international trade and global foreign-exchange reserves can be characterized as currency globalization. The economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia have affected the global dominance of the US dollar. At the start of the war in Ukraine, one-fifth of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves were in dollar assets, much of which were in Germany, France, Britain and Japan, which, along with other Western countries, are now working together to isolate Moscow from the global financial system. In the context of the US dollar’s weakening position as the dominant global currency, the West’s seizure of nearly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held by the US and its allies, and the use of the proceeds to defend and rebuild Ukraine, has taken on particular significance. It is important to acknowledge that over the past half-century, the dominance of the US dollar has experienced fluctuations. For instance, while the dollar’s share of world currency reserves was 80% in 1970, by 1980 it had dropped to 58%, and by 1990 to 47%. However, by 2000, it had rebounded to 70%. Since then, the share of the US dollar in world currency reserves has declined again, by 2020 reaching 59%. Notably, this decline was not accompanied by significant gains for traditional reserve currencies like the euro, yen and pound sterling. Instead, the shift has been towards non-traditional reserve currencies, such as the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singapore dollar and the currencies of the Nordic countries. With the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the process of globalization entered the stage of confrontational globalization, seeing the countries of the world divided into three groups: those supporting Western sanctions, those supporting Russia, and neutral countries. As a result, the unipolar world order began to transform into a multipolar world order. This could not help but influence the world monetary order that developed under hyper-globalization, when the geopolitical factor stood in the way of monetary globalization. Currency geopolitics, where geopolitical factors increasingly determine both the currencies in international trade and the formation of foreign exchange reserves, is not a new phenomenon. After the First World War, geopolitical motives played an important role in selecting international currencies for foreign exchange reserves. While the geopolitical factor remains in the era of currency globalization, it does not dominate the system. From this, it follows that currency globalization and currency geopolitics do not exclude each other at all, but rather complement each other. At the same time,in certain historical periods, as a rule, one of them prevails: either currency globalization or currency geopolitics. It is also important to highlight that the dollar’s status as a global reserve currency is declining not only due to geopolitical factors, but also due to US fiscal policy, which has resulted in central and commercial banks in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates having less and less need for US dollars. The geopolitically driven shift away from the US dollar in trade transactions will reduce its role as a reserve currency, although this role cannot in principle be reduced to zero. In the context of the significant uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the modern geopolitical landscape, and the geopolitical fragmentation of risks resulting from the Western sanctions on Russia, there has been a noteworthy accumulation of gold as an alternative reserve asset, and increase in the use of various currencies in international trade. The euro, while it is the second-largest reserve currency by scale of global distribution, cannot completely replace the US dollar in the global economy. Despite accounting for 21% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves as of 2023, the euro is not reliable as a universal reserve asset. Structural and political problems in the EU, particularly the lack of a coordinated fiscal policy among its member states, undermine its stability and appeal as an alternative to the US dollar. In 2023, both Western-sanctioned Russia and China called for the creation of a multipolar global monetary system. However, the prospect of a near-term transition from US dollar-dominance to an alternative global reserve currency appears unrealistic. BRICS+ (which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates) is seeking to play a significant role in challenging the dominance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. A key aspect of this strategy is the shift towards conducting oil and gas trade in national currencies, as a result of which prices for them would not be set in US dollars. As a result, these countries have managed to increase the share of trade carried out between them to 65%. The petrodollar system, which emerged in the 1970s to evaluate oil in dollars, significantly reinforced the position of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. However, due to the factors noted above, such as the Western economic sanctions against Russia, many countries have started to seek alternatives to the petrodollar. The growing energy ties between Saudi Arabia and China have contributed to the replacement of the petrodollar with the petro-yuan, with long-term oil trading contracts denominated in yuan. It should be noted that many developing countries had expressed a desire for an alternative to the US dollar long before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This desire grew even stronger after the West imposed sanctions on Russia, including by cutting off many of its banks from SWIFT and freezing its $300 billion in international assets. Although China is increasingly using the renminbi in cross-border payments, its financial system still remains dependent not only on the US dollar, but also on the US financial system, which is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. China’s growing role in global trade has contributed to the yuan’s rise as a global currency, although there are objective reasons (notably strict government controls on capital flows, lack of transparency in financial markets, and centralization of one-party political power) that make many countries reluctant to use it as a reserve currency. The BRICS countries intend to create a new reserve currency backed by a basket of their own national currencies, with the potential for gold-backing in addition. This initiative is expected to accelerate the de-dollarization process, reducing global dependence on the dollar. That said, due to the unresolved nature of many institutional, organizational and technical issues, BRICS is still far from resolving the issue of introducing a new reserve currency. The push for de-dollarization will have serious consequences for both the US and the global economy. In particular, inflationary pressures could increase for the US economy, the US position in international financial institutions may weaken, while developing countries could reduce their dollar debt and gain greater financial autonomy. Although the US dollar is likely to continue its global dominance and retain its role as the world’s main reserve currency in the short and medium term, it is fundamentally unacceptable to overlook the gradual strengthening of the currency geopolitics factor. It should be emphasized that the relationship between cryptocurrencies and geopolitics warrants independent study, as do the geopolitical aspects of central bank digital currencies. In conclusion, we can say that the new world monetary order is being formed as a combination of monetary globalization and monetary geopolitics, in which the latter plays a predominant role.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYAYd36wrCSz	2024-11-21T09:22:44-08:00	
Ukraine’s Choice: NATO Membership Or Going Nuclear – OpEd	Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17, surprised many especially Ukrainians, that in the war for its existence, Ukraine now has a choice between NATO membership or manufacturing nuclear weapons. NATO and most governments know well that Ukraine not only has extensive civil nuclear facilities and supplies, but it also has considerable expertise in nuclear weapons manufacturing. Ukraine’s Nuclear History and Capability At the time of Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, estimated at 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A senior Ukrainian official quoted by Bild was reported to have said earlier this year that: 'We have the material; we have the knowledge. If there is an order, we will only need a few weeks to produce the first bomb.' As Russian forces continue advancing on the battlefield, reports from the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, Ukraine has the capability to assemble a nuclear weapon within months. The report highlights that Ukraine could rapidly create a bomb using plutonium derived from spent fuel rods. With about seven tons of reactor plutonium available, experts claim the material is sufficient to produce hundreds of warheads with tactical yields. President Zelensky possibly has made these calculative statements as he well knows Firstly that US led NATO is not inclined to induct Ukraine as a NATO member and Secondly Russian President Putin keeps threatening to escalate this war into a nuclear strike if the US sanctions firing of the long-range US made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles into Russia. Ukraine may already have in its possession some kind of a nuclear bomb or even procured one discreetly or clandestinely going by President Zelensky’s statement. President Biden on his way out did sanction firing of the long-range US made ATACMS missiles into Russia. Ukraine firedUS made ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time on November 19. Will President Putin respond with a nuclear strike now lowering the thresh hold of a nuclear strike? Not likely! The strike in Bryansk marks an intensification of the conflict amid broader uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House who has repeatedly stated that he will end the war. So, all the stake holders of the Ukraine-Russia War are taking actions most suited to them before the just months before unpredictable President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office and heralds a potential majorshift in course. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that five out of the six missiles, fired at a target in the country’s Bryansk region, were shot down and that the sixth was damaged, dismissing the attack as largely ineffective. But Ukrainian officials said the strike caused a conflagration at a weapons depot in the city of Karachev, just over 70 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. If this be the Russian capability to destroy the ATACMS missiles then why should Russia react with a nuclear weapon head strike? Now the Russian Army must be planning to neutralize the ATACMS missile sites. US Vetoes UN Security Council Gaza Ceasefire The US on 20 Nov 2024 vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, drawing harsh criticism from most of the UN members. The draft was put forward by the council's 10 non-permanent members, demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The 15-member council voted 14-1 in favor of the resolution, and the US used its veto as a permanent council member to block it. North Korean Soldiers deployed in Kursk, Russia Tensions have heightened with reports that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been stationed in Kursk, Russia. If North Korean forces engage in combat, it would further escalate the situation. The open-source intelligence is limited about the strength of North Korean troops in support of the Russian forces. Initial reports were that there are Korean troops to operate their launcher systems for KN-23 missiles having a range of about 300km. Ukrainian sources claim that the Koreans are equipped with the weapons required for front line combat. Wonder the Korean troops have been sent for direct combat with the Ukrainian forces with the potential for escalation. Zelensky Warns NATO Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17 has indirectly warned NATO that his country may pursue nuclear weapons if it is not granted NATO membership. A press conference was also held alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who refrained from making any statement. However, later that day, Zelensky said that Ukraine has no intention to pursue nuclear weapons. Ukraine’s foreign ministry also confirmed the country’s commitment to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Zelensky’s rhetoric or Putin’s credible threat or desperate bluffs have finally had the effect on the West post Ukraine fired six long-range US ATACMS missiles at targets inside Russia and President Putin lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons: NATO countries are asking their citizens to be prepared for a war. Have started issuing pamphlets to their citizens, advising them on how to prepare for World War III. Denmark has already sent emails to its citizens to stock up on dry rations, water and medicines so that they could manage for three days of emergency, including a nuclear attack. Finland, too, updated its online brochure on 'preparing for incidents and crises' amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine war. The US and some other Western embassies (The Italian, Greek and Spanish) in Kyiv remained closed on November 20, having received a warning of a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital. 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of US long range missiles into Russia. The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' — Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024. And now the US vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Is it to put Trump and his team into a difficult position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East as during his campaign, Trump has vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if he regains the presidency. He previously has called President Zelensky 'the greatest salesman on Earth.' Zelensky’s rhetorics or Putin’s credible threats or desperate Nuclear bluffs are not likely as Putin is also keen to end the war and expects Trump to mediate a negotiation between the two warring nations to fulfill his promise and also prove that he is a world leader. Russia’s war against Ukraine presently is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. How Team Trump plays their cards differently than Biden’s administration is to be seen in beginning 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYs8972QQGta	2024-11-21T09:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine War: UN Peace Forces As Part Of A Comprehensive Peace Dea...	By Jonathan Power To its credit the Soviet Union and its successor state, Russia, has long supported UN peacekeeping, a practice that originated in 1960 in the time of UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, who evolved the concept during the great Congolese civil war when it was in danger of becoming a Cold War flashpoint. But what Russia has never contemplated is UN troops in its own backyard. 'Summoning the UN deep into Russia’s historical space is a serious step', Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, told The Economist. There does seem to be a shift in Moscow’s thinking on this highly sensitive issue. In 2017 President Vladimir Putin put forward a plan for the deployment of UN troops in south-eastern Ukraine. Not that he imagined their use along the Russian/Ukrainian border—that would be too much—but he wanted them to divide the fighting forces inside Ukraine. An objection is that this would formalise the internal division in Ukraine. But even so it was a bold move as it would mean UN soldiers getting in the way of the secessionist, Russian-orientated, militia in south-eastern Ukraine. They wouldn’t be able to expand the territory they already control without overrunning UN troops. The idea of a UN peacekeeping operation in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, was first discussed over a decade and a half ago by a small group of independent Russian and American experts on the Finnish island of Boisto. Their proposals were rejected by both the Ukrainian government and Moscow. Moreover, the cease-fire negotiated at Minsk by Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine in February 2015 was regularly violated and some of the heavy weapons that were pulled back from the demarcation line returned. The Minsk 11 agreement also lost its initial momentum. Moscow justifiably blames Kiev for not implementing the agreement. Critical promises were not followed through, such as changing the country’s constitution, passing a law to establish the special status of the Donetsk and Lugansk enclaves in Donbas, underlining their Russian-language rights, holding elections and declaring an amnesty. A divided government led by Petro Poroshenko, partly under the influence of right-wing movements whose pedigree stretches back to Nazi times, was incapable of moving on these vital issues. Putin still seems to think he can go on hoodwinking the world about Russia’s early role. He maintains that the 'soldiers are men following the call of their hearts to fulfil their duty or are voluntarily taking part in hostilities, including in south-east Ukraine'. Russia appeared to believe that without these local militias the Poroshenko government would have just walked in. Both in Washington and Moscow some macho policy makers and in particular Putin himself, have talked about the necessity of preparations for a limited nuclear war (although, in all probability, there never could be a limited one—recall the joint Ronald Reagan/Mikhail Gorbachev statement that a nuclear war 'could never be won and must never be fought'. This is why some of us think Putin’s talk of a UN role is a big step forward. Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the influential Global Affairs, and who has the ear of the Russian Foreign Ministry, argues that Putin should expand his UN ideas. According to Alexei Arbatov, head of Russia’s Centre for International Security, a UN force must be strong enough to ensure a 100% cease-fire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. The mission would look less like the failure in Kosovo in 1999 and more like the success in Cyprus that began in 1974, separating the Greek-speaking half of the island from the Turkish-speaking. UN forces have been deployed along the dividing line for over 50 years and are still there. They have held back what many Greeks have long believed is the danger of a renewed threat of ethnic cleansing of the kind that the Turks tried to carry out in 1974. At first the UN troops had to fight their way in. In the Ukraine case, peace between the two sides in Donbas would not be just a dividing line between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, it would probably in time bring peace on the Russian-Ukraine border. Putin’s now old idea must be explored. With Ukraine’s army losing out is a good time to explore it as part of an all-encompassing peace deal. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnUVSH0qoyici	2024-11-21T09:15:09-08:00	
A Mahdi, Messiahs, And Wonderful Non-Jewish Leaders – OpEd	Muslims say: 'There is no god but Allah' and people should worship only him, rejecting idolatry and polytheism. Jews agree. Muslims believe Allah created the world in six days and so do Jews and Christians. Allah sent thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, who brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can also agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah, notably the Pages of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that these messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scriptures before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Unlike the biblical Yahweh (often misread as Jehovah), Allah has no personal name, and his traditional 99 names are really epithets. Muslims claim to totally reject anthropomorphic descriptions of Allah, yet the Qur'an sometimes describes Allah as speaking, sitting on a throne, and having a face, eyes and hands. Allah is also the Master of the Day of Judgment, when the good, especially believers, will be sent to their heavenly reward, and the wicked, especially unbelievers, will be dispatched to hellfire. Jews and Christians also have traditions about end of days judgments, Armageddon, Gog —Magog and redemptive Messiahs. Judaism and, Christianity and Islam all teach their followers to take care of the earth. They also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardship and khalifah) for the planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. Recent Jewish and Christian history enables us to understand in a new way Isaiah's famous passage (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) about God's servant whose tragic suffering can be redemptive to those who once reviled and belittled him. In Jewish thought the Prophet Isaiah himself provides the strongest evidence for the claim that God's servant is Israel, the Jewish People. Four verses in prior chapters of Isaiah specifically state that Israel/Jacob is God's servant. 'You Israel are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen' (41:8), 'Hear me now, Jacob my servant; hear me, Israel my chosen' (44:1), 'Have no fear, Jacob my servant: Jeshurun whom I have chosen' (44:2), 'Remember all this, Jacob, remember Israel, for you are my servant' (44:21). These verses make it clear that Israel/Jacob is God's chosen servant. The national community is spoken of in terms of an individual, as is often the case in the Bible (see Jeremiah 30:10). However, many rabbis did identify Isaiah's messianic figure as a person, usually as a Messiah, a descendant of David, from the tribe of Judah. Other Rabbis had other interpretations. Rabbi Sa'adyah Ga'on glosses the figure as referring to the Prophet Jeremiah. Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel rejects that and thinks the suffering servant is Josiah, King of Israel. I think this individual is a messianic figure called by the rabbis: Messiah, son of Joseph, i.e. from one of the northern tribes, who precedes David's son, and is killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. If we keep in mind both the Josephson messiah as well as the role of Israel/Jacob as God's chosen servant, we will better understand Isaiah's suffering servant prophecy. The belief that there would be two different messiahs, one a moral political leader from the house of David (Davidson) and the other, a religious reformer from the house of Aaron (Aronson), as well as a special 'end of days' prophet such as Elijah or Jeremiah (Matthew 16:14) is found in inter- testament literature. A Dead Sea scroll states that the Qumran community must continue to live according to the original discipline 'until there shall come a prophet (Elijah) and the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel' (Manual of Discipline 9:11). There is also a rabbinic belief in a messianic figure from the northern tribes called a Josephson messiah who is killed by Israel's enemies. This idea may be modeled on the example of Saul who reigned before David and was killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. Thus there could be as many as four individual messianic figures as well as the people of Israel who act as God's agents in bringing about the Messianic Age. Gentile rulers also play a role, first as destructive oppressors of the Jewish people, and second when their successors later acknowledge their error and are ultimately included in helping bring about the Messianic Age's worldwide blessings. The Persian King Cyrus was such a messiah (Isaiah 45:1) All of this makes for a complicated future scenario that might take generations, or even centuries to develop. When people are persecuted, afflicted and oppressed as a community, and despised and rejected as individuals, they need hope for a much quicker and simpler process of redemption. This is why there is an overwhelming focus on the final stage Davidson messiah by most teachers, preachers, commentators and expositors. This is also the reason that those who believe in the imminent coming of the Davidson messiah always think it will occur soon within their lifetime (John 14:19, 21:22). Islam adds to all these Messiahs the figure of a Mahdi (Arabic: ٱلْمَهْدِيّ al-Mahdī). A messianic figure in Islamic eschatology who will appear at the end of times to rid the world of evil and injustice. Said to be a descendant of Muhammad, and thus a descendant of Prophet Abraham, he will appear shortly before Prophet ʿĪsā (Jesus) and defeat the evil forces of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear metaphorically in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, nations, catastrophes of nature; and in our own days as racist nationalist states and political movements. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazi racists, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (Qur'an 18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, Nazi racists, and the Communists, as well as widespread human pollution of Mother Earth, that near the time of the end of days will penetrate every part of the world like the persistently high levels of ozone pollution in Asia that are costing China, Japan and South Korea an estimated $63 billion annually in lost rice, wheat and maize crops. The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (Qur'an 21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 1/2 centuries later as the State of Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for many generations. Though the Mahdi is not mentioned in the Quran, and is absent from the two most-revered Sunni hadith collections: Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim – he is mentioned in other Hadith literature; and Islamic end-time images of pre Judgement Days natural catastrophes are similar to Christian and Jewish imagery of nature's potential disruptiveness (plagues, famine, draught, earthquakes etc.). Also, since humans have free will, the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we do. Repentance produces changes in the future of both individuals and nations. Repentance enables some individuals and communities to escape the consequences of prior evil. On the other hand, God's promise is that evil powers will never succeed in destroying Israel or in overcoming worldwide justice in the long run. Thus even without full repentance, God will act if the Divine promise of a Messianic Age is threatened. As Isaiah states a few verses prior to the suffering servant passage, 'The Lord says: you were sold but no price was paid, and without payment you shall be redeemed.' (52:3) i.e. all your suffering in exile was not merited and your redemption from exile will not be fully earned. Both are part of God's outline for human destiny and will occur sooner (through repentance) or later (in God's own time). Finally, if one believes that God inspired prophets are able to describe scenarios of various developments in the distant future then one has to accept that the understanding of these passages should change and improve as we come closer and closer to the times they describe. As an example, Jeremiah describes a radical future in which women surround men, 'The Lord will create a new thing on earth-a woman will surround a man' (31:22). The great commentator Rashi understands 'surround' to mean encircle. The most radical thing Rashi can think of (and in 11th century France it was radical) is that women will propose marriage (a wedding ring, or encircling the groom at the wedding ceremony) to men. In today's feminist generation we can see women surrounding men in many fields once almost exclusively male such as law, medical and theological schools. This means that a few generations from now we might have even better understandings of some predictive passages in the prophets, so humility should always be with us. Now let us try to understand the suffering servant passage in light of 20th century Jewish history. Isaiah proclaims the good news of peace and salvation (52:7) when God returns to Zion (8) and comforts his people (9) so all the Gentiles see his salvation (10). The Jewish people will depart the exile not in flight but under God's protection (11&12). Israel/Jacob, God's servant, whose appearance (14) was disfigured, marred and appalling (during the holocaust) will prosper (13) and be lifted up (in subsequent generations). A marvel for many nations, whose rulers will shut their (anti-Semitic) mouths because of this, since they will see what they had not been taught and will understand what they never heard of (15). For centuries the Church taught that the Jews were being punished for rejecting Christ and couldn't be redeemed without believing Jesus was the Son of God. Now some Gentile rulers see that this teaching is not really correct doctrine. The biblical message of God's commitment to redeem Israel without explicitly believing in Jesus wasn't believed (53:1) but now there is a growing minority who affirm a two covenant theology. Many Gentile rulers (kings, governments, business and religious leaders) now admit what their anti-Semitism did to the people of Israel. The Jews were like a tender shoot in dry ground, unattractive and undesirable, despised and rejected, sorrowful and familiar (intimate) with suffering (52:2&3). We (the Gentile rulers) scapegoated them and they carried our projected infirmities, but we rationalized that the Jews were stricken and afflicted by God, not by us. Israel was pierced and crushed due to our transgressions (anti-Semitism) for we sought our peace by blaming Jews for all kinds of evils (54:4&5). This anti-Semitism led to: Crusaders slaughtering Jews in France and Germany, blaming Jews for the Bubonic Plague in central Europe, torture by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, many expulsions and pogroms at various times throughout Europe, and the deaths of tens of thousands of Jewish civilians massacred during wars in Poland (1648-9) and the Ukraine (1919-21). All this set the stage for the worst martyrdom of all, the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust (plus five million non-Jews). Each evil regime turned its own kind of iniquity (religious, political, economic and social) on its Jews (54:6). Again and again Jews were passively taken away to exile, or like sheep to the slaughter cut off from the land of the living, though they had done no violence (54:7-9). Yet faithful Jews accepted all this as God's will and refused to abandon their religion or their people. Survivors of the concentration camps, who had lost their entire family, had the courage and faith to marry, and lived to see their offspring (Jewish children and grandchildren) grow up (54:10). Many, whose days were prolonged (54:10) and are now in their 70's and 80's, have lived long enough to see the most amazing outcomes of the Holocaust. The return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the rebuilding of its cities and countryside are the subject of many passages in Isaiah both preceding chapter 53 and following it. The realization of these prophecies did not require a Holocaust. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the mass departure of more than one million Soviet Jews to the land of Israel also are not directly linked to the Holocaust.But the redemptive aspect of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust for Gentile rulers and nations is emphasized in this suffering servant passage. Of course, the Turkish government still denies responsibility for the death of over one million Armenians; the Japanese deny slaughtering 300,000 residents of Nanking during WW2, and only a few French leaders admit to the complicity of the Vichy government in rounding up Jews for the Nazi death camps. Even the UN has not officially admitted its dereliction of duty in the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda. Yet the few steps of public confession and atonement that have been taken by some political and religious leaders are truly remarkable when you consider that nothing like this has ever happened in previous human history. If the Holocaust stimulated a willingness of religious and political leaders to accept responsibility for past examples of persecution and iniquity done by their institutions and governments continues to expand, society will improve greatly. If other governments and institutions admit responsibility for the sins of their predecessors it reduces the likelihood of repetition. Then the numbering of God's innocent servant- Israel/Jacob with transgressors will, when the lessons are finally learned, justify not just those directly involved in the atonement process but also many others. Israel's pouring out of life (six million deaths) will not have been in vain, and the revivified Jewish people will see the light of life and be satisfied (54:11-12). The ability of Christians and Jews to understand that both religions' interpretation of Isaiah's Suffering Servant has helped bring us closer to an age of increased human rights will lead to a greater demand for universal peace and security. (Isaiah 2:1-4 and Micah 4:1-8) Christians have always stressed the individual aspects of personal self sacrifice for salvation. By adding national and organizational aspects, Christians can help elevate the moral level of political and organizational behavior. When current political and religious leaders feel the need to publicly acknowledge the sins of their predecessors, itt helps to reduce the level of self righteousness that usually accompanies the corruption of political and religious power. It also warns religious people and their leaders that in the words of Pascal, 'Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.' Jews can now begin to understand how the role of Jesus as the Josephson Messiah, and the example of the passion of Jesus, has motivated many political and religious leaders in our generation to apologize for evils they personally did not do, in order to set the record right. The Davidson messiah will come after all nations, religions and political parties learn to respect and value as a gift from God, each other's right to differ in large as well as small issues. (Micah 4:5) Since this religious reform requires great leadership from all the major religions, each religion will have to produce its own Aronson religious reformer Messianic Mahdi figure. These many messianic mahdi religious reformers are referred to by Prophet Jeremiah positively as 'shepherds' (3:14-18) and their teachings will provide each religion with a reformed and renewed covenant (31:31-34). The advocacy of religious pluralism by the major religious communities will then produce the bases for the ultimate messianic predictions of worldwide peace, justice, prosperity, and salvation that the prophets proclaimed so often. The Davidson Messiah will come last to crown our faith in God's inspiration and deliverance. Until then let us remember that the Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnTu5aiHOBFZ0	2024-11-21T09:10:56-08:00	
Maryam Rajavi’s Conference At European Parliament And The Shamefu...	On Wednesday, November 20, 2024, a major parliamentary conference titled 'A New Policy on Iran: Centred on the People and Resistance' was held at the European Union headquarters in Brussels. The conference featured Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), alongside several Members of the European Parliament. Yet, shockingly, none of the Persian-language media outlets affiliated with European governments covered the event. This omission is not just regrettable and shameful, but catastrophic, as it serves the interests of the Iranian regime by censoring, suppressing, and distorting the Iranian Resistance Movement. In her address, Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that 'Democratic change in Iran is an achievable goal.' She continued, 'Today, I have come to the home of European democracy to declare that the regime’s terrorism and warmongering can be brought to an end. The overthrow and democratic transformation of this regime by the people and resistance of Iran is achievable and within reach.' Mrs. Rajavi then outlined the key components needed to achieve this goal: 1. The People and the Resistance: The Iranian people are deeply discontented, with widespread anger and frustration. This movement is supported by rebellious units (components of the National Liberation Army of Iran) that challenge the regime’s oppressive grip. Women, leading this movement, are at the forefront of Iran's fight for freedom and change. Video clips showcasing 20,000 acts of resistance across Iran were presented at the NCRI’s annual gathering in July 2023. 2. The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK): This organization, with its thousands of experienced cadres, has fought for 60 years against both the Shah’s dictatorship and the current mullahs’ regime. It has sacrificed thousands of martyrs and is considered the regime’s primary adversary. 3. A Democratic Alternative: The NCRI, founded 43 years ago by Massoud Rajavi, consists of 457 members representing diverse political ideologies, making it the longest-standing political coalition in Iranian history. It advocates for freedoms, women’s rights, national autonomy, equality between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the separation of religion from state, the abolition of the death penalty, a non-nuclear Iran, and peace in the Middle East. In 2002, the NCRI exposed the regime’s secret nuclear facilities, at great cost to itself. 4. Widespread Support and Endurance: The Iranian Resistance has organized the largest gatherings of Iranians abroad, demonstrating the broad support base within Iran. Families of 100,000 martyrs and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners over the last 45 years stand behind this movement. A network of Iranian professionals, organized into 320 associations worldwide, plays a crucial role in rebuilding Iran’s future. This resistance operates independently, relying on self-sufficiency for its funding. Its members cover the costs for daily operations, communications, publications, gatherings, and a 24-hour satellite TV channel that broadcasts to Iran. 5. International Support for the NCRI’s 10-Point Plan: The NCRI’s 10-point plan for a free Iran has received widespread endorsement, including statements from 34 parliamentary majorities across Europe and the U.S., as well as some Arab countries. Furthermore, 137 former world leaders and 80 Nobel laureates have supported this initiative, underscoring their belief in establishing a democratic republic in Iran, rejecting both religious and monarchical dictatorships. Censorship and the Right to Information in the European Union The right to the free flow of information is a cornerstone of democracy and human rights in the European Union. This right ensures that citizens and residents have access to information held by governments and public bodies. Articles 10 and 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantee freedom of expression, protecting the right to receive and disseminate information without government interference. However, this fundamental principle is being violated in the case of the Iranian Resistance Movement, particularly by European media and institutions. The EU’s appeasement policies toward the Iranian regime have contributed to the suppression and distortion of the Resistance Movement’s narrative. This censorship is part of a long-standing pattern: The deportation and exile of NCRI supporters to Gabon in the 1980s. Blacklisting the Resistance Movement in the 1990s to appease Iran’s then-President Khatami. The June 17, 2003, raid on the NCRI’s headquarters in France under President Chirac. Illegal obstruction of MEK demonstrations in Berlin and Paris. Illegal Obstruction of MEK Demonstrations in Berlin and France In 2005, the German government obstructed a demonstration by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) in Berlin. However, the court ruled this action illegal, allowing the MEK to hold the demonstration. This event highlighted repeated efforts to restrict the group’s political activities in Europe and the MEK’s legal efforts to challenge these restrictions. Similarly, in 2023, the French government attempted to block a MEK demonstration in Paris at the request of the Iranian regime. However, a court ruled the French government’s actions illegal, permitting the protest to take place. Censorship, by nature, involves restricting or controlling information and suppressing dissenting political views. Typically enforced by authoritarian regimes, its consequences include the erosion of free speech, the stifling of creativity and innovation, diminished public awareness, historical distortion, and the promotion of extremism. While it is not surprising for authoritarian regimes to impose such policies, it is deeply troubling when European-affiliated media adopt these tactics against a legitimate resistance movement. This complicity effectively serves the interests of Iran’s tyrannical and terrorist regime, which fuels extremism, terrorism, and instability in the region and beyond. Iran’s Regime and Terrorism: The 2018 Bombing Plot A prominent example of the Iranian regime’s involvement in terrorism occurred in 2018 when an attempt to bomb a major MEK rally in Paris was thwarted. The plot, orchestrated by the Iranian regime, saw one of its diplomats, Assadollah Assadi, arrested. Assadi, a diplomat stationed at Iran’s embassy in Austria, was convicted of terrorism charges in Belgium. Despite his conviction, he was controversially exchanged by the Belgian government and sent back to Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnT9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-21T09:08:49-08:00	
Prince Igor At The Ankara Opera: The Power Of Art – OpEd	Last night, we had the pleasure of watching Alexander Borodin's timeless masterpiece, Prince Igor, at the Ankara Opera. The production captivated the audience, showcasing not only Borodin's years of dedication but also the stellar performance on stage. The History Behind the Masterpiece Borodin worked on Prince Igor for nearly twenty years but passed away in 1887 before completing it. After his death, his close friends Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov gathered the drafts from Borodin's home and finished the opera. The work premiered in 1890 at the renowned Mariinsky Opera in St. Petersburg. Inspired by The Lay of Igor's Campaign, a significant epic in Russian literature, the opera tells the story of 12th-century Prince Igor Svyatoslavich and his campaign against the Cuman (Polovtsian) tribes. The Performance in Ankara In Ankara, the opera was performed in its original Russian language. The choir and soloists delivered outstanding performances that earned high praise from the audience. Conductor Sunay Muratov expertly led the orchestra, ensuring a flawless musical execution. The Russian origins of director Ilya Ilin added an authentic touch to the staging, enriching the overall experience. The cast featured Çetin Kıranbay as Prince Igor, Burcu Uyar as Yaroslavna, Ayhan Üştük as Vladimir Igorevich, Erdem Baydar as Prens Galçtski, and Can Kocaay as Konçak Han. Each performer brought depth and nuance to their characters, leaving a lasting impression. Polovtsian Dances: The Highlight of the Evening The most striking moment of the opera came during the final scene with the Polovtsian Dances. This mesmerizing blend of opera and ballet showcased an exceptional harmony of music and visuals, taking the audience on a historical journey. The performance was nothing short of breathtaking. A Recommendation for Art Enthusiasts For those who wish to experience the unparalleled magic of art and music, Prince Igor is an absolute must-see. The Ankara Opera artists have brought this masterpiece to life with extraordinary skill, providing an unforgettable evening. A true gem for classical music and opera lovers alike.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-djmfSxqyDz7	2024-11-21T09:06:48-08:00	
Moroccan Media And The Final Phase Of The Sahara Issue: A Call Fo...	As Morocco moves closer to achieving the full international recognition of its territorial integrity, the role of the media in shaping perceptions and bolstering national advocacy is entering a decisive phase. This is no longer about reaffirming sovereignty; it is about strategically consolidating Morocco's historical and legitimate rights on the global stage. For Moroccan journalists, this means rethinking the fundamentals of their approach to the Sahara issue, anticipating new dynamics, and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. This imperative was at the heart of a recent conference organized by the Alliance of Istiqlali Journalists under the theme, 'Moroccan Media and the Cause of the Kingdom's Territorial Integrity: Crossed Perspectives.' The event, held on November 19, featured Professor Hassan Abdelkhalek—a veteran journalist, former editor-in-chief of Al Alam, and Morocco's ambassador to Algeria from 2016 to 2021. His unique expertise, spanning both media and diplomacy, provided critical insights into the evolving landscape of this decades-long dispute. One of the conference's main conclusions was clear: Moroccan media must not only sustain its mobilization for the Sahara but also refine its tools, narratives, and strategies. The current phase is one of pre-resolution—a delicate juncture where misinformation and propaganda continue to distort the realities of the conflict. It is essential for journalists to adapt, using innovative methods and persuasive arguments to counter outdated narratives driven by Algeria's hegemonic ambitions and the Polisario's misinformation campaigns. A particularly pressing issue raised during the event was the need to anticipate the eventual reintegration of thousands of Moroccans held or displaced in the Tindouf camps. These individuals have been subjected to decades of ideological manipulation and propaganda aimed at severing their ties to Morocco. Rehabilitating them will require not only social and logistical efforts but also a robust media strategy to dismantle the falsehoods ingrained over generations. Moroccan media must be ready to support this process, offering narratives of hope, inclusion, and unity that pave the way for their full reintegration into Moroccan society. The international dimension of this advocacy is equally critical. Morocco's position has gained unprecedented momentum in recent years, underscored by the recognition of its sovereignty over the Sahara by key global players. However, maintaining and expanding this support requires sustained media engagement. Moroccan journalists must project a credible and compelling narrative, emphasizing the legitimacy of Morocco's claims and exposing the artificial nature of the conflict, which has been perpetuated by Algeria's geopolitical ambitions. This moment is a turning point. The Moroccan Sahara is no longer just a territorial dispute; it is a national cause that encompasses identity, history, and the future of regional stability. The media's role must extend beyond advocacy to become a force for reconciliation and cohesion in a post-resolution era. By amplifying Morocco's achievements, countering hostile narratives, and preparing for the reintegration of all its citizens, the media can play a transformative role in shaping this new chapter. The Moroccan press stands at a historic crossroads. Success will depend on its ability to adapt to the demands of this decisive phase, balancing professionalism with patriotic duty. The stakes are immense, but so are the opportunities to reaffirm Morocco's rightful place as a model of unity and legitimacy in the face of decades of manufactured conflict. The time for strategic, forward-thinking media advocacy is now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-bNAD49RXSM8	2024-11-21T09:03:20-08:00	
Strengthening Pakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Efforts With Global Su...	The recent terrorist attack in Quetta, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people, has drawn widespread condemnation and support from the international community. From China to Russia, and from the UN to regional neighbors like Iran and Sri Lanka, global leaders have voiced their solidarity with Pakistan in its counter-terrorism efforts. However, beyond expressions of sympathy, there lies a pressing need for tangible support, enhanced collaboration, and coordinated counter-terrorism strategies to bolster Pakistan's efforts. China-Pakistan Collaboration: More Than Just Condemnation China’s response, led by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, reflects an enduring alliance marked by shared interests and significant economic investments, such as CPEC. The injury of two Chinese nationals in Karachi highlights the threat that terrorism poses not only to Pakistanis but also to foreign partners. China’s vocal support for Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operations is essential, but it must be matched with sustained bilateral counter-terrorism initiatives, including security training, intelligence-sharing, and joint task forces to protect CPEC investments and Chinese citizens. Russia’s Firm Stance and Its Implications for Pakistan Russia, under President Putin’s leadership, has consistently voiced its commitment to assist Pakistan in combating terrorism. Putin’s condemnation of the Quetta attack and his call for justice are welcome affirmations of Russia’s support. Pakistan and Russia have a mutual understanding when it comes to countering terrorism; both nations have encountered extremist threats that have shaped their security policies. Moving forward, Pakistan should explore deeper military collaboration with Russia, including joint anti-terrorism drills, intelligence-sharing, and even arms deals aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities. UN and Global Institutions: From Words to Action UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and called for accountability. While these statements are critical for maintaining international awareness, the United Nations and its associated agencies have an opportunity to play a more direct role in Pakistan’s fight against terrorism. Programs that provide counter-terrorism training, funding for security enhancements, and expertise on deradicalization can make a lasting impact. The UN’s endorsement of anti-terrorism efforts in Pakistan also strengthens the case for international donors to invest in Pakistan’s security sector, which remains vital for ensuring sustained stability. Regional Solidarity: Iran, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia The tragedy has drawn powerful responses from regional players, including Iran and Sri Lanka, both of whom are no strangers to terrorism. Iran, whose spokesperson underscored the need to uphold human rights and reject terrorism in all forms, shares a long border with Pakistan, making coordinated border security essential. Sri Lanka, reflecting on its own history of combating separatist terrorism, has also extended support, reiterating the shared regional interest in stability. By leveraging such solidarity, Pakistan can build regional coalitions to tackle cross-border terrorist networks and enhance border security. A Call for Multilateral Action Against Terrorism The responses to Pakistan’s tragedy showcase a rare alignment of global voices against terrorism, but they should serve as more than symbolic gestures. This is an opportunity for the international community to establish or strengthen multilateral frameworks that address terrorism with a particular focus on South Asia. Forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) can play a pivotal role in supporting Pakistan’s efforts, creating shared strategies for intelligence, surveillance, and securing borders. Global action, beyond just statements, will be instrumental in sustaining Pakistan’s efforts to prevent future tragedies. Pakistan’s own determination to root out terrorism within its borders is evident, but it cannot achieve this goal without the continued backing of its international allies. Not only do such partnerships alleviate some of the strain on Pakistan’s resources, but they also reinforce its stance on countering extremism, helping isolate those elements that threaten both regional and global peace. Pakistan has the potential to be a strong pillar in the fight against terrorism, provided it is equipped with the resources and alliances necessary to overcome the challenges it faces. Conclusion: Building a Future Without Terrorism The Quetta tragedy is a reminder of the stakes involved in the fight against terrorism. Pakistan’s resilience, supported by the international community’s tangible assistance, can foster a more secure future for its citizens and allies. As countries rally behind Pakistan, this tragic event serves as a catalyst for deeper cooperation and mutual resolve to eliminate terrorism from the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fwEODyNaIi_	2024-11-21T09:00:54-08:00	
India: Cherishing Classical Status To Asomiya Language – OpEd	A function to commemorate the completion of 53 years by the Directorate of Cultural Affairs (under Assam government in northeast India) turned a serious and fruitful event to cherish the recognition to Asomiya (Assamese) as a classical language and also highlight the future course of actions for the government, concerned organisations, literary personalities and common people using the language both in written and colloquial forms in day-to-day conversations. The courtyard of iconic Rabindra Bhawan in Guwahati was decorated elegantly for the occasion with a colourful podium under Bokul (Spanish Cherry) plants. As evening Sun set to disappear on the mighty river Brahmaputra touching the horizon, the intriguing program commenced with the participation of three outstanding resource persons in front of a decent gathering. The panellists were unanimous in advocating for a comprehensive dictionary with standardised spellings to each and every word. They also emphasized on an internet-savvy apparatus to cross-check the mistakes instantly so that more and more correct words can be pumped into the digital space. Various jargons reflecting the useful modern technology needs to be incorporated possibly with authentic Assamese words and a careful monitoring of the language in the public domain emerge as the need of the hour. Earning the classical recognition as nearly two million people use Asomiya for their primary mode of communication and informal understanding, the language possesses a brighter future, argued the participants amidst rounds of applause from the audience, assembled in the historic cultural premise of northeast India. Director Rahul Ch Das welcomed everyone to the discussion on সুৱদি সুৰীয়া অসমীয়া ভাষা আৰু ধ্ৰুপদী মৰ্যাদা (Delightful & melodious Assamese language and the classical recognition) highlighting the eventful journey of Asomiya for the achievement and also essential future plans for the language, where three resourceful speakers enriched the initiative with refreshing inputs. Dr Namita Devi from Barbhag College (under Gauhati University) narrated the voyage for the attainment, where litterateur, researcher and linguistic expert Dr Upen Rabha Hakacham from GU highlighted the historical inventiveness for assimilation to enhance the Assamese language & culture and Dr Arup Kumar Nath from Tezpur University spoke about the future trail for the language in the session, which was moderated by this writer. Elaborating her views, Namita Devi stated human society and civilisation are shaped through historical evolution that passes through a relentless process of synthesis and antithesis. Humans, as a species known as Homo sapiens, have developed language and culture through the assimilation process as people are migratory in nature and came into contact with different stock of people. The word culture indicates ideas, customs and social behaviours of a particular community and its traits and features reflect a specific character and identity. Same process follows for a language too, added the young and ingenious lady. Assamese language and culture are rooted in ancient Assam from the days of Pragjyotish-Kamrup-Kamata-Koch, where the language was formed by a group of people even though they were divided anthropologically and linguistically. Till today, each group maintains distinctive linguistic and cultural features. Linguistically, Assamese is a composite form of all tribes and stock of people living together and expressing their collective culture through it. Thus, the recognition of Assamese as a classical language has cleared the roots and identity of the culture with a strong foothold. It's time for the new generation to come forward with an effort to preserve, nourish and expand the language and cumulative culture of Assam, she stressed. Dr Nath also threw light on the glorious past of the easternmost Indo-Aryan language, which had its presence in rock different inscriptions, Charyapadas (ancient Buddhist tantric text), Ramayani & other mythology literature since the 4th century. Due to internal and external threats from various sources, Asomiya had to confront many challenges over time. With the classical status on its cap, the language (and its users) can now think of achieving many new heights in the days to come, commented the energetic scholar. He concluded with some valuable advices for the language-users including the need for advanced technological tools (like text to speech and vice versa, advanced machine learning, pdf to word conversion, etc), a solid unicode support, adequate technical terminology in Assamese and so on for the survival and flourishing of the language. Mentionable is that the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 3 October 2024 approved conferring the classical language status to Asomiya along with Marathi, Pali, Prakrit and Bengali/Bangla citing it to serve as a custodian of Bharat's profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community's historical and cultural milestone. Primarily rooted in Sanskrit (even though maintaining some distinct features) Asomiya thus got an entry to the prestigious group of languages comprising Tamil (notified in 2004), Sanskrit (2005), Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013) and Odia (2014). The specific initiative to celebrate the recognition was also augmented by the gracious presence of distinguished personalities like actor Malaya Goswami, singer Manisha Hazarika, author Satyashree Das, former cultural affairs directors including Swapnanil Barua, Barnali Sarma, Bishnu Kamal Borah with a number of students from Luit Konwar Rudra Barua State Music College and many others.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-21T08:59:27-08:00	
Pakistan’s Palestine Conundrum – OpEd	The ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues to evoke profound concern across the world, compelling nations to reassess their responsibilities in upholding justice, human rights, and international law. In this dire context, Pakistan has emerged as a steadfast ally of the Palestinian people, vehemently advocating for their right to self-determination and an end to Israel's illegal occupation. France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot recently highlighted a 'window of opportunity' for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a sentiment Pakistan wholeheartedly echoes. Islamabad sees this as a vital chance to halt violence, protect lives, and foster an environment conducive to dialogue and lasting peace. However, achieving this requires decisive global action, coupled with unwavering support for the Palestinian people. Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause stems from its deeply rooted principles of justice, equality, and respect for sovereignty. Since the inception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Pakistan has consistently condemned the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and the systemic oppression of its people. Successive Pakistani governments have reinforced this stance in international forums, underscoring the importance of a just resolution to the crisis. Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar recently reiterated Pakistan’s solidarity with Palestine, highlighting that the fight for Palestinian sovereignty is not just a regional issue but a universal one tied to fundamental human rights. His government has worked to amplify Palestine’s voice in platforms like the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), emphasizing that justice delayed is justice denied. At the heart of Pakistan’s advocacy is a demand for accountability. Israel's actions, which have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, must not go unchecked. Pakistan urges the international community to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law and its persistent disregard for human rights. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached catastrophic proportions. Blockades have crippled access to essential goods, while relentless airstrikes have reduced infrastructure to rubble. Civilians, particularly women and children, are disproportionately affected, with schools, hospitals, and shelters bearing the brunt of the violence. Pakistan has called for immediate international intervention to address this crisis. A sustainable ceasefire is a pressing need, but it must be accompanied by substantial humanitarian aid. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted to ensure that food, water, medicine, and essential supplies reach those in dire need. The international community must also support the reconstruction of Gaza’s destroyed infrastructure and provide psychological aid to a traumatized population. France’s call for a ceasefire reflects a growing recognition among global leaders of the need to act urgently. However, such calls must be translated into tangible action. Words alone cannot mitigate the immense suffering of the Palestinian people. Pakistan emphasizes the need for sustained international pressure on Israel to halt its military operations and engage in meaningful negotiations. Furthermore, Pakistan calls upon influential organizations such as the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to lead efforts in securing a just resolution to the conflict. Global powers, particularly those with significant influence over Israel, must use their leverage to ensure compliance with international norms and a commitment to peace. As Pakistan joins the chorus of nations calling for immediate de-escalation, it also highlights the broader implications of this crisis. Stability in the Middle East is intrinsically linked to global peace and security. Left unaddressed, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue to fuel extremism, exacerbate humanitarian crises, and undermine efforts toward international stability. The spillover effects of the conflict, including rising tensions in Lebanon and the risk of broader regional instability, necessitate a unified and holistic approach. Pakistan has urged world leaders to recognize these broader ramifications and act decisively to prevent further escalation. Echoing Jean-Noel Barrot’s sentiments, Pakistan believes that the time for global solidarity is now. The world must unite to uphold the principles of justice, human rights, and dignity. Only through collective action can we pave the way for a peaceful and equitable future for the people of Palestine and the region as a whole. The situation in Gaza is not just a Palestinian tragedy but a global failure to protect basic human rights and uphold justice. Pakistan’s call for accountability, dialogue, and humanitarian intervention is a reminder that peace is possible but requires collective effort. The international community must rise to the occasion, bridging differences and taking bold steps to ensure that the Palestinian people can live in dignity, freedom, and security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-dhVaL_UTFh6	2024-11-21T08:58:03-08:00	
ASEAN’s Elusive Code Of Conduct For The South China Sea – Analysi...	By Jaime Naval ASEAN’s involvement in the South China Sea dispute began informally and incrementally. As Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, China and Taiwan firmed up their territorial claims, the dispute raised concerns from with and outside the region. From 1990 to 2002, Indonesia, with funding from Canada, hosted a series of Workshops on managing potential conflict in the South China Sea. Although dubbed a non-official activity to which the participants came in their ‘individual, private capacity’, the workshops, in the words of former ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino, had ‘an ASEAN aura’ to them. ASEAN cannot evade the issue as four of its members are involved in the dispute. The late 1980s witnessed China’s growing assertiveness. Sixty-four Vietnamese sailors died when they clashed with Chinese forces in the Spratly Islands in 1988. In February 1992, China passed its Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which claimed sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. In July 1992, in the face of heightened tension, ASEAN issued its Declaration on the South China Sea — underscoring the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the area. In March 1995, impelled by the discovery of Chinese structures surreptitiously constructed on Mischief Reef — which China argued were intended to provide refuge and support for fishermen operating in the region — ASEAN issued its Statement on Recent Developments in the South China Sea. It again stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the region through peaceful resolution of disputes and adherence to international law, particularly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Over time, it became apparent that China’s actions were part of a broader effort to assert territorial claims over the South China Sea, which eventually led to the construction of military facilities on the reef in the 2010s. In earlier ASEAN–China exchanges, the South China Sea was reputedly treated as an after-dinner topic. But over time, as the dialogues gained traction, it became a central item in open discussions. Guarded optimism swept the region in late 2002 when ASEAN and China signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. It was a watershed document that mediated the dissonant and dangerous dynamics of the claimant states. The declaration was a dramatic departure from the assertiveness of the South China Sea dispute’s protagonists. Despite lingering distrust, it brought to the fore the possibility of cooperation among the claimants and proved ASEAN’s ability to forge a unified position on a complex, region-wide issue of strategic importance. It also demonstrated how China can be persuaded to recalibrate its position. The declaration was expected to pave the way for a successor agreement — the code of conduct, which was meant to preclude further escalation of the dispute. But its long absence has emboldened claimants to carry out expansion, fortification, coercion and even environmental degradation in the area. The overlapping claims are in contest in the South China Sea against the backdrop of a geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. Even as ASEAN and China strive to find common ground to craft a code of conduct, it would be foolhardy to drive out the United States and other extra-regional stakeholders, because they have their own strategic stakes in the South China Sea. The asymmetrical distances that ASEAN members maintain with the major powers translate into variations in their respective positions towards the South China Sea dispute. Strong disagreements on how to respond to China’s actions following the Scarborough Shoal standoff prevented ASEAN from issuing a joint statement in its 2012 ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. Cambodia, then Chair of ASEAN and a close partner of China, sought to exclude the matter from the joint communique, drawing livid reactions from concerned ASEAN members. It is thus not surprising that ASEAN has not issued any official statement referring to the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Even as the Court invalidated China’s expansive nine-dash line claim, the prevailing circumstances deterred the group from coming out with a formal, unified position. After more than two decades, several impediments to the code of conduct remain. Defining the geographical scope of the code is both fundamental and contentious. China wants the scope limited to areas where it does not have complete control, while the Philippines and Vietnam, seek inclusion of all disputed maritime features. As China claims nearly 90 per cent of the South China Sea, it makes sense for the code of conduct to include overlaps. China also seeks a flexible, non-binding code, while ASEAN wants a code that is legally binding. Having clear rules and mechanisms encourages compliance and accountability. Without this, the code of conduct would likely become an impotent document. Prohibiting military activities in the South China Sea is salient to preventing untoward incidents and a central purpose of the code of conduct. Limiting installation of military infrastructure, weapons deployment and military exercises would be expected to reduce the possibility of violent engagements. For the Philippines and perhaps Vietnam, the involvement of external powers, such as the United States, translates into having a necessary counterweight to China. China insists on disallowing external parties to engage in security partnerships or exercises with regional states. ASEAN stresses that freedom of navigation and overflight be preserved in accordance with UNCLOS, which guarantees the right of passage for all states through international waters. China also vows adherence to these rules, but in practice it pushes back on freedom of navigation operations by rival outside powers. Despite their professed commitment to finalising a code of conduct — including their latest 2026 deadline — ASEAN’s and China’s efforts are moving at a slow pace. Renewed or intensified military activity in the South China Sea undermines every avowal to peaceful dispute settlement. China evidently benefits from the status quo as it indurates and stretches its military presence in the area. But ASEAN cannot afford to be oblivious as the disputed waters constantly and ominously change.

BBC’s Ability To Facilitate Debate In Vietnam Hindered By Media C...	By Thanh Giang Nguyen This Perspective argues that Vietnam’s domestic campaign of media control, launched in 2017 has exerted a negative impact on the BBC World Service’s ability to report and engage with the Vietnamese public on social media. The article consists of four parts: The contextual background for the BBC’s engagement with Vietnam in pursuit of its mission of impartiality from 2000 to 2019. The negative impact of media control in Vietnam affecting BBC’s ability to engage with the Vietnamese public on social media between 2017 and 2022. A data analysis of the participation at the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable on YouTube that highlights the decreasing number of interviewees from Vietnam in 161 political episodes between 2014 to 2022. A comparative study with VOA and the implications of restricted access to Vietnam for all Western broadcasters serving Vietnam. The key findings are built around the locations of the people who participated in 161 political episodes of BBC Vietnamese Roundtable discussions about Vietnamese politics, out of all 356 broadcasts that also included discussions about other topics (social issues, health, politics etc.) from 2014 to 2022.[1] The author collected this set of data to determine whether the participants were located in Vietnam or abroad, as the level of intervention by the Vietnamese state influences the ability of interviewees to participate in political discussions. Specifically, individuals in Vietnam may face police actions such as detention or internet restrictions, and this discourages them from joining the Roundtable on social media. The findings are examined against the backdrop of regulatory changes in Vietnam, in order to evaluate how restrictions implemented between 2017 and 2019 impacted the number of individuals in the country willing to engage with the BBC on politically sensitive topics.[2] A short comparative study of 10 similar roundtable discussions on the YouTube channel of VOA Vietnamese in the US from this year (2024) will be conducted to broaden the findings about Vietnamese censorship’s impingement beyond the BBC to include other Western broadcasters for Vietnam in the last few years.[3] THE BBC AND VIETNAM: A STORY OF INCONGRUENT ENGAGEMENT The history of the BBC World Service, founded in 1932 as an international broadcaster of the British Broadcasting Corporation, has been shaped 'by global events and the UK’s changing relationship with the wider world'.[4] Similarly, the BBC Vietnamese programme, established in 1952, was perceived in Hanoi during the Cold War as a voice from the other side of the Iron Curtain. During the Vietnam War (1954-1975) BBC Vietnamese was even seen as 'an enemy radio' (đài địch) by communist propaganda. Such a perception is still being propagated by the military and security forces in Vietnam today.[5] The post-war unified Vietnam imposed a decade-long ban on all BBC reporters and jammed the BBC’s radio on shortwave frequencies for Vietnam, only allowing BBC Vietnamese Service’s Editor Judy Stowe to visit Vietnam in 1984.[6] Compared to China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and even Myanmar, Vietnam’s relationship with the BBC made it an outlier in that the country did not allow the BBC to have a local office. This policy of limiting BBC’s access to Vietnam shows a lack of mutual understanding between the BBC and the Vietnamese government about the role of the media. In other words, the World Service’s mission to provide 'trusted, accurate, impartial and independent news'[7] was not compatible with Vietnam’s definition of media in the Press Law (2016) as a tool to 'propagandise and disseminate the policies of the Communist Party, policies and laws of the State'.[8] The Law requires all publishing outlets to obtain official permits for disseminating news content and authorises the government to screen works prior to publication and stop publication of any content deemed objectionable or harmful to national security.[9] The reforms initiated in the late 1980s brought a change to Vietnam’s media environment. Since 2000, a new media strategy not only opened the country to foreign media, including the BBC, but also envisaged international integration of Vietnam into the world by combining three strategic objectives of 'security, development and influence'. The government media, e.g. Voice of Vietnam (VOV) and Vietnam Television (VTV), began to reach out to the BBC to gain access to modern technology and educational materials while the web blocking of the BBC’s content which is to prevent news stories deemed 'objectionable' from entering Vietnam’s cyberspace, would continue in a two-prong approach, consisting of 'collaboration and the struggle' with foreign powers.[10]0 In 2012, BBC Media Action, a department of the World Service in charge of training and collaboration was able to launch a communications project in Vietnam to help VOV 'better communicate the climate change issue to the community'.[11]1 The opening-up also saw three BBC News correspondents (Owen Bennett-Jones, Claire Arthur and Bill Hayton) being granted a reporting visa between 2000 and 2007 and to be based in Hanoi. The London-based BBC Vietnamese journalists were also permitted to visit their home country for reporting. However, despite this opening-up, the Vietnamese government continued with its cautious stance towards foreign media. Both British and Vietnamese reporters who had access to Vietnamese news sources and enjoyed direct engagement with the Vietnamese public were closely monitored by the Foreign Ministry’s Press Department and interviews with Vietnamese people needed to be pre-approved.[12] Stepping out of line would immediately result in the permit being revoked, as in the case of Bill Hayton who had his reporting visa shortened in 2007 because of a report about Vietnamese dissidents.[13] Since 2011, BBC Vietnam closed the radio programme to continue the news service on a web site, and then began to expand also on social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube). However, BBC’s online presence both in English and Vietnamese, has been blocked from time to time, prompting the corporation to find ways to keep the engagement going not only with government officials but also with the wider public in Vietnam. THE ROUNDTABLE: AN IMPACT THROUGH ENGAGEMENT Intensive efforts by the Vietnamese government to block BBC’s online content in Vietnam in the mid-2010s led to several initiatives by BBC World Service, including collaboration with tech companies, to circumvent the Vietnamese firewall.[14] The most crucial decision was to launch a direct regular broadcast on social media for Vietnam in 2014, produced especially for YouTube live discussions on the online address alongside the normal online news service of bbcvietnamese.com web page which was blocked from time to time.[15] The aim was to maximise accessibility on social platforms to fulfil BBC’s mission to engage with the audience without interference. In the next 6 years (2014-2021), the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable, modelled on BBC HARDtalk, a news-focused, moderated debate on British television, brought together hundreds of opinion makers, politicians, academics, and civil society activists from Vietnam and around the world. The diversity of voices and the live comments from the audience made it a success, bringing 143.8 million views to the BBC and 31.9 million hours of watch time between 2014 and 2021, according to data from YouTube Studio, with the majority being from Vietnam.[16] On many occasions, people with opposing viewpoints have debated and argued about Vietnamese politics, a phenomenon unseen after decades of ideological conflict and division among the Vietnamese. For example, the discussion broadcast on 1 May 2020 between Dr Bui Quynh Hoa, the daughter of Colonel Bui Van Tung who commanded a Northern Vietnamese tank unit that crashed through the gates of the former Republic of South Vietnam’s presidential palace in Saigon on 30 April 1975, and professor Nguyen Manh Hung, a US-based scholar and senior official in the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War, about the need to accept the past for the sake of national reconciliation, received over 1.3m views on YouTube. Of note, a programme such as this by the BBC Vietnamese team was a brave attempt to tackle the longtime issue of the North-South divide, a topic severely censored in Vietnam because Hanoi still sees any symbol of the Republic of South Vietnam which surrendered in 1975 as a form of sedition, and still denies people who had ever served that regime access to state media in Vietnam.[17] The popularity of the Roundtable drew attention from the government, and a number of programmes in 2021 were denounced by the state media for 'distorting the truth about the country', and some of the moderators had to face cyber harassment.[18] But the fact that most participants were Vietnamese citizens, including many academics and government officials without any association to the former South Vietnamese regime, took away the usual argument of Vietnam’s state propaganda that critical voices were 'remnants of the hostile forces who refused to accept the defeat' in the Vietnam War which ended in 1975.[19] The success of the broadcast was made possible by a pluralism in political views, the immediacy of social media networks and its delivery in the neutral balanced language. Nevertheless, it soon became the subject of censorship. This was especially the case during the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam (2020-21) when wide campaigns were undertaken to curtail public discussions in cyberspace, according to rights groups.[20] INTENSIFYING OF CENSORSHIP AND THE END OF PUBLIC DEBATES A quantitative review of 165 guest speakers and the frequency they were participating in 161 political episodes (several people appeared repeatedly in many episodes) together with the information about their locations as announced at the beginning of each broadcast,[21] reveals the following: YearParticipation from VietnamOutside VietnamTotal Episodes2014401201547422820167023242017553324201858292920193014182020402323202127913Table 1 (source: BBC Vietnamese YouTube) While the year 2014 had only one episode in November as the first in the series of political discussions, it is notable that that particularepisode had all 4 participants from Vietnam. Episodes in 2016 had the largest number of participants from Vietnam, with 52.8% representation. The year 2019 was a turning point which saw a significant drop in participants from Vietnam down to 30, with 14 from overseas. This is the time when both the new Press Law (enacted in 2016 to take full effect from 2017), and the Cybersecurity Law (effective from 01 January 2019) began to impact the Vietnamese media landscape. In the following years, media control targeting dissidents worked in tandem with heightened cyberspace restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Throughout 2020 and 2021, the number of participants from Vietnam joining the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable decreased to an unsustainable level. In 2021, only 27 people from Vietnam, the lowest ever, and 9 from overseas (75% vs 25%) joined the 13 episodes of political discussions, with the last recording taking place in July of that year. In terms of audience attraction, a key metric for any media organisation in the world, the YouTube data gathered here (Figure 1) tells a story of decline. Since all recordings remain on YouTube, some of them still generate so-called ‘delayed watch time’ when people revisit a popular programme many months after it was aired. Hence, some of the visits and watch time in hours were recorded from 1 June 2008 well into 19 August 2024, but the YouTube Studio graphic here indicate that the peak of the Roundtable was between 2016 and 2020. The ending of political discussions on the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable in 2021 also meant that the regular inflow of audience to the BBC, built up over six years, stopped. In other words, millions of visits from Vietnam who spent 31.9 million hours to engage with the BBC on the free channel of YouTube ceased, a huge loss in terms of market share and direct audience engagement. Figure 1: Data set: YouTube Studio’s Analytics of BBC Vietnamese Roundtables The heightened intensity of YouTube broadcasts and participatory presence between 2014 and 2018 can be explained by the favourable media environment and a change in official attitude towards the BBC in Vietnam under the government of reform-oriented Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung (2006-2016). A chronological record of heightened BBC’s engagement with Vietnam’s leadership is presented as follows: 2007: Former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet gave an interview to BBC Vietnamese in Ho Chi Minh City and used the BBC platform to call for national unity and political reform.[22] 2008: Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung gave a televised interview to BBC World TV during his visit to London.[23] 2009: Former Deputy President Mrs Nguyen Thi Binh received a BBC Vietnamese reporter in Hanoi and gave a candid interview about the Vietnam War and national reconciliation.[24] 2012 and 2015: Vietnamese officials, including Vice-Minister of Defence Nguyen Chi Vinh gave interviews to BBC Vietnamese reporters in Vietnam and Singapore.[25] July 2019: A BBC Vietnamese reporter successfully conducted an interview with Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung, a member of the Politburo, in London rather than Vietnam. This event signifies the end of the BBC’s favourable period in Vietnam and highlights a remarkable shift in regulatory measures governing foreign media operations in the country.[26] It is noteworthy that the appreciation of the BBC by the government of Vietnam and the interaction with several leaders at that time helped remove the Cold War stigma of 'the BBC as a voice from the opposite side' and facilitated the participation of middle-ranking officials, academics and technocrats from the public sector, most of whom were members of the Communist Party, in the Roundtable. With the resignation of PM Nguyen Tan Dung at the 12th Congress of the CPV in early 2016, Vietnamese politics slowly turned back towards Leninism and state controls. The trend continued into 2021 when the Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong was re-elected to serve a third term, according to observers.[27] International observers noticed an emerging paradigm affecting many areas of social life and economic participation of foreign companies including a stricter visa regime for foreign workers (2020), cuts to the length of tourist visas in 2021, and the introduction of Decree 58 by the government (2022) to scrutinise foreign non-governmental organisations operating in Vietnam. In the field of media control, the new measures to stifle public discussion in Vietnam were developing in two stages with each of them affecting the BBC in unique ways: First, Decree 9, issued in February 2017 by the new government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc prohibited all civil servants and employees of government agencies from speaking to the media without prior authorisation, and forbade Vietnamese journalists from sharing news stories on social media.[28] The effect of the ban on speech in the public sector has been far-reaching and has reduced the number of regular contributors from the public sector in the BBC’s discussions. The latter were, inter alia, former chairman of Vietnam Parliament’s Education Committee Nguyen Minh Thuyet, former Director of the Vietnamese government’s Border Commission Tran Cong Truc (both holding the rank of a minister), former ambassador Dinh Hoang Thang, diplomat Tran Viet Thai, historian Vu Minh Giang and many others who were once regular participants in the Roundtable in the previous period. Then,the Cybersecurity Law (2018) further limited the number of participants from the non-state sector.[29] Worse, many civil society activists and independent journalists were subjected to direct censorship, according to human rights groups.[30] More than 10 of the regular participants of the BBC’s broadcast were among activists and bloggers detained and charged in Vietnam between 2016 and 2022 for 'abusing freedom of speech' or more often, for 'anti-state propaganda' by speaking publicly on social media.[31] Others chose self-imposed exile or kept silent to avoid persecution. In less-known cases, provincial newspapers in Vietnam publicly denounced local activists and bloggers until they stopped using social media to challenge the government on policies or to expose corruption cases. In the court papers against blogger Pham Doan Trang, one of the charges against her was 'the interviews given to BBC Vietnamese and Radio Free Asia'.[32] LIMITATIONS ON POLITICAL DEBATE IN VIETNAM AND THE CONSEQUENCES By 2021, censorship online and offline – often in the form of harsh sentences meted out to online critics – had damaging ramifications for BBC Vietnamese Roundtable output, reducing the number of people from Vietnam brave enough to continue participating to less than 10 people. The latter included two well-known dissidents, Mr Nguyen Huu Vinh and Mr Nguyen Quang A, and two outspoken academics, Pham Quy Tho and Hoang Ngoc Giao. Together with a few retired historians and journalists in Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese journalists, they participated in the last 13 political discussions of the Roundtable in 2021.[33] In response to this new situation – with a lack of speakers able and willing to discuss Vietnamese politics – together with the departure of four staff members experienced in moderating the Roundtable, BBC Vietnamese had to close the Roundtable in 2022 and instead reinvest in a different livestreaming podcast on social and youth-related topics, from its Bangkok bureau. The last BBC Vietnamese interview conducted in Vietnam was in January 2023 and, since then, no team member has been able to gain accreditation to report from the country. Moreover, the public space in Vietnam has been so thoroughly sanitised that a public discussion, if organised to be independent from state intervention, is highly likely to have just voices from outside of Vietnam. The limitation on the ability to organise discussions in Vietnam is also evident in the case of the VOA Vietnamese YouTube debate about Vietnamese politics. A review of 10 episodes between 18 January and 10 August 2024 on the VOA Vietnamese YouTube channel reveals a pattern about the locations of participants or guest speakers similar to that for the BBC Vietnamese discussion in the recent past: DateLocationTotal numberVietnam guest speakersOverseas guests10 Aug 2024All speakers in USA40403 Aug 2024Vietnam, USA, Cambodia41321 May 2024Vietnam, UK, USA41309 May 2024Vietnam, US, Germany41304 April 2024Vietnam, Germany, USA41318 Jan 2024Vietnam, USA422Table 2 (source: VOA Vietnamese YouTube) The data not only indicate that the geographical location of the participants favours overseas voices, often at a ratio of 3 to 1. In addition, their personal profiles, and thus their political viewpoints are less diverse compared to those taking part in the BBC’s YouTube programme during its peak, prior to 2019. In sum, all participants in this VOA Vietnamese discussion programme were political dissidents, with no one representing the view of the Vietnamese government. Moreover, the only regular guest speaker from Vietnam in 4 out of 6 VOA Vietnamese recordings was dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan while several programmes in the same series had the same, returning guest speakers from the US, Germany and the UK.[34] At the time of writing, the issue of Vietnamese citizens being pressurised and prevented from giving interviews to overseas-based media has received international attention. In September 2024, Mary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders raised the case of Mr Nguyen Quang A, a Hanoi-based intellectual dissident who had been interrogated multiple times by the police in Vietnam for 'giving interviews on social media', calling on Vietnam to protect his human rights.[35] It is worth noting that Mr. Quang A was a regular guest on the BBC Roundtable. Since its closure, he has frequently appeared on the Vietnamese programmes of other international broadcasters, including the new YouTube discussion series by VOA mentioned earlier. CONCLUSION An increasingly tight media censorship by Vietnam in the last 5 years both internally and externally has had a far-reaching negative impact on the operation of the BBC Vietnamese language service. The impact on BBC Vietnamese Service is two-fold. Firstly, the continuation of a harsh media regulatory regime and the lack of direct access to Vietnam have, in effect turned it into one of many language services in the BBC World Service 'working in exile', a new phenomenon caused by increasing repression against free media around the world.[36] In this specific context concerning the operation of the BBC, Vietnam’s media restrictions are on a par with Iran, China and Russia. Secondly, to uphold the principle of impartiality, the only option left to these journalists is to use indirect quotes reflecting the views and opinions of the Vietnamese government and top leaders as shown in state media outlets. The Service can now hardly organise an open debate about Vietnamese politics with a variety of views and voices from Vietnam, as envisaged by the BBC Charter. For the public in Vietnam, the pervasive and stringent media censorship has significantly restricted civic space, preventing the expression of diverse viewpoints and limiting the ability to address common concerns in a timely and responsible manner. With Decree 53 (2022) issued specifically to interpret the Cyber Security Law in the light of national defence, and new decrees in 2023 effectively banning livestreaming by individuals in Vietnam except for entertainment, sales and commercial advertising, more state control over public speech is in place.[37] One of the implications of this new stringent regime has been that the vacuum has gradually been filled by anti-government YouTube broadcasts made by overseas influencers attacking top leaders of Vietnam with numerous unsubstantiated corruption accusations and in very defamatory language.[38] Their popularity indicates that the stringent regulations have been counterproductive to their purpose of bringing people to the government’s side. Instead, they have led to further polarization of public opinion in Vietnamese-language media environment. For the government of Vietnam, blocking the BBC and closing space for domestic debate has not only deprived its decision-making agencies of a useful channel for constructive feedback, one needed to rectify their policy-related errors, but also contradicts the joint declaration on the UK-Vietnamese strategic partnership made in 2020 wherein both sides had pledged to 'promote greater access to each other’s media organisations'.[39] Looking forward, one could argue that until both sides reach convergent perspectives on the role of the media, Vietnam’s hindrance to the work of British media, especially the BBC in reporting about Vietnam and engaging with the public in that country, will continue.

On Climate, Will Trump Have It All His Own Way? – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo Donald Trump’s comments during his 2024 campaign trail, together with his actions during his first presidency, suggest doom and gloom for the global climate agenda – and a severe retardation of climate action during his upcoming second term. But new factors determine the global landscape compared to 2016, offering a more nuanced set of possibilities for climate action. Trump announced the United States’ (US) withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017. The official exit came in November 2020, just before the end of his first term. Although President Joe Biden’s administration soon reversed the departure, some damage was done. A second withdrawal could be devastating. Trump also appointed climate change sceptics to key positions within the US administration and beyond. He picked Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency head and nominated David Malpass – famous for denying the scientific consensus on the link between fossil fuels and global warming – as president of the World Bank. The bank is a key body expected to support an international movement to a lower carbon economy. In 2020, the Brookings Institution counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened environmental protection in the US, driven largely by the America First Energy Plan. This was primarily a package to rescue and empower the US fossil fuel value chain. Measures included reopening coal mines, removing oil exploration and drilling restrictions, and reducing climate and environmental regulations. Will Trump’s second presidency – bolstered with a suite of gains he didn’t have before – deliver more of the same? His first gain was winning the popular vote and the electoral college vote. Second, the Presidency, Senate and Congress are all under Republican control. This creates a super-highway for legislation, policy and budget approvals that are not necessarily aligned with global sustainability. In 2020, Brookings counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened US environmental protections The third gain is that preparation for this Republican presidency has been high. In addition to the role of Trump’s team and conservative think tanks, there is also Project 2025, which lists as a priority ‘unleash[ing] American energy production to reduce energy prices.’ Project 2025 policy documents call for ending research funding on climate change, and dismantling or downsizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency. These agencies have become increasingly prominent as the US experiences high levels of climate-related disasters. Damaging possibilities include reversing official policy to decarbonise America, decreasing public investments in climate change research, balkanising or reducing the size of federal and other institutions managing climate impacts, and withdrawing from related multilateral and other commitments. If launched, the US anti-climate juggernaut, driven by its geopolitical influence and economic power, might push the world towards catastrophic climate scenarios. The US will also reduce foreign aid and assistance programmes related to climate change, with Africa as a potential victim. But there are important mitigating factors. First, the domestic dividends associated with the US’ green investments are real. The flagbearer is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its US$370 billion boost for investment in green technology. In the short term, most benefits from the IRA are being accrued to Republicans. Clean energy investments in Republican congressional districts stand at US$268.5 billion, compared to US$77.4 billion in Democrat-controlled districts. Most IRA benefits – with its US$370 billion boost for green tech investments – accrued to Republicans The US Treasury indicated in its March 2024 report that the projected benefit from the IRA would be US$5 trillion by 2050, as a combination of global economic benefits, decreased pollution and an increase in domestic health and productivity. The projected benefit for 2024 alone is estimated at US$137 million. Forbes says that by 2030, the IRA could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. It could create 1.3 million jobs and avoid 4 500 premature deaths annually by 2030. The second mitigating factor is that the US has had a plethora of weather- and climate-related disasters that have been costly in terms of the economy, threats to the social fabric, and loss of life. Official data indicates that since 1980, these disasters have resulted in 16 768 deaths and cost the economy US$2.785 trillion. Third, the weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant. Europe has already pegged its future economic security in the European Green Deal. The US’ biggest economic competitor is China, which has invested extensively in renewable energy and electric vehicles. China’s green growth has been a major boost to its ascendency economically. Both overt and covert carbon-based trade barriers are already being developed at pace. The most prominent is the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2024 states that faster expansion of clean energy is key to reducing fragilities associated with geopolitical risk. The report also points to a 2030 tipping point, when electricity production from low-emission sources will overtake fossil fuels. Then there is the Elon Musk factor. A big Trump supporter and clearly a person of influence around the president-elect, Musk is an electric vehicle pioneer. Tesla is the world’s largest electric car company, with more than 10 times larger market capitalisation than its closest competitor. Musk is also a major global player in battery technology and a strong proponent of low-carbon energy solutions. Could this soften Trump’s position on fossil fuels? The likely scenario is that the beginning of the 47th US administration will see big gestures in line with the America First Energy, pro-fossil fuel doctrine. This may include initiating a second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Early push-back on environmental regulations is almost certain. Equally likely is a subsequent shift to a nuanced narrative highlighting the need for decarbonisation as renewable energy and low-carbon industrialisation become essential in global economic competition – a change that can’t come soon enough.

The History And Impact Of Japan’s Loans To China – Analysis	By Xia Ri 1979 was a critical year for the economic, political, and diplomatic development between China and Japan. During his visit to China, then-Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira explicitly stated that Japan would support China's reform and opening-up efforts. Subsequently, Japan formally began providing government development loans to China, primarily in yen. In December 2007, China and Japan signed the yen loan agreement, and 28 years later, the Japanese government officially announced that it would cease the loans to China starting in 2008. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, and in advancing China's socialist modernization. However, the importance of yen loans is clearly underestimated in China, hence the need for it to be re-examined and recognized. In its entire process, Japan provided loans to China in batches, with the initial scale rapidly increasing, peaking in 2000, then sharply decreasing. Overall, yen loans show the five characteristics of high amounts, large increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. The first three batches of yen loans saw a significant increase in scale. The first batch (1979-1983) amounted to JPY 330.9 billion, with an interest rate of 3% and a 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The second batch (1984-1989) was announced during Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to China in 1984, with a loan of JPY 470 billion, an interest rate ranging from 3% to 5%, and the same 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The third batch (1990-1995), announced during Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru's visit in 1988, involved JPY 810 billion, a 2.5% interest rate, and a 30-year repayment period, also with a 10-year grace period. Secondly, after the fourth batch of yen loans, the scale sharply declined after reaching its peak. The fourth batch of loans was divided into two stages: JPY 580 billion for the 1996-1998 period and JPY 390 billion for the 1999-2000 period, totaling approximately JPY 970 billion. The annual interest rate ranged from 0.75% to 2.3%, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a 10-year grace period. By 2000, yen loans peaked at JPY 2.14299 trillion, which was about three times the amount of the first batch. However, after 2001, the loan amount significantly decreased, reaching its lowest point by 2007 at only JPY 46.302 billion, a reduction of about 78.4% compared to 2000. Finally, there were also industry-specific loans. In 1988 and 1994, the Japanese government provided China with two capital recycling yen loans, amounting to JPY 100 billion and JPY 40 billion, respectively. These loans were mainly used for industries such as textiles, electromechanical, light industry production, and raw materials for export. The development of these sectors supported China's efforts to expand exports and generate foreign exchange. In October 2000, Japan also provided China a special yen loan with a 40-year repayment term, with a 10-year grace period, and an interest rate of only 0.95%, totaling JPY 17.202 billion. These yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, driving the rapid development of the Chinese economy. This impact is reflected in the following three areas: First, they opened the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy. In June 1979, the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law was passed, signaling China's official abandonment of its 1960s policy of rejecting foreign investment. This marked a shift towards encouraging foreign capital. In 1978, China's foreign exchange reserves were only USD 167 million. In 1979, China and Japan signed the first loan agreement, which was the earliest and largest foreign government loan received by China since the reform and opening-up began. Japan was the first country to offer government loans to China, thus opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital to develop its economy. To facilitate this loan, the Japanese government proposed and convinced other Western countries and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to classify China as a 'developing country' and include it in the list of countries eligible for assistance from developed nations. This was very helpful for China in securing funding and development aid from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, thus accelerating China's economic development and integration into the global economic system. Japan was also the largest donor of government development assistance to China, with the total loan agreement amount accounting for over 60% of all foreign government loans to China. Among the 24 countries and regional financial institutions that provided government loans to China, Japan's loans were the largest. China was the third-largest recipient of Japan's foreign aid, following Indonesia and Vietnam. In 2006, Japan's Ambassador to China, Keiji Ide, noted that, in terms of U.S. dollars, Japan's aid to China amounts to USD 144.1 billion, exceeding the total aid from Germany (USD 39.6 billion), France (USD 13.4 billion), and the UK (USD 6.6 billion) combined. Second, the loans promoted China's infrastructure and economic development plans through valuable long-term investment funds, thereby reducing financing costs for construction. The multi-year decision approach to loans aligned with China's five-year economic plans, effectively advancing infrastructure development in areas such as resources, energy, transportation, and communications. According to data from Japan-China Economic Cooperation, the share of yen loans in China's fixed asset investment increased from 1.54% in 1985 to 10.41% in 1992. Through joint efforts between the two countries, a number of large-scale, long-term, technologically advanced, and capital-intensive infrastructure projects were completed across China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. By the end of 1995, the major construction projects included the expansion of the Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway, Qinhuangdao Port expansion, Lianyungang Port expansion, Qingdao Port expansion, the Tianshengqiao hydropower project, the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway construction, Beijing subway construction, Beijing water supply improvement projects, urban gas improvement projects, export base construction projects, Hainan Island development, telephone network expansion in nine provinces and cities, Beijing Capital Airport development, the Xi'an-Ankang railway project, and numerous city infrastructure projects in railways, gas, water supply, electricity, and communications. For instance, between 1991 and 1995, the Tianshengqiao Hydroelectric Project utilized JPY 4.367 billion in loans to build a 1,200 MW dam-style hydroelectric power station, extend 984 kilometers of transmission lines, and support China's eighth Five-Year Plan and the West-to-East Gas Pipeline Project. Furthermore, since Japan launched the transformative economic cooperation plan for China in 2001, yen loans have supported national regional strategies such as the plans for developing the western and central parts of the country. These loans greatly facilitated development in the recipient areas in sectors such as education, healthcare, and the environment, including projects like the Heihe-Beian highway in Heilongjiang, local road development in Gansu, and afforestation plans in Inner Mongolia. Third, it accelerated the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. After the 1980s, the two countries' economic and trade relations evolved from simple import-export trade to comprehensive economic cooperation, which included bilateral trade, the change of Japan's government development aid policy to China, direct investment, and intergovernmental financial cooperation. During this decade, leveraging Japan's government-to-government financial cooperation with China, bilateral trade between the two countries grew from around USD 10 billion in 1981 to USD 20.282 billion in 1991, an increase of over 100%. During this period, trade between the two nations experienced sustained and rapid development overall. Moreover, direct investment from both countries also saw a significant rise, leading to the first surge of private Japanese investment in China. According to data, between 1979 and 1985, the investment amounted to USD 1.23 billion; from 1986 to 1990, total investment reached USD 1.29 billion. Although these investment surges were mainly focused on China's Special Economic Zones and were smaller in scale compared to later investments, they were crucial in opening up direct private investment between the two countries and played a significant role in developing China-Japan economic and trade relations. Later, due to political factors and the Asian financial crisis, China-Japan trade experienced several setbacks. In 1990, bilateral trade declined significantly; from 1994 to 1996, growth slowed notably compared to previous years, and negative growth occurred in 1998. However, overall, China-Japan trade continued to rise, from USD 12.927 billion in 1990 to USD 66.167 billion in 1999. In the 21st century, the development of China-Japan economic and trade relations accelerated rapidly, showing characteristics such as mutual dependence, increasing deepening, a mutually beneficial structure becoming more evident. At the same time, Japan's increasing dependence on China surpassed China's dependence on Japan. This made an important contribution to China's economic development. Meanwhile, Japanese investment in China continued to grow. In 2002, Japanese investment in China remained high, with an agreement amount of USD 5.3 billion and an actual investment of USD 4.19 billion. By the end of 2002, the total agreed investment from Japan to China had reached USD 49.53 billion, with actual investment amounting to USD 36.34 billion. All in all, the 28 years of Japanese loans had a significant impact on China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for it to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, a proper understanding of these loan aids is crucial for China to effectively manage and advance its relations with Japan. Final analysis conclusion: The 28 years of yen loans were characterized by high amounts, significant increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. They played a crucial role in China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, the history and impact of yen loans need to be re-examined.

Will Gavin Newsom Become The New ‘Teflon’ Politician? – OpEd	By William L. Anderson When reality hit the Democratic Party and its ruling-class allies the day after the election, one Democrat must have been relieved: California governor Gavin Newsom. The Kamala Harris loss not only ends her political career—at least at the presidential level—but also clears the way for Newsom to pursue the White House himself. A Harris victory would have delayed Newsom’s quest for eight years, but now he can start laying the groundwork now for a run in 2028. Newsom will spend the next two years in office before becoming a full-time candidate, and, given the constitutional limit on two terms, the Republicans won’t have the advantage (or the weight) of incumbency and will likely present a candidate with less name recognition than Newsom possesses. The New York Times already has jumped in feet-first in its 'Style' section with a hagiographic portrayal of Newsom, hair gel and all. The writer breathlessly wrote: Last year, he debated Ron DeSantis on that network, landing rhetorical jabs like 'You’re nothing but a bully.' The appearances have burnished his reputation as someone who saunters into the conservative lion’s den and comes out with his slicked hair unruffled. His first post-election 'heroic' move was to call for a special session of the California legislature: ...to protect 'California values' in preparation for former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Less than 36 hours after Trump’s resounding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, the California governor — a prominent opponent of the former president during his first term — called to bolster the state’s legal resources with the aim of protecting reproductive healthcare, climate policies and immigrant communities in California. One might think that we are looking at something that is light years away, politically speaking, but in the world of presidential ambition, successful candidates spend years scheming to reach that office. John F. Kennedy’s father was planning the political careers of his sons long before they reached full adulthood, Ronald Reagan coveted the presidency more than 10 years before he was elected in 1980, and Jimmy Carter and his advisers quietly launched their quest long before the Watergate scandal gave him a major opening. In presidential politics, four years is tomorrow and no doubt Newsom and those surrounding him already are at work. However, as Harris has found out, what constitutes success in California politics might prove a liability elsewhere, and that is especially the case regarding the state’s draconian policies on energy and climate change. One imagines that most people believe California to be a weird and exotic place on the nation’s west coast that is an expensive place to live but has little relevance in their own lives. Sure, the state has stringent environmental laws, but the effects are limited to California, or one might think. However, California’s energy and climate policies affect nearly everyone in this country. The election of Donald Trump brings an opponent of California’s policies to the White House, where he is: …expected to try to blow up California’s climate policies, which have set the pace for the rest of the nation and the world. The state is requiring about three-quarters of new trucks sold there after 2035 to be zero emissions. And in a request that is pending, California wants permission from the Biden administration to enact one of the most ambitious climate rules of any nation: a ban on the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in the state after 2035. Both rules are far tougher than federal policy and could have influence beyond the United States, given California’s standing as the world’s fifth-largest economy. China and the European Union have already adopted parts of California’s car and truck tailpipe emissions reduction programs. The Democratic-controlled state legislature has also passed a first-in-the-nation law requiring major companies to disclose their greenhouse emissions. And it has strengthened the authority of local governments to shut down oil and gas projects in their communities. Next month, Californians will be asked to approve a ballot measure to create a $10 billion 'climate bond' to pay for climate and environmental projects. While the New York Times writes approvingly of California’s policies, in reality they will be disastrous for the rest of the country if put into place. In 2023, the California legislature passed a law aimed at outlawing all internal combustion engines in trucks within a decade, a law so draconian that 19 state attorneys general filed suit in federal court to block it. The impact this law would have on the trucking industry would be enormous, especially given how much freight is carried overland on trucks and how inadequate electric vehicles would be to carry it: Electric trucks suffer major disadvantages when compared to diesel trucks. Diesel trucks can travel about 1200 miles after filling the tank in 15 minutes. The range of electric trucks is about 150-330 miles and recharging may take hours, even on a high-speed charger. Electric truck cabs cost two to three times as much as diesel cabs, an incremental cost of as much as $300,000 per truck. Electric cabs also weigh about 10,000 pounds more than comparable diesel versions. This can reduce net freight carried by as much as 20 percent. Part of the problem is that California’s environmental standards often become the precursors to standards for the entire country, but thanks to the Jones Act, California policy has a disproportionate effect upon the lives of others. Because of California’s proximity to Asia (and especially China), it is a natural place for container ships coming from Asia to bring goods imported into the US, and at the present time, about 40 percent of all US imports come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Because of the Jones Act, those foreign-owned ships cannot take goods to any other US port unless they stop at a foreign port that is some distance away. Thus, they cannot take some goods to California and then sail to the US east coast and take goods there. The effect of this law is that a huge amount of imported goods going elsewhere in the US must be transported by truck or rail through California, and given the strict regulations for transfer trucks, carrying goods through that state is very expensive. Given that the laws governing transfer trucks will be even more stringent, that only can raise costs—unless the Jones Act is repealed, which is highly unlikely, given its almost religious support by Democrats and labor unions, despite the hardships it causes. Because Newsom supports the draconian legislation regulating trucks in California, he also is playing a direct role in California being a transportation bottleneck for the rest of the country, a situation that will only become worse in the next four years. To writers from the New York Times, economic crises caused by things like environmental regulations simply don’t happen, or if they do, the fault lies with capitalism. However, if California can proceed with radical restrictions on transporting goods, there can be no spinning the inevitable results. They will mean higher prices, empty shelves, and more hardships for those who are not wealthy. Newsom’s policies will at least be partly to blame, but will voters connect the dots, especially since journalists won’t? Four decades ago, a former governor from California occupied the White House. Because the media and their governmental allies could not pin any scandals on Ronald Reagan, they derisively called him the 'Teflon President.' Given the fawning coverage that Newsom receives in the media, the fact that California has the nation’s highest poverty rates, ruinous environmental laws, and one of the nation’s highest net out-migration rates, one would think that the most prominent political architect of these woes would at least pay something akin to a political price. But think again. If there ever has been a 'Teflon' politician, it is Gavin Newsom. Be prepared to see numerous fawning pieces from mainstream media outlets that present him as a demigod. They are coming. About the author: William L. Anderson is Senior Editor at the Mises Institute and retired professor of economics at Frostburg State University.

Javier Milei’s Blueprint For DOGE: A Chainsaw For Bureaucracy – O...	By Daphne Posadas 'What is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.' That opening line set the tone for Javier Milei’s two-hour interview with Lex Fridman. In it, Argentina’s libertarian president reflected on the first few months of his administration following his historic electoral victory on November 19, 2023. Milei has been called many things, but his methods and philosophy thrive under scrutiny. In a free society, being questioned is both a challenge and an opportunity. What sets Milei apart is his ability to answer tough questions with logic, evidence, and, most importantly, results. His anarchist rhetoric is—as he said—rooted in a libertarianism that has an 'unrestricted respect for the life project of others based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the rights to life, liberty, and property,' a definition championed by Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr., and that follows John Locke’s ideas. A Model Exported Milei’s reforms haven’t gone unnoticed in the U.S., especially after the announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. In the interview, Milei highlighted how Argentina’s Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation, led by Federico Sturzenegger, is systematically dismantling protectionism and privilege by eliminating 1 to 5 economic restrictions daily. This approach is catching attention worldwide, as Musk and Ramaswamy have hinted at adapting this 'chainsaw' strategy. Ramaswamy recently posted on X: 'A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.' A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) November 18, 2024 The Chainsaw Reforms If there’s one image that defined Milei’s 2023 campaign, it’s the chainsaw. He carried a real chainsaw to his rallies, chanting '¡Motosierra! ¡Motosierra!' (Spanish for 'chainsaw') as a symbol of his promise to slash Argentina’s bloated bureaucracy. When Milei took office, Argentina’s inflation was out of control, climbing at almost 1% per day. Fixing the fiscal deficit became his top priority, knowing nothing else would work without a solution on that front. In just a few months, he made drastic changes: cutting over 50,000 government jobs, shutting down more than half of the ministries, slashing regulations, and removing subsidies. The results? Inflation has dropped from 211% year over year in December 2023 to 107.4% in November 2024, according to the latest inflation data from INDEC. According to UFM Reform Watch’s Daniel Fernandez, Javier Milei’s government has now achieved 10 consecutive months of primary fiscal surplus: 'Between January and October 2024, the Argentine government accumulated a primary fiscal surplus equivalent to nearly 1.7% of GDP'—a remarkable turnaround. Milei: A Former Academic As a former economics professor, Milei excels at breaking down complex economic concepts. Early in the interview, he provided a roadmap for those interested in understanding Austrian economics with big references: Human Action by Ludwig von Mises and Principles of Economics by Carl Menger, two starting points for him. He also name-dropped other thinkers, including Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Jesús Huerta de Soto, Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, and Walter Block—a quick guide to both Anglo and Hispanic perspectives on libertarian thought. When Fridman dug deeper and asked about his economic philosophy, Milei replied: 'Ideally, anarcho-capitalist; in reality, minarchist.' This summarizes his pragmatic approach to reducing the state’s size through what he calls 'the largest structural reform in Argentina’s history' while being realistic about what’s possible. Here Milei also addressed criticism from some libertarians, saying they often fall for the 'nirvana fallacy'—expecting perfect solutions in an imperfect world. Key Takeaways There are two main takeaways from Milei’s interview with Fridman. First, Milei knows what he’s talking about. Too many politicians don’t really understand economics, but Milei clearly does. He doesn’t just memorize numbers; he explains the reasoning behind his decisions, and it makes sense. Second, market-driven reforms can deliver results. Contrary to popular belief or experts’ advice, these changes don’t require decades to show their impact. Will these reforms catch on all the way to the White House? Only time will tell. But for now, it’s clear that Milei’s approach is turning heads around the world. I highly recommend watching or listening to the full conversation. It’s an incredibly stimulating discussion, particularly for economics enthusiasts eager to see theory translated into real-world policy action.

Who Should Pay For Really Expensive Drugs? – OpEd	When is the last time you saw a news headline about cancer patients who died because they were unable to afford a drug that could have saved their lives? I bet you haven’t. One reason is that drug companies that make expensive drugs can’t afford the political backlash that would follow such a headline. Another reason is that large employers who provide health insurance can’t afford such a headline, either. Yet, despite the fact that Big Pharma and big business agree on the end result (people get the lifesaving drugs they need), they don’t always agree on who should bear the bulk of the cost. In fact, in the modern era there has been a continuing tug of war between the two that has been largely unreported. Enter the politicians to tilt the scale. A letter signed by a number of Democrats and Republicans in Congress supports a Biden administration proposed regulation that would remove many employer options. Instead of allowing normal market forces to play out, this regulation would allow drug companies to sell brand-name drugs at monopoly prices for virtually all patients with employer-provided health insurance. The result would be higher drug company profits and lower employee wages. Specialty Drugs The most expensive drugs are generally called 'specialty drugs.' These are primarily used to treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and genetic diseases. They can also cost thousands of dollars. For example, among the top ten most prescribed specialty drugs, the monthly expense ranges from $3,587 to $33,981. Including the treatment of HIV infection, only 5.9% of the US population uses a specialty drug. But those drugs now account for over 50% of total drug spending in the United States. Within the U.S., people with private health insurance tend to face very high out-of-pocket costs when it comes to specialty drugs. If a drug costs $2,000 a month, for example, an employee might have to pay the full cost for 3 or 4 months before reaching the deductible; then the employee’s health insurance takes over. For many people, this out-of-pocket cost may pose a significant barrier to obtaining the prescribed drug. Drug Companies To overcome that obstacle (at least in the short run), drug companies issue copay cards to use at a pharmacy to cover the initial cost. This gets patients started on the drugs their doctors say they need. Although it is not generally known, just about anyone starting out on an expensive drug regime can get copay cards for the first few months of treatment—regardless of income. (Remarkably, in issuing copay cards, drug companies are doing something that would be completely illegal if done by doctors and hospitals. If a doctor or hospital waived the patient’s out-of-pocket portion of the bill, they would be violating anti-kickback laws.) The drug companies’ second line of attack is the creation of Patient Assistance Programs. These are charitable enterprises that give financial assistance to people who are uninsured or underinsured. The amount of help generally depends on the patient’s income—with the goal of making the drug affordable. Large Employers In a free market for health insurance, a typical plan would leave the enrollee responsible for small expenses for which patient discretion is affordable and desirable, and have the health plan pay for large expenses that would otherwise be unaffordable. However, government regulation (which has become more onerous with the passage of time) forces employers to ignore the health condition of prospective employees. These regulations, along with the rising cost of health care, have induced employers to adopt health plans that turn traditional health insurance principles upside down. That means, for example, low out-of-pocket costs for primary care and high out-of-pocket costs for hospitalization. This is the type of plan that appeals to potential employees who are healthy and does not appeal to those who expect to need a lot of care. Drug coverage often fits this pattern. No employer wants to hire an employee whose family member needs a specialty drug. The employer could end up paying more in medical costs than in wages. Since it is illegal for the employer to ask about expected medical expenses at the point of hiring, the same end can be achieved by not covering the drug in the first place, or by covering it with a high deductible. This makes employment at the firm unattractive to anyone who needs the drug. The Tug of War We saw above how drug companies try to get private group health plans or health insurance to pay most of the cost of expensive drugs. Employers have been using strategies of their own. One straightforward approach is to not cover a specialty drug in their health plan or to cover it with high patient cost-sharing (which large, self-insured companies are allowed to do). When a doctor prescribes the drug, the employee is then directed to the drug company’s Patient Assistance Program (PAP) as someone who is not fully insured for the needed drug. Some advocacy companies actually specialize in helping the employee fill out the paperwork and navigate the byzantine PAP system. What happens if patients are rejected by the PAP, say, because their income is too high to qualify for financial assistance? Then the employer often makes a hardship exception and pays for the drug through its health plan. The congressional letter signers (noted above) want to put an end to these employer options. They want to force large employers to cover expensive drugs the way they cover other drugs—giving the drug companies a big win. And since employer health insurance benefits are ultimately paid for by lower employee wages, the drug company win would be an employee loss. There is no right or wrong solution when a monopoly seller clashes with buyers trying to avoid paying a monopoly price. That’s why government regulators should be held at bay and normal market forces should be allowed to play out.

Russia Now Has Two Million Homeless And Their Ranks Are Growing B...	Although the Russian government does not release any statistics on homelessness, the Shelter (Nochlezhka) organization, the oldest group in Russia devoted to helping the homeless, says there are now approximately two million homeless in Russia and that their numbers are growing because of the war in Ukraine. According to Nochlezhka, the three primary causes of homelessness are low incomes, family problems and the search for work in new places (tochno.st/materials/iz-za-krizisov-v-rossii-vyroslo-cislo-bezdomnyx-no-oficialnoi-statistiki-o-nix-net-my-proanalizirovali-dannye-noclezki-o-tom-kto-i-pocemu-cashhe-vsego-popadaet-na-ulicu). Their numbers rose during the pandemic and have risen even more since the start of Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine which has left many Russians without sufficient money to pay rent, increased problems within some families, and led others to move from one place to another in hopes of finding better jobs. Approximately four out of five are men, some are second generation homeless, and one in ten grew up in an orphanage. But despite public views, fewer homeless are alcoholics or drug abusers than are members of the Russian population as a whole, according to the data collected by Nochlezhka. Most of Russia’s homeless survive on the basis of temporary work or help from families rather than from social services provided by the government. Indeed, the group says, the only government service such people, who now form one in every 70 Russians, can rely is the government’s ambulance service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzt0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-20T16:56:04-08:00	
Albert Camus’s Thought And Its Impact On Later Thinkers – Analysi...	Albert Camus, the French-Algerian philosopher, writer, and journalist, left an indelible mark on modern intellectual thought through his exploration of absurdity, rebellion, and existential ethics. His ideas, articulated through works such as The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Stranger (1942), and The Rebel (1951), have resonated deeply with later thinkers, influencing diverse fields ranging from existentialism and postmodernism to politics and literature. Camus's unique perspective on the human condition challenged prevailing ideologies and provided a nuanced framework for understanding personal freedom, collective responsibility, and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe. The Core of Camus's Philosophy Camus's philosophy revolves around the concept of the absurd—the tension between human beings' relentless search for meaning and the universe's apparent indifference to that search. Unlike existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who sought to transcend the absurd through subjective meaning-making, Camus embraced the absurd as a fundamental condition of existence. For Camus, life's lack of inherent meaning does not lead to despair but calls for defiance and the conscious creation of value. This perspective laid the foundation for his emphasis on rebellion, not as a destructive act, but as an assertion of human dignity and solidarity. Impact on Existentialism: Sartre and De Beauvoir While Camus famously rejected the existentialist label, his work inevitably intersected with and influenced prominent existentialist thinkers, particularly Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre, in his monumental work Being and Nothingness (1943), shared Camus's preoccupation with freedom and responsibility. However, Camus diverged from Sartre in his refusal to embrace Marxist revolutionary violence as a means of achieving freedom. This difference came to a head in their public feud following the publication of Camus's The Rebel, in which he critiqued Marxist ideologies for their justification of historical violence. Simone de Beauvoir, in works such as The Second Sex (1949), explored existential themes of freedom and oppression, particularly in the context of gender. While she was more aligned with Sartre's existentialism, de Beauvoir acknowledged Camus's influence on her conception of personal responsibility and the confrontation with absurdity. Camus's insistence on solidarity as a form of rebellion resonates in her discussions of collective feminist struggles. Postmodern Thinkers: Derrida and Foucault The rise of postmodernism in the latter half of the 20th century saw thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault grappling with issues of meaning, power, and subjectivity, often in ways that echo Camus's absurdist sensibility. Derrida's deconstructionist approach, for instance, can be seen as a philosophical parallel to Camus's insistence on confronting the absurd without resorting to absolute truths. Derrida's emphasis on the instability of meaning aligns with Camus's rejection of ultimate purpose, emphasizing instead the creative potential of human agency in the face of uncertainty. Michel Foucault's analysis of power and resistance bears traces of Camus's influence, particularly in its rejection of totalizing narratives and its focus on individual agency. Foucault's concept of 'counter-conducts' in resisting dominant systems of control echoes Camus's vision of rebellion as a life-affirming act against oppressive ideologies. While Foucault does not explicitly cite Camus as a key influence, their shared emphasis on ethics and freedom in a fragmented world underscores an intellectual kinship. Political Philosophy: Hannah Arendt and Václav Havel Hannah Arendt, a leading 20th-century political theorist, found resonance in Camus's exploration of rebellion and human dignity. In her seminal work The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Arendt analyzed the dehumanizing effects of totalitarian regimes, themes that Camus also examined in The Plague and The Rebel. Both thinkers emphasized the importance of collective resistance against tyranny and the preservation of human freedom. Arendt's idea of 'natality,' the potential for new beginnings through human action, mirrors Camus's notion of defying absurdity through creative acts. Václav Havel, the Czech playwright, dissident, and later president, openly acknowledged Camus's influence on his political philosophy. Havel's concept of 'living in truth' as a form of resistance to oppressive regimes draws directly from Camus's celebration of personal integrity and rebellion. Camus's works provided a moral and philosophical framework for Havel and other dissidents during the Cold War, underscoring the enduring relevance of his ideas in political resistance. Camus's Influence on Literature Camus's literary legacy extends beyond philosophy, profoundly impacting writers such as Samuel Beckett, James Baldwin, and Milan Kundera. Beckett, in works like Waiting for Godot (1953), explores themes of absurdity and existential inertia that parallel Camus's depiction of human perseverance in The Myth of Sisyphus. The repetitive, purposeless actions of Beckett's characters reflect the absurdist condition Camus described, while also embodying a form of rebellion through endurance. James Baldwin, a towering figure in 20th-century literature, was deeply influenced by Camus's humanism and his critique of systemic injustice. Baldwin's essays, particularly in The Fire Next Time (1963), echo Camus's call for moral courage and solidarity in confronting oppression. Baldwin admired Camus's refusal to succumb to nihilism despite acknowledging the absurdity of the human condition. Milan Kundera, the Czech novelist, found inspiration in Camus's balance of philosophical inquiry and literary expression. Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984) reflects Camus's influence in its exploration of existential freedom and the tension between personal responsibility and historical determinism. Kundera's characters, like Camus's, navigate a world devoid of ultimate meaning, finding significance in their acts of defiance and creation. Contemporary Philosophy and Ethics In contemporary philosophy, thinkers such as Susan Neiman and Bernard-Henri Lévy have carried forward Camus's legacy. Neiman, in her book Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists (2008), draws on Camus's moral philosophy to argue for an ethical framework that combines realism with hope. She sees Camus as a model for engaging with life's challenges without resorting to cynicism or despair. Bernard-Henri Lévy, a prominent French intellectual, has championed Camus's ideas as a guide for navigating the complexities of modern geopolitics. In works such as The Genius of Judaism (2017), Lévy emphasizes the relevance of Camus's humanism in addressing issues of identity, conflict, and reconciliation. Critiques and Challenges to Camus's Thought Despite his widespread influence, Camus's ideas have also faced criticism. Postcolonial theorists, including Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, have critiqued Camus's ambivalence toward colonialism, particularly in the Algerian context. While Camus advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian War, his reluctance to support full independence for Algeria alienated some contemporaries. Additionally, feminist scholars have challenged the gendered implications of Camus's absurd hero, often characterized as a solitary male figure. Thinkers such as Luce Irigaray have called for a more inclusive conception of rebellion that accounts for diverse experiences of oppression and solidarity. Legacy in the 21st Century In an era defined by technological advancement, climate crises, and political polarization, Camus's philosophy continues to offer a compelling lens for understanding the human condition. His call for ethical rebellion and solidarity resonates with movements addressing systemic inequality, environmental degradation, and social justice. Camus's thought has influenced activists and intellectuals alike, from Greta Thunberg's climate activism to the Black Lives Matter movement. His insistence on confronting absurdity with courage and creativity provides a timeless framework for addressing contemporary challenges. Conclusion Albert Camus's thought, rooted in the recognition of life's absurdity, remains a beacon for those seeking to navigate a world fraught with uncertainty and conflict. His influence on thinkers such as Sartre, Arendt, Derrida, and Baldwin highlights the enduring relevance of his ideas in philosophy, politics, and literature. By championing rebellion as an affirmation of human dignity and solidarity, Camus offers a vision of hope and resistance that continues to inspire generations of thinkers and activists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzpjCAGuT2RmQ	2024-11-20T16:47:49-08:00	
Edward Said And Frantz Fanon: Pioneers Of Postcolonial Thought An...	Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, two intellectual giants of the 20th century, profoundly shaped postcolonial theory and decolonial thought. Said, a literary critic and cultural theorist, and Fanon, a psychiatrist and revolutionary, examined the deep-seated structures of colonialism and their enduring effects on culture, politics, and identity. While their works addressed different aspects of colonialism—Said through cultural critique and Fanon through political and psychological analysis—both shared a commitment to exposing colonial oppression and envisioning paths to liberation. This article explores the seminal contributions of Said and Fanon, their intellectual synergy, and their impact on later thinkers across disciplines, including Gayatri Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Achille Mbembe, Stuart Hall, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and others. Their ideas continue to resonate in fields as diverse as literary studies, political theory, anthropology, and critical race studies. Frantz Fanon: The Revolutionary Voice of Decolonization Frantz Fanon's major works, including Black Skin, White Masks (1952) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961), offer a searing critique of colonialism's dehumanizing effects on both colonizers and the colonized. Drawing from his experiences as a psychiatrist in Algeria during its war for independence, Fanon analyzed the psychological dimensions of colonialism, highlighting how it internalizes inferiority in the oppressed and superiority in the oppressors. He also called for violent revolution as a means to reclaim identity and autonomy. Edward Said: The Critic of Orientalism Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) revolutionized the study of colonialism by exposing how Western representations of the 'Orient' were rooted in power dynamics and served to justify imperial domination. Said's concept of 'othering' revealed how the West constructed the East as its binary opposite—irrational, backward, and exotic—thereby legitimizing colonial control. Through Culture and Imperialism (1993), Said expanded his critique to include the ways Western literature reinforced imperial ideologies. Synergy and Divergence: Said and Fanon While both thinkers critiqued colonial systems, their approaches differed. Fanon emphasized the necessity of physical and psychological decolonization through revolutionary action, while Said focused on dismantling the cultural narratives that sustained imperial power. Together, they laid the groundwork for a holistic understanding of colonialism's legacy, influencing subsequent scholars who integrated their insights into broader frameworks. Impact on Later Thinkers 1. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' Gayatri Spivak, a postcolonial theorist and literary critic, drew on Said and Fanon to develop her seminal concept of the 'subaltern'—marginalized individuals silenced by colonial and patriarchal systems. In her 1988 essay, Can the Subaltern Speak?, Spivak critiqued Western intellectuals for speaking on behalf of the oppressed rather than enabling their voices to emerge. She also extended Said's critique of cultural representation by emphasizing how imperialism intersected with gender. Spivak's scholarship has influenced feminist theory and postcolonial studies, pushing for greater attention to the intersectionality of race, class, and gender within colonial and postcolonial contexts. 2. Homi K. Bhabha: Hybridity and the Third Space Homi Bhabha built on Said's analysis of cultural representation and Fanon's exploration of identity to articulate key concepts such as hybridity and the 'third space.' In The Location of Culture (1994), Bhabha argued that colonial encounters produce hybrid identities, destabilizing the binary distinctions between colonizer and colonized. Bhabha's ideas have profoundly influenced discussions on globalization and multiculturalism, offering a nuanced understanding of how cultural exchanges reshape identity and power dynamics in postcolonial societies. 3. Achille Mbembe: Necropolitics and the Legacy of Fanon Achille Mbembe, a Cameroonian philosopher, extended Fanon's insights on violence and colonialism to develop his theory of necropolitics. In his 2003 essay of the same name, Mbembe examined how sovereign powers exert control over life and death, particularly in colonial and postcolonial contexts. He also engaged with Said's critique of Western domination by exploring how racial hierarchies are sustained in global systems of capitalism and governance. Mbembe's work has become central to critical race theory and discussions on contemporary forms of structural violence and exclusion. 4. Stuart Hall: Cultural Studies and Identity Politics Stuart Hall, a British cultural theorist, combined insights from Said and Fanon to analyze the interplay between culture, power, and identity. Hall's concept of cultural identity as dynamic and ever-changing draws from Fanon's exploration of identity formation under colonial rule. Hall's analysis of media representations also resonates with Said's critique of Orientalism. Hall's contributions have been foundational to cultural studies, particularly in understanding how race and ethnicity are constructed and contested in popular culture and political discourse. 5. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o: Decolonizing the Mind Kenyan writer and theorist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o directly engaged with Fanon's call for cultural decolonization in his seminal work, Decolonising the Mind (1986). Ngũgĩ argued for the rejection of colonial languages in African literature, emphasizing the need to reclaim indigenous languages as a form of resistance and empowerment. Ngũgĩ's ideas echo Said's critique of cultural imperialism and Fanon's emphasis on reclaiming identity through cultural production, making him a key figure in the global decolonial movement. 6. Arundhati Roy: Postcolonial Activism Indian author and activist Arundhati Roy has drawn from Said's and Fanon's critiques to address contemporary issues of globalization, environmental degradation, and social justice. In essays such as The Algebra of Infinite Justice (2002), Roy critiques the neo-imperial practices of multinational corporations and global powers, echoing Said's analysis of cultural hegemony and Fanon's critique of systemic exploitation. 7. Leela Gandhi: Postcolonial Ethics Leela Gandhi, in Postcolonial Theory: A Critical Introduction (1998), engaged deeply with the works of Said and Fanon to explore the ethical dimensions of postcolonialism. She emphasized the importance of building solidarity between the colonized and the colonizers, drawing from Said's notion of 'contrapuntal reading' and Fanon's vision of a humanist future beyond colonial violence. 8. Walter D. Mignolo: Decolonial Thinking Walter Mignolo, a prominent decolonial theorist, expanded on Said's and Fanon's ideas to develop the concept of 'epistemic disobedience.' In works such as The Darker Side of Western Modernity (2011), Mignolo critiques the dominance of Western epistemologies and calls for a decolonial shift in knowledge production. Contemporary Relevance In the 21st century, Said's and Fanon's ideas remain deeply relevant as scholars and activists grapple with the enduring legacies of colonialism. Movements such as Black Lives Matter, Indigenous land rights campaigns, and global decolonial efforts resonate with their critiques of systemic oppression and calls for liberation. The proliferation of postcolonial and decolonial studies as academic disciplines testifies to their enduring influence. Conclusion Edward Said and Frantz Fanon transformed the intellectual landscape by exposing the cultural, psychological, and structural mechanisms of colonial domination. Their works have inspired generations of thinkers—Spivak, Bhabha, Mbembe, Hall, and others—to explore the complexities of identity, resistance, and liberation in a postcolonial world. By confronting the past and envisioning alternative futures, Said and Fanon's legacy endures as a powerful call for justice, equality, and human dignity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzlqy-bgTdmU8	2024-11-20T16:45:00-08:00	
US, Under Fire, For Vetoing Resolutions Demanding Ceasefire In Ga...	The US veto on a Security Council (UNSC) resolution—demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza—was highly predictable. The resolution, which was vetoed November 20, also called for the release of all hostages and full humanitarian access for civilians. Since 1945, a total of 36 UNSC draft resolutions related to Israel-Palestine have been vetoed by at least one of the five permanent members (P5)—the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Of these, 34 were vetoed by the US and two by Russia and China, according to Al Jazeera, the Qatari-based Middle East news network. Meanwhile, the US, a strong ally with undying loyalty to Israel, came under heavy fire for its decision to exercise its veto—for the fourth time on a resolution on Gaza. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said the US used its veto, once again, to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza, including mass forced displacement and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The resolution it rejected also called for the release of Israeli hostages and compliance with international humanitarian law, both of which the US itself has called for. 'By continuing to shield Israeli authorities from pressure and scrutiny, the US is de facto condoning their crimes against humanity,' said Charbonneau. Brenda Moyfa, Head of Oxfam’s New York Office, said: 'It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a life-saving ceasefire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe.' This latest resolution for humanitarian access and an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza was promising on paper, but has little meaning vetoed, while past resolutions have gone unenforced, she pointed out. Security Council members continue to transfer arms for the Israeli military’s ongoing attacks on Palestinians trapped in Gaza without anywhere safe or the most basic resources to survive. 'The North Gaza governorate is being ethnically cleansed, with desperate civilians being deliberately starved to death in blatant violation of international law. Virtually no aid has entered all of Gaza for weeks now, yet member states continue to look the other way. 'This vote underlines Israel’s continued impunity to commit atrocities in Gaza. We need urgent reform within the UN Security Council. It is a profound failure and dereliction of duty for the member states who have pledged to uphold the UN Charter to maintain peace and protect lives,' Moyfa declared. Asked whether Secretary-General António Guterres has any reaction to the failure of the Gaza ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters November 20: 'I think it’s another example of the regrettable lack of consensus that we’ve seen in the Security Council between Member States and frankly, the lack of implementation of previous resolutions on Gaza'. For his part, the Secretary-General will continue in to support all efforts to see an end to the conflict in Gaza, to achieve the unconditional release of all hostages and to implement the two-state solution, he added. Dujarric also pointed out that the lack of unity among Member States, lack of unity among the Permanent Five 'makes our job that much more challenging.' Unity from the P5, unity from the Security Council as a whole, gives the Secretary-General clearer guidance on how to move on issues politically. 'I’m not going into analysing the motivation behind the various vetoes we’ve seen from the permanent members, but I think especially on humanitarian and political situations, unity is better for the brand. Let me put it that way', said Dujarric. Coincidentally, the 193-member General Assembly is currently debating the uses and abuses of veto powers by the P5. Ambassador Gianluca Greco of Italy told delegates November 20 the veto power is 'the problem'. While understandable in the specific historical context of 1945, nowadays it blatantly contradicts one of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter: that of sovereign equality of States, he said. In too many occasions, he pointed out, it has prevented the Security Council from discharging its vital responsibilities with regard to situations endangering international peace and security, in which the UN could have made a real difference on the ground. 'Which is why Italy has consistently advocated for a Security Council reform that does not exacerbate further the functional malaises of the Council by adding new permanent members with veto powers', he declared. Speaking on behalf of Germany, Michael Geisler, Political Coordinator, told delegates limiting both the scope and actual use of the veto is essential for creating a more inclusive, transparent, and responsive Security Council. 'Germany strongly advocates for restraint in the exercise of the veto, particularly in cases involving mass atrocities and war crimes, in order to prioritize the protection of civilians in conflict situations. We call upon all Member States to support the ACT Code of Conduct and the French-Mexican Initiative on veto restraint', he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtztOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-20T16:44:06-08:00	
Getting Ukraine To A Position Of Strength: A Strategy For The Tru...	By Luke Coffey Why Ukraine Matters to the United States Below are five reasons why Ukraine is important to US interests. 1. Protecting the US economy. North America and Europe account for nearly half of the world’s GDP. Two-thirds of foreign investment into the US comes from Europe, and 48 states export more to Europe than to China. This supports millions of American jobs. European stability, which Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine undermines, benefits the US economy and, by extension, the American worker. Aiding Ukraine helps preserve that stability. 2. Detering Chinese aggression. Russia is China’s junior partner. A weakened or defeated Russia means a weaker China. Beijing is watching how the West supports Ukraine. A strong and victorious Ukraine makes Taiwan appear stronger and deters Chinese aggression. 3. Succeeding in great power competition. Russia’s war against Ukraine is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. North Korea has provided 10,000 soldiers, millions of artillery shells, and hundreds of missiles to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meanwhile, Iran provides Russia with drones and ballistic missiles in exchange for fighter jets and other advanced capabilities. China’s technical, economic, and diplomatic support for Russia enables all this as part of Beijing’s strategy to undermine the US. 4. Preparing the US military enterprise for twenty-first-century warfare. Support for Ukraine has exposed major shortcomings in the US defense industrial base that can now be fixed. The war has also tested American-made military hardware in a way not possible in peacetime—with no American casualties. The US is learning what works, what does not work, and how systems evolve in combat. And as Ukraine receives US weapons, America replaces its own weapons stocks with newer, more effective systems. 5. Demonstrating strength. A successful Ukraine demonstrates American strength. However, acquiescing to Putin and abandoning partners shows the world American weakness. Even forcing Ukraine into a deal that lopsidedly benefits Russia would embolden US adversaries and cause America’s allies to hedge toward other security arrangements. What President Trump Needs to Do President-elect Donald Trump is sincere in his desire to end the war, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emphasized that he wants a 'fair' end to the war. But the end needs to be just and honorable. The incoming Trump administration needs to change course from the Biden administration’s approach so Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. Below are seven steps to do so. 1. Take meaningful steps to close sanctions loopholes. Russia diverts much of its trade through a network of partners to skirt Western sanctions. The US and its allies need to crack down on sanctions evasion to truly cripple the Russian economy. 2. Encourage European partners to establish an air defense mission in Poland and Romania. Russian missiles and drones routinely violate NATO airspace. Alliance members should use Polish and Romanian territory to intercept missiles or drones headed toward a NATO member, even in western Ukrainian airspace. This is a reasonable act of self-defense with a low risk of escalation because neither US nor NATO forces will be in direct confrontation with Russian troops. The mission would protect major Ukrainian population centers such as Lviv, allowing Kyiv to reposition scarce air defense systems closer to the front line. 3. Promote a pro-America energy policy. Congress and the executive branch should revoke all restrictions on liquefied natural gas exports. President Trump’s policies to unshackle US oil and gas production and his administration’s relationships with Gulf states could give the president powerful leverage on global energy prices. This would weaken one of Russia’s remaining economic lifelines. 4. Develop a strategy to boost Ukraine’s defense sector and integrate it with America’s. Ukraine’s defense sector has a highly skilled, innovative, and educated workforce. Before Russia’s 2014 invasion, Ukraine was among the top 10 global defense exporters. Even as it fights, Ukraine has debuted groundbreaking weapons systems, especially in the unmanned category. Bolstering Ukraine’s domestic defense industry is one of the best long-term guarantees of the country’s security. 5. Think boldly and creatively about weapons. The next administration should break President Joe Biden’s predictable cycle and show strength in the weapons it sends to Ukraine. So it should continue providing Kyiv with more of the weapons it has already used successfully, and consider arming Ukraine with longer-range weapons such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile Block III and Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER). 6. Remove all restrictions on the use of American-provided weapons and encourage European partners to do the same. By adhering to Russia’s dubious red lines, Washington allows Moscow to dictate the conflict’s terms. If the Kremlin’s forces strike Ukraine from Russian territory, the US should show strength and allow Kyiv to use any weapons system against any legitimate military target, even those inside Russia. 7. Urge Congress to (a) pass another Ukraine supplemental during the lame-duck session and (b) legislate for the seizure of frozen Russian assets to be used for Ukraine aid. Both actions would strengthen President Trump’s hand when he takes office in January.

Belarus: Lukashenko Pardons 32 More Political Prisoners Of Estima...	(RFE/RL) -- Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, has pardoned an additional 32 political prisoners, according to reports from the pro-government Pul Pervogo Telegram channel, although an estimated 1,300 opposition activists remain behind bars in the country. The identities of those pardoned were not disclosed, but the report said they had all been convicted of extremism, a charge widely used against political activists. The report further identified the pardoned individuals as 24 men and eight women, with nine of them above the age of 50. The pardons released the individuals from serving their full sentences but did not remove their criminal records. Their behavior will continue to be monitored by the Interior Ministry after their release, the report said. This marks the sixth instance of political prisoner pardons in Belarus this year, bringing the total number of individuals set free to 178. Earlier this month, 31 political prisoners were pardoned. In July, the government pardoned 18 people, including Ryhor Kastusyou, the former leader of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party who had been serving a 10-year sentence and is reportedly in poor health. Additional pardons followed in August (30 individuals), early September (30), and mid-September (37). In mid-November, prominent opposition figure Maryya Kalesnikava, who is serving an 11-year sentence on charges of conspiring to seize power, met with her father for the first time in 21 months. A month earlier, Lukashenka had suggested he might consider pardoning Kalesnikava if she submitted a formal request. However, it remains unclear whether she has accepted the offer. Kalesnikava has previously refused to request a pardon, maintaining her innocence and rejecting the legitimacy of the charges against her. The latest pardons come in the context of a harsh crackdown on dissent following the mass protests in Belarus in 2020, sparked by contested presidential election results. Lukashenka responded to the demonstrations with widespread repression, forcing at least 13,000 people into exile. According to human rights organizations, approximately 1,300 political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails, including politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, and civic activists. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for January 2025, with Lukashenka widely expected to be declared the winner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqRCDuDRJ0Mw	2024-11-20T16:34:03-08:00	
HRW: Proposed US Landmine Transfers Gravely Threaten Civilians	The Biden administration’s decision to transfer internationally banned antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine risks civilian lives and rejects the most successful humanitarian disarmament treaty of the past 25 years, Human Rights Watch said today. On November 19, 2024, the Washington Post reported that US President Joe Biden had authorized providing antipersonnel mines to Ukraine, which US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on November 20. 'They’ve [Ukraine] asked for these, and so I think it’s a good idea,' Austin told the New York Times. 'President Biden’s decision to transfer antipersonnel landmines risks civilian lives and sets back international efforts to eradicate these indiscriminate weapons,' said Mary Wareham, deputy crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. 'The US should reverse this reprehensible decision, which only increases the risk of civilian suffering in the short and long term.' A majority of the world’s countries rejected antipersonnel landmines decades ago due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term human suffering that they cause, Human Rights Watch said. Antipersonnel mines are designed to explode in response to a person’s presence, proximity, or contact. They are typically placed by hand, but they can also be scattered by aircraft, rockets, and artillery or dispersed from specialized vehicles. Antipersonnel mines cannot distinguish between soldiers and civilians, making them unlawfully indiscriminate under international humanitarian law. Uncleared landmines pose a danger until cleared and destroyed. Mined land can drive displacement of the civilian population, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities. Civilians made up 84 percent of all recorded landmine casualties in 2023, while children were 37 percent of casualties when the age was recorded. The United States has not used antipersonnel mines since 1991, has not exported them since 1992, has not produced them since 1997, and had no plans for future procurement. Over the past 30 years, the US has destroyed antipersonnel mines from its stockpile and has spent more than $1 billion on the development and production of systems that could be considered alternatives to antipersonnel mines. On June 21, 2022, President Biden announced a policy committing the US not to use antipersonnel mines anywhere in the world, except on the Korean Peninsula, and set the goal of ultimately joining the Mine Ban Treaty. Under that policy, the US committed to destroy antipersonnel mine stockpiles that are 'not required for the defense of the Korean Peninsula.' It promised that it would not develop, produce, or acquire antipersonnel mines. The policy explicitly requires the US 'not [to] assist, encourage, or induce anyone, outside the context of the Korean Peninsula, to engage in activity that would be prohibited' by the Mine Ban Treaty. In September 1994, the US became the first country to call for the 'eventual elimination' of antipersonnel landmines and participated in the 1996-1997 Ottawa Process that created the Mine Ban Treaty. The US did not adopt or sign the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Clinton administration set the goal for the US to join the treaty in 2006. The George W. Bush administration reversed that objective in 2004. In 2014, the Barack Obama administration issued a US landmine policy banning the production and acquisition of antipersonnel mines, as well as halting their use by US forces anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. In January 2020, then-president and current President-elect Donald Trump canceled a policy that would have eliminated all antipersonnel mines in the US stockpile. The existing US stockpile of antipersonnel mines is expected to expire—meaning that the mines will become unusable—by the early 2030s, in part because their 36-year shelf-life decreases over time as batteries embedded inside the mines deteriorate with age. The 2014 policy precluded the US from extending or modifying the life of the batteries in its stockpiled antipersonnel mines. The 2022 policy was understood to continue that practice. The Mine Ban Treaty entered into force on March 1, 1999; it comprehensively bans antipersonnel mines and requires destruction of stocks, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims. A total of 164 countries have joined the treaty, including all NATO member states, except the US; all European Union member states; and US allies such as Australia, Japan, and Ukraine. Ukraine ratified the Mine Ban Treaty on December 27, 2005, while Russia has not joined it. The US transfer decision comes days before the Fifth Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, to be held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from November 25-29. The US and Ukraine have registered to attend the event, also known as the Siem Reap Summit on a Mine-Free World. Russia has used antipersonnel landmines widely in Ukraine since its full-scale invasion of the country on February 24, 2022, causing hundreds of casualties and contaminating vast tracts of agricultural land. Russia has also created an unprecedented situation in which a country that is not party to the Mine Ban Treaty is using the weapon on the territory of a treaty party. Human Rights Watch has also documented Ukrainian use of antipersonnel mines in violation of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium, Kharkivska province, in 2022, when the city was under Russian control. Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating reports that forces used rocket-fired antipersonnel mines. By accepting and using antipersonnel mines, Ukraine risks further violating the Mine Ban Treaty, Human Rights Watch said. Under article 20 of the Mine Ban Treaty, a state party engaging in armed conflict is not allowed to withdraw from the treaty before the end of the armed conflict. The treaty is also not subject to reservations. 'Russian forces have repeatedly used antipersonnel mines and committed atrocities against civilians across Ukraine in violation of the laws of war, but this doesn’t justify transferring and using prohibited weapons,' Wareham said. 'Abiding by international protections for civilians means working to ensure that antipersonnel mines are never used again.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuLb8p71SqDX	2024-11-20T16:30:25-08:00	
As Chinese Buyers Snap Up Chiang Mai Properties, Thais Fear For F...	By Wittayakorn Boonruang Visitors who walk through a new housing development in Hang Dong, a district of Chiang Mai, might think they’ve stumbled into a slice of China because Chinese letters dominate storefront signs. This isn’t isolated to Hang Dong. Across Chiang Mai, Thailand’s northern cultural capital, Chinese investment is rapidly reshaping entire neighborhoods – and raising alarm about the city’s future identity and economic independence. 'If Chinese investors seriously enter the dormitory business and buy up properties to rent at higher prices exclusively to Chinese tenants, people living paycheck to paycheck who rent cheap accommodations will definitely struggle,' Naret Puntasrivichai, 43, who runs a monthly apartment rental business in Hang Dong, told BenarNews. His concerns aren’t unfounded. Over the past decade, buyers from mainland China have snapped up more than 1,000 housing units in Chiang Mai, with investments totaling between 3 billion and 5 billion baht (U.S. $86.1 million and $143.5 million), according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association. These properties, with pricetags starting at 3 million baht ($86,133) per unit, have spread across Chiang Mai’s three major districts – Hang Dong, San Kamphaeng and San Sai. In Hang Dong district alone, one Chinese-backed project spent 350 million baht ($10 million) on only four acres of land – a level of investment that dwarfs local developers’ capabilities, Prachachat Business, a local newspaper, reported in early 2023. The Chiang Mai Provincial Office reported that the city has a population of about 1.62 million Thai nationals, 7,190 Chinese and about 150,000 people from other nationalities. In addition to the 7,190 residents, many other Chinese take advantage of tourist visas allowing them to stay in Thailand for up to 60 days per visit. In Chiang Mai, it is common for Chinese nationals to use this route to reside and conduct business, according to authorities. In 2023, Chinese nationals were the largest group of tourists – about 200,000 – traveling to Chiang Mai. 'Chinese investors are transforming Chiang Mai from a tourist destination into their second home,' said Danaitun Pongpatcharatrontep who heads Chiang Mai University’s China Intelligence Center. 'They’re planning businesses in tourism and second-home construction, bringing their children to study here and establishing long-term residences for elderly Chinese. Investment comes both through pure Chinese companies and joint ventures with Thais,' he told BenarNews. Europeans, Americans and Middle Easterners dominated foreign property purchases in Thailand before the COVID-19 pandemic forced travel restrictions. Today, Chinese buyers outstrip not just other foreigners but even Thai nationals in the local property market, according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association 2024 report. Property prices in Chiang Mai can be several times lower than in China and budget airlines offer direct flights from major Chinese cities, cutting travel times to two to three hours. For China’s burgeoning middle class, Chiang Mai represents an affordable slice of paradise. In major cities Beijing and Shanghai, housing prices can average $6,800 to $8,400 per square meter, meaning a 1,200 square-foot (110 square-meter) home could cost $740,000 or more – compared to $80,000 to $180,000 in Chiang Mai. A 2023 survey by private education company New Oriental found many Chinese families choose Thailand to educate their children, where tuition and cost of living are lower than in Singapore and Japan. Local losses Thai law restricts foreign condominium ownership to 49% of total units and bars foreigners from owning land or houses. Yet Chinese investors have found creative ways around these restrictions, often using Thai nominees to hold their businesses. 'These practices not only circumvent the law but could affect the country’s economic system and security in the long term,' said Naret, who rents apartments in Hang Dong. 'Chinese investors often operate through informal channels, avoiding official registration while maintaining significant control over properties.' Local real estate professionals have experienced the change, according to agent Hathairat Polnirun, 38. 'The Chinese real estate system differs greatly from Thailand’s,' she told BenarNews. 'In Thailand, sellers pay commissions of 3% to 5%, while in the Chinese system, buyers pay 10% or more, making it impossible for Thai agents to compete when selling to Chinese clients.' This occurs when buyers, sellers and brokers negotiate additional terms beyond those stipulated by law, she said. 'Recently, Chinese operators have begun establishing their own real estate companies directly, though often using Thai names as cover,' Hathairat said. 'If large Chinese real estate companies with substantial capital enter this market, small agencies – both Thai and Chinese – won’t survive.' In September, a small survey by a local think-tank, The Glocal, reported on concerns among a group of Thai residents. Of the 30 respondents between the ages of 19 and 62, 60% said Chinese investment significantly impacted local businesses. The real estate sector topped concerns at 40%, followed by tourism (20%) and retail (16.7%). Notably, 17 supported increased regulation of Chinese investment. In neighborhoods with high Chinese concentration, cultural friction is becoming more apparent. 'Their behavior creates discomfort for Chiang Mai and Thai people, who have a culture of politeness, humility, and mutual respect,' Naret said, citing issues from loud conversations to traffic law violations to disregard for customs. Stricter control A legal analyst has advocated for comprehensive oversight. Tossapon Tassanapan, an associated professor at Chiang Mai University’s Faculty of Law, called for a thorough investigation of business practices. 'We must examine all aspects, from entry permits to financial transactions,' he said. 'While general laws don’t specifically target Chinese investment, as we must treat all foreigners equally, we need to investigate whether their activities fall into gray areas, whether officials are complicit and whether there are connections to money laundering or other criminal activities.' The solution, Tossapon said, involves rigorous enforcement of existing laws. 'We need to check everything – from tourist visas being used for business purposes to tax payments and financial trails. If these businesses can operate, it likely indicates either official complicity or negligence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzjz6UQInD2wU	2024-11-20T16:24:54-08:00	
What The Arakan Army’s Rise Means For The Rohingya – Analysis	By Dr. Azeem Ibrahim The Arakan Army is emerging as the dominant force in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, a dramatic shift that could redefine the region’s political landscape. Over the past year, this group has not only entrenched itself militarily, but it has also sought to carve out a role as a governing authority. This transformation, while significant, brings both opportunities and challenges for Rakhine’s people, including the long-persecuted Rohingya minority. The Arakan Army’s military achievements are striking. By mid-October, it had established control over an estimated two-thirds of Rakhine State, including critical areas such as the state capital Sittwe, the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone and the Myanmar military’s strategically important Western Command base. This consolidation is underpinned by the creation of nine military zones across the state and the deployment of thousands of troops in allied territories. This rise from obscurity is remarkable. Founded in 2009 with just 26 members, the Arakan Army now fields a force of about 40,000 troops. Its rapid growth reflects both its military prowess and its ability to position itself as a credible alternative to Myanmar’s junta. Yet, despite its successes on the battlefield, it faces significant governance challenges. The International Crisis Group notes that, while the Arakan Army has established de facto control over much of Rakhine, it lacks the capacity to address the state’s fundamental socioeconomic needs. The coming years will test whether it can translate its military dominance into effective governance. The Arakan Army has already taken steps toward governance. Even before the 2021 coup, it managed administrative and judiciary services in parts of Rakhine. Since gaining more territory, it has sought to establish legitimacy by engaging with diverse communities. For instance, it invited Rohingya representatives into its governance mechanisms and played a leading role in post-Cyclone Mocha recovery efforts in May 2023. These moves are critical for a state as fragmented as Rakhine, where ethnic and communal divisions run deep. By fostering inclusion, the Arakan Army has an opportunity to unify Rakhine’s communities and build a foundation for sustainable governance. However, its track record is mixed. In April and May, during the final stages of its offensive against junta forces, the group committed atrocities against civilians, including the shelling, looting and burning of Rohingya neighborhoods in Buthidaung Township. These actions, which forced thousands to flee, underscore the tension between its aspirations and its actions on the ground. The rise of the Arakan Army also changes the calculus for the Rohingya, who have historically borne the brunt of Myanmar’s ethnic strife. Its inclusive overtures, such as engaging Rohingya representatives, are promising. However, these gestures must be accompanied by genuine efforts to protect Rohingya communities and ensure their rights. The group’s actions during the Buthidaung offensive highlight the precarious position of the Rohingya. While the Arakan Army may view the Rohingya as a potential constituency, its willingness to commit violence against them suggests that ethnic hierarchies and power struggles still dominate Rakhine’s politics. For the Rohingya, the group’s rise presents both risks and opportunities. On the one hand, its dominance could offer a respite from the systematic persecution they have faced under the junta. On the other hand, its ability to govern inclusively and protect minority rights remains unproven. As the Arakan Army transitions from a rebel force to a governing authority, it will face immense challenges. Rakhine is one of Myanmar’s poorest states, with high levels of poverty, displacement and ethnic tension. Addressing these issues requires more than military strength; it demands a commitment to inclusive governance, economic development and reconciliation. The group’s relationship with the Rohingya will be a litmus test for its governance. If it can protect Rohingya communities, integrate them into its governance structures and address their grievances, it could pave the way for a more stable and inclusive Rakhine. However, continued violence and exclusion will only deepen the state’s divisions. The international community has a role to play in shaping Rakhine’s future. Diplomatic engagement with the Arakan Army should prioritize the protection of minority rights and the establishment of inclusive governance. Humanitarian assistance should be directed toward addressing the state’s urgent socioeconomic needs, particularly in Rohingya communities. At the same time, accountability for human rights abuses must remain a priority. Its actions in Buthidaung demonstrate the risks of unchecked power. Holding all actors accountable, including the Arakan Army, is essential for building a foundation of trust and justice in Rakhine. The group’s rise marks a new chapter in Rakhine’s troubled history. Its military dominance offers an opportunity to break free from decades of junta rule, but its ability to govern inclusively and address the state’s deep-seated challenges remains uncertain. For the Rohingya, its ascent is a double-edged sword, offering hope for change but also exposing them to new risks. The road ahead for the Arakan Army and Rakhine is fraught with challenges. Success will depend on the group’s willingness to transcend its origins as a rebel force and embrace its responsibilities as a governing authority. For the sake of Rakhine’s diverse communities, including the Rohingya, this transition cannot come soon enough.

Indo-Pacific Commander Gives Unvarnished View Of Situation In Reg...	By Jim Garamone Any discussion of the Indo-Pacific region must start with China as a rising global power, and Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo gave a snapshot of what military competition with China would look like for the United States. Paparo, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, spoke to Michael O'Hanlon and Lynn Kuok at the Brookings Institution, yesterday. The admiral also answered questions about North Korea and India during the wide-ranging discussion at the Washington think tank. China is demonstrating and working on improving its power. This past summer, China held exercises that covered a large geographical area and one that demonstrated joint capabilities, and the admiral followed them closely. 'It was the 'jointest' operations for air, missile, maritime power that I'd seen over an entire career of being an observer,' Paparo said. On one day, he noted, the Chinese had 152 vessels at sea, including three quarters of their amphibious force. He said the People's Republic of China exercised 43 amphibious brigades to include rehearsal in breaching obstacles and military operations in urban terrain. 'We saw also two demonstrations of military power in response to the Taiwan inauguration on May 20, and then, once again, on 1010 [October 10th] — Taiwan National Day, as it's so called,' he said. 'This was the largest rehearsal we've seen,' he said. It demonstrated the upward trajectory of PLA modernization. The Chinese military also exercised with Russian air and maritime forces this summer in the Bering Sea. That exercise included ships and long-range aviation, he said. China is not the only competitor in the region, and Paparo specifically talked about the threat North Korea poses to the region and beyond. He pointed to the recent test of its largest ballistic missile this past week. That missile 'reached an apogee of over 7,000 kilometers, portending a capability that will have the ability to range the entire continental United States,' he said. He added that the North Koreans have not demonstrated the capability of weaponizing the missile 'but we just see continued testing towards that.' But China is the main competitor in the region and Paparo was grilled on Chinese capabilities and intentions. He was specifically asked about the Chinese initiative to build a military that can challenge the United States by the centennial of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027. 'The closer we get to 2027 the less relevant the date becomes,' he said. He does not see that as the date the Chinese would invade Taiwan. 'I think it is a worthy benchmark to say, we had better pay close attention to this,' the admiral said. Paparo has the responsibility under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to be ready for any change to the status quo. 'I am responsible for being ready every single day,' he said. The United States has worldwide commitments and there are competing requirements for resources and systems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel are depleting stocks the Indo-Pacific might need, Paparo said. He said that until this year the effect on his command by the delivery of systems to Ukraine and Israel was negligible. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into stocks, … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he said. These high-end stocks are crucial in the Indo-Pacific, he said. 'It imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' Paparo said. Paparo also addressed the growing U.S. military partnership with India. The two countries are cooperating across a range of areas including undersea domain awareness, joint production and more. 'We see this security partnership growing year by year,' he said. 'India cherishes its history in the non-aligned movement. So those who aspire to an alliance with India, I think, don't hold your breath. We're not holding our breath either.' But that does not temper U.S. moves to a deeper partnership and deeper friendship with India. China also competes with India. 'There have been flash points of tension at sea and along its border, and those are opportunities for our cooperation as well,' the admiral said. India has ties with Russia, who supplied much of the weapons systems India used since the 1960s. 'I believe that those partnerships will likely fade over time as the partnership between the United States and India grows, but we cannot be complacent about it,' he said. 'But we have many, many mutual interests, and we've got to — both of us — keep our foot on the accelerator.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzvjtOoivvswD	2024-11-20T16:18:08-08:00	
Austin Announces Additional Security Assistance For Ukraine	By Joseph Clark The U.S. is sending a new round of military assistance, valued at up to $275 million to Ukraine, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said today. The package includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, mortar and artillery rounds and unmanned aerial systems to meet critical battlefield needs as Russia's war of aggression surpasses 1,000 days. In previewing the White House announcement of the latest round of assistance, Austin underscored the importance of continuing to support Ukraine. 'What we learned early on is that Ukraine matters and not just to Ukraine, and not just to Europe,' Austin said. 'It matters to the world. 'We shouldn't have any situation where someone can wake up one day and attack its neighbor and change the borders and annex its neighbor's property,' he said. 'That is just not the world that any of us want to live in.' The secretary added that the U.S.-led efforts to rally global allies and partners in support of Ukraine continue to be effective in countering Russia's onslaught. 'The largest military in Europe invaded its neighbor, who had a much smaller inventory, much less capability, and 1,000 days later they've yet to be successful,' he said. 'This war has gone on for 1,000 days and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has failed in every case to achieve any sort of strategic objective.' The latest round of assistance marks the 70th drawdown of military equipment for Ukraine from DOD inventories since August 2021. It follows President Joe Biden's commitment in September to surge the more than $5 billion in remaining presidential drawdown authority funds authorized by Congress. The assistance also comes with new urgency as Russia leans on thousands of North Korean troops to fill out its ranks. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier this week that nearly 11,000 North Korean troops have moved into Russia's Kursk Region. She said the Pentagon had not confirmed reports that the North Koreans had begun to engage in combat operations but said, 'They're moving into Kursk for a reason.' 'We have every expectation that they would be engaged in combat operations,' Singh said. Austin announced a new round of assistance from Vientiane, Laos, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member bloc of Southeast Asian nations. During the two-day series of engagements, Austin will meet with a range of regional allies and partners informally during the meeting and reaffirm the United States' commitment to regional security. Following the first round of discussions today, Austin announced that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. Tomorrow, Austin is expected to announce the first-ever Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. 'It's great to be back at the ADMM-Plus for my fourth time as secretary,' he said. 'Being here is a priority and a sign of strong support for ASEAN's central role in regional security. Engagement with ASEAN is focused on practical cooperation and mutual respect, and that includes training the next generation of leaders and tackling emerging challenges and deepening maritime cooperation.' Austin proposed a meeting with People's Republic of China's Minister of National Defense Dong Jun, who's also a member of ADMM-Plus. The secretary has continued to advocate for open lines of military-to-military communication between the U.S. and China but said today that his Chinese counterpart chose not to meet during this week's forum. 'The PRC decision is a setback for the whole region,' he said. 'As I've said consistently, the right time to meet is any time.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzumYJY-jPWxA	2024-11-20T16:13:29-08:00	
US Vetoes UN Resolution Calling For Ceasefire In Gaza And Release...	By Ephrem Kossaify The US on Wednesday used the power of veto it holds as one of the five permanent member of the UN Security Council to block a resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire' in Gaza and 'the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The resolution was put forward by the 10 elected, non-permanent members of the council. The US was the only one of the 15 members not to vote in favor of it. The text of the resolution also called for the 'safe and unhindered entry of humanitarian assistance at scale' to Gaza, including besieged areas in the north of the territory, and denounced any attempt to deliberately starve the population there. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October last year, and the UN says that in excess of 70 percent of the verified deaths were among women and children. More than 130,000 people have been injured. The UN believes these figures to be an underestimate, given that scores of bodies are thought to be buried under the rubble of destroyed or damaged buildings. The war has also displaced almost the entire population of the enclave, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe. On Monday, the UN’s Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices presented a report to the General Assembly in which it said the methods of warfare employed by Israel in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a weapon, the mass civilian casualties and the life-threatening conditions deliberately inflicted on Palestinians, are consistent with the characteristics of genocide. After the Security Council failed to adopt the resolution on Wednesday, Majed Bamya, the Palestinian deputy ambassador to the UN, told its members that they were witnessing an attempt 'to annihilate a nation' and yet the 'very tools designed to respond (to this are) not being used.' He added: 'Maybe for some we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin color, but we are humans and we should be treated as such. 'Is there a UN Charter for Israel that is different from the charter you all have? Is there an international law for them? An international law for us? Do they have the right to kill and the only right we have is to die? 'What more can (Israel) do for this council to act under Chapter 7? Or will this council be the last place on earth that cannot recognize a threat to peace when they see it?' Chapter 7 of the UN Charter relates to action that can be taken by member states in response to threats to peace and acts of aggression. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told council members: 'Today, a shameful attempt to abandon our kidnapped men and women by the UN was prevented. Thanks to the US, we stood firm with our position that there will be no ceasefire without the release of the hostages. We will continue in this struggle until everyone returns home.' Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador, said that an unconditional ceasefire would mean acceptance by the Security Council of Hamas remaining in power in Gaza. 'The United States will never accept this,' he added. 'Rather than adopting a resolution that emboldens Hamas, let’s instead demand Hamas implement Resolution 2735 without further condition or delay. 'Let’s continue to ensure Israel facilitates additional humanitarian aid into Gaza, and let's work to bring a durable end to the suffering and misery of Hamas’ many victims.' Security Council Resolution 2735, which was adopted in June, calls on Hamas to accept a proposed hostage and ceasefire agreement with Israel. British envoy Barbara Woodward, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the council this month, expressed regret over the failure of the council to adopt the resolution but vowed to 'keep striving, alongside our partners, to bring this war to a close.' She said: 'The deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic and unacceptable. All of Gaza is at risk of famine, and in some areas this is likely to be imminent. Yet the aid reaching civilians remains entirely insufficient to mitigate this unfolding disaster. 'The unthinkable hardship that civilians are already facing in Gaza is set to get even worse as winter approaches.' Woodward urged Israeli authorities to take 'urgent action to alleviate this crisis. International humanitarian law must be respected by all sides.' China’s ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, said that even with the imminent threat of famine in Gaza, 'the United States always seems to be able to find a justification to defend Israel.' It is a stance that represents a distortion of international humanitarian law, he added. 'People keep learning something new they never knew before was possible, and how low one can stoop. No wonder people feel angry,' said Fu. 'People’s indignation also stems from the fact that the continued supply of weapons from the US (to Israel) has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long, causing so many casualties and so much destruction.' He added: 'All hostages must be released. An immediate and unconditional ceasefire must be established. Both are important factors. There should be no conditionality. They cannot be linked to each other because facts have shown that Israel’s military operations in Gaza have long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages. 'Insistence on setting a precondition for ceasefire is tantamount to giving the green light to continuing the war and condoning the continued killing.' The Algerian ambassador, Amar Bendjama, told the council after the vote: 'Today’s message is clear. 'To the Israeli occupying power: You may continue your genocide and collective punishment of the Palestinian people with complete impunity. In this chamber, you enjoy immunity. 'To the Palestinian people: While the majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.' Nicolas de Riviere, France’s permanent representative to the UN, lamented the latest failure by the council to help bring an end to the war. 'France voted in favor of this resolution and deeply regrets that the (Security Council) remains unable to speak with one voice on the situation in the Middle East.' The Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, directly addressed his US counterpart and accused him of being responsible for the deaths 'of tens of thousands of innocent civilians (and) the suffering of hostages and illegally detained Palestinians.' He added: 'It was very interesting to hear the American representative today, in the wake of the vote, say that the resolution does not contain provisions on the release of hostages. Well, it does contain such a provision. Perhaps the US representative should read through the resolution before voting against it.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-20T16:07:21-08:00	
Jimmy Lai Takes The Stand In Yearslong Hong Kong National Securit...	By Daniel Payne Catholic human rights activist Jimmy Lai on Wednesday took the stand in his national security trial in Hong Kong, arguing in his own defense as he faces life in prison over allegations of sedition against the communist Chinese government. Lai, 76, was first arrested in August 2020 under China’s newly instituted Hong Kong national security law. He has faced multiple trials since his arrest and has been convicted on multiple charges of unlawful assembly and fraud. Advocates have argued that the charges are politically motivated. Lai, through several media enterprises including the long-running Apple Daily newspaper, has for years been a vocal pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong media, with Apple Daily itself encouraging citizens to participate in numerous pro-democracy demonstrations over the years. Chinese Communist Party officials, meanwhile, allege that Lai has engaged in what they claim is seditious activism, in part by allegedly advocating for Hong Kong’s independence from mainland China. At his trial on Wednesday, Lai denied allegations of sedition. 'All I was doing was carrying a torch to the reality,' he told the court of his publishing activities. 'The more information you have, the more you’re in the know, the more you are free,' he said. The publisher also denied that he had ordered the Apple Daily to continue as usual after his arrest. 'I had written to them, asking them not to take risks,' he said. The activist further disputed that he had colluded with the U.S. government in 2019 when meeting with then-Vice President Mike Pence. 'I would not dare to ask the vice president to do anything,' he said. 'I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me.' Wednesday’s trial comes after the Tuesday sentencing of 45 other Hong Kong democracy activists, all of whom received stretches of up to 10 years in prison under the national security law. Lai is a Catholic. He converted to Catholicism in 1997 and was received into the Church by Cardinal Joseph Zen. The cardinal was present at the trial on Wednesday, sitting with Lai’s family members, according to the Associated Press. His yearslong imprisonment has drawn international rebuke, including from supporters in the United States. Last December the Congressional Executive Commission on China urged the U.S. government to sanction Hong Kong prosecutors and judges if they fail to release Lai. The trial 'is a political prosecution plain and simple and another sad example of the Hong Kong government’s increasingly repressive policies,' the commission said. Father Robert Sirico, a Catholic priest and founder of the Michigan-based Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, told CNA in December 2023 that he '[doesn’t] have any hope' that the Chinese Communist Party will let Lai walk free. 'I want to be hopeful. I love the man,' Sirico said. 'I have a deep respect for him. I’m inspired by his bravery. But I know what he’s up against.' More recently, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in a report that the Chinese government should 'release Mr. Lai immediately.' The working group said the government should mount a 'full and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Lai and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of his rights.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-20T16:03:27-08:00	
Russia Says Ukraine Used ATACMS Against Military Target In Bryans...	By Merhat Sharipzhan (RFE/RL) -- The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on November 19 that Ukraine used six U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles in its attack on the Bryansk region overnight, claiming Russian forces managed to shoot down five of the missiles and damage one. According to the ministry, fragments from the damaged ATACMS fell on a military target, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. The ministry also said there were no casualties. Hours earlier, the Russian RBK news agency quoted an informed source within Ukraine's military as saying Kyiv had used ATACMS missiles for the first time, targeting an object in the city of Karachev in Russia's southwestern Bryansk region, successfully damaging the facility. The timing of this operation, coinciding with the 1,000th day of Russia's invasion, carries symbolic weight. By demonstrating its capacity to retaliate with precision and range, observers believe Ukraine seeks to shift the strategic calculus of the war, showing Russian territory is not immune from direct attacks. The same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an updated nuclear doctrine. This revision allows for the consideration of nuclear weapons use if Russia faces a conventional missile assault supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine now includes attacks with conventional missiles, drones, or other aircraft as potential triggers for a nuclear response. Additionally, any aggression against Russia by a state allied with a nuclear power will be viewed as aggression by the entire coalition. Ukrainians awoke on November 19 to news of yet another deadly Russian drone strike on a residential building. Ukrainian authorities said that six people were killed, including one child, in the early morning attack that hit a five-story building in the city of Hlukhiv, in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region. Twelve people were injured, two of them children, and one section of the building collapsed. Rescue workers were on the scene and officials expressed fears that the casualty count could rise. Just two days earlier, Russian forces targeted an apartment building in the regional capital, Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring more than 50. The Sumy region, which borders Russia, has been a frequent target of artillery and drone strikes, with attacks intensifying in recent months. Local authorities in Sumy have ordered the evacuation of 23 towns and villages, affecting around 6,000 people, as the region remains under near-constant threat. Russia's Defense Ministry continues to claim that it targets only military facilities, yet reports from Ukrainian officials and independent media document widespread civilian casualties and destruction of nonmilitary infrastructure. Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, has evolved into a prolonged conflict with significant losses on both sides. For Ukraine, the war has meant widespread destruction, over 20,000 civilian deaths according to international estimates, and millions displaced. For Russia, the conflict has brought economic isolation, military losses, and growing internal dissent. The use of ATACMS by Ukraine would reflect both the maturation of its military strategy and the increasing support from Western allies, who have progressively provided more advanced weaponry to counter Russian aggression. However, it also raises questions about the potential for further escalation, as attacks on Russian soil may provoke a harsher response from Moscow.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8loRK3rhV9T	2024-11-19T08:15:12-08:00	
Europe’s Five Big Powers Commit To Ukraine Regardless Of US Polic...	By Claudia Ciobanu Foreign ministers of the five biggest powers in Europe together with the incoming top EU diplomat and host Poland held talks in Warsaw on Tuesday to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression. 'We were in agreement that imposing on Ukraine peace recipes contrary to its interests or unacceptable socially would have a negative impact on the stability of the country,' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said after the meeting of Weimar Triangle foreign ministers (Germany, France and Poland) plus Italy, Spain and the UK. 'Any scenarios for finishing the war and putting an end to Russian aggression must be worked out in close cooperation with the Ukrainian government,' Sikorski added. The meeting was called to allay fears that Ukraine would be sidelined once the newly elected US president Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has repeatedly talked about bringing peace 'in 24 hours' by imposing a solution that would likely be heavily weighted towards Russia. Jitters were also caused by the decision of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to discuss the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a one-on-one call last week, the first since the full-scale invasion began. That call has been criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, among others. Sikorski was joined in Warsaw by the foreign ministers of Germany (Annalena Baerbock), France (Jean-Noel Barrot), Italy (Antonio Tajani) as well as Kaja Kallas, the future EU high representative for foreign affairs. The foreign ministers of Spain and the UK took part in the talks remotely. Explaining the reasons for organising the meeting, Sikorski said it was prompted by the weekend’s major attack on Ukraine, the largest since last year, as well as by the US presidential election. The meeting in Warsaw also served as an attempt by Poland to preserve its key role in European policymaking on Ukraine after apparently being snubbed last month by Berlin when it held talks on Ukraine with the US, UK and France but not Poland. It was also an opportunity for Sikorski to score a few domestic points ahead of his party’s primary election later this week to choose its presidential candidate for next year. German Foreign Minister Baerbock spoke about the importance of not 'having any breaks in securing the peace in Europe' in the context of uncertainties connected to the election of Trump as the next president of the US. EU countries, she said, 'must strengthen the European pillar of NATO' and 'invest significantly more than 2 per cent of GDP in defence'. She also warned against 'self-fulfilling prophecies', implying that it was too early to tell what a future US administration would do in relation to the war and US financial involvement in European defence. All the foreign ministers were careful to highlight the importance of cooperation with the US for ensuring peace in Europe, regardless of who holds the reins of power in Washington. 'It’s only by having strong transatlantic ties that we can counter the rising threats from Russia and other countries,' Sikorski said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnxnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-19T08:03:57-08:00	
Russia Broadens Conditions For Using Nuclear Weapons	As the war in Ukraine entered its 1,000th day Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine stating that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power is considered a joint attack and could trigger a nuclear response. The proclamation came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons from the U.S. to attack military targets in Russia. When Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if the revised doctrine was issued in response to the U.S. authorization, he said it was put forth 'in a timely manner' and that Putin wanted it updated to be 'in line with the current situation,' the Associated Press reported. The doctrine states nuclear weapons could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. It says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It doesn’t specify whether such an attack would definitely be met with a nuclear response. Peskov the aim of the updated policy was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. It also states that Russia could use nuclear weapons if another country attacks ally Belarus. 1,000 days of fighting Both Russia and Ukraine issued statements about the 1,000th day of the war, both vowing that they would continue fighting against each other. The Kremlin said Western support for Kyiv would have no impact on the military campaign. 'The military operation against Kyiv continues,' Peskov said, adding that Western aid 'cannot affect the outcome of our operation. It continues, and will be completed.' Ukraine, meanwhile, said it would continue to resist the Russian invasion. 'Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. Attack on Russian weapons depot There was no word if long-range U.S. weapons were used in Ukraine’s strike against a large weapons depot near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region more than 110 miles from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reported that Ukraine often uses domestically produced drones to hit targets deep inside Russia, and in an announcement on Tuesday, the military did not specify which weapons had been used for the strike. 'The destruction of ammunition depots will continue for the army of the Russian occupiers in order to stop the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian military said on the Telegram messaging app. An overnight Russian drone attack in the northeastern Sumy region killed eight people, including one child, Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. The attack on a residential building in the border town of Hlukhiv also wounded 12 people, including two children, Ukraine's national police force said on Telegram. Two high-rise buildings and a hospital were damaged, and more people could be in the rubble. Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday it shot down 51 out of 87 drones launched by Russia overnight. Tear gas detected near front line Also on Tuesday, Ukraine urged action after the international chemical weapons watchdog said banned CS riot control gas, also known as tear gas, had been found in Ukrainian soil samples from the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia has not reacted to the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which did not assign blame for the chemical. The Chemical Weapons Convention strictly bans the use of riot control agents including CS outside riot control situations when it is used as 'a method of warfare,' Agence France-Presse reported. CS gas causes irritation to the lungs, skin and eyes. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in the conflict, and Ukraine’s Western allies have claimed Moscow has employed banned weapons. 'Russia's use of banned chemicals on the battlefield once again demonstrates Russia's chronic disregard for international law,' a statement from Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. OPCW stressed however that the report did 'not seek to identify the source or origin of the toxic chemical.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8YXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-19T08:00:11-08:00

With HPC6, Eni strengthens its leadership in high-performance computing for industrial applications and reaffirms its position as a technology-driven company supporting the energy transition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn3sTEUSXbVxo	2024-11-19T07:52:56-08:00	
United States: Fighting To The Last Ukrainian – OpEd	When Joe Biden leaves office, he will leave as the president with a record that places him amongst the most militaristic of American leaders with responsibility for inflicting suffering and bringing death to possibly the largest number of innocent civilian casualties in this modern era. This is as a result of the wars taking place during his watch in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere. This record will become worse if the bleak outcome of his latest foreign policy decision becomes reality. In what independent observers view as a further attempt by Biden to continue and escalate the war in Ukraine, the lame duck president has authorised Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia. In the US, the following response by Congress representative Marjorie Greene has received 2 million views on X and 47,000 likes 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of U.S. long range missiles into Russia. 'The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' -- Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024 This decision, allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMs) with their superior range of up to four times more than the current missiles supplied to Ukraine for attacks inside Russia, has been justified with the most flimsy of excuses. Quoting American officials reported to be ‘knowledgeable’ about the matter but obviously designated by the White House to provide justification propaganda, the major policy change is being pitched by western media to the world as a response to North Korean troops reported to be positioned along Ukraine’s northern border. The explanation rings hollow. Since the war began, Russia has not called upon or relied on any non-Russian troops to fight its war. At this late stage when victory appears to be in sight, Putin will want for it to enter into the history books as an exclusive and singlehanded Russian victory against the combined forces of the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and other allies of the West. It will be foolish and extremely unlikely for Putin to welcome any participation from Russia’s allies in the current battlefield and military endgame in Ukraine. As to the presence of North Koreans in Ukraine, it is possible that there is a small number of them at the frontline. However, South Korea, which has the best intelligence on North Korea, has not been able to confirm that North Korean troops are now engaged in combat as reported by some US and Ukraine officials. Explaining Biden's Last War Hurrah What explains Biden’s last hurrah in US foreign policy is not difficult to understand. Firstly, he is giving way to the late ditch effort by the military-industrial (MIC) and deep state complexes that are key players of US domestic and foreign policy to obstruct the incoming president, Donald Trump, in his plan to end the war. Such a move which Trump has promised to take place within 24 hours after his assumption of office, would obviously adversely impact the windfall profits that the war in Ukraine has generated for the MIC complex. Biden had earlier resisted pressure from Zelensky and Western supporters to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia for fear that this escalation could draw the US and NATO into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. His change of mind at this late hour can also be interpreted in other ways besides his finally giving in to the military and industrial forces working behind the political scene in Washington and Kyiv. Foremost appears to be his personal animosity towards Trump who he condemned in a recent election campaign rally as a threat to democracy and someone that needed to 'be locked up'. Related to that animosity may also be a quest for retaliation against his nemesis fuelled by Kamala Harris’s election loss which many Democrat leaders attribute to Biden’s late withdrawal from the presidential race. Failure by Trump as the new president to stop the war as promised would put Biden’s foreign policy legacy of support for Ukraine in a better light and make Trump the loser in the American history books which Biden is now focused on influencing and rewriting. Earlier in his youth, Biden had shown promise of being anti-war in his sentiment. Like earlier presidents - George W. Bush and Bill Clinton - he was successful in avoiding the draft. According to a report by the US Army Times newspaper which serves active, reserve, national guard and retired US army personne, and analysed the draft dodging strategies of various presidents: 'Biden not only received deferments for his undergraduate days at the University of Delaware, but for three years of law school at Syracuse University. When his education deferments expired in 1968, Biden requested a deferment based on the fact he had asthma as a teenager. He did this in spite of the fact that, according to his own book, he was a star athlete in high school and in college played intramural sports and was a lifeguard in the summer.' -- Dodging and deferring: Trump wasn’t the only POTUS to avoid the draft The report also noted that as soon as he received his asthma deferment, Biden ran for local office and within two years after he would have been discharged from the Army, assuming he was not wounded or killed, he was elected to the Senate. As an outgoing president, Biden clearly has embellished his war record with this latest variant of US foreign policy - that is, of fighting to the last Ukrainian. This recalibration of US foreign policy is also being applied to hotspots such as Gaza and Lebanon in the Middle East and Korea and Taiwan in Asia. Fighting to the last Palestinian, Korean or Taiwanese can be expected as the US continues with its efforts to maintain geo-political dominance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn1sgBTt-8yVC	2024-11-19T07:51:37-08:00	
Trump Kept World Peace, And He’ll Do it Again – OpEd	Amidst the challenges of increasing geopolitical conflicts worldwide, America requires a leader possessing determination, foresight, and a track record of rebuilding stability domestically and internationally. Donald Trump embodies these qualities. His prioritisation of interests through the 'America First' approach alongside a fresh new position on international affairs, most importantly his dovish mantra and rejecting warmongering tendencies, offer a roadmap for economic revitalization within the U.S. and fostering a safer world. Trump didn't just impact the US, he also made his mark on the stage by standing up to countries threatening global and regional stability while working towards peace agreements. Critics of Trump's 'America First' ideology wrongly interpret it as isolationism when, in reality, his focus was on prioritizing America's military interests without disregarding its allies' well-being.He revamped trade deals such as NAFTA (replaced by the USMCA) to enhance protection, for workers and industries while safeguarding intellectual property rights. America fought and won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and established the rules-based order that preserved global stability. This long peace comes with a cost, and all Trump wants is for others to pay their equal burden and fair share for world peace. Trump called on NATO partners to fulfill their defense spending promises so that America's allies also took part in safeguarding security. This action aimed to redistribute responsibilities by reducing the U.S.' heavy burden of NATO defense duties and decreasing its dependence on countries for assistance. Trump's strategies have clearly demonstrated that America's economic strength is pivotal for global well-being. His stances on taxes, commerce, and energy self-sufficiency provide a groundbreaking positive foundation for future positive changes. Trump's tax reductions for corporations prompted investments in manufacturing, and his energy strategies turned the United States into a powerhouse in the energy sector, resulting in job security for workers in energy-intensive sectors and potential economic stability worldwide. Trump's initiatives extended beyond tax reductions; they aim to undo years of offshoring practices and enhance infrastructure while securing energy self-sufficiency for the nation's benefit. Trump won the elections with a resounding and thumping voice of the American people's victory in a powerful message of truth and will. The red wave has retaken the Senate and put the House under Republican control, marking a new era of change for the country. Trump's popular vote gain, not seen since Bush Jr., also marks a new era of change. Democrats warned that Trump and the MAGA movement are hijacking democracy. Now, they must acknowledge the truth: the Trump movement, no matter how much it has been panned by many, is a powerful expression of democracy. The red wave and Donald J. Trump's victory marked the greatest political comeback in history, symbolizing the advent of the prospects of a new world peace and an end to global conflicts. He won more votes with key demographic groups than last time, including Hispanic Americans and younger voters, compared to Harris, who did poorer than Biden with women, urban voters, younger voters, and Hispanics. Sixty percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, further worsened by the soaring inflation. Trump is now seen as the champion of the working class. Why Trump Has Always Been the Clear Choice The economy was booming under the first Trump administration with his low tax and low regulations mantra, and a second Trump administration will see bigger tax cuts that will boost domestic production and create more high paying jobs. In his first four years, stock markets and 401(k) were high. Businesses were easier to form, and jobs were returning. Inflation was almost at its lowest, and the sense of economic optimism and unity from both sides of the aisle was at its highest.Trump saved tens of millions of lives worldwide with Operation Warp Speed, in getting the vaccines ready in record time. Trump helped America build its strongest economy in history. Median household incomes rose to their highest level ever in 2019, while the poverty rate hit an all-time low. Under the Trump Administration, more Americans were employed than ever before, numbered at 160 million, and the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans without a high-school diploma all hit record lows, while the Trump 'Blue-Collar Boom' saw wages grow faster for workers than for managers or supervisors. Trump signed the largest relief package in American history to protect workers and families from economic devastation during Covid. The American economy surged back to life within months, seeing record growth and job gains. Trump returned law and order to the American people, and would be tough on crime in the new term. He brought the abortion decision back to the states and overturned Roe v Wade, the first in more than five decades. The pro-life stance started a new opening to save the lives of the unborn. Energy independence was achieved, where reliance is no longer on oil-rich countries in the Middle East. Under his new term, America will soon be an energy dominant country, with common sense utilisation of the vast black gold under the feet of Americans and with the 'drill, baby drill' mantra. In Trump 2.0, the fundamental economic problem plaguing the country will be addressed, starting by cutting energy prices in half within his first year. The appointment of three Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of federal judges, that have been confirmed during Trump 1.0 further sealed his legacy. He also oversaw the greatest transformation in the criminal justice reform, a feat where even Obama failed to pass. Border security was among the best in a very long time, and the greatest tax cut since Reagan has enabled manufacturing jobs to return. The military has been rebuilt, and veterans' welfare and support capacity have been prioritized. The Space Force has been created, providing the US with new space dominance for decades to come. When Biden-Harris took over the leadership, the economy got worse. Trump was right when he predicted, way before the 2020 Elections, that if Biden-Harris were to get elected, energy prices and inflation would be through the roof. 65% of Americans cannot afford to own a home, and 800,000 Americans lost their jobs last year. Instead, 1.2 million non-citizens took those jobs. Energy prices and crime were also through the roof. More than ten thousand manufacturing jobs were lost last month alone, just before the elections. Businesses are leaving because of high taxes and high regulations, and with the tariff in place under Trump 2.0, they will be coming back to America, and new manufacturing bases will sprout in America. Under Trump, the stock market and the economy were better off than before Covid era when he left office. He also reviewed and withdrew from global memberships including Paris Climate Accords that are weakening America and putting it at a disadvantage, mostly in constraining America's economic potential through green and carbon obligations. In contrast, other countries are allowed to have bigger leeway. For years,America was seen to be ripped off by foreign powers. While their cars dominate the American market, other countries are not accepting American cars. Trump's tariff will protect American businesses, get other countries to stop their dumping and market distortion that have obliterated American workers' interests, encourage more companies to shift and start their operations in America, and give new tax cuts to American enterprises. Peace Through Strength and New Advent of Global Peace Trump's America First agenda has been panned by the Democrats and the world over, but it brought unconventional approaches and returns to both America and the world through relative peace and stability. The world is safe because of his peace through strength mantra, which deterred aggression and preserved the rules-based order. Under his watch, no major conflicts or wars happened, and he stopped war-mongering neocons. Biden-Harris' Afghanistan withdrawal with the loss of 13 American soldiers and 85 billion dollars of military equipment left behind led to the perception of America's weakness, with negative ripple effects. Despite the casting of Trump as weakening America's global standing via his treatment of allies and withdrawal from multilateralism and globalism, Trump fixed the cancerous plague that has held America back with smart and common sense foreign policy that has benefitted everyday Americans and rebuilding the military with Space Force, taking care of the veterans and regaining America's military strength. Trump never left a vacuum in global dominance, he strengthened the US position through military and economic rebuilding at home. Most importantly, he is not a typical politician who is part of the system that panders to the military-industrial complex, in which the warmongers and hawks have been having a field day enriching themselves from the various global conflicts. Trump is definitely different, and peace and saving lives have always been his priorities. This is evident even now when warmongers have been left out of his new administration, but the outgoing Biden administration continues to be fixated on global conflicts and just recently approved the first use of US-supplied long-range missiles for Ukraine for strikes inside Russia. While Trump intends to prevent WWIII, the current establishment seems not to want to give Trump an easy transition in terms of global peace and stability. They continue to take a conventional approach to dealing with foreign leaders and viewing conflicts through traditional, outdated lenses and archaic foreign policy trappings. Traditional diplomacy typically focuses on ideological alignment or gradual confidence-building measures and friendshoring efforts. Trump's method is more transactional and direct, with 'win-win' outcomes, a focus on transactional diplomacy, and his willingness to challenge traditional norms in U.S. foreign policy. Traditional U.S. peace efforts often emphasized security guarantees or political agreements, but Trump highlighted economic incentives as foundational to long-term peace. Hopes are highest that Trump will follow through on his quest to prevent WWIII, end the Ukraine war and the conflicts in Gaza and West Asia, prevent new conflicts in East Asia and prevent warmongering hawks from dominating defense and foreign policy, which will trap the world into another endless cycle of wars and conflicts. The choice for the 47th President of the United States has always been clear, as proven by the red wave in the elections, and Trump will signal a new era of rejuvenation and global peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnyiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-19T07:50:37-08:00	
The Problem With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – OpEd	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been chosen by president-elect Donald Trump to be Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). From a Catholic perspective, there are serious problems with that choice. First and foremost is Kennedy’s position on abortion. It might be more accurate to say his positions on abortion. For most of his career he has been a staunch supporter of abortion-on-demand, but now he says he favors some restrictions. Kennedy didn’t evolve over the years on this issue. He did so recently when it became apparent that if Trump were to win the election he may land some post in the administration. Being pro-abortion, he obviously reasoned, could be a real problem, especially if he were up for the HHS job. When Kennedy was asked by former ESPN commentator, Sage Steele, whether there should be any limits on abortion, he said no. 'Even if it is full term…I don’t think it’s ever OK…I think we have to leave it with the woman rather than the state.' He didn’t say that ten years ago. He said it in May of this year. It gets worse. Literally three days after the Steele interview, Kennedy saidabortion should be permitted only before viability. There are other issues that should give Catholics pause. In December 2023 he told political commentator Patrick Bet-David that he did not support a ban on 'gender affirming' care for minors. Why? Because he did not 'know enough about it to say that it should be completely illegal,' and he needed 'to look at the data' before making a decision. But guess what? In May he decided he supported a ban on minors receiving 'gender affirming' care. Kennedy not only wants to make marijuana legal nationwide, he wants to legalize some psychedelics. That would presumably include psilocybin (magic mushrooms), the most popular psychedelic in the nation. He believes that there are significant benefits to psychedelics that have not been uncovered because the medical establishment has gone out of its way to prevent that research. Here’s what we know about magic mushrooms. They can cause frightening hallucinations, distorted thinking, impaired concentration, unusual body sensations, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, confusion and emotions ranging from bliss to terror. The fundamental problem with Kennedy is that he lacks a coherent understanding of these issues. He has no overriding philosophical vision. He spent his entire life defending abortion-without-limits, and had no problem justifying puberty blockers, chemical castration and mutilating the genitals of disturbed minors—until he experienced his grand epiphany in May. That must have been quite a month for him. And now he thinks we need to make it easier for Americans to hallucinate. This is Robert F. Kennedy’s vision of health and human services. It’s not ours.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn3aW42jO4oa7	2024-11-19T07:48:29-08:00	
Between Activism And Isolationism: What To Expect From Trump’s Mi...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The not-so-unexpected victory of former president Donald Trump on November 5 has sparked renewed discussion on his foreign policy and how a second term might differ from both his first term and current President Joe Biden’s. This article examines Trump’s potential approach to the Middle East, identifying possible shifts and continuities across key issues shaping the region today. These issues include the Iran-Israel confrontation (centered on the Iranian nuclear program), Arab-Israeli reconciliation (and the future of the Palestinian question), US military presence in Syria and Iraq, and broader efforts to reshape the Middle Eastern order within the context of US-China strategic competition. These topics continue to shape the region’s politics, affecting various state and non-state actors, both regionally and globally. As the dictum goes, 'personnel is policy.' Thus, the scenarios and possibilities discussed here consider the tensions between two core factions within today’s Republican Party: an isolationist faction on the farther right of the party aligned with Trump’s 'America First' vision, and a more activist faction that supports robust American power projection, though not through large-scale ground invasions as seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. These foreign policy strains are not new—they have deep roots within the Republican Party and American politics. For example, as seen with former President George W. Bush’s administration following the 9/11 attacks, domestic or international events can dramatically alter an administration’s course, even if it initially professes significant isolationist leanings. Israel-Iran Confrontation and Iran’s Nuclear Program The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is currently the most pressing regional issue, with a genuine risk of evolving into an all-out, multi-party, multi-front war. Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks and the subsequent Israeli response in Gaza, the conflict has been on a path of incremental escalation, initially by Iran and, more recently, by Israel. Israel has leveraged the multi-front assaults by Iran’s 'Resistance Axis' since October 7 as justification to break the taboo of launching direct attacks on Iranian soil. Much in terms of the trajectory of Iran and Israel’s confrontation depends on the threat perception, risk calculation and strategic objectives of each side. Iran has been in a mostly reactive position since the Israeli attack on Iranian consulate in Damascus in April. Israel has gained strategic initiative over Iran and is the party that would decide whether, when, how, and where to escalate based on what price it is willing to pay for the ends that it defines for itself. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has jubilantly hailed Trump’s return to the White House, Tehran views the prospect with deep wariness. However, much in the US-Israel-Iran relations depends on the direction of Iran’s nuclear program and whether Iran will be willing to negotiate with a Trump administration. Trump has signaled on several occasions that he does not seek regime change in Tehran and that he wants an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Iranian officials seem to cautiously welcome this approach, aiming to avoid the possibility of war with the United States or Israel and to relieve the devastating sanctions placed on them for decades. Iranian Vice-President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif, a primary advocate of the former Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal on Iran’s side, has indicated that Tehran would enter into talks with Trump if it is treated with 'respect.' However, the question remains: What kind of deal would Iran be able to negotiate? Would it be one that focuses solely on Iran’s nuclear program, and if so, how would it differ from the JCPOA? During his previous term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA and issued a twelve-point set of conditions for talks with Iran, which included terminating the military dimension of its nuclear program, allowing rigorous and sudden inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, halting Iran’s ballistic missile program, ceasing support for regional proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, and disarming Iraqi militias and integrating them into Iraq’s security forces. It is unclear whether the Trump team would insist on these conditions this time around. However, if they did, it would place Iran in a serious dilemma. Moreover, Iran’s repeated attempts to assassinate Trump in retaliation for his 2020 order to kill Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani could influence Trump’s personal stance toward Iran, adding another layer of complexity for Tehran. While survival is crucial for the Iranian regime, the form and basis of that survival matter. Without its network of regional militias, ballistic missile capabilities, and a nuclear program under stringent international monitoring, the Islamic Republic would undergo a transformation, appearing significantly weakened to both allies and adversaries. This level of concession could leave Iran vulnerable to external pressures and domestic unrest—the likelihood of which is heightened given the government’s oppressive stance on civil liberties, women’s rights, ethnic minorities, and overall economic mismanagement. Consequently, a deal with Washington along the liens of the 12 points might seem like an act of capitulation for Iran and could prove disastrous, without necessarily guaranteeing the regime’s survival. However, rejecting a deal exposes Iran to the serious risk of escalating Israeli and even US attacks, particularly as its air defenses are now severely compromised following recent Israeli strikes in late October. In short, the Iranian regime is caught between a rock and a hard place. Trump’s policy toward Tehran will also depend on the figures he appoints to key national security and foreign policy roles in institutions like the State Department—especially the person handling the Iran portfolio—the Defense Department, and the National Security Council. Should individuals with strong anti-Islamic Republic views assume these positions, it would be reasonable to expect an aggressive stance from the administration toward Iran. Currently, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is reported to be Trump’s choice to lead the State Department and former State Department Iran envoy Brian Hook is reported to be overseeing the department’s transition. Fox News host Pete Hegseth is Trump’s nominee for Defense Secretary nominee and Congressman Mike Waltz is the nominee for National Security Advisor, while Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is the nominee for US’s UN ambassador role. All these figures are known for tough stances on Iran and strong support for US allies such as Israel. Additionally, Mike Evans, a prominent Evangelical leader and Trump advisor, told Israel’s i24News that president-elect Trump encouraged Israel to target Iran’s energy infrastructure during Biden’s remaining lame-duck period. With Hamas significantly weakened and Hezbollah decapitated, Netanyahu may feel emboldened to launch a comprehensive strike on Iran before or shortly after January 20 to diminish Tehran’s threat to Israel. Overall, while the Trump administration is likely to avoid a direct regime-change policy, it will probably pursue a maximum pressure campaign by imposing new sanctions on key Iranian industries and officials, rigorously enforcing existing sanctions on Iranian oil sales (which have doubled under Biden compared to Trump’s first term), adopting a 'maximum support' approach if domestic unrest occurred in Iran, and potentially backing Israeli strikes on Tehran. The intent would be either to pressure Tehran into a new deal or to punish it severely for refusing one and for its regional behavior. Of Iran’s multi-layered deterrence strategies, only developing a nuclear weapon might shield it against future attacks and possible collapse, given the reduced effectiveness of its Resistance Axis and ballistic missile arsenal. This would certainly depend on Tehran’s threat perception. But with uranium enriched to 60 percent, Iran appears to be now capable of producing weapons-grade, 90-percent-enriched uranium within one to two weeks, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated in July. Despite internal pressure for such a move, whether Tehran will present the world with a nuclear weapon fait accompli—and the timing of such a decision—will be closely monitored by actors in the region and beyond. Taking actual steps toward building a bomb would certainly invite a devastating Israeli (and US) response. And if Tehran manages to secretly build such a bomb, it will prompt even greater sanctions from Washington and its Western, and possibly regional, allies. Abraham Accords 2.0 The Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan were undoubtedly the most prominent foreign policy achievement and legacy of the first Trump administration. Following years of unsuccessful efforts by the Biden administration, a second Trump administration would likely prioritize securing a similar agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. This would be seen as the culmination of the Abraham Accords, regardless of whether it retains the same title. However, there are significant obstacles to such a deal. Ongoing Israeli military operations and its reluctance thus far to agree on a new governing formula for Palestinian areas in Gaza or Palestinian statehood could hinder the likelihood of an Israeli-Saudi agreement. Without meaningful recognition for Palestinians and without a role for the Gulf states and Egypt, in supporting a future for Gaza and other Palestinian territories, the prospects of an expanded Abraham Accords or an Israeli-Saudi deal would face substantial challenges. Israel appears to favor a compartmentalized approach, distinguishing its relations with the Gulf and Saudi Arabia from the Palestinian question. Saudi Arabia, however, seems to prefer a comprehensive approach, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan recently reiterating the need for a recognized Palestinian state as a precondition for any deal with Israel. Given Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in the Arab and Islamic worlds and its guardianship of Islam’s two holiest sites, the kingdom cannot afford to appear as abandoning the Palestinian cause. As demonstrated by the October 7 attack by Hamas, the Palestinian issue and militant groups remain potent forces that could disrupt any Arab-Israeli deal that overlooks them. Overall, warmer relations and a higher degree of trust between the Republicans and Israel suggest that a deal is more likely under a Trump administration if approached strategically. Trump’s personal style of diplomacy and strong connections with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) may aid in this process. If Jared Kushner returns to a central role in Trump’s Middle East policy, the chances of a comprehensive Saudi-Israeli agreement may increase, given his close relationship with MBS and family ties to Trump. Should an Israeli-Saudi deal prove unachievable—mainly due to Israeli inflexibility on the Palestinian issue—a bilateral Saudi-US security agreement might be the most viable alternative, either in Biden’s final weeks or under a future Trump administration. US Military Deployments in Syria and Iraq Another key issue for the incoming Trump administration in the Middle East will be the ongoing presence of US troops in Syria and Iraq. These forces have faced numerous attacks by pro-Iran militias, and their strategic purpose is frequently questioned in Washington. Given Trump’s emphasis on ending 'endless wars' abroad, he may be tempted to bring these troops home. However, such a decision is easier said than done, as their deployment remains crucial to regional stability and US interests. Syria Syria has become a central arena for entangled regional and global rivalries over the past decade. The country is currently divided into three primary zones, each backed by a major regional or global power. The western part of Syria is dominated by Assad, with the support of Iran, its regional proxies, and Russia. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control the northern and northeastern energy-rich areas with the backing of a 900-strong US military deployment. Northwestern and parts of northern Syria are controlled by various, mainly Islamist groups supported by Turkey. Syria continues to be a hub of Iranian regional activity and a transit point for weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has prompted Israeli airstrikes, particularly since the October 7 attacks. Damascus also has an unresolved territorial dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights, which has been under Israeli control since the 1967 War. Syria was a primary base of the Islamic State (ISIS) and has recently witnessed troubling signs of ISIS resurgence, reminiscent of the group’s rise in the early 2010s. The official rationale for the US military presence in Syria is to prevent the re-emergence of ISIS. Complicating matters further, Syria has become a site of ongoing tension between Turkey and Kurds, as Ankara considers the Kurdish elements within the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which it has been battling for nearly four decades. Crafting a policy toward this complex landscape of regional and global interests is understandably challenging. In 2019, Trump ordered a partial withdrawal of US troops from the border areas between Syria and Turkey, enabling Turkey to launch incursions and occupy significant portions of Kurdish-majority areas previously held by the SDF. It remains to be seen whether a future Trump administration would take a similar approach. Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently stated that the president-elect wanted to withdraw the remaining US troops from Syria to avoid them becoming 'cannon fodder' in the event of a regional conflict between the Assad regime and Turkey. While the chances of an all-out war between Assad and Turkey are minimal, a US withdrawal would likely lead to further instability in Syria and result in a loss of critical leverage for the United States in both Syria and the broader region. Although the US military presence in Syria is small, it is strategically vital, yielding significant benefits by monitoring ISIS activity and limiting Iran’s regional expansionist efforts—the latter especially directly bearing on Israel’s security. Pulling out the troops would trigger a bloody struggle by various local and regional contenders for the control; of the SDF territory, sow chaos, and could potentially lead to the escape of hundreds, if not thousands, of captured ISIS elements and their radicalized family members from prisons and camps. Thus, it is not far-fetched to expect that Republican foreign policy segments, more attuned to broader regional geopolitical interests, may push back against Trump’s potential withdrawal and the more isolationist factions within his administration. The outcome of this internal struggle is uncertain, especially given that the composition of the Trump administration is not yet fully known. However, National Security Advisor pick Waltz and State Secretary nominee Rubio on Syria strongly opposed Trump’s troops’ withdrawal from Syria in 2019. Overall, maintaining the partnership with the SDF while addressing Turkish concerns by diversifying the SDF’s composition to include Kurdish and non-Kurdish groups more acceptable to Turkey would better advance the strategic interests of the United States and its allies. Iraq The United States and Iraq continue to share an uneasy relationship more than two decades after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Baath regime and the rise of the current political order in the country. The growing dominance of pro-Iran groups within Baghdad’s state institutions has strained this relationship further. Groups straddling both official Iraqi security and political institutions and the so-called Iran-led Resistance Axis continue to attack US forces in Iraq and Syria as part of Iran’s broader strategy to undermine US regional influence. This has placed Iraq and the United States in a murky dynamic, where they are neither true allies nor adversaries, despite the Strategic Framework Agreement they signed in 2008. Approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, advising Iraqi security forces on the critical mission of ensuring ISIS’s defeat. Iraq’s significance has grown amid the recent regional conflict since the October 7 attacks, as Iran-backed militias have targeted both Israel and US forces—with dozens of attacks on Israel in the past six weeks. These actions contradict Iraq’s official stance, which seeks to avoid becoming entangled in the conflict. Recently, Iraqi and US officials reached an agreement for US forces to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2026, with a small contingent remaining in the Kurdistan Region during the last year of this agreement to support the mission in neighboring Syria. This agreement awaits final approval from the US government. For Iraq, the priority is to see US troops depart and to strengthen economic and bilateral security ties beyond the anti-ISIS global coalition framework. The incoming Trump administration may find it tempting to withdraw US troops from Iraq either prematurely or in accordance with the scheduled plan. Or depending on the course of regional events and Iraq’s behavior in the context of the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, it might decide to keep troops in Iraq. Ongoing attacks on Israel could potentially make Iraq a target for the Israeli military, as has occurred with other members of the Iran-backed axis in Lebanon and Yemen. Washington has reportedly restrained Israel from adding Iraq to its list of targets, though this could change depending on US Middle East policy (under Biden or Trump) or the evolving calculations of Netanyahu’s government and Iran’s broader behavior. Iraq may also face sanctions due to militia activities, the continued smuggling of US-provided dollars to Iran and its proxies, and an Iraqi judicial arrest warrant for Trump following the killing of Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the umbrella group for predominantly Iran-backed factions. The possibility of Washington revoking exemptions that allow Iraq to purchase Iranian natural gas for its power plants is a tangible prospect, especially as part of its anticipated maximum pressure strategy against Iran. Washington’s best course of action regarding Iraq may be to leverage current regional tensions to pressure the Iraqi government toward meaningful security sector reforms. This could involve curbing the influence of Iran-backed armed factions and further integrating the PMF into the state’s military-security structure. The United States could also alternatively maintain a long-term military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan to support the Syria mission, broader regional interests, and the containment of a resurgent jihadi threat. Washington’s fatigue with Iraq should not overshadow prudent policymaking concerning the challenges and opportunities the country presents. The Middle East in a Moment of Global Rivalries The desire to reduce US engagement in the Middle East dates back to former president Richard Nixon’s administration, nearly half a century ago. This aspiration continued under both Trump and Biden, yet the region continues to demand US attention. Although US policymakers have argued for a pivot to East Asia and focusing more energy on Eastern Europe to counter China and Russia, the Middle East remains integral to global rivalries. China has made substantial inroads through economic, energy, and trade partnerships and flexed its diplomatic clout by brokering the 2023 Iran-Saudi deal. The region is also central to global trade routes, as evidenced by initiatives like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to integrate the region’s vast energy resources. From the perspective of some policymakers in Washington, the Abraham Accords and a surprising weakening of Iran and its Axis of Resistance in recent months offer a unique opportunity to reshape the regional order in alignment with US priorities. For Washington to maintain its influence, it would feel compelled to continue strengthening its allies, which necessitates some level of military presence or involvement. A leadership void due to Washington’s disengagement would likely invite interventions by China or Russia, or intensify regional rivalries among players like Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Turkey, and Iran. Actors like Iran tend to design their policies in the region or their support for Russia against Ukraine as part of a broader strategy to erode US influence and challenge the US-dominated global order. Viewing the region through this 'big picture' lens is essential to understanding the broader significance of regional events and the stakes involved. Interpreted cautiously, despite Trump’s professed preference against deploying military power or involvement in global conflicts/crises, the selection of individuals for key foreign policy and national security roles suggests a lean toward a more engaged US presence in the region than retreat. This indicates continuity in the use of American power and influence, support for Israel, and harsher policy toward Iran, much like Trump’s first term. Nevertheless, future US policy could still reflect isolationist tendencies, both due to Trump and the general American public’s hesitation regarding troop deployments and overseas interventions. The future of US policy in the Middle East will likely reflect a struggle between activist and isolationist inclinations within the Trump administration and the Republican foreign policy establishment writ large. Neither side is likely to gain full control, suggesting US Middle East policy will likely experience shifts in both directions. About the author: Mohammed A.

Challenge Before Trump As Russia-China-North Korea Axis Takes Sha...	The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty, or the mutual defence treaty signed between Russia and North Korea in June 2024 in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. Following the signing of a comprehensive defence treaty between Russia and North Korea in June 2024, North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia. Bilateral ties between the two soon developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un needs to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world know that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan expresses concern Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated by the day and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time. During his visit to Ukraine on 16-17 November, Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his counterpart Andrii Sybiha, and expressed grave concerns about the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia in its war against Ukraine and promised Japan’s unwavering stance of being with Ukraine in the conflict, now in its third year. As a quid pro quo, Russia seems to be transferring missile and nuclear technologies to North Korea. Iwaya’s visit symbolised the close relationship between the two countries. Zelenskyy expressed appreciation for the support Japan provided to Ukraine to the tune of $12 billion (1.85 trillion yen). The latest assistance from Japan consisted of electrical equipment items to help Ukrainians through the cold winter months, when power shortages are feared. The items, including 32 generators, were to be given to the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa through the UNDP and the JICA. Ukraine lost about 60 per cent of its power generation capacity due to Russian attacks on infrastructure facilities from March 2024. Iwaya was the first minister of the Ishiba Cabinet to visit Ukraine and the third Jaoanese foreign minister to travel to the country after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. No doubt, Zelenskyy called Japan a true leader in Asia in terms of protecting the rules-based international order as well as international order as well as human lives. Reaction of US State Department The US State Department reacted by saying that North Korea’s involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine causes 'great concern' and 'consternation' for the Indo-Pacific. The State Department statement underscored cooperation with South Korea, Japan and other countries in addressing the issue. The engagement of North Korean troops in combat operations in Russia’s western front-line Kursk region runs risk of the Ukraine war developing into a larger war. The US is working collaboratively with its partners in Japan and South Korea on this. While confirming the North Korean troops already in the combat zone, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Brussels that the deployment calls fir a 'firm' response. The larger concern is that the Russia-North Korea military partnership will have broad security implications for Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the world. South Korea’s Response South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol said that his country would 'implement appropriate effective measures' in response to North Korean troops being deployed to fight for Russia in Ukraine. At the same time, Yoon is making 'diplomatic efforts' with Russia. Yoon appears to be adjusting his position on sending Ukraine weapons in light of Donald Trump being elected US president. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. One other option before Yoon is to maintain 'strategic dialogue' with Beijing even as he called on Beijing to play a responsible role in contributing to stability on the Korean Peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Earlier, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, had confirmed that North Korean troops were deployed to Russia and engaged in combat in Ukraine. This was a clear departure from his earlier announcement of sending lethal weapons to Ukraine even as he weigh what policy response US President-elect Trump would adopt on this issue. Though China has leverage both with Russia and North Korea, there has been a clear reluctance on Beijing’s part to be grouped together with Russia and North Korea. Such a situation poses bigger challenge to other stakeholders to woo China to play its card on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUI9O83651OiB	2024-11-18T17:18:03-08:00	
Ron Paul: If Trump Didn’t Send Musk To Talk With The Iranians…He ...	One of the most encouraging and promising things President-elect Trump said in his post-election acceptance speech was, 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars…' We all understand that campaign promises often have a short shelf life after the election is over, but the Trump campaign’s repeated talk of peace over war at least demonstrates that he finds it a winning point to make to American voters. Will that talk of peace turn into action in the second Trump presidency, especially with the hawks he has named to senior foreign policy positions in his incoming Administration? It is hard to say, but last week’s report that he sent Elon Musk to meet with the Iranian Ambassador to the UN would be a good sign if true. Iran has denied that any such meeting took place, and with rumors swirling of Trump talks with Putin and other world leaders it may just be a media creation. But even if it is not true that Trump sent Musk to meet with the Iranians it would be a good idea to do so. Why Musk? Because Musk is not expected to take on a formal role in the incoming Trump Administration he can be seen as an informal advisor and friend of the President-elect. Plus, as a businessman Elon Musk speaks a different language than government diplomats. Why meet with the Iranians? What’s there to talk about? One important topic to bring up would be claims made by Biden’s FBI that there was an Iranian plot to assassinate then-candidate Trump. As many commentators including former CIA analyst Larry Johnson have asserted, the plot as outlined in the FBI indictment seems improbable. Is it possible that deep state hawks cooked up this alleged plot to guarantee that once taking office President Trump would not be tempted to open to Iran? There is a history of terror plots cooked up by the FBI so, sadly, this cannot be discounted. Does that mean that Iranian denials should be trusted? Of course not. But it is worth discussing. It is widely expected that in his second term President Trump will return to the 'maximum pressure' policy of his first Administration. That would be a mistake. Trump will not be stepping into the same world when he steps back into the White House. More than ever, the proxy war in Ukraine has demonstrated the futility of sanctions and pressure as a tool of foreign policy. The countries under US sanctions have increasingly joined together and formed their own pathways to trade and diplomacy without the US. In other words, we did not isolate Russia, China, and Iran with our sanctions upon sanctions. We isolated ourselves. We are seeing this clearly with the emergence of organizations such as BRICS. A more prosperous America requires more foreign trade, not less. Frédéric Bastiat is quoted as saying, 'When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.' We have already seen too much of that lately. Someone wrote recently that if only Nixon could go to China, perhaps only Trump can go to Iran. Making peace with Iran would be an achievement that would reverberate across the Middle East and beyond. It would even benefit Israel to have the current near state of war with Iran turned down. War destroys, peace builds. Let’s hope for a new approach.

Khamenei’s Succession Remarks Cause Turmoil Within Iran’s Regime ...	On November 7, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamanei met with the Assembly of Experts and discussed plans for his successor. 'The Assembly of Experts, as defined in our Constitution, is one of the most revolutionary institutions of the Islamic Republic,' he said. 'Its significance lies in its unique responsibility to select the nation’s leader. This readiness to fulfill that role must always be maintained.' One day after Khamenei’s remarks to the Assembly of Experts, where he emphasized the need for their readiness to select the next Supreme Leader, Mohammad Bagher Heydari Kashani, a member of the Assembly, described both the speech and the atmosphere as such: 'We held our breath. He gave explicit orders for the Assembly to act swiftly and decisively, without hesitation, to appoint the next leader in accordance with constitutional guidelines… The mere thought of the Leader’s absence moved some members to tears; they couldn’t hold back their emotions at the possibility of the Supreme Leader’s martyrdom.' These remarks sparked widespread controversy within the regime and surfaced in Friday prayer sermons on November 15 across various cities. Several of Khamenei’s appointees spoke on the issue, their conflicting statements revealing the confusion and anxiety caused by the anticipation of Khamenei’s potential demise at the highest levels of the regime. During Friday prayers in Shahrekord, Abdollah Keyvani, another member of the Assembly of Experts, outright denied Heydari’s account: 'Someone said the members of the Assembly cried… That’s not true; there was laughter, joy, and a sense of empowerment in the session. We were delighted, but there weren’t even tears of joy. The claim that the Leader directed the Assembly to discuss the next Supreme Leader is completely untrue.' In Isfahan, Abolhassan Mahdavi, Khamenei’s representative and the Friday prayer leader in the city, remarked, 'Khamenei’s statement that the Assembly should identify suitable candidates for leadership in case of emergency isn’t new; I’ve heard him mention this about 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years.' He continued, 'There is a committee within the Assembly of Experts responsible for identifying all individuals qualified for leadership—this extends beyond Iran, as the concept of ‘Velayat-e Faqih’ transcends borders. This committee works under strict confidentiality, and three members have been chosen to securely hold the names of potential candidates.' Despite the secrecy, reports circulating in the media and on social networks claim that the three confidential candidates include Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, who is said to control the IRGC, particularly its intelligence organization. The second is Alireza A’rafi, head of the seminaries and former leader of Al-Mustafa International University, known for recruiting and training overseas operatives. The third is Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri, a cleric reportedly regarded as the spiritual leader of the 'Paydari' faction. In another example of the controversy stirred by Khamenei’s remarks on November 7, Hossein Shafiei Darabi, the Friday prayer leader of Sari, said on November 15, 'The Thursday meeting between the Supreme Leader and the Assembly of Experts provoked reactions from the enemies [i.e., the oppressed society]. They sharpened their tongues and pens, speculating about what might happen. Don’t think that if something unfortunate befalls the Leader, you [the people] will benefit!' Although Mahdavi in Isfahan claimed to have heard Khamenei discuss the need to identify a successor 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years, his comments indicate that previous mentions did not provoke such strong reactions or turmoil within the regime. This current wave of responses, evident in the Friday sermons, underscores both Khamenei’s fragile condition and the severe crisis gripping the regime amidst its challenges—essentially a 'succession crisis' within the regime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUN0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-18T17:16:11-08:00	
The Indian Navy: A Resident Power In Indian Ocean And Rising Lead...	The Indian Navy stands at the crossroads of a transformative era, where global power dynamics and maritime security imperatives converge in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the Indo-Pacific. As a resident power in the IOR and an emerging leader in the broader maritime domain, the Navy reflects India’s strategic aspirations to ensure a stable, rules-based maritime order. Against the backdrop of Cold War 2.0 and an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy is crafting a new legacy—one that blends operational capability with diplomatic finesse to address complex 21st-century challenges. From Coastal Defense to Strategic Power: The Indian Navy’s Evolution Historical Roots and Geopolitical Awakening India’s maritime heritage is intertwined with its history of trade and cultural exchange. Yet, it was the post-independence era that catalyzed a shift from viewing the ocean as a commercial artery to recognizing its strategic potential. Early investments in naval infrastructure laid the groundwork for a force that would eventually evolve into a blue-water navy capable of influencing events far beyond India’s shores. The Emergence of SAGAR and Regional Ambitions The turning point in India’s maritime strategy came with the introduction of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) in 2015. This policy articulated a vision for an inclusive and cooperative approach to maritime security, positioning India as a stabilizing force in the IOR. SAGAR encapsulates India’s role as a net-security provider and emphasizes economic growth and collective prosperity in the region. Building Regional Leadership Through Multilateralism The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) India has adeptly used platforms like the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) to solidify its role as a regional leader. Bringing together littoral states, IONS addresses shared challenges such as piracy, climate change, and illegal fishing, fostering an environment of trust and collective action. This approach highlights India’s commitment to building partnerships rather than hierarchies. Operational Excellence: Cementing the Role of Net-Security Provider Defending Maritime Lanes The Indian Navy’s operational successes demonstrate its ability to counter both traditional and non-traditional threats. Notable missions include: Counter-Piracy Operations: In January 2024, the Navy’s elite MARCOS thwarted the hijacking of the MV Leela Norfolk in the North Arabian Sea. Similarly, the interception of the Iranian vessel Iman and the rescue of 17 crew members from Somali pirates spotlighted its proficiency in high-stakes operations. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR): From its response to the 2004 tsunami to delivering water to the Maldives during its 2014 water crisis, all the way to its medical assitance during the pandemic, the Navy has repeatedly proven its role as a force for good, enhancing India’s diplomatic and humanitarian reputation. First-Responder in Regional Crises India’s readiness to act as a first responder in regional emergencies solidifies its role as a dependable partner. Deployments such as the 2024 mobilization of 20 ships and 5,000 personnel to counter maritime threats highlight the Navy’s capability to respond swiftly and effectively while fostering goodwill among neighboring nations. Expanding Horizons: The Indian Navy in the Indo-Pacific Naval Diplomacy: Building Bridges and Projecting Power India’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific reflects its recognition of this region as the fulcrum of global power. The Navy’s goodwill visits and joint exercises have emerged as critical tools in shaping perceptions and forging partnerships: In 2024, the Eastern Fleet’s visits to Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines signalled India’s intent to deepen ties with Southeast Asia. These visits often coincide with heightened regional tensions, demonstrating India’s commitment to ensuring stability while subtly countering China’s assertive manoeuvres. Strengthening Alliances Through Multilateral Exercises Participation in multilateral exercises like Malabar, alongside the United States, Japan, and Australia, exemplifies India’s commitment to collaborative security. Such exercises enhance operational interoperability while reinforcing India’s image as a key player in the Indo-Pacific security architecture. Navigating the Complexity of Great Power Competition Countering China’s Expanding Influence China’s maritime strategies, from its String of Pearls initiative to its militarization of the South China Sea, present a significant challenge to India’s maritime interests. The Indian Navy’s response is multifaceted: Modernization: The induction of INS Vikrant, India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier, and Project 75I to expand the submarine fleet highlight India’s focus on bolstering its capabilities. Strategic Alignments: Partnerships with nations like France, Australia, and Japan reflect a deliberate strategy to counterbalance China’s regional influence. Balancing Relations Amid U.S.-China Rivalry As a cornerstone of the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy, India enjoys strengthened ties with Washington. However, its emphasis on strategic autonomy necessitates a careful balancing act, ensuring that partnerships with the U.S. do not compromise its broader diplomatic relationships, including with China. Harnessing Opportunities for Leadership Leveraging Technology for Maritime Superiority To maintain its operational edge, the Navy is investing in advanced technologies such as AI-driven surveillance systems and unmanned underwater vehicles. Collaborations with technologically advanced naval powers offer avenues for capacity-building and innovation. Economic Diplomacy and Connectivity Initiatives like the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) exemplify the convergence of India’s strategic and economic objectives. As an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the AAGC reinforces India’s commitment to fostering inclusive regional development. Conclusion: Charting India’s Maritime Destiny The Indian Navy’s evolution from a coastal defense force to a proactive player in the Indo-Pacific shows India’s strategic resolve in an era of shifting global power. As the IOR and Indo-Pacific become central to 21st-century geopolitics, India’s maritime strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. By balancing ambition with pragmatism, the Navy is positioning itself to be a force that defends India’s maritime interests and contributes to global stability. Whether through its role as a net-security provider in the IOR or its proactive engagement in the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy embodies a vision of cooperation, innovation, and resilience. As great power competition intensifies and the Indo-Pacific’s importance grows, the question remains: Can India sustain its momentum and emerge as a decisive maritime leader? The coming years will reveal the extent of India’s maritime rise—and its implications for the global order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUETbWctOpbo2	2024-11-18T17:15:19-08:00	
US’ Stake In Philippine Mid-Term Elections – Analysis	Donald Trump’s comeback to the White House after winning the US Presidential election in November 2024 may simply sustain the long-standing US-Philippine relations, the longest in Southeast Asia since colonial times. As US Ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson, confidently confirmed that the two countries 'will remain steadfast friends and iron-clad allies as well as partners in prosperity' In Trump’s previous presidency (2017-2021), US-Philippine had remarkable dynamics affecting regional stability, bilateral security cooperation, and economic ties. As US’s strategic ally in Asia, particulary Southeast Asia (SEA), Analysts surmise that Trump 2.0 will withstand US-Philippine relations ultimately to check on China’s military and economic domination of Asia. Indisputably, the US has a significant concern over the outcome of the Philippine mid-term 2025 elections as it will roughly define the future of US strategic geopolitical role in the Indo-Pacific region with its 'dependable' ally in the next three (3) years or up until the end of President Marcos Jr. six (6)-year term, and until Trump concludes his second term in office in 2028. The Philippine 2025 elections The Philippine 2025 election will determine who would occupy the over 18,000 positions, including 12 Senate seats, 316 seats in the House of Representatives (HoR) comprising representatives of legislative districts and party-list groups, local executives and legislators, and members of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) parliament. The politicians will ascertain the configuration of the Philippine Congress (Philippine Senate and HoR), the institution which influences the country’s foreign policy and sanctions defense programmes on the one hand, and regional as well local government bodies’ acting as collective institutions at the grassroot level to organize and mobilize local and popular boost to national policies and international commitments on the other hand. In as much as key legislators of the Philippine Senate and the HoR are mandated to frame and adopt laws and policies of national and international significance, it is imperative to the US to ensure that legislators closely conform with US foreign policy interest in the country as well as in the region, or offer less essential impediments or feeble resistance to US pursuit for power, security, and wealth in SEA. Geopolitical implications: The Mutual Defense Treaty and military cooperation agreements As a former colony of the US for 50 years and tied to a neocolonial relationship in the past 78 years US-sponsored independence in 1946, the Philippines as a major non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) US ally plays a key role especially where US foreign policy is increasingly focused over the growing influence of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). Equally, the country’s geographical position in the region is crucial for maintaining US’s presence particularly in projecting its power in the South China Sea (SCS), where territorial disputes between the country and PRC have escalated in recent years. Moreover, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the two (2) countries secured them militarily to support each other if one party is a victim of an armed attack on its 'metropolitan territory' (Art V of MDT), which by definition does not refer to territories under dispute. Addititionally, any counter-attack is not necessaritly automatic nor military in nature on the part of the US as the latter is required to invoke Art IV of the MDT: 'Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.' Given that PRC and Russia are permanent members of UN Security Council, they can easily exercise their veto power to annul any attempt for US to launch any military attack against China. Besides, military cooperation with the Philippines is indeed paramount to the US more than ever before especially with the termination of the 1947 US-Philippine Military Bases Agreement (MBA) in 1992 and with the new geopolitical landscape in East Asia dominated by the emerging regional rivalry between China and the US. The new strategic reality has been driven by China’s economic rise against backdrop of the US’s 'rebalancing' foreign policy in Asia and its relative economic decline. Also known as 'pivot to Asia,' the American military and diplomatic 'pivot,' or 'rebalance,' toward Asia became a popular buzzword after then US State Secretary Hillary Clinton first announced it at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 2010 in Hanoi and subsequently authored 'America's Pacific Century,' in Foreign Policy (2013). Pivot to Asia is a shift in the focus of foreign policy from the Middle East to the Far East to try to balance the growing influence of China and threats of North Korea. While essentially diplomatic and economic in nature (Graham 2013), the catalyst for the pivot was not only of reduced American regional power but the more assertive Chinese approach and actions, especially in the SCS disputes. This has reignited US involvement in the region; it is not waiting to be reduced to sub-primacy in the region as a result of what some have dubbed Chinese ‘domination by stealth.’ The US and some of its Asian ardent allies perceive China as a peril more than a partner in global development. China’s growing geopolitical importance has prompted US to strengthen its position, via balancing and engaging with China. In the period of 'pivot to Asia' and post-bases era, US-Philippine security relations has broadened and extended to Philippine politics. US’s geopolitical strategic interest makes it vital that the 2025 election produces politicians and leaders who continually endorse and commit themselves to key standing military cooperation agreements forged between the two states especially the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Implemented in 1999, the VFA paved the way to a series of uninterrupted annual conduct of Balikatan('shoulder-to-shoulder') military exercises, notables in 2001, 2016, 2022, 2023, and 2024, between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the US military. Although the first Balikatan military exercise held in 1991, a year prior to the closure of the US bases in the Philippines in 1992, and before the adoption of the VFA, was then under the MDT, the training exercises and war games have apparently been an important fixture of US-Philippine military-civil security relations. Balikatan has been designed to strengthen bilateral interoperability, capabilities, test air and missile defense systems, increase awareness of maritime security, trust and cooperation. The near cancellation of the VFA in 2020 by then President Duterte as Philippine foreign policy, and during President Trump’s first term, shifted towards China and away from the US is a testament that political leadership has direct impact on the complexion of the country’s foreign policy. Apart from the VFA, the country adopted the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) as a supplemental agreement to two previous accords – the 1951 MDT and 1998 VFA. The ten-year EDCA deal allows the U.S. to have a strengthened presence in the Philippines. This Agreement was however challenged by civil society organizations and legal experts before the Philippine Supreme Court (PSC) as it tolerates US to rotate its troops in the Philippines for an extended stay and consents it to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both US and Philippine armed forces. While opposition groups and parties argue that EDCA contravenes the Philippine constitutional provision on the establishment of a permanent foreign military base, the PSC ruled otherwise and with finality that EDCA is constitutional in its 2016 decision. The slow implementation of EDCA during then-President Duterte’s term (June 2016-June 2022) was willfully done as US is disdained by Duterte who is partial to China’s interest. Notwithstanding, the US and the Philippines agreed to have five (5) EDCA sites or military bases for the American troops in 2016, namely: Antonio Bautista Air Base (Palawan); Basa Air Base (Pampanga); Benito Ebuen Air Base (Cebu); Fort Magsaysay (Pampanga); and Lumbia Airport (Cagayan de Oro). With the shift of foreign policy that caters to the US interest, now President Marcos Jr., expanded the EDCA sites, covering four (4) more new bases in 2023, a year after he assumed the presidency. Additional sites are situated in north Luzon facing Taiwan (Republic of China), three, and one in Palawan facing the SCS. These are: Camp Melchora Dela Cruz (Gamu, Isabela); Lal-lo Airport ( Lal-lo, Cagayan); Naval Base Camilo Osias (Santa Ana, Cagayan); and Balabac Island (Palawan). The unilateral selection and identification of EDCA bases without the participation of people on the ground has been adversely received by local government officials. The governors of the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan were collectively offended by the national government’s choice of their provinces as EDCA armed bases as they become potential magnets of attack by Chinese missiles and nuclear attacks, and be caught at the crossfire of US and China armed rivaly in the region. Civil society organizations and groups also raised the alarm of wanton violation of human rights and confiscation of lands from indigenous peoples as a consequence of hosting EDCA military activities and training. Understandably, the non-participation of local government and community leaders in the political process of charting their future in a large-scale project like the EDCA military and civil scheme will not only isolate the program from the people but also produce adversarial relations between national and international actors on the one hand, and local government and community on the other hand. China’s economic growth It is argued moreover that US geopolitical interest in the region is intricately linked and cannot be disassociated with its economic goals. The US as a global political power no longer exercises sole dominion in Southeast Asia. Over the last two (2) decades, the PRC has become the main trading partner for most Asian nations replacing the historic primacy of Asian linkages with the US and the West. China’s economic rise and success did not only win the admiration of Southeast Asian countries, but also helped Beijing establish strong trade and financial ties with them. In Lowy Institute’s 2023 report (Patton and Sato 2023) it concludes that China has been more influential than the US using a variety of indicators such as regional affect across four categories: economic relationships, defense networks, diplomatic influence, and cultural influence. Of the ten (10) Association Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the U.S. is the most influential power in only two: the Philippines, which is a U.S. treaty ally, and Singapore, which is a staunch U.S. partner Similarly, in a 2023 study by the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore found that a majority of respondents in a poll found that China was now the most dominant economic and political-strategic power in Southeast Asia. Given China's growing economic presence in the region as well as in the Philippines, the US is keen on offering a counterbalance. By increasing trade, investment, and development assistance, the US aims to offer the Philippines an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. This is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the Philippines remains open to American businesses and geopolitical interests. In May 2022, the Philippines and the US joined 12 other partners to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The Philippines and the US look forward to strengthening economic partnership on: trade; supply chains; clean energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure; and tax and anti-corruption. And more through the Global Infrastructure and Investment (GIP) in support of IPEF economies, human capital, and sustainability goals. In terms of trade and investment, US-Philippine relations are relatively strong -- $22.6 billion in total goods trade in 2023 and an estimated $10.6 billion in trade in services in 2022. The US is also the country’s largest export market and is one of the country’s largest foreign investors. In 2024, the US Commerce Secretary brought 22 U.S. companies to the Philippines to explore commercial opportunities, resulting in US1 billion in investment pledges. These economic momenta have to be built further and expanded towards the conclusion of President Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028 as well as Trump’s first term in office. Having elected US-oriented candidates and/or politicians who make decisions that impact on labour laws, education, transportation, trade, and taxes will ensure that policies and regulations with national application protect and safeguard US capital and investments as well as guarantee that multi-national corporations (MNCs) have undue advantage. Any shift in the current business environment which will be unconducive to US economic and commercial interest would be deeply concerning and troubling to US investors as this may affect their business and commercial future in the country. Summary Given U.S.’s geopolitical interest in the region, the Philippine mid-term elections is highly significant to warrant its possible intervention. U.S.’s keen concern is driven by strategic, economic, security, and diplomatic reasons. The Philippines plays a crucial role in the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy, and the outcome of these elections could have significant implications on the assertion of the Philippine right to self-determinaion as a sovereign and independent state on the one hand and the US geopolitical interest in the region on the other hand. Leaders elected in 2025 will shape the Philippines’ foreign policy and its alignment with either U.S.-led alliances or with China's sphere of influence. The U.S. may view these elections as a way to support candidates and policies that align with its vision for a 'free and open Indo-Pacific.' The results of the 2025 midterm elections will also help shape the 2028 presidential race. Politicians seeking higher office in 2028 will use this election to build momentum and expand their influence. President Marcos Jr.s’ declaration in his 2023 State of the Nation Address (SONA): 'Our independent foreign policy – a friend to all and enemy of none – has proven effective' is obviously out of touch of the reality as his foreign policy is neither independent nor all-embracing.

Is America Turning Fascist? – OpEd	By Vincent Cook On October 25, ABC News published the results of a survey of 2,392 registered voters where 44 percent of the respondents said that Donald Trump is a fascist, while 23 percent said that Kamala Harris is a fascist. There was even a 5 percent overlap between the two groups—respondents who characterized both Trump and Harris as fascists. Only 32 percent of the respondents thought that neither candidate is a fascist. Is America really in danger of turning fascist? The survey defined 'fascist' rather broadly as 'a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.' This definition is misleading (perhaps intentionally so), since most Americans view communism as being an alternative form of political extremism and would hesitate to apply the fascist label to any communist. If the question had been reworded to ask whether or not a given candidate was 'fascist or communist,' many more respondents would likely have moved Harris into the extremist category. Another difficulty is that the words like 'fascist' and 'Nazi' have been routinely used as fear-evoking smears for a very long time. One of the keenest critics of the political abuses of language, George Orwell, despairingly called attention to the ambiguity of the word 'fascism' in its ordinary usage in his 1944 newspaper article 'What is Fascism?': It will be seen that, as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley’s broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else. Yet underneath all this mess there does lie a kind of buried meaning. To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy to point out and not easy to explain away, between the régimes called Fascist and those called democratic. Secondly, if 'Fascist' means 'in sympathy with Hitler', some of the accusations I have listed above are obviously very much more justified than others. Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word 'Fascist' in every direction attach at any rate an emotional significance to it. By 'Fascism' they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come. But Fascism is also a political and economic system. Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one—not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make. All one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not, as is usually done, degrade it to the level of a swearword. There is little doubt that the word 'fascism' has been used in an equally-ambiguous manner lately, with President Biden explicitly using the word against Trump and partisan legacy media outlets supporting Biden’s accusation with witnesses claiming Trump wanted to coerce political opponents on various occasions by using military, police, or angry mobs and of resorting to viciously-racist rhetoric and policies, particularly regarding illegal immigrants. Conservative commentators, in turn, accused Democrats and Democrat-friendly elites and bureaucrats of instituting censorship of social media, of instigating frivolous prosecutions and litigation directed against Trump and his supporters, of funding violent street protesters, of engaging in fraudulent vote counts, and of concocting numerous fabrications and misrepresentations against Trump with the assistance of numerous members of the intelligence community. Suspicions were also aroused by at least two assassination attempts against Trump by individuals having unknown motives and affiliations. To assess if American political trends bear more than just a superficial resemblance to the original Italian model, it is important to take up Orwell’s 1944 challenge and provide a clear definition of what qualifies as fascism, and to better understand how democracies are transformed into fascist states. The original Italian promoters of Fascism, dictator Benito Mussolini, and idealist philosopher Giovanni Gentile, were prolific writers who authored numerous works attempting to explain and justify fascism, including Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals(1925), Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (1929), and The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism (1932). However, it is not easy to formulate a clear definition of fascism from their works, in part because they rejected all-encompassing ideological explanations for what they viewed as spontaneous political developments driven by the practical political needs of the moment. What does emerge as a positive doctrine in their works is an elevation of the state to the status of an Absolute (not unlike G.W.F. Hegel’s deification of the Prussian state)—an organic entity that supposedly gives spiritual meaning to life and actively creates nationhood, and where mere individuals (contra classical liberalism) or economic classes (contra Marxism) count for nothing except to the extent they are harmoniously integrated together as parts of the nation-state whole. Another clearcut fascist doctrine is that the interests of different states are irreconcilable and, therefore, a state must go to war with other states in order to prosper. Again, in 1944, three classical liberals cut through the conceptual fog that bedeviled Orwell, writing books warning about the dangers of fascism—American journalist John Flynn (As We Go Marching) and Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises (Omnipotent Government) and Friedrich von Hayek (The Road to Serfdom). Flynn and Hayek offered troubling political, economic, and ideological comparisons between the two leading fascist nations and western nations (America and Britain respectively), warning that the prevailing ideas and policies of the New Deal in America and of Labour partisans in Britain were leading those countries down the same road that Italy and Germany had followed. Mises and Hayek analyzed the ideological origins of fascist regimes and the causes of their political success, with a particular focus on the rise of Nazism in Germany. Flynn listed eight defining characteristics of a fascist social system: (1) Governmental powers are unrestrained (totalitarianism); (2) Governmental powers are concentrated in the hands of a dictator supported by a political elite (the leadership principle); (3) Production and distribution are in private hands, but directed by state planners ('public-private partnerships' or corporatism); (4) State regimentation of production is effected through regulations promulgated by immense bureaucracies; (5) Investments are also regimented through an integration of government and private finances ('industrial policy' and 'monetary policy'); (6) Consumption is also subjected to government planning on a large scale via the deficit-financing of government spending (e.g., welfarism, public works) and the creation of purchasing power (inflation); (7) Militarism is also embraced as an element of planned consumption; (8) Imperialism also follows as a consequence from militarism and other elements of fascism Flynn aligned with the original Italian fascists in associating fascism with totalitarianism, corporatism, and military conquest, but he notably cited neither nationalism nor racism in his definition. While many protest Flynn’s omission, Mussolini and Gentile tended towards the view that states made nations and peoples, not the other way around. Unlike many Nazis, they were not reflexive chauvinists or eugenicists. For them, the state, not the nation as such, always comes first. To be sure, demagogic appeals to nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, etc. can explain why totalitarians gain public support in specific instances. Mises and Hayek offered critical qualifications about this though. In their view, interventionism, welfarism, and inflationism are what ultimately destabilized economies, democratic institutions, and international peace in spite of sincere democratic intentions of most of those who instituted such policies. While it may be an obnoxious nationalist demagogue who delivers the final coup de grace to a democracy, one could never succeed in seizing power without the institutions and ideology of economic collectivism already being in place. The illiberal policies that caused the First World War and the Great Depression and the economic chaos following from those events were necessary antecedents to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. In the penultimate chapter of his book, Hayek also presciently warned that multinational institutions would fail to keep peace among nations if central planning to continued to exist, either by states at a national level or by supranational authorities at a global level—a severe rebuke to the 'anti-fascist' pretensions of contemporary Davos elites. America is indeed in serious danger of turning fascist; not specifically because Donald Trump won the election, but because partisans on both sides, together with globalist elites and Deep State operatives, have built a system with most of Flynn’s fascist elements already in place, lacking only a willful executive empowered by an enabling act.

Wealth Redistribution Is A Hidden Property Right Infringement – O...	In The Theory of Political Spectrum, I presented three critical factors that influence the polarization of political ideologies: attitudes toward private property rights, the state of consciousness, and the degree of wealth redistribution. The article demonstrates that an assault on private property, the collectivization of consciousness, or widespread and involuntary wealth redistribution—either individually or collectively—are methods of making society more oriented to socialism. The last factor, wealth redistribution, has a close relationship with private property rights but is often ignored by mainstream academics and policy analysts. They have become so accustomed to extensive social programs and progressive taxation as normal conditions of a modern state that they fail to recognize the underlying economic and moral flaws. Neglecting this factor overlooks the central role it played in the gradual adoption of evolutionary socialism in the United States. The Significance of Wealth Redistribution For decades, the U.S. fought against the global expansion of communism, positioning itself as the defender of capitalist ideals and individual freedoms. Yet, during this global struggle, evolutionary socialism quietly took root at home. Unlike revolutionary socialism, which seeks to overthrow the existing order through radical means, evolutionary socialism advances gradually, using legal and institutional mechanisms. One of the most effective tools in this process is wealth redistribution. Through taxation and social programs, evolutionary socialism embedded itself in American society without attracting much attention. The U.S. was vigilant against external threats but failed to recognize how wealth redistribution was being used as a subtle tactic to undermine private property rights and promote socialist ideals within the country. Wealth redistribution shifted resources from private individuals to the state, creating the foundation for a more collectivist approach to economic and social governance. Therefore, wealth redistribution is an extremely important factor. It is not just a policy of economic adjustment, but a tool that gradually shifts the power dynamics in society, eroding individual property rights and enabling the expansion of state control. Ignoring this factor allows evolutionary socialism to grow in the background, weakening the foundations of private enterprise and individual freedom. The Origin of Evolutionary Socialism Evolutionary socialism advocates for gradual and legal reforms to bring about socialist changes within a capitalist society. Its roots trace back to key figures and movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably Eduard Bernstein and the Fabian Society in Britain. Eduard Bernstein, a German Marxist and political theorist, argued that socialism was attainable through gradual, democratic reforms instead of violent revolution. His ideas, expressed in Evolutionary Socialism (1899), emphasized the potential for adaptation and evolution within capitalism. Therefore, socialism could be integrated into existing political systems through reforms like extending suffrage, labor rights, and social welfare. Bernstein’s ideas laid the foundation for what would later be known as democratic socialism or social democracy. At the same time, the Fabian Society in Britain pursued a similar approach. Members of the Fabian Society and Bernstein likely influenced each other. Founded in 1884, the Fabian Society sought to implement socialism progressively through education, political activism, and legislative reforms. Rejecting revolution, the Fabians believed in working within existing institutions to transform society deliberately. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolized their strategy of subtle infiltration. They used established systems to introduce socialist reforms without direct confrontation. The Fabian Society had a strong influence on British politics, particularly in shaping the Labour Party’s platform, and had a significant, albeit less pronounced, impact on progressive thought in the United States. Today, the Democratic Party has openly endorsed the principles of evolutionary socialism. It would be more accurate to call them the Social-Democratic Party, as many of their European counterparts have done. Unfortunately, the Republican Party has not only failed to counteract the collectivist reforms pushed by the Democrats over the years, but it has also started embracing left-leaning ideas. This drift has taken the party further from the rightist position of economic and individual freedom. Both parties now view the state as a major economic player and rely more on government solutions than on market forces. Progressive Taxation and Property Rights What follows is a simplified numerical exploration of how progressive taxation, a central mechanism of wealth redistribution, constantly infringes upon private property rights, leading to the slow erosion of financial returns on privately owned property. Consider the example of a private enterprise that owns 10 units of equipment, each costing $1,000. These units of equipment are used to produce commodities that generate a total profit of $100,000 after all expenses. Under a 10% tax rate, the business would pay $10,000 in taxes, leaving a net profit of $90,000. Each of the 10 units of equipment contributes equally to the total profit, meaning each unit accounts for $9,000 of the net profit. Now, suppose the government implements a progressive tax structure that increases the rate to 20% for profits at or above $100,000. Under this new system, the business would be taxed $20,000, leaving a net profit of only $80,000. In this scenario, ceteris paribus, each unit of equipment now contributes only $8,000 to the net profit. The progressive tax effectively reduces the profit generated by each unit by $1,000. Prior to the tax increase, it was possible to attain the same $80,000 net profit by utilizing only 9 units of equipment (since $80,000 / $9,000 = ~9 units), with each unit contributing $9,000 under the original 10% tax rate. The additional tax renders one unit of the businessman’s equipment economically redundant. Even though the proprietor still possesses and maintains all 10 units, the government has silently confiscated the value created by one of them through elevated taxation. This gradual and hidden assault on private property means that while the businessman maintains his equipment, the income it generates is partially appropriated by the state. Progressive taxation undermines the fundamental principle of private property by eroding the financial returns that property is meant to produce. Faced with this situation, the businessman may resort to certain measures to protect his property and profit. Rather than allowing the government to seize a portion of the value produced by his equipment, he may choose to sell one unit outright, reducing his total production capacity. For instance, if the businessman sells one unit of equipment for $1,000, leaving him with 9 units, he can limit his production to keep total profits below $100,000. This keeps him in the 10% tax bracket, maintaining a higher after-tax profit. This strategy demonstrates how progressive taxation incentivizes business owners to limit their productive capacity in order to protect their property. This scenario illustrates how progressive taxation undermines private property rights, not through direct confiscation, but by diminishing the value that property can generate. Over time, this creates a gradual erosion of the businessman’s wealth and economic power. As each tax increase forces him to either accept reduced profits or downsize his operations to avoid further losses, the result is a steady transfer of wealth and productive capacity from private individuals to the state, undermining the very foundation of private enterprise and property ownership. The Immorality of Wealth Redistribution Of course, contemporary humane society does not want its members to experience hardship or lead a miserable existence. There are indeed categories of people, such as the disabled or elderly, who genuinely need assistance. Ideally, such help would come from voluntary donations by individuals and private organizations, which would not only provide for those in need but also demonstrate the true compassion and generosity of a society. Voluntary charity reflects a community’s collective empathy and moral values, showing that people are willing to uplift others without coercion or the force of law.While some level of state involvement in providing a safety net is not entirely rejected, it should remain limited and targeted. Government intervention in assisting the most vulnerable can play a role, especially in areas where private charity may fall short. However, mandatory wealth redistribution through extensive taxation is both economically and morally flawed. When the primary goal of such redistribution is to eliminate so-called inequality, it punishes success and discourages initiative. Those who work hard, take risks, and create value are penalized, while an underclass is created for whom 'poverty' becomes a profitable lifestyle. This system disincentivizes personal responsibility and ambition, rewarding reliance on state benefits rather than encouraging self-sufficiency and economic mobility.Moreover, when wealth redistribution is framed as a solution to economic inequality, it perpetuates a narrative of entitlement and resentment. The focus shifts from creating opportunities for growth and innovation to redistributing the achievements of others. Rather than fostering a society where people are motivated to strive for success, such policies breed stagnation, where personal effort is devalued, and the rewards of hard work are forcibly taken to subsidize those who may lack the same drive. In the long run, this undermines the moral fabric of a free and productive society, fostering a culture where dependence on government aid becomes normalized, and individual liberty is eroded.

The EU’s Dual Approach: Green Subsidies And Tariffs On China EVs ...	On October 29, 2024, the European Commission unveiled new countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports, effective the following day. This move is framed as part of a broader aggressive strategy to safeguard European industries, but it overlooks a significant reality. The EU itself has long been an active player in subsidizing its own green transition, including the EV sector. Recent EU statistics reveal that Brussels and its member states have poured substantial financial support into the 'new trio' industries—lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, and electric vehicles—through a mix of grants, tax breaks, low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and price subsidies. These subsidies, which are often justified by the need to boost competitiveness and drive regional development, have granted the EU a commanding role in emerging industries. Although the EU has rules to limit state funding, it has allowed member states to provide targeted financial support. On top of this, the EU itself has established dedicated funds for direct grants. In 2022 alone, the EU allocated a staggering 25 billion euros to solar power through its various financial mechanisms. This extensive dual-channel support, blending EU funds with member-state aid, has given European green industries a major competitive edge, which stands in sharp contrast to the tariffs now imposed on China’s own green transition. The European Union, under the pretext of advancing the green transition and aiding underdeveloped regions, has created an extensive network of at least 11 subsidy funds targeting emerging industries like lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and electric vehicles. These funds, including the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), Horizon Europe, and the Just Transition Fund, among others, form a robust financial infrastructure designed to fuel the EU’s competitive edge. With the EU’s strategic investment in these sectors, the bloc aims to dominate critical green technologies even as China’s similar efforts are increasingly met with tariffs and restrictions. As of April 2024, the RRF has allocated 87.9 billion euros to sustainable transportation projects, particularly in zero- and low-emission vehicles, reinforcing the EU’s green agenda. Horizon Europe, with a total budget of 93.5 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period, has already dispersed 22.7 million euros to bolster research and innovation. Meanwhile, the Innovation Fund, fueled by EU carbon emissions trading revenue, is expected to grant at least 40 billion euros by 2030 to advance low-carbon technologies. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), with a defined objective of narrowing the development gap between regions, has allocated 104.3 billion euros from 2021 to 2027. This sum will support green initiatives like energy transitions and sustainable urban mobility, furthering the EU’s low-emission agenda. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) also plays a crucial role, investing in interconnected, high-performance trans-European networks. From 2021 to 2022 alone, the CEF awarded 1.66 billion euros to 18 energy projects, spanning electricity, carbon dioxide, and renewable energy. The European Union’s focus on electric vehicles has elevated the battery industry as a key player, with EU funds pouring substantial support into this sector. Among the 'new trio' industries, battery projects have garnered the largest subsidies, often covering over half of their total costs. Horizon Europe, for instance, allocated 873 million euros to 307 battery R&D initiatives between 2014 and 2020. The Innovation Fund provided 161 million euros to eight battery projects from 2021 to 2022. Meanwhile, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) channeled 319 million euros into 459 battery-related initiatives across 14 member states. By 2023, the European Union had also firmly committed to the electrification of its transport sector, with all 27 member states enacting at least one electric vehicle (EV) consumption subsidy policy. These efforts have largely been driven by tax incentives and direct grants, offering substantial financial support for EV adoption. Among the frontrunners, Germany stands out, having allocated a remarkable 10 billion euros in subsidies to foster electric vehicle adoption. It has also extended motor vehicle tax exemptions for electric vehicles multiple times since 2012, including a 10-year circulation tax exemption for EVs, which began in 2016. Also that year, Germany introduced the 'Government Programme for Electric Mobility' by committing 1.2 billion euros for environmental bonuses for electric and plug-in hybrid cars, alongside 300 million euros to expand charging infrastructure. France, meanwhile, offers a 50 percent reduction on registration fees and a full exemption on license plate registration for both fully electric and hybrid vehicles. Spain, in 2023, introduced a 15 percent personal income tax reduction for electric vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, with deductions reaching up to 20,000 euros for EVs and 4,000 euros for chargers. Grants, too, play a crucial role in the push for EV consumption across the EU. France’s 8 billion euro 'Automotive Industry Revitalization Plan,' launched in 2020, includes direct subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, alongside trade-in bonuses for consumers who replace older fossil-fuel cars with greener alternatives. Locally, 131 cities in the Paris metropolitan area have offered varying degrees of aid to EV buyers. As the European Union escalates its efforts to counter Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports with new tariffs, subsidies often account for over half of the budget for many green initiatives. These subsidy programs—aimed at bolstering its green industries—have already reshaped the market, giving European companies an undeniable edge. Rather than hastily imposing punitive tariffs on China, the EU should instead foster a global, cooperative effort to advance green technologies, ensuring a fair, competitive, and sustainable EV market for all.

Trump’s Multiethnic Winning Coalition – OpEd	Go on, admit it. Don’t be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of 5–6 November? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump’s 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by three million votes (two percent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four percent). This time he won the popular vote by three million (76-73) and two percent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a ‘beautiful,’ ‘historical realignment’ in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In an NBC exit poll, Trump won 57 percent of white and 55 percent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In an AP exit poll, he won 20 percent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris’s 80 percent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden’s four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 percent of Latinos, 39 percent of Asian-Americans, 54 percent of ‘Other,’ 45 percent of women, and 43 percent of 18–29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump’s success in creating a new multiethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in an AP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases like the Latino, black, or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Traditional Voter Concerns Beat Woke Neoliberalism Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing in The Globe and Mail in reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as ‘manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself.’ His take on the outcome? ‘Sometimes the people get it wrong.’ He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that ‘this election was not an indictment’ of Harris but ‘an indictment of America.’ At least one Guardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the ‘simple, inescapable message’ from Trump’s victory is that ‘many people despise the left’ with progressives seen as ‘one judgmental, 'woke' mass.’ Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that ‘America is the greatest country in the world’ where ‘most people can make it if they work hard,’ again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump’s 14-point advantage among voters without college degrees flips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 percent of Americans admitted to having skipped meals to keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on 4 November. Speaking at his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: ‘We don’t need a star because we have policy.’ She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was ‘I am not Trump. I am not Biden.’ This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles, and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. Even Taylor Swift’s hometown of Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in the Wall Street Journal, it was ‘a landslide against the media’ (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the ‘quadfecta’ of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy, some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year’s Voice referendum here in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris’s massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they’d become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big ‘FU’ in return, just like with the Voice down under. Growing the Trump Voter Base There isn’t just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn’t one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to a Forbes analysis, Harris’s six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 percent Latino population that hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 percent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, the needle moved 20 points towards Trump from 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian’s off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, which Biden carried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris’s appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN’s exit poll shows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites, and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump’s new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women’s rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. The CNN exit poll confirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations too see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They too object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are wracked with guilt over historical sins like slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. Democracy Under Threat In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14 million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden’s cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris’s fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they’ve returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris’s concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world’s diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump’s efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris’ watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showed immigration and the economy as the voters’ top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 percent support. A Win for Women’s Rights against Trans Colonisation of Female Spaces The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don’t subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don’t believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don’t support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don’t obsess over personal pronouns, and don’t lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump’s disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people’s concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump’s counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year, 69 percent of Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trump gained three points from both. How could this be: Isn’t he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and ‘My Body, My Choice’ with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade in June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was 1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 percent jump from 625,978 in 2021 before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and the highest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don’t feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn’t align with the joy vibe and there’s something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don’t back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it’s a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpeted gender gap worked to Trump’s net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn’t even excite the young. About 39 percent of young women and 42 percent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 percent and 8 percent picked abortion. Trump won 40 percent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden’s margin by 19 points. He won among under-30 men by 14 percent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent $175 million on TV ads across the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent $123 millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: ‘Kamala’s For They/Them. President Trump is for you’ was exceptionally effective. The New York Timesreported on 7 November on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by a stunning 2.7 percent towards Trump after viewers watched it. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia’s critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. Indo-Americans For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups’ sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. Speaking at a function in Mumbai on 10 November, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that ‘a lot of countries are nervous about the US…We are not one of them.’ He said that Modi’s call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India’s global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are 5.2 million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations, and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It’s worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over 700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 percent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 percent for Biden in 2020. Harris’s share fell again to 60 percent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 percent, up from 22 percent in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation’s elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump’s Republican Party offer important clues on Trump’s appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

US Congressional Leadership Remains United In Devotion To Israel ...	Some things changed in politics in Washington, DC when on Wednesday Republican United States senators via a secret ballot vote selected Sen John Thune (R-SD) to become Senate Republican leader, replacing Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in the position. One of the things that remained the same, though, was that the Senate Republican leader position, along with the other three top leadership positions — Republican and Democrat — in the Senate and House of Representatives, remains held by a politician espousing devotion to the government of Israel and its war effort. In July of 2022, I wrote about the peculiar situation where these top congressional leaders were then as well lined up in adamant support for the Israel government despite the fact that Americans’ views regarding the Middle East nation were roughly evenly divided between favorable and negative views. Of the people then holding the four top Republican and Democratic leadership positions in Congress, only Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) remains in the group. Nonetheless, the unanimity in over-the-top support for Israel persists, irrespective of how out of step it is with the thinking of the American people, even as over the last year Americans have increasingly opposed the US government’s unwavering supplying of military and intelligence support for Israel waging its expanding war with catastrophic consequences. In January of 2023, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), a die-hard supporterof the Israel government, became the top Democratic leader in the House. Then, when Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted from the House speaker position in the fall of 2023, something astounding happened: All 11 candidates to succeed him as speaker — including ultimate winner Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) — had expressed both their devotion to Israel and their devotion to the US supporting Israel in Israel’s war. Continuing the trend, all three Senate majority leader candidates — Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) — competing last week were express devotees of the US government supporting Israel generally, as well as supporting Israel’s war effort. Cornyn made his devotion to Israel and its war crystal clear in an October 3 Dallas Morning News editorial titled 'America’s Next Commander in Chief Must Unapologetically Support Israel.' In the editorial, he declared: Support for Israel ought to transcend party lines, religion, race and ethnicity. This is not an issue of opinion; this is a battle of right and wrong, of good and evil. Israel is our most steadfast ally in the Middle East, and it deserves our full support, both in words and action.I was honored to visit Israel earlier this year, and I was also extremely proud to have voted for widely-supported legislation that sent critical aid and military resources to Israel. Scott in, of all places, his America First plank of his Rescue America plan put succinctly his dedication to supporting Israel. 'We will always defend our allies, starting with Israel,' Scott’s plan declares. Further, Scott made this promise in a September speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Summit: 'And, as Senate leader, you can count on support for Israel and protection for our Jewish communities being top priorities.' In the speech, Scott also declared: We need to show up for our friends and family in Israel right now. We need them to know we are with them, we will show up and we will fight with them. Thune, the winner of the Senate Republican leader race, is on the same page as his Senate Republican leader race opponents in regard to Israel. Thune wrote an editorial last month titled 'America Must Support Israeli Victory.' In the editorial, the senator criticized the Biden administration for not doing enough for Israel. This is the administration that has been pumping out weapons, intelligence, and military support to Israel at an incredible pace to aid Israel’s pursuit of its expanding war. After criticizing what he refers to as the Biden administration’s 'tepid support for Israel at a time when it needs a strong ally in the United States,' Thune declared the US 'needs to stand strongly with Israel as it faces enemies from every side that threaten its very existence.' And what did Thune do upon winning the leadership race? Thune called the prime minister of Israel, posting at Twitter for all to see a picture of Thune on the phone along with this message: 'Spoke with Prime Minister @netanyahu and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to standing with Israel, our closest friend and ally.' The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Monetary Policy: Donald Trump Versus Jerome Powell? – OpEd	President-elect Trump has, in the past, been at odds with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on monetary policy. Trump will likely favor lower interest rates and an easier monetary policy than Powell. However, Powell and the Fed act independently of the presidency, at least nominally, and when asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to, Powell said no. Powell has said he’s reluctant to lower interest rates until there’s good evidence that inflation is headed toward the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Such evidence will be difficult to come by in the next few months. It is unlikely that prices will continue their downward trend over the rest of the year. Recently released inflation data for October show that consumer prices rose by 2.6% over the past calendar year, which does not look that close to 2% to me. However, prices fell in November and December of 2023. Since the beginning of 2024, prices have risen by 2.9%. Any uptick in prices over the next two months will place the inflation rate for all of 2024 at or above 3%. Should that occur, it would appear from Powell’s comments that he would be reluctant to lower interest rates early in 2025 at the beginning of Trump’s term. That will put his agenda at odds with Trump’s. I expect some critical comments from Trump to be launched Powell’s way.

Why Putin Should Ignore Biden’s Pathetic ATACMS Provocation – OpE...	As provocations go, the latest by President Joe Biden to permit the use of long-range missile strikes on Russia is certainly audacious. But, ultimately, in practice, it is a pathetic gesture by a lame-duck president that will have no impact on Russia’s anticipated military victory against the NATO-armed Kiev regime. Biden’s reported decision is a desperate last-bid gamble to incite an escalation with Russia and to sabotage incoming plans by President-elect Trump to end the conflict in Ukraine. Biden’s move is reckless, reprehensible, and odious. But it should not be given any credibility as a serious threat. Russia would be best to ignore it. Of course, Russia has to defend itself against any increased potential threat to its territory that such weapons may pose. Nevertheless, Moscow should continue exercising the strategic restraint that President Putin is renowned for, and not retaliate over the provocation. Understandably, Russian politicians and media have reacted furiously to U.S. media reports that Biden gave the Ukrainian military the green light to deploy American-made ATACMS for striking deep into Russian territory. The ground-launched Mach-3 supersonic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometers. The audacity and arrogance of the American ruling class knows no bounds. It has sanctioned Russia to the hilt (to no avail mind you), it has weaponized a NeoNazi regime in Kiev, it has killed civilians in the Russian territory of Crimea already with ATACMS, and so on. Now Biden is ramping up the assault capability deep into Russia. Two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that if the U.S. took such a move, then it would dramatically alter the very essence of the conflict in Ukraine, one where Moscow would see the United States and its NATO partners as 'direct participants' in a war against Russia. Putin’s reasoning was correct. The deployment of ATACMS and other sophisticated long-range missiles against Russia would inescapably mean that American and NATO personnel were manning these systems. The Ukrainian military – riven with desertion, in disarray, and suffering from poor morale – would not be capable of targeting and operating such munitions. The use of ATACMS, or air-launched JASSMs, and the British and French Storm Shadow and Scalp cruise missiles to hit Russia is tantamount to NATO’s direct involvement in a war against Russia. The implication of what Putin said was grave and potentially catastrophic. If the Western states took that step, the result could mean an all-out war between nuclear powers. When Putin issued his stark warning in September, Biden and other Western leaders, including Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, appeared at the time to heed it and back down from considerations to permit the Ukrainian regime to use long-range missiles against Russia. Now, however, Biden has flipped to finally give his approval, according to reports. The style of anonymous U.S. officials briefing the New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated psychological operation. What has changed? Simple. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on November 5 with a resounding victory in defiance of the political establishment that wanted Kamala Harris to win. The Republican president-elect takes over in two months when he is inaugurated on January 20. Trump has repeatedly said he will negotiate an end to the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine, which has seen the U.S. and NATO allies bankroll a corrupt regime in Ukraine to the tune of $200 billion. And yet after all that obscene wasting of Western public money to bloat the war machine, Russia is going to defeat the NATO proxy. The stakes for NATO’s future and the Western imperialist war machine could not be higher. The impressive electoral mandate for Trump suggests that the American public wants the U.S. warmongering to stop and for their mounting economic and social needs to be taken care of as a priority. Under Trump, the war racket could well be over. His nomination last week of Tulsi Gabbard – an outspoken critic of the NATO proxy war in Ukraine – as his Director of National Intelligence is a major sign of his bold intentions of negotiating a diplomatic settlement to the conflict. That means the end of the blood money flowing into the coffers of the Western military-industrial complex and Wall Street. Biden and the Democrat candidate Kamala Harris were the puppets of the war racket. To perform well, they mouthed endless Russophobia, making negotiations impossible with Moscow, and they swore to keep the conflict in Ukraine going 'for as long as it takes.' European leaders like Starmer, Macron, and Scholz are equally contemptible. As Biden packs his bags for his overdue retirement, he is rendering desperate last-minute services to the war racket that lies at the putrid heart of American capitalism. Last week, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken (another non-entity puppet) said the Biden administration would release a further $9 billion in military aid to Ukraine so that it could keep fighting the war well into next year. Likewise, the reported green light from Biden on the use of long-range missiles is another ploy to keep the war racket going. Trump could reverse the decision when he enters the White House, but over the next two months, the Biden administration seems to be trying to sabotage Trump’s peace intentions by escalating the conflict to a dangerous point of no return. Russia should not take the bait. For a start, the United States does not have a large supply of ATACMS to give to Ukraine. Any use of these missiles will be limited. The Kiev regime’s so-called president Vladimir Zelensky – he canceled elections months ago and rules by decree – has no chance of stopping the rapidly advancing victory of Russian forces, even with a few ATACMS. No, this is not about defending Ukraine or enabling Zelensky’s ridiculous 'victory plan'. It’s all about the American-led Western imperialist deep state wanting to provoke Russia into a dreadful escalation to keep the war profits churning. Biden’s gesture is reckless, but it is something that should be treated with contempt. As he wanders off to the oblivion of his retirement dementia, people will soon forget about this failed politician. His 50-year career was one long shift of prostituting for U.S. imperialism. Legally, Russia could respond to Biden’s provocation with reciprocal attacks on U.S. and NATO sites. But such an escalation is exactly what the imperialist deep state of the U.S. and its NATO lackeys are betting on. The provocative gesture is more symbolic than a substantive threat. Russia should ignore it and focus on demolishing the NATO proxy regime in Kiev, and with that, thereby deal a fatal blow to U.S. and NATO credibility.

From One ‘Ism’ To Another: The Artistic Evolution Through Time – ...	Art, as a mirror of society, evolves dynamically over time. Movements, or 'isms', influence one another through reactions, innovations, and reinterpretations. These shifts are not merely aesthetic; they often embody changing cultural, political, and technological landscapes. From the grandeur of the Renaissance to the provocations of modern and postmodern art, each era contributes to an ongoing dialogue. Movements build upon the ideas of their predecessors, either by challenging established norms or refining them. The 'isms' of art do not emerge from a vacuum; rather, they are the continuation of a rich tradition or traditions that stretch back to the ancient era. Ancient art is the foundation upon which many modern movements and techniques were built. Emerging in prehistoric times, art served not only as a form of personal expression but also as a means of documenting history, religion, and daily life. Early cave paintings, like those found in Lascaux, France, reveal humanity's desire to communicate and connect with the environment and the spiritual world. As civilizations developed, the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans refined their artistic techniques, focusing on idealized forms and proportionality. Egyptian art, for example, adhered to strict conventions to convey the eternity and order of life. Greek and Roman art, on the other hand, emphasized humanism, exploring themes of beauty, the human body, and the natural world in greater depth. The Gothic period (12th–16th centuries) marked another important shift, with a focus on spirituality, complex architecture, and the human experience. Figures such as Giotto di Bondone, whose naturalistic approach to painting marked a shift towards realism, and Abbot Suger, who played a pivotal role in the development of Gothic architecture through his work on the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exemplify this era's innovations. Gothic art, particularly in cathedrals and stained glass, brought a new focus on light, verticality, and ornate detail. This style, deeply connected with religious themes, laid the foundation for the humanism of the Renaissance. Ancient and medieval art laid the groundwork for classical ideas that would later inspire Renaissance artists and beyond. From sculpture to pottery to murals, the flow of art demonstrates human creativity and the desire to represent and understand the world. The evolution of these early styles, though distinct in different regions, set the stage for the major movements that would follow, influencing generations of artists. Studying the progression of artistic movements, from ancient to modern times, offers invaluable insight into the evolving nature of human expression, culture, and society. Each 'ism' in art history reflects the unique concerns, ideologies, and advancements of its time, providing a window into the past and a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped civilization. By tracing the influence of one movement on another, we can better comprehend how cultural, political, and intellectual shifts influence creative expression. Art history also highlights the interplay between innovation and tradition, as artists respond to, reinterpret, or challenge established norms. Furthermore, understanding the lineage of art movements allows us to appreciate the enduring relevance of classical ideas and their transformation over time. These studies are not just about art for art's sake; they help us understand the broader social and psychological contexts in which these works were created. By studying art movements and their interconnections, we can cultivate a greater appreciation for how art shapes and reflects human history, inspiring future generations of artists and thinkers. This article explores influential transitions, shedding light on how one artistic philosophy inspires and informs the next, creating a continuous and interconnected history of creativity. Early Modern Movements 1. Renaissance → Mannerism The Renaissance celebrated realism, symmetry, and classical ideals, reaching its zenith through masters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. However, Mannerism emerged as a response, pushing boundaries with elongated forms and exaggerated perspectives. Mannerist artists such as Pontormo and Parmigianino sought to explore emotional intensity and complexity, moving beyond the harmonious ideals of the Renaissance. This transition marked a shift towards more experimental, personal expressions of art, reflecting the tensions and uncertainties of the late 16th century. Mannerism, thus, challenged the structured beauty of the Renaissance, paving the way for new artistic explorations that embraced ambiguity and distortion. 2. Mannerism → Baroque Baroque art followed Mannerism, emphasizing grandeur, drama, and movement. Artists like Caravaggio used chiaroscuro to heighten emotional impact, while Bernini's sculptures conveyed intense energy and spirituality. Rooted in the Counter-Reformation, Baroque art aimed to inspire awe and devotion among viewers. This movement embraced Mannerism's emotional depth but balanced it with a sense of clarity and purpose. Baroque art's theatricality and dynamic compositions marked a dramatic shift, reflecting the religious and political fervor of the 17th century. Through its elaborate forms and striking visuals, Baroque became a powerful tool for storytelling and spiritual engagement. 3. Baroque → Rococo As the Baroque period waned, Rococo emerged in 18th-century France, shifting from grandeur to lighthearted elegance. Artists like Fragonard favored playful themes, pastel hues, and intricate ornamentation, reflecting the leisure and decadence of the French aristocracy. While Baroque art sought to inspire awe, Rococo emphasized intimacy and sensuality. The movement's decorative style extended to architecture and interior design, celebrating refinement and frivolity. However, Rococo's emphasis on indulgence faced criticism during the Enlightenment, setting the stage for the rise of Neoclassicism. Despite this, its focus on beauty and detail remains influential in decorative arts and design. 4. Rococo → Neoclassicism Neoclassicism arose as a reaction against Rococo's perceived excess, drawing inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art. Artists like Jacques-Louis David championed moral seriousness, simplicity, and symmetry, aligning with Enlightenment ideals. The movement reflected a broader cultural shift towards rationality and civic virtue, particularly during the French Revolution. Neoclassical art used clean lines and heroic themes to convey timeless values and universal truths. This transition from Rococo's frivolity to Neoclassicism's discipline mirrored changing societal priorities. By reviving classical antiquity, Neoclassicism established a foundation for modern art's emphasis on form and function. 5. Neoclassicism → Romanticism Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a counterpoint to Neoclassicism's rationality, celebrating emotion, nature, and individualism. Artists like Caspar David Friedrich and William Blake explored themes of the sublime, depicting nature as a source of beauty and terror. Romanticism also embraced subjectivity, imagination, and the mystical, challenging Enlightenment ideals. This movement reflected the upheavals of the Industrial Revolution and societal shifts towards personal freedom. By prioritizing the emotional and the transcendental, Romanticism influenced literature, music, and art, creating a profound legacy that continues to resonate in creative expression. Modern and Pre-Modern Movements 6. Romanticism → Realism Realism emerged as a reaction to Romanticism's idealism, focusing on everyday life and social realities. Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet depicted rural labor and ordinary people with unvarnished honesty, rejecting Romantic heroism. This movement reflected the societal changes brought by industrialization and urbanization, highlighting class struggles and human dignity. Realism's commitment to truth-telling laid the groundwork for modern art's explorations of contemporary themes. By turning attention to the mundane and the overlooked, Realism expanded art's scope, encouraging artists to engage with their environments and present authentic narratives. 7. Realism → Impressionism Building upon Realism's focus on contemporary life, Impressionism explored fleeting moments and the effects of light. Artists like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas painted en plein air, capturing the vibrancy of modernity in loose brushstrokes and vibrant palettes. Impressionism broke from academic traditions, prioritizing immediacy and sensory experience over meticulous detail. This movement reflected the rapid transformations of 19th-century urban life, including industrialization and leisure culture. By emphasizing spontaneity and movement, Impressionism paved the way for further experimentation, challenging conventions and inspiring future generations of artists. 8. Impressionism → Post-Impressionism Post-Impressionism extended Impressionism's innovations, emphasizing emotion, symbolism, and structure. Artists like Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin moved beyond capturing fleeting impressions, exploring deeper psychological and spiritual themes. Paul Cézanne's focus on form and geometry laid the foundation for Cubism, while van Gogh's emotive color use influenced Expressionism. This movement bridged the gap between Impressionism's lightness and modern art's abstraction. By reinterpreting Impressionist techniques, Post-Impressionists expanded the possibilities of visual storytelling, fostering a diverse range of artistic expressions that shaped the 20th-century avant-garde. 9. Post-Impressionism → Fauvism Inspired by Post-Impressionism's bold use of color, Fauvism emphasized emotional power and aesthetic freedom. Henri Matisse and André Derain used vivid, non-naturalistic colors to create works that resonated with energy and joy. Fauvism sought to liberate color from its descriptive function, focusing on its expressive potential. This movement rejected realism, embracing abstraction as a tool for personal and emotional exploration. Although short-lived, Fauvism's radical approach to color and form profoundly influenced later movements like Expressionism and Abstract Art, marking a turning point in the evolution of modern art. 10. Post-Impressionism → Expressionism Similarly, Expressionism built on Post-Impressionism's emotional depth, channeling personal and societal anxiety into bold, distorted imagery. Artists like Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele depicted raw emotion, often using dark palettes and exaggerated forms to convey existential themes. Expressionism reflected the turmoil of early 20th-century Europe, addressing themes of alienation and psychological conflict. This movement expanded the boundaries of artistic expression, paving the way for Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. By prioritizing emotion over realism, Expressionism inspired artists to explore the inner workings of the human psyche, fostering a profound legacy of introspective creativity. 20th Century Avant-Garde Movements 11. Expressionism → Surrealism Expressionism's exploration of emotion and psychological depth influenced Surrealism, which delved into the unconscious mind. Inspired by Freud's theories, Surrealist artists like Salvador Dalí and Max Ernst created dreamlike, fantastical images. Surrealism extended Expressionism's introspection, adding a focus on the irrational and the mysterious. While Expressionism depicted emotional struggles, Surrealism sought to visualize the hidden and surreal aspects of human experience. This movement celebrated the unpredictable, challenging traditional artistic boundaries. By combining Expressionism's intensity with new intellectual frameworks, Surrealism expanded the horizons of art, influencing not only visual mediums but also literature, film, and theater. 12. Fauvism → Cubism While Fauvism celebrated color, Cubism deconstructed form. Pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism fragmented objects into geometric shapes, presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously. Fauvism's simplified forms inspired Cubism's break from realism, but Cubism pursued intellectual depth rather than Fauvism's emotive expression. This movement reflected the rapidly changing perceptions of space and time in the early 20th century, influenced by scientific advancements and industrialization. Cubism's innovative approach redefined art, inspiring Futurism, Abstract Art, and beyond. Its radical departure from tradition positioned it as one of the most influential movements in modern art. 13. Cubism → Futurism Cubism's fragmented representation of space and motion profoundly influenced Futurism, which celebrated speed, technology, and modernity. Italian artists like Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla embraced Cubist techniques to depict the dynamism of the machine age. Futurism extended Cubism's geometric abstraction, incorporating movement and energy into its compositions. This movement was deeply intertwined with the cultural and political fervor of early 20th-century Europe, reflecting the era's fascination with progress and innovation. By merging Cubism's aesthetic with a celebration of modernity, Futurism contributed to the avant-garde's ongoing redefinition of art's role in society. 14. Cubism → Abstract Art Cubism's reduction of form also influenced Abstract Art, which moved towards complete non-representation. Wassily Kandinsky, often credited as the first abstract painter, expanded on Cubism's innovations, focusing on the spiritual and emotional resonance of color and shape. Abstract Art rejected the need for recognizable subjects, emphasizing the expressive power of visual elements themselves. Inspired by Cubism's intellectual rigor, this movement opened new avenues for artistic exploration. By prioritizing abstraction, artists like Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian transformed art into a medium for universal ideas, laying the groundwork for countless modern movements. 15. Dadaism → Surrealism Dadaism's anti-establishment ethos and embrace of absurdity directly influenced Surrealism. Emerging during World War I, Dada artists like Marcel Duchamp rejected traditional art forms, instead using readymades and nonsensical works to critique societal norms. Surrealists adopted this rebellious spirit, channeling it into explorations of dreams and subconscious thought. While Dadaism embraced chaos and randomness, Surrealism sought to uncover deeper psychological truths. The two movements shared a disdain for conventional art, challenging viewers to question reality itself. By merging Dada's playfulness with intellectual depth, Surrealism created a lasting impact on modern art and culture. Abstract and Conceptual Developments 16. Suprematism → Constructivism Suprematism, led by Kazimir Malevich, emphasized pure geometric abstraction, stripping art of representational content. Constructivism built upon these principles, focusing on the practical application of abstract forms in design, architecture, and propaganda. Artists like Vladimir Tatlin used art to serve societal needs, aligning with the Russian Revolution's ethos. While Suprematism prioritized spiritual purity, Constructivism embraced functionality and materiality. This transition reflected a broader shift in art's purpose, moving from individual expression to collective utility. By merging abstraction with practicality, Constructivism laid the foundation for modern design and industrial aesthetics. 17. Constructivism → De Stijl Constructivism's geometric rigor influenced De Stijl, a movement dedicated to achieving universal harmony through abstraction. Artists like Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg reduced forms to vertical and horizontal lines, using primary colors to create balanced compositions. De Stijl expanded on Constructivism's ideas, seeking to integrate art, architecture, and design into a cohesive aesthetic. This movement reflected the modernist desire for order and clarity in a rapidly industrializing world. By focusing on simplicity and universality, De Stijl shaped modern art and design, influencing movements like the Bauhaus and Minimalism. 18. De Stijl → Bauhaus The Bauhaus movement drew heavily from De Stijl's minimalist aesthetic, combining art with functionality. Founded by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to unify creative disciplines, integrating art, design, and architecture. De Stijl's emphasis on geometric abstraction informed Bauhaus principles, particularly in its approach to modernist design. Bauhaus artists like Paul Klee and Josef Albers expanded these ideas, applying them to mass production and industrial design. This movement revolutionized art education and practice, emphasizing the intersection of beauty and utility. By adapting De Stijl's ideals, the Bauhaus became a cornerstone of 20th-century modernism. 19. Bauhaus → Minimalism Minimalism grew out of Bauhaus principles, embracing simplicity, form, and function. Artists like Donald Judd and Agnes Martin reduced art to its essential elements, stripping away ornamentation. Minimalism rejected narrative and symbolism, focusing instead on materiality and spatial relationships. The movement reflected Bauhaus ideas about industrial design, but it also responded to Abstract Expressionism's emotive excess. By prioritizing clarity and precision, Minimalism reshaped contemporary art, architecture, and design. Its influence extends beyond the visual arts, permeating fields like fashion, music, and technology. 20. Abstract Expressionism → Pop Art Abstract Expressionism's bold, emotive gestures influenced Pop Art's dynamic imagery. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein adapted the scale and immediacy of Abstract Expressionism but replaced abstraction with recognizable cultural symbols. Pop Art celebrated consumer culture and mass media, critiquing post-war materialism. This movement merged high and low art, reflecting the changing nature of modern society. By reinterpreting Abstract Expressionism's techniques in a commercial context, Pop Art created a new visual language, bridging the avant-garde and popular culture. Postmodern and Contemporary Movements 21. Pop Art → Postmodernism Pop Art's critique of consumer culture set the stage for Postmodernism's broader challenge to traditional narratives. Postmodern artists embraced pastiche, irony, and fragmentation, rejecting the notion of universal truth. Movements like Neo-Pop and Appropriation Art drew directly from Pop Art's playfulness and critique. By deconstructing cultural symbols, Postmodernism questioned authority and celebrated diversity. This transition reflected shifting societal attitudes towards pluralism and subjectivity. Postmodernism's legacy continues to shape contemporary art, design, and media. 22. Minimalism → Conceptual Art Minimalism's emphasis on essential forms influenced Conceptual Art, which prioritized ideas over physical objects. Artists like Sol LeWitt and Joseph Kosuth focused on intellectual engagement, using text, instructions, and ephemeral materials to convey meaning. This movement redefined the art object, challenging viewers to rethink traditional notions of creativity and authorship. By expanding Minimalism's reductive approach, Conceptual Art opened new possibilities for artistic expression, influencing installation, performance, and digital art. 23. Conceptual Art → Performance Art Conceptual Art's focus on ideas extended into Performance Art, where the artist's body and actions became the medium. Marina Abramović and Yoko Ono used performance to explore themes of identity, endurance, and audience interaction. Performance Art rejected static forms, emphasizing temporality and experience. This transition reflected a broader shift towards participatory and experiential art. By merging Conceptual Art's intellectualism with live action, Performance Art created a new dialogue between artist and viewer. 24. Performance Art → Installation Art Performance Art's immersive qualities influenced Installation Art, which engaged viewers in spatial and sensory experiences. Artists like Olafur Eliasson and Yayoi Kusama created environments that blurred the boundaries between art and audience. Installation Art expanded the scope of artistic practice, incorporating light, sound, and technology. This movement reflected a desire to create holistic, multisensory experiences. By building on Performance Art's dynamism, Installation Art transformed how audiences interact with art, redefining its role in contemporary culture. 25. Surrealism → Psychedelic Art Surrealism's exploration of altered realities inspired the vibrant, fantastical imagery of Psychedelic Art in the 1960s. Artists embraced vivid colors, swirling forms, and mystical themes, reflecting countercultural movements and interest in altered states of consciousness. This movement reinterpreted Surrealism's dreamlike qualities, infusing them with a sense of rebellion and experimentation. Psychedelic Art's influence extended beyond visual media, shaping music, fashion, and graphic design. Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Continuum of Art Art movements are rarely isolated phenomena; they are threads in a larger tapestry of human expression. Each 'ism' carries the DNA of its predecessors while carving new paths for the future. This interconnectedness not only reflects the evolution of artistic thought but also mirrors broader cultural, social, and technological transformations. As artists continue to innovate, the legacy of past movements ensures that the dialogue between tradition and experimentation remains vibrant and enduring.

Time For A Regional Response To An Emboldened Trump – OpEd	When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, the conventional wisdom was that we should take him seriously but not literally. This time, we ought to take him literally, too. Since his victory, he has announced a number of appointments — Robert F Kennedy for Health Secretary; Pete Hegseth for Defence; Marco Rubio for State; and Michael Waltz as National Security Adviser, to name a few — that suggests that the major ruptures promised during his campaign are likely to come to pass. Trump’s economic objectives are mutually incoherent: he wants to replace income taxes with tariffs, rebuild American manufacturing and keep inflation low. But the more effective his tariffs are in promoting domestic industries, the less revenue they will raise; conversely, if he wants to keep tariff revenue high and inflation in check, the only way would be an appreciation of the dollar which would hurt American manufacturers. Prepare, then, for a confused set of economic policies in Trump’s second term, and a transactional foreign policy that seeks flashy ‘wins’, probably at the expense of American strategic dominance. In many Asian capitals, the reaction to Trump’s return to the White House has been relatively sanguine. Trump’s first time posed major challenges for the region, of course, but the savvier leaders — former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe chief among them — learned to play on both his vanity and his venality to get by. His trade war with China caused great disruption to the most important economic relationship in the world, but it also created opportunities for other economies, most notably Vietnam, which saw major increases in American demand for the kinds of consumption good markets in which it already specialised and in which Chinese competitors had been rendered uncompetitive by Trump’s tariffs. But it would be a mistake for individual Asian countries to ignore the kind of damage that Trump is likely to do to the global system in the interests of securing a favoured position at Trump’s court. Indeed, the biggest danger for the region would be for each country alone to try to strike their own bargain with Trump. This was more or less the approach taken in the first Trump presidency, and as Shiro Armstrong argues in this week’s lead article, it was a tactical victory for some but a strategic bust for Asia as a whole. The World Trade Organization has still not recovered from the damage done by a bipartisan string of US Presidents, beginning with Obama, who have blocked the appointment of new appellate judges and left the WTO’s rule-enforcing power neutered. Former Director-General of the WTO Pascal Lamy has called for a broad front between the European Union and China to help protect global trade under Trump, but with powerful protectionist forces aligning in Brussels and deep distrust in Beijing, building such a coalition will be fraught. The region with the most to lose from an even more aggressively protectionist Trump is Asia, and so it is to Asia that the world looks for leadership in protecting the system of rules and institutions that have done so much to promote economic growth in Asia and in the world in general since 1945. The temptation for big players that are likely to be targeted by Trump again — most importantly, China and the European Union — will be to play tit-for-tat and retaliate with tariffs. While this may solve some domestic political problems, the economic effects of a generalised trade war would be devastating, particularly in Asia. Asia’s middle powers, Armstrong argues, need to mobilise to convince major powers that retaliation is not in their own interests. Trump’s wrong-headed policies will be their own punishment: there is no need for China to try to inflict more. Far more important, for China (which lacks allies) and for Asia more generally, is that the global trade system is insulated as best as possible from the deleterious effects of Trump’s almost guaranteed efforts to sabotage it. This will not be easy. Faith in Beijing’s good intentions is still at a low point, particularly following China’s naked attempts to coerce countries like Australia in recent years. Yet, as Armstrong notes, the institutional foundations for this kind of effort exist already, even if they need reinforcing: ASEAN-centred institutions like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in Asia need to be connected to European collective action. The stakes are high enough that a concerted effort from middle powers across Asia to stitch together a collective response to protectionist provocation in the United States is worth the diplomatic trouble. ‘The multilateral trading system is the biggest source of economic security for open trading nations’, Armstrong argues, and in a world that is fracturing on geopolitical lines, strengthening the open economic order is not just an economic mission, it is a national security imperative as well.

Contrasting Expectations For A Russia-Ukraine Settlement – OpEd	In his dramatic shift away from arming the Kiev regime, Donald Trump's Secretary of State Marko Rubio says he's now against funding a 'stalemate' concerning the NATO proxy war against Russia. The use of the word stalemate misrepresents the actual situation in a way that serves to prolong a conflict which Trump correctly said should've never happened. Since February 24, 2022, the start of Russia's Special Miliary Operation (SMO), the Russian military has qualitatively and quantitively gotten stronger with the Kiev regime going in reverse. During this same period, Russia's economy has fared comparably better than that of the EU. For all practical purposes, the Kiev regime doesn't have a functioning economy. In the US, the overall population face considerable socioeconomic challenges and is therefore reluctant to see massive aid going to Project Ukraine. This is a key motivating reason for Trump's resounding victory over the Democratic Party establishment. A limited American military engagement abroad enables a Trump administration concentration on US domestic concerns. In his changed position, Rubio notes that Ukraine is better off with a practical peace settlement which maintains the former Soviet republic as a functioning state. The US foreign policy establishment peace proposals are out of whack with reality. Shortly before Trump's decisive victory, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, gave an unrealistic commentary in Foreign Affairs. Contrary to Haass, Russia has already rejected the idea of a ceasefire for the purpose of building up Kiev regime military capability, as well as a 10-20 year wait on whether Ukraine can join NATO. As the party winning and most likely to win the NATO proxy war against it, Russia will have a great say on the settlement terms. Haass' selective BS (when applied to Russia) about ethically not redrawing boundaries via force is pretty rich given what NATO has done regarding Kosovo. Borders continue to be redrawn elsewhere via armed conflict. South Sudan is a recent example. In the not-too-distant past, Germany was reunified after it had been forcefully separated. Hence, it's not so out of the ordinary for some culturally, historically, linguistically and religiously Russian territory to be reunited. Mirroring Haass, New York former Republican Governor Geroge Pataki said on a November 12 WABC New York Talk Radio show (at the 40:24 mark) that aggression shouldn't be rewarded. He wasn't referring to neocon, neolib, neo-Nazi Banderite aggression. Rather, an overly selective and inaccurate overview on his part. The Hungarian-American Pataki is no Viktor Orban or Péter Szijjártó. Among the considerably better American commentators getting some establishment play, there's room for valid disagreement. James Webb of the Quincy Institute is the brilliant son of a former US Secretary of the Navy and Virginia Senator. In a November 12 segment on The Duran (at the 1:00:38 mark), Webb spoke of a hypothetical geopolitical exchange involving a Russian military withdrawal from Syria. For the purpose of satisfying Western neocon and neolib feelings, there's no need for this. Russia's number of military bases in the Middle East and elsewhere dwarfs that of the US. In Syria, the Russian armed presence is welcomed by the internationally recognized Syrian government unlike the current US troop deployment there. The secular Syrian government (which BTW is preferred by the majority of Syrian Christians) sought Russian, Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah help in combating Sunni extremists affiliated with either ISIS or Al Qaeda. Even with the Russian settlement terms, the collective Western foreign policy establishment can brag (albeit erroneously) about: - NATO adding two new members (Finland and Sweden, thus further extending itself) - how Putin didn't take all of Ukraine (not that he ever actually attempted to do such). At this time, a Russian proposed settlement is along these lines: - strictly adhered to Ukrainian neutrality, with a limited Ukrainian armed forces - all of Zaporozhe, Donetsk, Lugansk and Kherson going to Russia - end of SMO related sanctions against Russia - complete release of Russian 'frozen' (stolen) assets - protection of Russian identity (like language use) within Ukraine's Communist drawn boundary - discussion on a new Euro-Atlantic security arrangement. A year ago, the Kiev regime could've gotten a better deal. Going back further, the Minsk Accords was an even better option for it. The longer the proxy war against Russia continues, the greater the likelihood of the Kiev regime losing more Ukrainian territory. Don't be fooled by the clownishly pompous likes of Sebastian Gorka. On a November 16 RT aired show (at the 15:45 mark), Gorka said that if Russia refused a Trump peace proposal, the incoming US president will flood Ukraine with arms. Like Pataki, the Brit-Hungarian-American Gorka is no Orban or Szijjártó. Seasoned military analysts including Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud, Brian Berletic, Lawrence Wilkerson, Douglas Macgregor, Mark Sleboda and Scott Ritter, have conclusively shown how the Collective West is pretty much tapped out on what it can (within reason) militarily provide the Kiev regime, in conjunction with a dwindling number of available Kiev regime armed forces personnel. Daniel Davis has astutely detailed why the recently reported move by the Biden administration isn't going to change the eventual outcome.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUEc9vuLKzxCG	2024-11-18T16:47:46-08:00	
New Administration, New Outlook And New Action On Myanmar – OpEd	With the conclusion of the 60th U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump declared the 47th president, all eyes are on the incoming administration’s approach to domestic and foreign affairs when it assumes office on January 20, 2025. It’s essential to objectively observe the changes to come, as the campaign season was marked by bold rhetoric and sensational media coverage. While domestic economic priorities remain critical, the Trump administration faces equally daunting challenges on the global stage. As a leader in addressing crises worldwide, the U.S. must respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war in Gaza, terrorist activities in the Middle East, nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, and increasing strategic tensions with China—a dominant global economy and rising military power. The nominations of China hardliners Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State and Representative Tim Waltz as National Security Adviser indicate a tough stance on China, including security issues that extend beyond trade and tariffs. 1 However, Donald Trump is unlikely to pursue direct confrontation with Xi Jinping. Instead, his administration may adopt a restrained strategy, recognizing that American resources are finite and should be directed where they matter most. This approach could focus on countering China’s assertive actions in the Pacific by empowering allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia to maintain regional stability.2 While the U.S. concentrates on the South China Sea as a critical region for national security, Myanmar represents a significant oversight. For China, Myanmar provides vital access to the Indian Ocean, offering an alternative trade route to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Myanmar also plays a key role in the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As Myanmar’s largest investor, China seeks to dominate the region to protect its interests, including securing rare earth element (REE) imports from Myanmar. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s REE imports in 2022. A shortage of REE essential for military and technological advancements would be considered a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. However, since Myanmar's military ousted its democratically elected government on February 1st, 2021, the country has been engulfed in conflict. A nationwide resistance movement has united ethnic groups and opposition factions into a coalition against the junta’s oppressive regime, ushering in what is now called the Spring Revolution. Initially, China has maintained backdoor diplomacy with various factions while ensuring minimal U.S. involvement. Although it seeks to maximize influence, Beijing opposes the junta's collapse, fearing National Unity Government (NUG), which it perceived as a pro-Western, could gain power. 3,4 Since late 2023 and early 2024, the military has lost control of 60% of the territories of the country. In response, China has become more proactive, pressuring resistance forces for ceasefires, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. China has reportedly proposed establishing a joint security company with military regime to ensure the safety of Chinese projects and personnel. The news followed a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing on August 14, 2024. The report has raised fears of potential Chinese troop involvement in Myanmar through this proposed security company.5On November 6, 2024, Myanmar’s junta leader met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Kunming, Yunnan. Li expressed support for Myanmar's 'political reconciliation and transformation' to advance the construction of CMEC under the BRI.6 The Biden administration condemned the coup, imposed targeted sanctions, and supported limited humanitarian assistance. Senator Marco Rubio joined three other bipartisan members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in issuing a letter to urge President Joe Biden to help preserve democracy in Myanmar by outlining the key steps including to call for the immediate release of political prisoners and impose targeted sanctions on the senior leadership of the military and affiliated individuals.7 The US and Western democracies are providing important, but limited engagements on humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy despite the Burma Act passed in December 2022, that provides a framework for engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar. The US, EU, UK and Canada imposed targeted sanctions with limited impact on coffer for military to acquire jet fuels and weapons due to piecemeal implementation and lack of cooperation from the neighbors. China, India and ASEAN will now through combination of persuasion and pressure have proposed so called 'all-inclusive dialogue' about cease-fire, humanitarian aid, and sham elections that lack credibility. These initiatives will face colossal failure just like the Five-Point Consensus since the military will not accept to abandon its political dominance, kleptocratic-economic conglomerate and centralization dogma. The negotiated settlement will not succeed unless the military accepts civilian oversight and relinquishes its involvement in politics and impunity. Meanwhile, lost time due to the endless empty talks will prolong civilian suffering with no end to the military’s reign of terror against its own population.8 The new Trump administration must recognize the Myanmar crisis as a war of terror by the junta against its people, rather than a conflict between political factions. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces aligns with a restrained strategy in neutralizing China’s unchecked influence in the region. The U.S. should lead by formally recognizing the NUG. This move would encourage ASEAN, Western democracies, and neighboring countries to follow suit, fostering meaningful dialogue among anti-junta stakeholders, delivering humanitarian aid, and enforcing coordinated effective sanctions to cut off the junta’s resources. Empowering the NUG would allow Myanmar to break free from China’s shadow, consolidate resistance groups, and establish good governance and monetary institutions in liberated areas. This approach could deter Myanmar from becoming a failed state or a rogue regime like North Korea. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces offers the U.S. a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to counter China’s influence in Southeast Asia. A decisive, transparent policy that strengthens partnerships with allies and communicates effectively with Beijing would signal that the U.S. seeks balance, not Cold War-style dominance, in the region. 9 By prioritizing Myanmar, the U.S. could bolster regional security, promote democracy, and neutralize China’s monopoly in Southeast Asia, securing strategic gains for the U.S. in the era of heightened competition between the world’s two most powerful nations.9 References:	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUNJTUwvZPZ9O	2024-11-18T16:45:50-08:00	
Thank You For Emitting: The Hypocrisies Of COP29 – OpEd	COP29 was always going to be memorable, for no other reason than the hosting country, Azerbaijan, is a petrostate indifferent to the issue of emissions and scornful of ecological preachers. It has seen its natural gas supply grow by 128% between 2000 and 2021. Between 2006 and 2021, gas exports rose by a monumental 29,290%. A dizzying 95% of the country’s exports are made up of oil and gas, with much of its wealth failing to trickle down to the rest of the populace. The broadly described West, as stated by President Ilham Aliyev in his opening address to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was in no position to be lecturing his country about cutting back on the use of fossil fuels. They were, he grandly claimed, 'a gift from God'. In this, he should have surprised no one. In April 2024, he declared that, as a leader of a country 'which is rich in fossil fuels, of course, we will defend the right of these countries to continue investments and to continue production.' A few days later, Aliyev played the other side of the climate change divide, suggesting at a meeting with island leaders that France and the Netherlands had been responsible for 'brutally' suppressing the 'voices' of communities in such overseas territories as Mayotte and Curaçao concerned with climate change. (Aliyev himself is no stranger to suppressing, with dedicated brutality, voices of dissent within his own country.) This proved too much for France’s Ecological Transition Minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who cancelled her planned attendance to the summit while attacking Baku for 'instrumentalising the fight against climate change for its undignified personal agenda.' On the second day of the summit, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, tried to turn the attention of delegates to the urgent matter at hand. 'The sound you hear is the ticking clock – we are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and time is not on our side.' Others, however, heard the sound of money changing hands, with the fossil fuel industry lurking, fangs and pens at the ready, presided over by the good offices of a petrostate. In the background lie assessments of gloomy inevitability. The Climate Change Tracker’s November 2024 briefing notes this year was one characterised by 'minimal progress, with almost no new national climate change targets (NDCs) or net zero pledges even though government have agreed to (urgently) strengthen their 2030 targets and to align them with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.' As easy as it is to rage against the opportunistic Aliyev, who crudely blends environmentalism with ethnic cleansing, few attending the summit in Baku come with clean hands. As with previous COP events, Baku offers another enormous event of emitters and emission, featuring tens of thousands of officials, advisors and minders bloviating in conference. That said, the 67,000 registrants at this conference is somewhat lower compared with the 83,000 who descended on Dubai at COP28. The plane tracking website FlightRadar24 noted that 65 private jets landed in the Azerbaijani capital prior to the summit, prompting Alethea Warrington, the head of energy, aviation and heat at Possible, a climate action charity, to tut with heavy disapproval: 'Travelling by private jet is a horrendous waste of the world’s scarce remaining carbon budget, with each journey producing more emissions in a few hours than the average person around the world emits in an entire year.' COP29 is also another opportunity to strike deals that have little to do with reducing emissions and everything to do with advancing the interests of lobby groups and companies in the energy market, much of it of a fossil fuel nature. In the spirit of Dubai, COP29 is set to follow in the footsteps of the wily Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who chaired COP28 in Dubai. Prior to the arrival of the chatterati of climate change last year, the Sultan was shown in leaked briefing documents to the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) to be an avid enthusiast for advancing the business of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). It was hard to avoid the glaring fact that Al Jaber is also the CEO of Adnoc. The documents in question involve over 150 pages of briefings prepared by the COP28 team for meetings with Jaber and various interested parties held between July and October this year. They point to plans to raise matters of commercial interest with as many as 30 countries. The CCR confirms 'that on at least one occasion a nation followed up on commercial discussions brought up in a meeting with Al Jaber; a source with knowledge of discussions also told CCR that Adnoc’s business interests were allegedly raised during a meeting with another country.' The COP29 chairman, Samir Nuriyev, had already put out feelers as early as March this year that a 'fair approach' was needed when approaching countries abundant with oil and natural gas, notably in light of their purported environmental policies. He went so far as to argue that Azerbaijan was an ideal interlocutor between the Global South and Global North. His colleague and chief executive of the COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, showed exactly how that process would work in a secret recording ahead of the conference in which he discusses 'investment opportunities' in the state oil and gas company with a person posing as a potential investor. (The person in question purported to be representing a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm with a sharp line in energy.) 'We have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed,' Soltanov insists. 'We will have a certain amount of oil and gas being produced, perhaps forever.' In many ways, the Baku gathering has all the hallmarks of a criminal syndicate meeting, held under more open conditions. Fair play, then, to the Azerbaijani hosts for working out the climate change racket, taking the lead from Dubai last year. Aliyev and company noted months in advance that this was less a case of being a theatre of the absurd than a forum for business. And so, it is proving to be.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUKnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-18T16:43:44-08:00	
Indo-Pacific Strategies Of BRICS And The Quad: Digitalization As ...	The recent 16th BRICS Summit, held in October of this year, gave fresh momentum to the group's digital and geopolitical strategies, especially in the Indo-Pacific. The outcome of this summit is likely to have direct implications for the core themes of digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, and the ongoing competition with the Quad. The summit also announced the inclusion of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE, into its fold, thus promising to strengthen BRICS' outreach into regions that have high digital infrastructure potential. Russia announced its framework for the Digital Silk Road, which ties directly into creating a parallel digital ecosystem across member states. This expanded BRICS connectivity plan could rival Quad-led infrastructure projects like the Blue Dot Network, especially in underserved areas of the Indo-Pacific. Quad's focus on open, secure, and resilient infrastructure may face stiffer competition now as BRICS consolidates its influence through larger membership and shared resources. These raise a few questions: how will the inclusion of new BRICS members reshape the digital landscape in the Indo-Pacific? How will Quad nations respond to BRICS' ambitions in cybersecurity and digital infrastructure? The Quad strategically focuses on the Indo-Pacific with a primary focus on security in the Indo-Pacific, countering China’s growing influence, and promoting a free, open, and inclusive region. On the other hand, BRICS is not strictly Indo-Pacific-centric. However, China and India, key BRICS members, have major stakes in the area. Russia, through its 'pivot to Asia' strategy, has also increased engagement. Such an architecture creates indirect interactions, as BRICS and Quad member states pursue their objectives in the same geographic theater. While the US’s 'pivot to Asia' is a counterbalancing mechanism to contain the resurgent China, Russia’s strategy is to diversify from the West and strengthen ties with Asia. QUAD is often seen as a security alliance, though it lacks formalized military commitments. India is both in the BRICS and QUAD groupings and this puts it in a unique position to exercise what is known as ‘strategic autonomy’. In the Quad, India aligns with democracies like the US, Japan, and Australia to address security concerns, particularly about maritime security cooperation and China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific. At BRICS, India collaborates with emerging economies, this time again with China, to address different sets of issues about global economic and development challenges and emphasize a multipolar world order. To an extent, India has been utilizing this unique presence in both groups to balance its security interests with its economic and geopolitical priorities and often acting as a bridge between the Global North (Quad) and Global South (BRICS). See Fig 1: the network graph illustrating India’s association. Fig 1: India is a member of both BRICS and QUAD groupings In discussions at the recent BRICS summit there was increased emphasis on technological collaboration in AI. China's leadership has potentially set the tone for other members to take an interest in this. The UAE, which has a strong focus on AI development ( it is also ranked among the top nations in AI readiness), has brought added expertise to the table, bolstering BRICS' collective capabilities. AI-driven innovations have significant potential that could enhance BRICS' ability to offer competitive digital solutions in the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, Quad nations may need to accelerate their AI initiatives to counter BRICS' collective technological capabilities, especially as AI becomes a decisive factor in digital economies. In light of Russia and China advocating state-controlled cyberspaces, the BRICS summit's emphasis on cybersecurity frameworks directly aligns with the group's push for digital sovereignty. The proposed collaboration on cyber threat mitigation could be strategic and has the potential of establishing BRICS as a significant player in the global cybersecurity dialogue, challenging Quad-led initiatives. Cybersecurity discussions also included creating suitable safeguards against interference in national data systems, impacting Indo-Pacific digital trust networks. Quad's collaborative cyber defense efforts may need to scale up to address the increasing sophistication of BRICS-led frameworks. BRICS reassured its commitment to strengthening digital economies through projects like the New Development Bank (NDB)'s digital transformation and digital infrastructure programs. NDB, formally known as the BRICS Development Bank, finances infrastructure and sustainable development projects of emerging economies. In the meeting, there was particular emphasis on collaboration in blockchain and fintech-related areas. This initiative positions BRICS as a strong contender in shaping the Indo-Pacific’s digital economy. In contrast, Quad nations may need to bolster their digital economy projects in the region to counter BRICS' growing influence in areas such as digital payment systems. With an expanded membership, BRICS could further facilitate more widespread adoption of 'BRICS-driven technologies' in the Indo-Pacific. Huawei has been continuing to lead 5G projects among BRICS member states. Hence Quad must focus on secure and transparent 5G networks. This is crucial if it has to counter BRICS' technological advancements. There are some issues with Quad's digital openness model. The model may need to articulate clearer policies on balancing sovereignty and openness to maintain its influence in the Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the BRICS summit’s focus on digital sovereignty has underscored the importance of national control over cyberspace. In the current summit, the discussions included how dependence on US-led tech ecosystems could be reduced. Its expanded membership and push for advanced AI and cybersecurity initiatives, highlight a comprehensive strategy that could challenge Quad's dominance. This evolving rivalry highlights the urgent need for a deeper analysis of how digitalization shapes geopolitics in this critical region. There is a variation in the strategies of 'technology as a geopolitical tool' with a focus on two groups of countries embedded in different (yet interconnected) geopolitical contexts, namely the Quad and BRICS. As a result of this commitment to technology, both groups have developed respective strategies that cast technology as a geopolitical tool. The BRICS Strategy for Economic Partnership employs soft measures to reach geopolitical goals by setting rule-based cooperation frameworks in the developing part of the continent and using global cooperation law. The strategy was directed mostly at China, scaling up its involvement in these directions. The actors of the Quad, in contrast, have much less commitment toward developing such initiatives, and thus they use hard power measures to attain geopolitical aims - a comprehensive approach to allocate diplomatic pressure and funds for reducing China’s influence in these regions as an answer to its earlier policies. On the one hand, BRICS, the relative latecomer, attempts to push digitalization further in the direction of multipolarity, promoting inter-civilizational dialogue, developing cooperative formats with African nations, and providing digital access to those left out or marginalized by the major digital platforms. On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific Quad exhibits the efforts invested by the rising powers in promoting their strategies for digitalization in the regional architectural space as a statement of their ability to shape regional dynamics. As a geopolitical tool, the alliances within and between BRICS and the Quad are distinct. While intra-quad pacts are non-binding, the one signed with the EU has also gained significance because it is format-exclusive. Intra-BRICS arrangements, on the other hand, are binding owing to the multilateral nature, interests, and responsibilities of the signatory states. The difference between the two regional digital strategies is not only about ideology but also about interests and forces that drive the geopolitics of connectivity and digitalization. As a leading member, China shapes BRICS’ agenda to align with its interests, often countering Western hegemony. Quad, on the other hand, explicitly seeks to counterbalance China’s assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific. India’s presence in both groups reflects its practical approach to balancing competition with cooperation. Future research may help in gauging how the relative power structure may indeed begin changing once digital generations, beyond 5G, take an avowed center stage. For instance, hypothesizing how a post-quantum world or scenarios where pervasive AI comes into play may produce different structural and systemic realities. It is suggested that while there may indeed be areas as this trend develops, where BRICS countries and Quad members may incipiently end up cooperating, future scenarios, given the terrain, may also reveal that both camps may primarily and increasingly be juxtaposed against each other as they promote their 'digital' strategies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUOroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-18T16:41:37-08:00	
Tectonic Shift In Sri Lankan Tamil Politics – Analysis	In the November 14 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections, the minority Tamils broke away from ethnic parties and supported the all-island, left wing, National Peoples' Power (NPP) in a tectonic political shift. As predicted by most, the National Peoples' Power (NPP) swept the Sinhala-dominated areas of Sri Lanka in the November 14 parliamentary elections. The NPP had the reputation of being a Sinhala nationalist party and its fortunes were on the upswing given the alienation of the other national parties from the public. But what came as a surprise was the NPP's sterling performance in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated areas of North and East Sri Lanka. Breaking with a seven-decade tradition, Sri Lankan Tamils flocked to the all-island National Peoples' Power (NPP) party in preference to ethnic Tamil parties, including the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK). Concern for good governance appears to have weighed in substantially. Mobilisation on traditional Tamil political issues like provincial autonomy through the full implementation of the 13th., amendment and accountability for alleged war crimes etc., had weakened. Instead, faith was reposed in the NPP's promise to give a clean, people-oriented government. The NPP put the Tamils' favourite party, the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), in the shade, and emerged as the number one choice in many of the electorates in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated Northern and Eastern provinces. The NPP's performance was impressive especially taking into account the fact that the party was a total 'outsider' to the area. It was a 'Sinhalese' party witch had no presence at all in the Tamil-dominated North ever before. For most of its life, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is the core of the NPP, had campaigned against devolution of power to the Tamils. It was dead against the 13 th., Amendment. It rejected the Tamils charge of 'war crimes' against the armed forces. Even in its election manifesto, the NPP did not commit itself to meeting any of the traditional Tamil demands. It only said that all issues of national importance will be taken up when the new parliament discusses a new constitution for the country. NPP's Dominance in North and East In Vaddukoddai, in Jaffna district, which had been an ITAK stronghold, the NPP got the single largest number of votes - 21.5%. The All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) came second with 13.48%; and the ITAK came third with 13.39%. In Kankesanthurai also, the NPP was in the forefront with 13.37% of the votes. The ITAK got 12.57%; and the ACTC 7.15%. In Manipay, the share of votes had NPP at the top with 30.94%; and ITAK at number two with 13.49%. In Koppai, the NPP secured 29.86% and the ITAK 12.63%. The score in Uddipiddy was NPP 20.16% and ITAK 15.07%. In Point Pedro too, the NPP came first with 21.89 % and the ITAK second with 19.71%. In Nallur, a Hindu stronghold, the NPP came first with 31.44% and ITAK third with 11.49%. In Jaffna proper, NPP came first with 41.46% and ITAK second with 11.81%. However, in Kayts, the NPP got less than the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP). In Chavakachery, an Independent Group for the maximum number of votes. In Kilinochchi, ITAK President S.Sritharan's pocket borough, the ITAK bagged 43.79% of the votes and came first. The NPP came second with 16.39%. In Kalkuda in Batticaloa district in the Eastern province, the ITAK was the top scorer with 28.10 %. But in Batticaloa town, the NPP was first with 27.11% with the ITAK and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress were slightly behind. In Paddiruppu, the strong hold of the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puigam (TMVP), the NPP stood third. In Trincomalee District, which is ethnically mixed, the NPP got the largest percentage of votes in both Seruvila and Trincomalee town, cornering 56% and 40% respectively. In Mutur, the NPP came second to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). In Digamadulla (Ampara) district, the NPP was the top scorer in Amparai town, Sammanthurai and Kalmunai. It was second to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) in Pottuvil. NPP's Tamil winners Though a hard line Sinhala party, the NPP put up Tamil candidates in areas where the Tamils were concentrated and made many of them win. In Nuwara Eliya, NPP's candidate Krishnan Kalaiselvi was one of the winners. In Matara, deep in the Sinhala South, an NPP Tamil candidate, Saroja Savithri Paulraj was among the winners. In the Wanni, the NPP managed to get two of its Tamil candidates elected in the six seats up for grabs. In Batticaloa, its candidate K.Prabhu bagged one of the five seats. In Badulla, NPP got 2 Tamils elected –K.Selvaraj and S. Ambika in the nine-seat electoral district. In Ratnapura, NPP got S. Pradeep elected to one of the 11 seats. In Jaffna, three of NPP candidates (all Tamils) won. The ITAK and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress got only one each. Ethnic Nationalisms on the backburner While the NPP did not play up Sinhala nationalism in its campaign, the Tamil parties played up Tamil nationalist demands like federalism, accountability for alleged war-time atrocities, vacation of military-occupied lands and the full implementation of the 13 th.Amendment for more power devolution. But a substantial section of voters appeared to have overlooked the contentious ethnic issues and pitched for better governance, less corruption and more people-centred development which were promised by the NPP. Tamils voted for the NPP despite the fact the NPP's election manifesto had nothing to say on the Tamils' ethnic issues as such. It promised a new constitution, but left its contents vague, leaving the issue to be tackled by the new parliament. Though this was neither here nor there, the Tamils voted for the NPP because their attention was elsewhere, namely, on their deteriorating economic circumstances created by the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis of 2022. They were desperately in need of a government which would give them some relief. It is not clear as to how the NPP government will bring relief to the people given the lack of financial resources, the dependence on foreign aid and debt repayment obligations. Ahilan Kadirgamar, a professor at the University of Jaffna told Frontlinemagazine that the lands released from military occupation in the Northern Province could be developed by local cooperatives with a local village level official drawing up plans for their development and use. Development of this kind will be 'bottom up' and not 'top down', as is the case now. Development efforts will then be more effective. Most importantly, the NPP, being a hard core Sinhalese or Sri Lankan nationalist party, can take bold steps to bring about ethnic reconciliation because it cannot be accused of being anti-Sinhala or anti-Sri Lankan, Kadirgamar pointed out. The Tamils could make use the window of opportunities which is open now, to realize their reasonable demands within the frame of Sri Lanka's constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUMQ36glFESvq	2024-11-18T16:37:27-08:00	
What Donald Trump’s Administrative Picks Mean For US Foreign Poli...	By Majda Ruge On 20 January 2025, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 47thpresident of the United States. In Europe, uncertainty looms regarding Trump’s future approach to foreign policy and whether he might act on radical pledges regarding European security; minimise America’s role in NATO; withdraw US troops from Europe; or force Ukraine into a peace deal which includes territorial concessions to Russia and military neutrality for Ukraine. In European capitals, all eyes are on the incoming appointments for Trump’s foreign and security policy cabinet positions. The expectation is that – if the maxim 'personnel is policy' holds true – then Trump’s appointments to key cabinet positions (including the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Pentagon) may help Europeans decipher the direction of his second foreign-policy agenda. And Trump’s second-term cabinet is likely to be more aligned with his instincts regarding European security and America’s commitment to its European allies. Identifying the Republican party’s three foreign-policy tribes (primacists, prioritisers, and restrainers) is therefore vital to interpreting his first cabinet picks; and how they may cooperate or clash in the battle for Trump’s mind. Primacists comprise the majority of the traditional Republican foreign policy elite in Congress and support continued US global leadership. They see America’s leadership in NATO and the country’s continued support for Ukraine as being in America’s strategic interest. Prioritisers and restrainers, by contrast, argue that US support for Ukraine is depleting America’s military capacity in a region which is not in America’s key strategic interest, and urge for the prioritisation of financial and military resources to the Indo-Pacific to deal with the threat from China. Restrainers especially want the US to focus on problems at home – starting with securing the country’s southern border with Mexico – and to show restraint in its deployment of military force abroad. Ultimately, both restrainers and prioritisers want Europe to take full responsibility for its own security and for Ukraine’s, allowing the US to focus on China and domestic issues. Trump’s own view is that, during his first term, a primacist-dominated cabinet sabotaged his foreign policy agenda in conjunction with the ‘deep state’. He labelledmany of his first-term advisors 'globalists and warmongers' and pledged to exclude them from his second administration – confirmed via Trump’s announcement that he will not invite Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two prominent primacists from his first administration, to return to his second cabinet. His son, Donald Trump Jr., is a key member of Trump’s transition team: he reposted on X that the '‘stop Pompeo’ movement is great but it’s not enough' and pledged to entirely root out 'neocons and war hawks' from the next administrative line-up. But the announcement that Trump has picked Florida congressman Michael Waltz and senator Marco Rubio as national security advisor and secretary of state respectively indicates that Trump’s second-term cabinet is prepared to accept some primacists – albeit with certain adjustments. Waltz and Rubio are both former primacists turned prioritisers, and prominent ‘China hawks’ in Congress. Previously an advisor in the George W. Bush administration, Waltz is highly critical of US aid spending in Ukraine, arguing that it should end the ‘blank check’ policy and hand over responsibility for Ukraine’s defence to wealthy European nations – in particular France, Germany, and the UK. Waltz has also spoken out against Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership. Similarly, Rubio has become increasingly critical of US support for Ukraine. He sees America’s greatest task as 'forcing the outdated foreign policy blob… to reprioritise and focus on America’s most pressing threat: the Chinese Communist Party. And that will require tradeoffs and burden-sharing…'. In other words, both Waltz and Rubio have shed their previous primacist beliefs. They want to end Russia’s war in Ukraine as soon as possible, hand over responsibility for Ukraine to Europe, and shift US focus to developments in the Indo-Pacific. And the same is true for the appointment of Elise Stefanik, who Trump has appointed as his next UN ambassador. During the 2016 to 2020 term, she displayed primacist tendencies by disagreeing with Trump’s position on NATO and opposing the administration’s effort to broker an agreement with Taliban. However, Stefanik is proving herself an ardent Trump loyalist, throwing her support behind him during the Ukraine impeachment hearings in 2019 and after the Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021. This, along with her outspoken support for Israel, has secured her a spot at the top table: given Trump’s general disdain for the UN and other international institutions, Stefanik’s role is likely to be similar to that of Haley during Trump’s first term. This mostly focused on advocacy for Israel and defence of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from international agreements and institutions. For now, it seems that prioritisers and restrainers will be steering the ship on Ukraine. This seems, chiefly, to involve opposing Ukraine’s NATO membership while heightening the expectation that Europeans should take collective responsibility for providing security guarantees to Ukraine – and support a Trump-brokered deal between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. But how Trump’s administration will approach foreign policy with regard to the Middle East is less clear cut. Unlike their views on Europe, Waltz and Rubio retain strong primacist instincts on the Middle East, especially with regard to the Israel-Iran issue. On the issue of US-supported Israeli military strikes on Iran, their views could potentially conflict with those of true prioritisers like incoming vice president, JD Vance. The latter has pledged he would not support authorising military strikes on the Iranian mainland and is keen to prevent any escalation in the region which may see a heightening of US involvement. Finally, an important dynamic will emerge between key cabinet members and the ‘corporatist’ tribe around Trump. Influential individuals such as Elon Musk, Richard Grenell, and Jared Kushner do not fall officially into any of the foreign-policy tribes. But their strong business interests in other global regions – Musk in China and Kushner in the Middle East and Arab Gulf states – mean they may not necessarily be aligned with the ideas promoted by Trump’s prioritiser members of the cabinet. There is a possibility of conflict between Musk’s business interests in China and the highly hawkish approach by prioritisers such as Waltz, Vance, or the potential next US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Kushner’s designs for peace in the Middle East also may not align with the prioritiser or restrainer tribes, which seek to retrench from the region and avoid escalation with Iran at all costs. In contrast, however, the second-order foreign policy issues – on which prioritisers and restrainers have no opinion – will be entirely run by those, such as Grenell, who are both in charge and do have a strong opinion. Here, a prime example is the Western Balkans. There is also the possibility of the Trump wild card: he is erratic and unpredictable, and has already swung between the different foreign-policy tribes during his first term of office. But in the end, Trump’s lack of foreign policy coherence means his foreign policy advisors also have ample space through which to develop and determine America’s outreach. While the results will likely be messy and inconsistent, it is crucial that the governments of European countries braces themselves to deal with the foreign policy of a second Trump term. It will not come close to anything like his first. The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions.

Mobile Home Residents Should Be Able To Buy Their Parks – OpEd	Even in a barrelful of rotten apples, you might think there’d still be a few good ones. But don’t get your hopes up looking into barrels labeled 'private equity investors.' These esoteric, multibillion-dollar Wall Street schemes rig the marketplace so 'high-net-worth individuals' can grab fat profits and special tax breaks to buy up doctors’ offices, hometown newspapers, child care centers, etc. Consider America’s humble but beneficial mobile home parks. Homeownership has become so pricey that these affordable manufactured units now make up 10 percent of all single-family home sales. But while the buyers own the houses, they must rent lots from mobile park owners. This has generally been a square deal — at least when park owners live among the renters, providing decent services at reasonable rates. One such park is Linnhaven Center with some 300 mobile home residents in Brunswick, Maine. But these homes for millions of people have become a quick-buck target for Wall Street’s equity profiteers. Waving cash at longtime trailer park owners, private equity investors have been snatching up thousands of these lots. Without warning, people’s homes are literally being bought out from under them. The absentee predators then raise rents to drive out residents, clearing the spaces for high-dollar renters or buyers. But there’s good news for a change. A new law in Maine gives mobile home residents a chance to buy their park — and community cooperatives exist to help arrange financing. That’s what the modest-income people of Linnhaven have now done. Such a big leap isn’t easy, but give people a fair chance and they can make it work. As one Linnhaven woman put it, the community effort was much more than a property deal: It felt like 'a chance to control your own destiny.'

Moscow Prescribes Own Terms For Talks With Trump On Ukraine – Ana...	By Vladimir Socor Moscow is in no hurry to hold talks with US President-elect Donald Trump on halting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Kremlin expects its forces to continue, slowly but steadily, seizing more Ukrainian territory, grinding down the country’s infrastructure and housing stock with air strikes, setting preconditions for a social crisis in Ukraine this coming winter, and depleting the national morale. Trump shows himself eager to substantiate his 'deal-maker' reputation by brokering a peace deal between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents even before his own presidential inauguration. From Moscow’s perspective, however, holding such talks at this time could stymie its military operations in Ukraine before they attained their objectives. It would be entirely out of character with the Kremlin to enter negotiations with a major foreign leader who has not yet taken office. Moscow will, however, be ready to engage with Trump following his January 20 inauguration. By then, Russia also expects its military position to have grown stronger in Ukraine. The Kremlin could then turn Trump’s manifest eagerness for a deal into leverage against the US president. Awaiting that moment, Moscow is prescribing its own terms for possible talks with Trump on Ukraine. Within two days of Trump’s November 5 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin used a high-profile Valdai Club event to announce his willingness to hold talks with Trump on Ukraine when certain conditions are met. Putin listed those conditions but not before paying his respects to Trump’s 'courageous, manly reaction to the assassination attempt against him. The man proved himself, showed his character in that extraordinary situation.' Congratulating Trump on his election, Putin professed to be 'more than ready' to hold talks with Trump and 'open to restoring relations with the United States,' but he would not initiate a telephone call to the US president. 'The ball is in the US court' (Kremlin.ru, November 7). Follow-up statements by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (Interfax, November 9) and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (TASS, November 13; Mid.ru, November 14) elaborated on Putin’s list of conditions for Russia-US high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine. The conditions are familiar for the most part. They refer to prerequisites, processes, and outcomes, including: Talks can only commence once Russia regains the entire territory of its Kursk oblast. The United States should initiate talks with Russia. No quick fixes. 'His [Trump’s] signals about a super-quick settlement are nothing but election campaign rhetoric' (Ryabkov). 'The subject matter of talks cannot be merely a ceasefire, but a solution that would lead to restoring cooperation between these two peoples that are indisputably fraternal despite these tragic events' (Putin). Peace talks must at first involve Russia and Ukraine bilaterally. They must proceed from the 'Istanbul documents,' tentatively drafted by Moscow and Kyiv in March-April 2022 and based on Putin’s own June 14, list of demands to Ukraine (see EDM, March 17, 30, 31, April 4, 5, 2022, May 29, 30, June 20). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy must rescind his October 2022 decree banning direct political negotiations with the Kremlin (see EDM, October 5, 2022). 'Russia will certainly consider and answer Trump’s and any US proposals if geared to a political settlement, but not geared to supporting the Kyiv regime and feeding its expectations' (Lavrov). 'Western countries … should abruptly [rezko] cut the volume of their support to Kyiv, including military support, and get [their] Kyiv clients to abandon the idea that they could achieve anything without a direct dialogue with Moscow. This is what the US-led West must focus on during Trump’s presidential term' (Lavrov). 'Ukraine’s post-war borders must reflect the sovereign decisions of the people who live on the lands that we name our historic lands' [alluding to the four Russian-annexed provinces on the Ukrainian mainland] (Putin). The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had opened its door to Ukraine aiming to 'appropriate our [Russia’s] historical territories.' Post-war good-neighborly relations between Russia and Ukraine would only be possible if Ukraine is a permanently neutral country. 'The European Union has practically turned into the same thing as NATO in a military-political sense … NATO and the European Union will arrange some division of labor between them (Lavrov)—a warning that Russia could deem Ukraine’s candidacy to EU membership as incompatible with neutrality. These terms and parameters are not new, nor is their listing complete. They are presented with fresh emphases to familiarize Trump’s incoming team with them, ahead of possible direct contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government. These statements concern putative negotiations on a bilateral basis between Moscow and Kyiv but stop short of referring to follow-up negotiations in a multilateral format regarding post-war security guarantees to Ukraine. This multilateral track became the proximate cause for the collapse of the 2022 'Istanbul' negotiations because Russia was included among the would-be security guarantors of a neutral Ukraine. If Russia insists on being included in the multilateral format again, the negotiations are bound to collapse.

South Korea Best Off Balancing Deterrence And Diplomacy With The ...	By Rachel Minyoung Lee Unification is a perennial topic of interest among Korea watchers, but it has been particularly popular — and confusing — in recent months, with North and South Korea each sending diametrically opposed signals. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol delivered a rare speech dedicated to unification on Liberation Day, 15 August 2024, reaffirming Seoul’s commitment to unification and even telling Pyongyang that South Korea would ‘keep the door to inter-Korean dialogue wide open’. This was despite Kim Jong-un’s announcement at the end of 2023 of a new two Koreas policy, which defined North and South Korea as ‘two belligerent states’ and discarded the decades-long policy of peaceful unification. There was much speculation following the October 7–8 session of the North Korean parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, about whether the assembly had indeed revised the constitution to remove unification-related language and define North Korean territory according to Kim’s instructions in early 2024. Pyongyang subsequently implied that it made at least one revision related to inter-Korean issues — defining South Korea as ‘a hostile state’ — but it remains unknown whether it made other related amendments. North Korea never responded to Yoon’s Liberation Day speech, indicating a lack of interest in improving relations with Seoul. To the contrary, Kim himself reacted quickly to Yoon’s Armed Forces Day parade speech on 1 October 2024, even leveling an unusually direct nuclear threat that the North would ‘use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons’, against South Korea if its sovereignty was violated. Dialogue with North Korea — however desirable and necessary — is unrealistic for the foreseeable future. This raises the question of what is the best way forward. Kim’s two Koreas policy is here to stay. It is a result of a fundamental policy reorientation that occurred over a period of more than four years, going back to the breakdown of the Trump-Kim Hanoi summit in 2019. Kim’s call for the development of tactical nuclear weapons and the revised nuclear law, which implicitly expanded the scope of nuclear strike targets to South Korea, were just two of multiple indicators. Pyongyang’s South Korea policy change should be viewed within the broader context of its foreign policy reorientation. North Korea has given up its three decade-long policy of normalisation of ties with the United States through denuclearisation — distinct from a lack of appetite for normalisation of relations altogether — and, by natural extension, its policy of nonalignment with China and Russia. Kim’s decisions seem to increasingly be driven by the opportunities he sees in great power competition and the shifting geopolitical landscape, giving him even less motivation to improve relations with South Korea. Pyongyang’s policy towards the United States was almost certainly affected by what it perceived to be waning US leadership on the global stage due to US–China competition and a ‘multipolar’ global order. North Korea’s relations with Russia have reached new heights since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as evidenced by their new bilateral treaty. We should note that Kim announced the new South Korea policy in the midst of his ever-blossoming relations with Putin. This relationship probably emboldened Kim to trash the concept of unification, his forefathers’ legacy and one that has been deeply ingrained in the North Korean people’s minds. For as long as the current circumstances persist, the most realistic way for South Korea to manage relations with the North — and the potential for US–China competition and deepening Pyongyang–Moscow relations to amplify North Korea’s growing nuclear threats — is to balance deterrence with clearer signals for dialogue. Priority should be given to strengthening deterrence. In that vein, South Korea should continue to make efforts to advance its weapons systems. Seoul should continue to strengthen its alliance with the United States and work with it to maintain the credibility of extended deterrence. It should also step up trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. It is important to remember that muscle-building in and of itself cannot be the goal of deterrence — the goal is to maintain peace and lay the groundwork for future diplomacy. Accordingly, Seoul should redouble its efforts to signal to North Korea that its interest in dialogue is genuine. The first step to doing this is for Seoul to tone down on the themes that Pyongyang finds hostile — such as North Korean human rights and right of access to information — in its public messages specifically targeting North Korea. It is important for South Korea to continue to take the lead in working on these issues with the international community. But these themes do not have to be emphasised in messages that are intended to resonate with North Korea. Seoul should also learn from the lessons of the past that North Korea will not trade its nuclear weapons for economic compensation. The Lee Myung-bak administration’s Vision 3000: Denuclearisation and Openness and Yoon’s ‘Audacious Initiative’, both of which sought to incentivise North Korea to denuclearise through economic compensation, failed. It is time to recognise that North Korea’s strategic interests have changed, understand the reasons for this shift and craft viable policy options that work for both sides. Striking the right balance between deterrence and dialogue is not an easy task. But if Seoul can bring itself to be a little more flexible, it may be in a better position to deal with North Korea when the country is ready to start engaging. The time for diplomacy may arrive after January 2026, when North Korea is expected to hold its next quinquennial Party Congress and review and recalibrate its domestic and foreign policy.

Viewing A Fragmented America Through The Lens Of Economic Data – ...	By Muren Jin In recent times, U.S. economic data has become a target of criticism, with the degree of division caused by it being no less intense than the polarization between the two major parties during U.S. elections. This division is evident across multiple aspects, an indication of the fragmentation of the American economy at various levels. First, there is a clear split between different data points at the same time, particularly in the Markit Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI. According to data released by S&P Global on October 24, due to strong demand in the services sector, U.S. business activity maintained steady growth for most of October, with expectations of a rebound to the highest point in over two years. However, manufacturing has contracted for the third consecutive month, although the pace of contraction has slightly slowed. The preliminary October Markit Manufacturing PMI for the U.S. stood at 47.8, slightly higher than the expected 47.5 and the previous 47.3. Meanwhile, the preliminary October Markit Services PMI was 55.3, surpassing the expected 55 and the previous 55.2. Whether examining recent short-term data or the long-term decline of the Rust Belt since World War II, it is clear that the concept of a 'financially-driven nation' has become more deeply entrenched in the U.S. This suggests a widening industrial divide, pointing to an underlying imbalance in the American economy. Second, the same data, presented at different times, shows a clear divide, particularly evident in the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI's 'wild swings' around the dividing line of expansion and contraction. On November 5, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released data showing that the U.S. ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI for October was 56, the highest in nearly two years, well above the expected 53.8 and the previous September value of 54.9. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction. The October reading significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing the forecasts of nearly all economists surveyed. However, it is important to note that since the second quarter of this year, the U.S. Non-Manufacturing PMI has been quite volatile. In April and June, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI fell into contraction, while the data for September and October showed a noticeable improvement. The ups and downs of non-manufacturing data correspond with the Federal Reserve's major shift from maintaining a tightening cycle to initiating a loosening cycle with interest rate cuts. The data fluctuations have cleverly paved the way for rate cuts and later helped support the economic soft landing. On October 25, former Fed Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh openly stated in an interview with CNBC that the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September was at odds with its previous policy statements. Warsh raised concerns, 'I do not want to be the person accusing them of politics. That’s not the central bank I know. But when you don’t have a theory and follow it, it’s easy to get that accusation'. Third, the same data type, presented by different institutions at the same time, shows a stark divide, particularly evident in the significant discrepancy in 'non-farm payroll' data. On October 30, the ADP employment report showed that in October, U.S. companies hired at the fastest pace in over a year, indicating an extraordinary demand for labor. According to the latest data from ADP, U.S. private sector employment grew by 233,000 in October, far surpassing expectations. Additionally, the September ADP employment figure was revised upward from 143,000 to 159,000. The latest ADP data exceeded the forecasts of all economists surveyed by Bloomberg and was significantly higher than the 114,000 jobs expected by most economists. In contrast, on November 1, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data showing that non-farm payrolls in October had plummeted to just 12,000, a sharp decline from September's 254,000 (revised down to 223,000), marking the lowest increase since 2020, and well below the expected 106,000. While Fed 'voting member' Christopher Waller and President Joe Biden's chief economic advisor, Lael Brainard, both indicated that this report likely reflected temporary job losses due to recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the BLS acknowledged in its statement that while hurricanes may have affected employment in certain sectors, the impact on overall U.S. employment, hours worked, or income could not be quantified. The BLS also stated that the hurricanes had no significant effect on the overall national unemployment rate. The stark discrepancy in important data, combined with conflicting views from data release agencies, the Fed, and government officials, highlights the significant differences in perspectives on the state of the U.S. economy. Fourth, there is a divergence between history and reality, specifically reflected in the triggering of the Sahm Rule and the deviation of U.S. GDP growth. On August 2, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the U.S. unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.3% in July, the highest level since October 2021, and higher than the expected 4.1%. The increase in the unemployment rate triggered the well-known recession indicator, the Sahm Rule. Notably, historically, the Sahm Rule has been confirmed in all 11 U.S. economic recessions since 1950, without exception. However, data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on October 30 showed that the U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter, a slowdown of 0.2 percentage points from the second quarter, and below the economists' expectation of 3.1%. Still, the growth was better than most other developed economies during the same period. Economists also pointed out that while the growth rate slightly slowed compared to the second quarter, it remains relatively strong compared to historical trends. The differing perspectives between historical experience and current realities regarding economic development continue to resonate in the ongoing heated debate about whether the U.S. economy is headed for a soft landing. Fifth, there is a divergence between data and personal experience, specifically reflected in the contrast between the decline in inflation data and the harsh inflationary pressures felt by ordinary people. On October 30, data released by the BEA showed that the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 2.2% on an annualized quarter-over-quarter basis in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than the market expectation of 2.1%, but 0.6 percentage points lower than the second quarter. Subsequently, on October 31, data from the BEA revealed that the U.S. PCE price index for September rose 2.1% year-over-year, in line with expectations, marking the lowest level since early 2021. In contrast, starting in mid-September, U.S. dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree began to lower their sales forecasts and warned that their core consumers were under pressure, which caused their stock prices to drop sharply. Dollar stores, known for their low-cost, limited-product, and low-price business model, originally priced all items at a dollar and have long been a source of food and basic goods for low-income Americans. The sales performance of these dollar stores provides a clear indication of the real state of U.S. inflation and its impact on the consumption spending of middle- and low-income groups. The decline in cold, hard inflation data sharply contrasts with the dire economic realities faced by ordinary citizens. As ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan put it, the current U.S. inflation data is unreliable; the base effect of the data masks the deeper underlying significance beneath the surface. Overall, in recent times, the fragmentation of U.S. economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-level divisions within the United States. Kung Chan has pointed out more profoundly that the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data are now highly questionable. In the future, the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution, as the importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, making it almost inadvisable to use such data directly. Final analysis conclusion: In recent times, the fragmentation of American economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-layered divisions within the United States. At the same time, there are significant doubts about the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data. The importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, which means that the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution.

Has Anyone Noticed What BRICS+ Is Telling Us About A New World Or...	By Jean-Daniel Ruch In the beginning, there were four: Brazil, China, India and Russia. Following their first summit in 2009, they expanded to become BRICS with the accession of South Africa in 2011 and then nine in January 2024. At the sixteenth BRICS summit this October in Kazan, Russia, two African countries, Egypt and Ethiopia, and two Middle Eastern countries, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, made up what people now refer to as BRICS+. Thirteen among the more than thirty countries that have formally expressed their interest in membership are now associated with BRICS+: four Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam), two Latin American countries (Cuba and Bolivia), three African countries (Algeria, Nigeria, Uganda), two Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) and two European countries (Belarus and NATO member Turkey). They were given the status of 'partner states' in Kazan. To say that the Americans are not enthusiastic about the appeal of this new global club would be an understatement. Should the success of the summit in Kazan be interpreted as a sign of the failure of their strategy to isolate Russia? Worse still, are we witnessing the beginning of the end of the American century? In addition to the nine member states and thirteen partners, the summit was also attended by some representatives of countries whose presence was rather unexpected, such as the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, the very Russophilic Alexander Vulin. However, it was the presence of UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutierres that caused outraged reactions, especially in Ukraine. 'The UN Secretary-General declined Ukraine’s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland. However, he has accepted the invitation of the war criminal Putin to Kazan,' hammered the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. It is true that Gutierres boycotted the Bürgenstock meeting this spring. It is also legitimate to wonder whether a UN Secretary-General should shake hands with a person accused of war crimes, even if he is the president of a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin on March 17, 2023. This juicy skewer of participants is notable for its heterogeneity. There are dictatorships and democracies, Muslim, Christian and secular countries, economic superpowers and failed nations, some have characterized as rogue states. Are what we are witnessing merely an updated reiteration of that elastic non-aligned movement launched in the 1960s by Yugoslavia’s Prime Minister Josip Tito and Indian Jawaharlal Nehru, which encompassed two-thirds of the world but never achieved any real global influence? No, something else is happening here. In the space of sixty years, the balance of global power has clearly changed. A motley but (almost) global group with growing influence Antonio Gutierres is a realist. He understands how historically significant the bubbling events within the BRICS states are. He was in Kazan because it is important. To underline that point, consider a few figures. The nine countries now called BRICS+ account for more than half of the world’s population. Their combined gross national product is already greater than that of their rivals in the G7, the Western directorate comprising the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. The gap is likely to widen in the coming years, since the BRICS+ growth rate is around 5%, while Western economies are stagnating at 1–2% — and some, like Germany’s, are officially in a recession. Despite these new geo-economic realities, the international order established by the West after the World War II has been resistant to change. The UN Security Council will remain secure in the hands of its five permanent members — three Western states plus China and Russia — for a long time to come. However, the BRICS states are not seeking to change the United Nations Charter or create a parallel system to the United Nations. Rather, they are focusing on the economic and financial governance of the world. Parallel to the founding of the United Nations, the victorious Western powers, at the Bretton Woods conference in 1945, created institutions designed to regulate world finance. The dollar became the world’s reserve currency, making every country vulnerable to US sanctions. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which provide financial assistance to countries in difficulty, are run like shareholder meetings, in which the US holds a decisive vote. Together with the other Western nations, they possess an absolute majority. It is these two pillars of Western power in the world that the BRICS states hope to compete with. But how? It would be literally impossible to reform the international financial institutions in such a way as to reduce Western influence in them. However, they cannot prevent the creation of parallel systems of payment. The BRICS countries are thus working on three main tasks: A mechanism for processing international payments independent of SWIFT — from which Russia was excluded after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. An intensification of trade that is invoiced in local currencies instead of dollars, in order to accelerate the 'de-dollarization of the world.' A development bank that competes with the World Bank and finances infrastructure projects. There are currently 96 projects underway with a total volume of $32 billion. Critics of the BRICS states doubt that they are able to really compete with the dollar. Despite a steady erosion, the greenback still accounts for 55% of the reserves of the national banks. And when it is replaced by other currencies, these tend to be Western currencies, with the notable exception of the Chinese renminbi. Nevertheless, the trend is clear and the potential of BRICS+ is there. The formation of alternative transportation corridors is part of the same strategy to break free from Western, i.e., American dependency. Land routes vs. sea routes In a globalized and interdependent world, the transport of goods represents a strategic dimension. From cars to cell phones, hardly any industrial activity exists that does not include and depend on an accumulation of natural resources and semi-finished products from all corners of the world. Over the last hundred years, goods have primarily been transported by sea. Today, sea freight accounts for 70% of world trade. You only have to look at a map of the 128 US naval bases around the world to realize how important the sea lanes are to Washington’s power strategy. From the Sea of Japan to Malacca, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Panama, Rotterdam and New York, Washington’s ambition — sometimes supported by its British ally — to dominate the seas is obvious. With its 'Belt and Road' initiative, China has been trying for several years to develop land routes to, compete or at least complement the existing sea routes. It is therefore very revealing that one of the flagship projects highlighted in Kazan was the North–South Corridor, which will ultimately connect St. Petersburg with India, without passing through any Western-controlled areas. Is it worth remembering that India has become the largest importer of Russian oil products, despite the very audible gnashing of teeth in Washington? What is Switzerland doing? Between soft power and economic impact, the BRICS+ are redrawing the geopolitical map. Is Switzerland even aware of this probably irreversible development? Has it sought an invitation to Kazan? The answer is yes, Swiss companies are well aware of the underlying forces shaping the world of tomorrow. This is why some, for example in the trade sector, are moving to Dubai. Yes, Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs is well aware of this. It wants to update our free trade agreement with China. Switzerland is the only European country apart from Iceland to have concluded such an agreement. That is an advantage. Unfortunately, the options chosen by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport have not been helpful. By running after the Americans, who have been losing all their wars for twenty years, weFO° Exclusive: Make Sense of BRICS Summit in Russiahave turned Russia against us and made China doubt our reliability. Moreover, for three quarters of the world Gaza has become a symbol of the moral bankruptcy of the West, including Switzerland. Is there still time to restore our credibility? Is this even possible with the current political cast running our affairs? These are the questions that every Swiss citizen must rightly ask themselves.

Medicare Advantage Is Saving Taxpayers Money – OpEd	A new study finds that the migration of people from traditional Medicare to the Medicare Advantage program over the last decade has saved the federal government $144 billion. The study arrives at a time when critics have stepped up their claims that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are over-billing Medicare and causing a waste of taxpayer money. The study was conducted by Elevance, a private insurer with an obvious financial interest in the topic. However, the researchers make their data sources apparent and their results are available for scrutiny by others. The Elevance study builds on a finding by other, more limited investigations: What happens in the MA system indirectly affects what happens to patients in traditional Medicare. In a typical MA plan, doctors are encouraged to practice integrated, coordinated care—sharing medical records and following agreed-upon treatment plans, for example. This results in more efficient care. Yet these very same doctors also treat traditional Medicare patients. So, methods they employ to practice cost-effective care for one set of patients are more likely to be repeated in the treatment of other patients. Other studies have found that where there is a large presence of MA patients in an area, there tend to be spillover effects. Protocols used by MA plans tend to be become more widespread—affecting all Medicare patients. The Elevance study measures this effect nationwide. It is a first-time comparison of spending on MA patients and traditional Medicare patients in the same counties, across the entire country. The finding: larger enrollment in MA plans leads to lower spending on all Medicare patients. Specifically, a 10% increase in market share by MA plans leads to an average decrease in spending on all Medicare beneficiaries of between $105 and $127 per person, per year. Savings for Seniors More than half of all seniors in Medicare get their health insurance from a private MA plan. Because these plans typically provide comprehensive coverage, enrollees avoid paying for 'medigap' insurance that other seniors acquire to plug the holes in traditional Medicare. That’s one reason why the average senior in an MA plan is saving $2,541 a year in out-of-pocket costs. Participants also get extra benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get, including dental, eye, and hearing care. Since the program was originally a bipartisan creation, you would think that politicians in both parties would openly brag about the program and claim credit for it. Yet in recent years, many on the left have become increasingly hostile. The Biden administration has slashed payments to MA plans over the past two years, causing some MA plans to leave the market altogether and others to reduce the benefits they offer. The administration has also been a ruthless regulator. Based on a 'secret shopper' report, the administration fined one company $190 million for falling to answer a phone call in less than 8 seconds! Are MA plans overpaid? The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) claims that MA plans are paid 20% more than Medicare pays for patients with similar health conditions in traditional Medicare. They admit that MA patients get more benefits than regular Medicare patients But, they argue that giving MA enrollees benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get is not a good use of taxpayer money. One problem with MedPAC’s analysis is that traditional Medicare enrollees are not a homogeneous population. Some are also in employer plans. Some are also in Medicaid. They have different levels of out-of-pocket exposure. In failing to thoroughly adjust for these differences, MedPAC did not make a true apples-to-apples comparison between Medicare spending on enrollees in traditional Medicare and on MA enrollees. A more rigorous study by Milliman corrected for these problems and found that the government saves money when people leave traditional Medicare and enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. The savings equal $576 per enrollee per year. This is consistent with the Elevance results, independent of spillover effects. Upcoding One reason why the Medicare Advantage program works so much better than the (Obamacare) exchange is individualized risk adjustment. That means that MA plans get paid based on the health condition of their enrollees. If a patient is very sick, the government will pay the plan more. These payments are designed to make the healthy and the sick equally attractive to an insurer. As a result, MA plans have a financial incentive to find and report every health condition that generates a more generous payment from Medicare. 'Upcoding' occurs when the plans report conditions that might not be reported by doctors practicing in traditional Medicare. Critics claim that MA companies are overly zealous—perhaps even reporting phantom conditions. This is one of the suspicions behind the claim that MA plans are overpaid. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal (in collaboration with Medicare) found that in a single year, Medicare paid insurers $50 billion for diseases no doctor ever treated. However, doctors and hospitals treating traditional Medicare patients also have a financial incentive to overbill Medicare. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there are a higher percent of coding errors in traditional Medicare and they cost taxpayers twice as much money ($31.2 billion versus $16.6 billion in 2023). Efficiency The Better Medicare Alliance (an industry-funded organization), reports that MA plans deliver 13% lower inpatient hospitalization costs, 49% lower acute care hospital stays, and a 43% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations. This is despite the fact that MA enrollees have lower incomes, less education and are more likely to be from a minority population. The comparison is even better for people enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid—thought to be the most vulnerable population. Among this group, being in an MA plan means a 14.2% lower likelihood of a hospital stay, a 72.6% higher likelihood of receiving a colorectal cancer screening, and a 52.5% higher likelihood of having a breast cancer screening. The Medicare Advantage program has shown that competition in the marketplace is superior to government-run health insurance—in raising quality and lowering costs.

‘NAFTA Fever’ And The Myth Of Government-Created Free Markets – O...	By David Brady, Jr. Left or right, the enemy is the free market. Every problem is the fault of the free market. On the left, the supposed radical deregulation of the 1980s paved the way for the financial crisis and the destruction of the environment. On the right, free trade is responsible for the gutting of manufacturing. The free market is made out in this mythos to have had its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s and destroyed everything. Even free market advocates fall into this trap, saying that this time in the near past was a free market victory. The results—they try to argue with the market critics, but they agree with the causal analysis: Markets won! Hooray!The fact is that all three of these groups are wrong. There was no American market revolution in the ‘80s. It is important to make note of the rhetoric of American life up until the 1980s. American life at the beginning of the 1930s was introduced to the message of 'market failures' that justified the New Deal. By the end of the 1940s, Americans were thrown into the Cold War, where all of American life was defined by a battle between 'American Capitalism' and 'Soviet Communism.' Paying lip service to the free market was easy. Fusionism became the default conservative ideology, the mixture of so-called 'fiscal conservatism,' the 'moral majority,' and hawkish foreign policy. The hawkish foreign policy—the boogeyman of National Review—was bearing the brunt of the load. As Buckley put it: We have got to accept Big Government for the duration [of the Cold War]— for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged…except through the instrumentality of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores. 'Fiscal conservatism' was cast aside in the name of fighting the Soviet menace, but it was in the name of capitalism because everything was done in the name of fighting communism. Every American who bought into the existential crisis of Cold War rhetoric could be coaxed into supporting any policy in the name of capitalism and free trade. So when politicians wheeled forward thousand-page treaties with import/export quotas, environmental regulations, and currency price controls under the name of 'Free Trade Agreements.' No wonder the American people got behind it. No wonder free trade got stuck with the blame. It is an age-old tactic to give bills positive names while they have the opposite effect (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act). Who would oppose the 'Giving Puppies Good Homes Bill of 2024'? At the end of the Cold War, who would oppose a supposed free trade agreement with our fellow capitalist allies? With the backing of the tail-end of the Cold War market-rhetoric and every Cold War 'free enterprise' think tank, we were given NAFTA. Rothbard himself lamented the rise of NAFTA fervor in every so-called 'free market think tank.' He wrote in his essay 'The NAFTA Myth': For some people, it seems, all you have to do to convince them of the free enterprise nature of something is to label it 'market,' and so we have the spawning of such grotesque creatures as 'market socialists' or 'market liberals.' The word 'freedom,' of course, is also a grabber, and so another way to gain adherents in an age that exalts rhetoric over substance is simply to call yourself or your proposal 'free market' or 'free trade.' Labels are often enough to nab the suckers. And so, among champions of free trade, the label 'North American Free Trade Agreement' (Nafta) is supposed to command unquestioning assent. 'But how can you be against free trade?' It’s very easy. The folks who have brought us Nafta and presume to call it 'free trade' are the same people who call government spending 'investment,' taxes 'contributions,' and raising taxes 'deficit reduction.' Let us not forget that the Communists, too, used to call their system 'freedom.' One has to wonder where NAFTA supporters found their solace: Was it ignorance of what was actually in the treaty? Was it in favor of some 'middle-of-the-road' policy? Or was it by virtue of being purchased and funded by vested business interests that benefited from the treaty? We may never quite know. But we can know for certainty that a treatise with thousands of pages, featuring currency controls, import controls, and imposed cross-border regulations is hardly a laissez-faire victory. But these rhetorical victories that Rothbard decries become stuck in the minds of Americans. The media proclaims the 'new age of free trade!' and most buy into it. The failures of interventionism are thus blamed on the free market. Reagan is lauded as a limited government president who unleashed the markets through deregulation but that is truly a myth. Reagan may have allowed his bureaucracies to loosen environmental regulations in his tenure but it opened the door for the dreaded Chevron Doctrine. Reagan did not touch the New Deal and Great Society apparatus of regulation. The bureaucracies of the Progressive Era remained intact. The central bank remained. Reagan may have lowered some income tax rates, but he was hardly a deregulator. Lest any progressive try to blame so-called 'financial deregulation' for the 'Dotcom' and 2008 recessions, the only needed response is Tom Woods’ book Meltdown. Central banks playing price controls with interest rates created the financial crises. Thus, we reach the two-fold path of 'NAFTA fever.' It comes in two forms: either the radical insistence on a free market victory that never truly happened or the hatred of the free market based off of a rhetorical scheme that never was true. Neither are honest or helpful. Those defending markets should not fall into NAFTA fever, into a dogmatic orthodoxy whereby they defend NAFTA and the illusion of a free market victory. These were never free market victories, but intervention dressed in the garb of market rhetoric. We should not be jumping to the defense of the results of interventionism. Interventionism causes a death spiral of failure and continually worse social conditions. To bring about free markets and a more prosperous society, we need to make it clear what is the fault of interventionism and what isn’t. The United States has been defined by interventionist economic policy for a century, so it is no wonder that social conditions have worsened and more have become discontent. Free markets didn’t cause our conditions, they were simply the costume in which interventionism was packaged.No wonder more people today despise markets. By buying into the rhetorical marketplace of the time interventionists and cronies passed off their interventionist legislation as part of a 'market revolution.' The revolution never came, unlike the revolution described by Garet Garrett. American political discourse needs a cure to its NAFTA fever.

There Are No ‘Easy Wars’ Left To Fight, But Do Not Mistake The Lo...	Israelis, as a whole, are exhibiting a rosy assurance that they can harness Trump, if not to the full annexation of the Occupied Territories (Trump in his first term did not support such annexation), but rather, to ensnare him into a war on Iran. Many (even most) Israelis are raring for war on Iran and an aggrandisement of their territory (devoid of Arabs). They are believing the puffery that Iran ‘lies naked’, staggeringly vulnerable, before a U.S. and Israeli military strike. Trump’s Team nominations, so far, reveal a foreign policy squad of fierce supporters of Israel and of passionate hostility to Iran. The Israeli media term it a ‘dream team’ for Netanyahu. It certainly looks that way. The Israel Lobby could not have asked for more. They have got it. And with the new CIA chief, they get a known ultra China hawk as a bonus. But in the domestic sphere the tone is precisely the converse: The key nomination for ‘cleaning the stables’ is Matt Gaetz as Attorney General; he is a real 'bomb thrower'. And for the Intelligence clean-up, Tulsi Gabbard is appointed as Director of National Intelligence. All intelligence agencies will report to her, and she will be responsible for the President’s Daily briefing. The intel assessments may thus begin to reflect something closer to reality. The deep Inter-Agency structure has reason to be very afraid; they are panicking – especially over Gaetz. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have the near impossible task of cutting out-of-control federal spending and currency printing. The System is deeply dependent on the bloat of government spending to keep the cogs and levers of the mammoth ‘security’ boondoggle whirring. It is not going to be yielded up without a bitter fight. So, on the one hand, the Lobby gets a dream team (Israel), but on the other side (the domestic sphere), it gets a renegade team. This must be deliberate. Trump knows that Biden’s legacy of bloating GDP with government jobs and excessive public spending is the real ‘time bomb’ awaiting him. Again the withdrawal symptoms, as the drug of easy money is withdrawn, may prove incendiary. Moving to a structure of tariffs and low taxes will be disruptive. Whether deliberate or not, Trump is keeping his cards close to his chest. We have only glimpses of intent – and the water is being seriously muddied by the infamous ‘Inter-Agency’ grandees. For example, in respect to the Pentagon sanctioning private-sector contractors to work in Ukraine, this was done in coordination with 'inter-agency stakeholders'. The old nemesis that paralysed his first term again faces Trump. Then, during the Ukraine impeachment process, one witness (Vindman), when asked why he would not defer to the President’s explicit instructions, replied that whilst Trump has his view on Ukraine policy, that stance did NOT align with that of the ‘Inter-Agency’ agreed position. In plain language, Vindman denied that a U.S. president has agency in foreign policy formulation. In short, the ‘Inter-Agency structure’ was signalling to Trump that military support for Ukraine must continue. When the Washington Post published their detailed story of a Trump-Putin phone call – that the Kremlin emphatically states never happened – the deep structures of policy were simply telling Trump that it would be they who determine what the shape of the U.S. ‘solution’ for Ukraine would be. Similarly, when Netanyahu boasts to have spoken to Trump and that Trump 'shares' his views regarding Iran, Trump was being indirectly instructed what his policy towards Iran needs to be. All the (false) rumours about appointments to his Team too, were but the interagency signalling their choices for his key posts. No wonder confusion reigns. So, what can be deduced at this early stage? If there is a common thread, it has been a constant refrain that Trump is against war. And that he demands from his picks personal loyalty and no ties of obligation to the Lobby or the Swamp. So, is the packing of his Administration with ‘Israel Firsters’ an indication that Trump is edging toward a ‘Realist’s Faustian pact’ to destroy Iran in order to cripple China’s energy supply source (90% from Iran), and thus weaken China? – Two birds with one stone, so to speak? The collapse of Iran would also weaken Russia and hobble the BRICS’ transport-corridor projects. Central Asia needs both Iranian energy and its key transport corridors linking China, Iran, and Russia as primary nodes of Eurasian commerce. When the RAND Organisation, the Pentagon think-tank, recently published a landmark appraisal of the 2022 National Defence Strategy (NDS), its findings were stark: An unrelentingly bleak analysis of every aspect of the U.S. war machine. In brief, the U.S. is 'not prepared', the appraisal argued, in any meaningful way for serious ‘competition’ with its major adversaries – and is vulnerable or even significantly outmatched in every sphere of warfare. The U.S., the RAND appraisal continues, could in short order be drawn into a war across multiple theatres with peer and near-peer adversaries – and it could lose. It warns that the U.S. public has not internalized the costs of the U.S. losing its position as the world superpower. The U.S. must therefore engage globally with a presence—military, diplomatic, and economic—to preserve influence worldwide. Indeed, as one respected commentator has noted, the ‘Empire at all Costs’ cult (i.e. the RAND Organisation zeitgeist) is now 'more desperate than ever to find a war it can fight to restore its fortunes and prestige'. And China would be altogether a different proposition for a demonstrative act of destruction in order 'to preserve U.S. influence worldwide' – for the U.S. is 'not prepared' for serious conflict with its peer adversaries: Russia or China, RAND says. The straitened situation of the U.S. after decades of fiscal excess and offshoring (the backdrop to its current weakened military industrial base) now makes kinetic war with China or Russia or 'across multiple theatres' a prospect to be shunned. The point that the commentator above makes is that there are no ‘easy wars’ left to fight. And that the reality (brutally outlined by RAND) is that the U.S. can choose one – and only one war to fight. Trump may not want any war, but the Lobby grandees – all supporters of Israel, if not active Zionists supporting the displacement of Palestinians – want war. And they believe they can get one. Put starkly and plainly: Has Trump thought this through? Have the others in the Trump Team reminded him that in today’s world, with U.S. military strength slipping away, there no longer are any ‘easy wars’ to fight, although Zionists believe that with a decapitation strike on Iran’s religious and IRGC leadership (on the lines of the Israel’s strikes on Hizbullah leaders in Beirut), the Iranian people would rise up against their leaders, and side with Israel for a ‘New Middle East’. Netanyahu has just made his second broadcast to the Iranian people promising them early salvation. He and his government are not waiting to ask Trump to nod his consent to the annexation of all Occupied Palestinian Territories. That project is being implemented on the ground. It is unfolding now. Netanyahu and his cabinet have the ethnic cleansing ‘bit between their teeth’. Will Trump be able to roll it back? How so? Or will he succumb to becoming ‘genocide Don’? This putative ‘Iran War’ is following the same narrative cycle as with Russia: ‘Russia is weak; its military is poorly trained; its equipment mostly recycled from the Soviet era; its missiles and artillery in short supply’. Zbig Brzezinski earlier had taken the logic to its conclusion in The Grand Chessboard (1997): Russia would have no choice but to submit to the expansion of NATO and to the geopolitical dictates of the U.S.. That was ‘then’ (a little more than a year ago). Russia took the western challenge – and today is in the driving seat in Ukraine, whilst the West looks on helplessly. This last month, it was U.S. retired General Jack Keane, the strategic analyst for Fox News, who argued that Israel’s air strike on Iran had left it 'essentially naked', with most air defences 'taken down' and its missile production factories destroyed by Israel’s 26 October strikes. Iran’s vulnerability, Keane said, is 'simply staggering'. Kean channels the early Brzezinski: His message is clear – Iran will be an ‘easy war’. That forecast however, is likely to be revealed as dead wrong. And, if pursued, will lead to a complete military and economic disaster for Israel. But do not rule out the distinct possibility that Netanyahu – besieged on all fronts and teetering on the brink of internal crisis and even jail – is desperate enough to do it. His is, after all, a Biblical mandate that he pursues for Israel! Iran likely will launch a painful response to Israel before the 20 January Presidential Inauguration. Its riposte will demonstrate Iran’s unexpected and unforeseen military innovation. What the U.S. and Israel will then do may well open the door to wider regional war. Sentiment across the region seethes at the slaughter in the Occupied Territories and in Lebanon. Trump may not appreciate just how isolated the U.S. and Israel are among Israel’s Arab and Sunni neighbours. The U.S. is stretched so thin, and its forces across the region are so vulnerable to the hostility that the daily slaughter incubates, that a regional war might be enough to bring the entire house of cards tumbling down. The crisis would pitch Trump into a financial crisis that could sink his domestic economic aspirations too.

Robert Reich: There Was No Mandate For Trump, There Was No Red Sh...	Trump is saying the election gave him a 'very big mandate.' Rubbish. It wasn’t a mandate at all. It wasn’t even a 'red shift' to Trump and the Republicans. It was a blue abandonment. We now know that nine million fewer votes were cast nationwide in 2024 than in 2020. Trump got about a million more votes than he did in 2020 (700,000 of them in the seven battleground states). That’s no big deal. The bigger news is that Harris got 10 million fewer votes than Biden did in 2020 (400,000 fewer in the battleground states). Harris campaigned hard in the battlegrounds, so her erosion from Biden’s vote there wasn’t nearly as much, proportionately, as it was everywhere else across the country. The biggest takeaway is that Biden’s 9 million votes disappeared. Why? It couldn’t have been because of virulent racism because we elected a Black man, twice. It couldn’t have been misogyny, since Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than Trump in 2016, and Clinton’s actions and statements probably triggered more misogyny in 2016 than did Harris’s in 2024. There’s no evidence of illegal vote tampering or of voter suppression nearly on this scale. In fact, it was easier to cast a ballot this year than in 2020. So what happened to the 9 million? We can’t know for sure but it seems most likely that those 9 million potential voters — mostly working class — said to themselves, 'I won’t vote for Trump because he’s an asshole. But I won’t vote for the Democrats either, because they don’t give a damn about me.' The task for the Democrats is what it should have been all along: remaking the party into the party of the bottom 90 percent — the party of people who don’t live off stocks and bonds, of people who are not CEOs or billionaires like Mark Cuban, the party that rejects Elon Musk and the entire American oligarchy. Instead, the Democratic Party must be the party of average working people whose wages have gone nowhere and whose jobs are less secure. Blue-collar private-sector workers earned more on average in 1972, after adjusting for inflation, than they are earning now in 2024. This means today’s blue-collar workers are on average earning less in real dollars than their grandparents earned 52 years ago. Yet the American economy is far larger than it was 52 years ago. Where did the additional money go? To the top. So what’s the Democrats’ task? To restructure the economy toward more widely shared prosperity. This isn’t a blue-state versus red-state phenomenon. It’s a class phenomenon. In Missouri, one of the reddest of the red, voters passed an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by a wide margin, even as they overwhelmingly rejected Harris. It looks like they did the same in Alaska. In ruby-red Nebraska, roughly 75 percent of voters backed a measure to institute paid sick leave, although they rejected Harris. (Nebraskans also came close to unseating their incumbent senator in favor of Dan Osborn, a union activist who ran as an independent and railed against corporate overlords.) Americans across the board want a fairer economy. Trump Republicans won’t deliver one. Instead, Trump and his allies are readying more tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthy and regulatory rollbacks. They’re preparing to hand the country over to billionaires. Democrats! This is your opportunity! Take it! This article was published at Robert Reich's Substack	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-15T17:37:36-08:00	
Weapons From Libyan Stockpiles Flow To Terror Groups In Nigeria –...	Terrorists that plague northern Nigeria are arming themselves with weapons that originated in Libya, according to Nigerian defense officials. Weapons traffickers in Nigeria are benefitting from instability across the Sahel, particularly in Niger, which has become a key transit point for weapons taken from Libyan stockpiles. Those weapons have moved into other Sahel countries as well as Nigeria, according to the Small Arms Survey. 'When we talk about the proliferation of arms, first, you have to look at what happened in Libya years ago and in the Sahel,' Nigerian Maj. Gen. Edward Buba said during a recent briefing. 'Now, this gave the opportunity for arms to get into the wrong hands and then filtered into our country, which worsened the issue of insurgency and terrorism that we were faced with in the country.' In late October, Nigeria’s National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons destroyed 2,400 weapons confiscated from criminals across the country. Johnson Kokumo, the center’s director-general, said Nigeria would not tolerate the illegal trafficking of weapons into the country. 'These frameworks underscore the importance of transparent documentation and the responsible disposal of recovered arms, ensuring that they do not find their way back into the hands of criminal elements,' Kokumo said during the destruction ceremony in Abuja. The volume of illicit weapons into Nigeria has been described as 'like rice on the market,' with much of that traffic being traced back to Libya. 'This unlimited and unchecked proliferation of illegal arms has reached an epidemic level in Nigeria in recent times with attendant national security implications,' analyst Dakuku Peterside wrote for The Cable. The flow of weapons contributes to violence, crime and insecurity in the country. The 2011 collapse of the Libyan government under former dictator Moammar Gadhafi left the country’s massive weapons arsenals largely unguarded. The United Nations estimated in 2020 that Libya had as much as 200,000 tons of weapons at the time of its collapse. The subsequent civil wars made the security of Libya’s weapons stockpiles even worse. 'Those weapons were sitting virtually unguarded, destined for markets in the Sahel down south,' Defense News Nigeria wrote on X. 'At the apex of its power the Boko Haram campaign was being fueled by large scale heavy weapons supplies from [Gadhafi’s] looted vast arms stockpile.' Beyond its own stockpiles, Libya has also become a source of foreign weapons — many of them made in Russia and brought to the country by mercenaries connected to the former Wagner Group, now known as Africa Corps. Russia also uses Libyan ports to supply weapons to military juntas ruling Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Many of those weapons ultimately end up in the hands of terrorists in northern Nigeria, threatening civilians and Soldiers alike. Experts say terrorists have also captured weapons during raids on military outposts. In 2020, the Small Arms Survey estimated that Nigeria had 6.2 million small arms in the hands of civilians compared to about 580,000 in the hands of security forces. The presence of illicit weapons creates a vicious cycle of instability as local communities arm themselves to defend against terrorists and criminals, according to experts. That’s especially true in communities that feel ignored or overlooked by government security forces. 'Surging illicit arms flows have increased the availability of firearms in many communities,' researchers with the Small Arms Survey wrote in a study. 'Formerly low-level local conflicts thus risk violent escalation as traditional weapons — or, indeed, peaceful means of dispute settlement — are replaced with modern firearms.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSM7O1tblkgm4	2024-11-15T17:35:10-08:00	
Taliban Regime Post-US Withdrawal: Legitimacy Is Being Recognized...	In August 2021, the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces from Afghanistan precipitated the collapse of the previous Afghan government, resulting in the Taliban's resurgence and subsequent control over Kabul. For nearly twenty years, the insurgents have actively been involved in military confrontations with the US and NATO forces. Shortly after the withdrawal, thereafter, the Taliban announced the formation of a new government, which has yet to receive recognition from any foreign state or international organization. The cessation of development assistance, which previously accounted for 75% of the former government's expenditures, had come to an end abruptly by Western donors. The cutoff has precipitated a profound humanitarian and economic crisis in Afghanistan, exacerbated by the abrupt disintegration of the war economy alongside various other contributing factors. Since that time, the international community has pursued a strategy that balances selective engagement with the emerging regime alongside measures of isolation. Western nations have enacted a series of sanctions, asset freezes, and banking restrictions in response to the Taliban regime's significant constraints on the rights of women and girls, reflecting a deep-seated concern for human rights and gender equality. While certain countries have engaged in discreet dialogues with the Taliban concerning security issues, they have concurrently allocated billions of dollars towards poverty alleviation and famine prevention efforts. Through the establishment of trade agreements and the accreditation of Taliban ambassadors, neighbouring countries have adopted a more accommodative approach in their interactions with the newly formed government in Kabul. Although the systematic exclusion of women and girls from many facets of public life limits the benefits that half of the population receives from the positive changes, some aspects of Afghans' lives have improved and others have deteriorated three years after Taliban rule was renewed. Internal Perception of the Taliban Regime The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021 after fighting against the foreign powers and the U.S.-backed Kabul government since 2001. Afghanistan's economy has fallen apart under Taliban rule. Job losses number in the hundreds of thousands, and malnutrition rates have been rising. The women have not been allowed to work. The Taliban regained control after the U.S.-backed government fell, threatening Afghans' civil and political rights, with the UN documenting human rights violations. Taliban intimidates journalists, restricts press freedoms, cracks down on demonstrations, and reinstates the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Women face severe restrictions on secondary school, university teaching, and employment. Restricting women's employment may cost Afghanistan's GDP up to 5%, according to the UN Development Program. The Taliban's takeover has stalled the improvements in living standards, leaving nearly all Afghans in poverty and causing the economy to shrink by up to 30% since then. Security has improved, but violence persists, especially with the Islamic State in Khorasan targeting civilians. Some scholars have argued that many Afghans unequivocally abhor the Taliban's governance. Their adversaries predominantly consist of numerous individuals from ethnic groups distinct from the Pashtun majority of the Taliban, as well as men and women who contest the Taliban's limitations on women and girls, and those who prefer the freedoms and constitutional governance previously enjoyed over the opaque theocracy established by the new regime. The Emir's decisions seem to have irritated certain Taliban members, especially younger officials who contend that their government is lagging in a modernizing society. The protests by opium farmers signify that the Taliban's anti-drug campaign has resulted in a loss of support in certain provinces. Nevertheless, a small number of individuals within the population are in favor of the Taliban. The extent of this sentiment is once again challenging to ascertain; however, a significant number of Afghans, particularly those residing in the rural south and east, regard the regime change as a triumph for their right to self-determination. This is due to the fact that their side emerged victorious in the war, and their political convictions now have a greater influence in the capital. Women who either support the Taliban or oppose the years-long violence perpetrated across much of the nation by the security forces of the previous administration and its foreign backers comprise this constituency, which is predominantly Pashtun. A group of Afghans perceives the regime as a mixed bag, particularly in comparison to the previous governing structures, and does not express either support or opposition. For example, after decades of conflict, certain individuals may be appreciative of the newfound security but desire that women and girls faced fewer challenges. In addition to their disapproval of the Taliban's governance, numerous Afghans were also enraged by the corruption and oppression of previous regimes. The size of these constituencies has been particularly challenging to determine due to the severe flaws in Afghan polls. No De Jure Diplomatic Recognition The Taliban regime has not been recognized by most of the countries due to their concerns regarding its governance, violation of human rights, security, and non-compliance with international standards. The regime's lack of inclusivity, violations of human rights, and affiliations with terrorist organizations have prompted concerns regarding international security. Its governance exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and undermines its legitimacy. This is perceived by numerous nations as a method of exerting pressure on the Taliban. The Taliban have governed Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since 2021, when they overthrew the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan through force. The international community has widely condemned the takeover, and no nations have granted the new regime de jure diplomatic recognition, despite the fact that it ostensibly maintains relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban have been advocating for international recognition since assuming power. Some nations have declared that they will only recognize the Islamic Emirate if human rights are upheld there, while others have vowed never to do so. However, certain countries have granted Taliban diplomats the status of chargé d'affaires, despite their refusal to acknowledge the Islamic Emirate. Despite being the first nation to formally name a new ambassador to the country since the takeover in September 2023 and officially recognize the Taliban's envoy to China in January 2024, the PRC still does not formally recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The United Arab Emirates also received a Taliban-appointed diplomat as the new ambassador of Afghanistan in August 2024. Neighbouring Countries’ Cautious Engagements with Taliban Although most of the countries have not formally recognized the Taliban, on the contrary, the neighboring countries such as India, China, and Russia have been engaging with them due to practical considerations. Security imperatives such as regional stability and counterterrorism are significant imperatives due to concerns regarding cross-border extremist group activities. Examples of strategic interests that are also relevant include Pakistan's ambition for power, China's Belt and Road Initiative, India's regional balance, and Russia's security in Central Asia. Engagement is also necessary for economic reasons, such as resolving Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis and gaining access to its resources. These countries employ a realpolitik strategy to achieve stability and influence, while simultaneously exerting pressure on the Taliban to moderate its rule and adhere to international standards. India has officially denied any consular appointments or recognition given to the Taliban government. However, recently it has conducted a diplomatic visit to Kabul, during which it met with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and acting defense minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob. India's recent visit to Afghanistan is indicative of its increasing diplomatic engagement with Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Since 2022, India has pursued a more pragmatic strategy to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan and the region, despite the fact that it did not officially recognize the Taliban government. India is collaborating with Afghanistan in a variety of ways, including the establishment of a technical team at the embassy, the admission of more than 3000 students since 2021, and participation in the 'Afghanistan Regional Cooperation Initiative' meeting in Kabul in 2024. Geopolitical interests, regional stability, and secure investments are all significantly impacted by India's engagement. The Zaranj-Delaram highway and the Afghan-India Friendship Dam are two critical infrastructure projects that India is supporting in Afghanistan. The latter offers an alternative route into landlocked Afghanistan by bypassing Pakistan and passing through Iran's Chabahar port. In India, the appointment of Ikramuddin Kamil as Acting Consul at the Mumbai consulate of Afghanistan is a pragmatic response to the requirements of Afghan nationals in India, however, the same does not constitute an endorsement of the Taliban regime. India ensures that consular services are maintained for the Afghan diaspora by prioritizing Kamil's Afghan identity over his Taliban affiliation. India's cautious selection of a familiar figure for this role is further mirrored by his Indian-educated background. The action underscores India's changing strategy of restricted engagement with the Taliban, which prioritizes regional stability and operational requirements while simultaneously upholding its non-recognition stance in collaboration with the international community. Moscow has announced its intention to normalize relations with the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations. The Taliban's human rights violations, particularly those related to women's rights, have been the subject of international concern. Despite these concerns, the removal is perceived as a humanitarian response to the crisis in Afghanistan, offering crucial assistance to alleviate criticism. Russia regards the Taliban as its most effective ally in addressing the threat posed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), which it regards as a more immediate threat to regional stability than the Taliban itself. The normalization of Moscow's relations with the Taliban government, which is still not recognized by any country in the world, would be facilitated by the removal of the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and the lifting of sanctions against the group. The Taliban's transition to normalization is a component of Russia's strategy to establish stronger partnerships with the primary adversaries of ISKP (Fazl-e-Haider, 2024 November 13). The Taliban's potential support for militants in Xinjiang was a primary concern for China, which expressed its willingness to engage with them after the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. In June 2022, a catastrophic earthquake in southeastern Afghanistan prompted China to provide substantial humanitarian aid, including $7.5 million and supplies. The Taliban publicly acknowledged this action. Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Co (CAPEIC), a Chinese oil company, executed a substantial contract with the Taliban in January 2023. The contract, which was valued at $150 million for the initial year and $540 million by 2026, was intended to increase oil extraction and generate approximately 3,000 jobs. Furthermore, a Chinese mining company was in the process of negotiating the continuation of operations at a copper mine in Logar province. A significant diplomatic move was made by China in September 2023 when it appointed Zhao Xing as its first ambassador to Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. By December 2023, Bilal Karimi, Afghanistan's Ambassador to China, presented his credentials to President Xi Jinping, thereby fortifying diplomatic relations. China maintains trade, investment, and aid discussions with the Taliban government, despite the fact that it has not formally recognized it. This policy is driven by the desire to prevent Uyghur separatists from utilizing Afghanistan as a base for activities against the Chinese state. China's diplomatic and economic interactions suggest a strategic interest in maintaining influence in Afghanistan, despite the country's ambiguous stance on recognizing the Taliban as of January 2024. Conclusion The international community has yet to recognize the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal due to its human rights violations and affiliation with terrorism. But India, Russia, and China have engaged with the Taliban in a practical manner due to their concerns for regional stability, economic gain, and security. While Western countries remain isolated and subject to sanctions, regional powers leverage trade, economic agreements, and diplomatic relations to exert influence, despite their lack of official recognition. Afghanistan's future international legitimacy will be contingent upon the Taliban's capacity to address critical issues such as human rights and women's rights, as well as the evolving geopolitical dynamics of the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSDxQzcghq1AP	2024-11-15T17:32:37-08:00	
Earlier Activities Of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board: Looking Bac...	The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, India’s nuclear regulator is completing 41 years of age. It is the time for calm contemplation and accounting of what AERB has done thus far. If any reader delves deeper, he may legitimately feel that my views are most likely to be biased. Let me declare my conflict of interest. I was one among the first handful of officers who joined the Board from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). I was the Secretary of the Board from August 1987 to January 2004. I strongly defend my turf. However, I also make every effort to give references to authentic documents to buttress my views. One can get a bird’s eye view of the regulatory activities of AERB during its formative years here. Pioneers recall that when India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) started the design and construction of its first research reactor Apsara in 1955, there was no formal safety analysis report. Designers of various systems of the reactor on their own ensured the safety of the design. I hasten to add that it was the case all over the world. A robust regulatory system in which many specialists from different disciplines participated evolved soon. (One can read the history of the regulatory activities in the field of nuclear energy and its applications from here, here, here and here) . Safety Reviews The Board’s safety review covered unusual incidents at Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (1980-84), Quality Control and Quality Assurance at NPPs 1985, Radiation exposures in power plants 1988, Operational safety at Taraput Atomic Power Station (TAPS) 1985 and Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) and Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) 1989, the Narora Fire Incident 1993 and the Failure of containment dome in Kaiga 1994,. This reference contains details of various reviews. AERB appointed special committees to review safety features of Indian nuclear power plants considering accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima. The AERB secretariat diligently followed up the recommendations of these committees. Early reviews AERB started safety review and licensing of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) from Narora 1 onwards. Over the years, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) introduced newer projects, such as PHWRs of 540 MWe at Tarapur and 700 MWe at several sites, Kudankulam plant (VVER type Russian nuclear power reactors of 1000 MWe), Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor of 500 MWe etc. Safety reviews of foreign nuclear power reactors of higher capacity also started. Newer developments include SMR. These offer future challenges. Regulatory control of medical x rays a daunting task. A review of what AERB has done, particularly to enforce regulatory control on medical x-ray equipment and installations can be seen here . Effective regulatory control of medical x-ray units in India is a daunting task, as medical x-ray use grew in an unbridled way nationwide for many decades. In 1986, AERB held a National Seminar on 'Radiation exposures in Medical X-ray Practices: Consequences and Control'. Many senior officials (Directors of Health Services, Directors of Medical Education) from State Governments, radiologists, representatives of allied professional associations, radiographers, x-ray unit manufacturers, x-ray tube makers, officers from Medical Council of India and Director General of Health Services and others participated. Simultaneously AERB set up a specialist committee with Dr Arcot Gajraj as Chairman. The committee had representation from Directorate General of Health Services, DRP/BARC and AERB. Its recommendations included type approval of equipment, organization of training courses with emphasis on safety, preparation of safety codes and guides, registration of x-ray equipment and installations among others. AERB enhanced the type approvals for x-ray equipment with the assistance from Radiological Protection and Advisory Division (RP&AD) of BARC. AERB implemented most of the recommendations. AERB entered an MOU with CSIR and DRDO to organize a nation-wide x-ray registration program. AERB coordinated with Radiological Physics Division of BARC and trained 125 inspectors for the program. They were middle level officers from the respective regional laboratories of DRDO and CSIR. The program covered all 500 districts in the country. AERB collected invaluable information on the status of medical x-ray safety. AERB conveyed remedial measures on obvious safety deficiencies to these institutions. To our knowledge, no country has attempted such a massive program anywhere else in the world. The program covered over 30,300 x-ray units. In a mid-way analysis, AERB found that the age of nearly 9% of the 15528 units registered was unknown. One out of five units was over 15 years old. The AERB found several obvious deficiencies and recommended remedial actions. AERB’s efforts to decentralize regulatory control on medical x rays by authorizing State Governments were not successful. However, now there is some light at the end of the tunnel, as AERB developed and deployed its e-governance initiative for e- Licensing of Radiation Applications ‘e-LORA’. AERB extended e-LORA successfully to other areas as well. AERB received the 'SKOCH Smart Governance Award -2015' for e-LORA. AERB helps DAE in drafting new rules The promulgation of Atomic Energy Act 1962 and the Radiation Protection Rules, 1971 gave the initial legal framework to safety. AERB issued surveillance procedures for medical applications of radiation under Rule 15 of the RPR 1971. AERB also published a safety code on medical x-ray equipment and installations. These documents provided a firmer legal basis for enforcing safety provisions. Promulgation of Atomic Energy (radiation Protection) Rules 2004 helped to remove virtually all the legal infirmities. However, AERB’s constitution order needs revision Some Past Regulatory Actions Has AERB exercised its powers? AERB’s Annual report contains the regulatory actions taken by the Board. I recall that the first question a journalist asked me was whether AERB has any teeth! AERB was just born then. If an infant has teeth when born, it will be a freak I joked. The question inspired us to review the Atomic Energy Act 1962. When the Controller and Auditor General of India made an incorrect interpretation of certain provisions in the Atomic Energy Act we could easily identify it. (Please see here) Recovery of highly active sources from Coovum River !n 1993, someone stole three radioactive sources from the premises of a foreign company based in India, and engaged by Oil & Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) for oil well-logging operations. AERB ordered suspension of all its well logging operations using radioactive sources in India. Eventually based on the inputs from police, AERB’s team recovered the sources from Coovum River within the Chennai city limits. AERB permitted the use of sources after ONGC reinforced more measures to ensure security of the sources. The disgruntled workers involved got jail terms Regulatory actions against hospitals AERB endorsed the Division of Radiological Protection (DRP)’s decision on withdrawal of radium sources from hospitals as many of them were leaky or prone to develop leakage and were hazardous. Removal of radium led to the introduction of safer substitutes in cancer treatment, improved dosimetry, and better radiation protection. On April 6, 1995, AERB barred a cancer hospital in Delhi from treating new patients because of safety violations. The Board lifted the ban when the hospital fulfilled the safety requirements. Other developments In 1987, AERB prescribed permissible limits for radionuclides in foodstuffs when there was a possibility of the import of contaminated foodstuffs after the Chernobyl accident. One can get related details here. The Mayapuri radiation accident, which led to the death of one person and radiation injury to many, offered a wakeup call. AERB implemented stricter measures on keeping track of sources immediately. AERB issued an advisory to medical/dental x-ray owners and the general public against indiscriminate use of dental x-ray examinations solely for the purpose of non-diagnostic applications such as age determination or birth registration. In 2012, the Controller and Auditor General of India (CAG) gave a critical report on AERB. AERB staff noted that some reports criticized the CAG report (please see here, here and here). While noting in a lighter mood, that Accountants are seldom pleasant, we must admit that the appraisal of CAG offered an invaluable wake up call to AERB. The Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee endorsed CAG recommendations . As directed by CAG, AERB prepared a policy document. Through e-LORA, it implemented an online program for all its licensing activities. It issued a large number of safety documents. Anyone can download them freely from AERB web site. CAG’s proposal to make AERB’ legal framework stronger is pending with the Ministry which hopefully may accord priority to it. Closer perusal of AERB’s Annual report shows that AERB strengthened all regulatory activities as directed by CAG. The International Atomic Energy Agency carried out Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission during March 16-27, 2015. India is among the few countries, which published the report. AERB’s Annual report, which summarizes AERB activities are available at www.aerb.gov.in Safety Research Institute The objective of Safety Research Institute(SRI) is to build a unique research and knowledge base with a strong research capability in important safety related areas to support regulatory functions of AERB. Under the initiative of Prof. P. Rama Rao, the then Chairman, AERB, Safety Research Institute was setup at Kalpakkam. The foundation stone for the institute was laid on February 20, 1999 by Dr. R. Chidambaram, the then Chairman, AEC during the IX Five Year Plan period with P. Rodriguez as first Director of the Institute. SRI conducts independent safety research to supplement the Boards’ regulatory review and assessment activities. Looking forward AERB must be circumspect in enforcing changes in universally accepted radiation protection philosophy which has robustly and soundly stood the test of time. 'Radiation hormesis' for instance is a very popularly discussed phenomena. A major problem is that it is not possible to arrive at a scientifically defendable threshold dose. In order to appreciate the associated concepts such as Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model and ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) etc. the regulators must read the following references. Federal Register :: Linear No-Threshold Model and Standards for Protection Against Radiation )ALARA: The History and Science of Radiation Safety I strongly endorse the following conclusion from Ref 2 'Despite its genesis in public opinion rather than scientific investigation, the ALARA protocol has successfully limited the exposure of radiation workers to impressively low levels of around 1 mSv. The grounding of ALARA is in the linear-no-threshold hypothesis, which states that risk is directly proportional to dose, even for the smallest exposures. Although significant costs are incurred to conform to ALARA and the validity of the LNT model is unclear below doses of 100 mSv, more research on the health effects of low radiation doses is necessary before alternatives to ALARA can become viable.' I hope that AERB will stick to that view. Further reading (Key Note Address by the writer at the IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS-2022)on 11 November 2022) BEST WISHES TO ALL ON THE FOUNDATION DAY OF AERB Please see this you tube documentary on one of the most important policy decisions by AERB- prescribing the permissible limits radionuclides in foodstuffs,- It is by Shri Ajitesh Sharma. He got many awards (a few international). Towards the end, I explain how AERB took the decision. This was shown in some OTT platforms in India Here is the link: From a fledgling organization with a handful of members occupying two rooms at the Old Yacht Club, opposite Gate way India, Mumbai, AERB grew into a strong regulatory agency. AERB now occupies three buildings. When I reviewed AERB staff strength and their qualifications on November 15, 2017, exactly seven years ago it had a total staff strength of 346, over 250 of them Group A officers. Of them, 21 have Ph.D. degrees. All of them had special training in one or more of the subjects such as nuclear engineering, radiation safety, medical physics etc. All of them are graduates or postgraduates; many of them have M. Tech degrees from IITs. Uniquely for a regulatory agency, five or six of them secured law degrees and they reinforce the legal cell of AERB. I look forward to the legal cell to defend their turf against any attempt unintended or deliberate to dilute the existing legal powers of the Board. AERB looks forward to future challenges with renewed zeal, commitment and enthusiasm. The mood is upbeat in the AERB.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSOFb4avN7oh8	2024-11-15T17:28:30-08:00	
Rubio As US Top Diplomat Could Be A Win For Southeast Asian Human...	By David Hutt U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of state is likely to send a jolt of excitement to beleaguered democrats and opposition forces in Southeast Asia’s authoritarian states. Over the past five or so years, Rubio has co-authored almost every congressional bill on human rights in Southeast Asia. He co-introduced the Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act in 2022, stating at the time that 'the Hun Sen dictatorship destroyed democracy in Cambodia and allowed the nation to be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.' He reintroduced the bill in 2023. In 2020, Rubio appealed to the State Department to designate Vietnam a 'country of particular concern' for abuse of religious freedom, noting that 'the only way to realize the full potential of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship is to press them to take serious steps to improve the human rights situation in Vietnam.' A year earlier, he co-introduced the Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act to the Senate, which, had it passed, would have pressured the White House to impose 'sanctions and travel restrictions on Vietnamese nationals complicit in human rights abuses.' He was critical of the Obama administration’s rush to renormalize ties with Myanmar’s semi-military government in the early 2010s, and unabashed in saying the Burmese military orchestrated a 'genocide' against the Rohingya. In 2021, he was one of six senators to call on the Biden administration to impose much tougher sanctions on the military junta that took power in Myanmar through a coup in February that year. In 2017, he tried to introduce legislation to restrict the export of defense articles to the Philippines in response to then-President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal and illegal war on drugs. The same year, he challenged U.S. Secretary of State Nominee Rex Tillerson to pressure Duterte about his 'human rights violations.' China-hawk Rubio is principally known as a China-hawk, and he has been blacklisted by Beijing in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials for the genocide against the Uyghur ethnic minority and for the crackdown in Hong Kong. He has co-sponsored numerous bills against the Chinese Communist Party’s human rights violations, including the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Reauthorization Act and numerous Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Reauthorization Acts. Last year, he introduced the Deterring Chinese Preemptive Strikes Act to strengthen American air bases in the Indo-Pacific region. He was the arch-campaigner against TikTok and Huawei, and for the past decade has fought resolutely to bring attention against Beijing’s genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang region. However, a blinkered China-hawk who perceives all foreign relations through the Beijing prism would not have sponsored resolutions condemning the Communist Party of Vietnam, which the 'realists' in the Biden administration courting Hanoi treated as an ally beyond reproach. Rubio’s actions indicate he knows that America cannot be indolent about the sins of its friends. Perhaps he has tempered some of his views, but Rubio would appear to be instinctively interventionist and instinctively knows that America has a duty to not only promote global prosperity but also global liberty. During Trump’s first term, Rubio co-sponsored legislation to make it harder for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO. His more controversial comments about the Ukraine war – 'I’m not on Russia’s side, but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement’ – can be read in multiple, not all isolationist, ways. Promoting values Even if the senator who has been outspoken on human rights has to temper his views while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, it will still be heartening to have a U.S. secretary of state who has spent as much time with Southeast Asian dissidents, exiles and opposition politicians as with government officials and chambers of commerce. It will be positive to have an American foreign affairs chief who knows Cambodia is a 'dictatorship,' who says Myanmar’s generals committed 'genocide,' and who called out Duterte’s drug war for human rights violations. At least since the Obama administration, there’s been a tendency to appoint senior Asia officials who spent considerable time in the region. This brought expertise, but it also brought a certain mindset from those who previously 'had to get along with' the region’s tyrannical regimes. If Trump was isolationist and transactional in his first term, there’s been a temptation by the Biden administration to single-mindedly focus on alliance building against China, without sufficient thought for the local inhabitants of those allies. Indeed, it’s difficult to exaggerate not just how little the Biden administration did for human rights in Southeast Asia as his foreign policy pursued realpolitik goals. Rubio’s record suggests he will remind U.S. leaders and diplomats why they are effectively fighting a new Cold War against China – it isn’t only about trade margins and tariffs and spheres of influence. If he is able to temper Trump’s transactional instincts toward foreign leaders no matter how unsavory, Rubio is someone who could pursue a more muscular foreign policy against China without forgetting that key values are a factor in the rivalry.

Trump’s Chance To Atone For America’s Afghan Shame – Analysis	By Luke Coffey It is rare for anyone to be given a second chance in politics: for American presidents, it has happened only once before Donald Trump’s re-election. The only other US president to serve two non-consecutive terms was Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. This gives Trump a rare opportunity to reflect on past mistakes and learn from them to make better decisions in the future. Such an opportunity is with Afghanistan. The chaotic and disorganized departure from Afghanistan in August 2021 remains a stain on US honor and prestige. It did not have to end that way. While President Joe Biden bears most of the responsibility, the story is incomplete without considering the role of the first Trump administration. In February 2020, Trump agreed on a deal with the Taliban that set a date for the phased withdrawal of US forces by May 2021. This was the foundation for the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban’s return to power. Trump even went so far as to entertain the idea of inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David, though his advisers wisely convinced him to abandon it. Despite these missteps, one thing united Trump and Biden: their desire to exit Afghanistan, no matter the consequences. The Trump administration, with its deal, laid the groundwork for the disaster that followed under Biden. Now, after securing a second term, Trump has the opportunity to correct course, learn from the past, and implement a more thoughtful and effective Afghanistan policy. Since the Taliban took over in 2021, Afghanistan has plunged into a severe economic and humanitarian crisis. Young girls are still banned from school, women have been pushed out of most workplaces, and the country has become a hotbed for transnational terrorist groups. Al-Qaeda has reestablished its presence and Daesh has gained strength, exploiting the security vacuum left by the Taliban. With a new team in place, there is potential for the Trump administration to reevaluate and recalibrate. The nomination of Florida Congressman Mike Waltz as national security adviser signals a possible shift. Waltz, a former US special forces officer who served several tours in Afghanistan, has been one of the most vocal critics of Biden’s withdrawal. He has cultivated relationships with the National Resistance Front, a prominent Afghan opposition group led by Ahmad Massoud, and is keenly aware of the counterterrorism challenges posed by a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Trump administration has the opportunity to reengage with anti-Taliban forces and place greater emphasis on US national security interests. The first step should be formalizing communications with Massoud and his group, which is the most credible armed resistance to the Taliban but which the Biden administration has ignored. At the very least, the US should consider establishing a liaison office for the group in Tajikistan. The US should also consider moving its diplomatic mission to Tajikistan from Qatar, where it decamped from Kabul after the Taliban takeover. While Qatar has been a key player in Taliban talks, a move to Tajikistan would bring American diplomats closer to both Afghanistan and the National Resistance Front. It would also reflect a broader strategy in Central Asia, prioritizing long-term stability and counterterrorism cooperation. At a minimum, the US should open a second diplomatic mission in Tajikistan while maintaining the one in Doha. Another key area is the Vienna Process, a series of regular meetings of anti-Taliban groups led by the National Resistance Front with which the US has so far failed to engage. Trump’s administration should change that by sending a high-level representative to the next meeting. If it is willing to engage with Taliban representatives in Doha, it only makes sense to do so with the opposition groups too. The US should also explore ways in which the National Resistance Front could advance counterterrorism objectives in Afghanistan. Neither the US nor its allies have invested in developing a relationship with the group. While the US has limited over-the-horizon strike capabilities in Afghanistan, the Front could be a valuable partner. Strengthening ties could offer operational advantages, particularly in the fight against Al-Qaeda and Daesh. One area where the Biden administration has been correct is in its non-recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government. They desperately seek international legitimacy, which the US has rightly prevented. Trump should continue this policy, but more aggressively — freezing any potential funding from US sources that might benefit the Taliban, and ramping up sanctions against them. These steps would mark a crucial shift in policy. They would improve counterterrorism efforts, safeguard geopolitical interests in South and Central Asia, and demonstrate a commitment to a moral and strategic alignment with credible Afghan partners. History shows that Afghanistan is too important to ignore. While it is unlikely that American troops will return in the immediate future, before 9/11 nobody predicted a US intervention. In such a scenario, a relationship with the Front would give the US a trusted local ally and a valuable insurance policy for the future. Trump’s second term is a unique opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past and pursue a more coherent and effective Afghanistan strategy. It is time to move on from the chaotic withdrawal of 2021 and lay the groundwork for a more stable and secure Afghanistan in the future. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Gazprom Stops Supplying Gas To Austria	By Nikolaus J. Kurmayer (EurActiv) -- The Russian energy company Gazprom will stop sending gas to Austria effectively this weekend, said the country's energy major supplier, OMV. After OMV was awarded €230 million in damages in an arbitration against Gazprom, it announced its intention to stop paying bills to recoup the money. In response, the state-owned Russian company is turning off the tap, the company said on Friday. From 6am on Saturday (16 November), Gazprom will no longer send gas to Austria despite its contract with OMV until 2040 – the energy major is the only direct buyer of Russian gas, which makes up more than 90% of the supply. 'OMV ... has just been informed by Gazprom Export that Gazprom Export will suspend - and thus reduce to 0% - its deliveries of natural gas,' the company said in a statement. Despite that, Austria is not expecting an immediate gas shortage in the coming winter – the country’s storage facilities hold a whole year’s supply and are 90% full. The move potentially ends a six-decade history of Austria receiving gas from Russia, first offered after Moscow blocked the alpine country from joining the EU, forcing it to remain a neutral country in the Cold War. 'The actions of Russia’s Gazprom today prove once again that Russia is not a partner,’ said Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Greens) in a statement. 'But tomorrow also marks the end of a risk. If we no longer receive supplies from Russia, we can no longer be blackmailed,' she added. Austria is locked into a long-term contract until 2040 and may now finally be able to break it in a way unlikely to see the company lose any arbitration case. Previously, OMV’s arbitration win against Gazprom has already pushed Europe’s nervous gas markets to a three-month high, with a 10% price increase since the company announced its award on 13 November. The energy major is already betting on contracted gas from Norway and global LNG markets to replace Gazprom supplies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSNRB809r9qnu	2024-11-15T17:16:14-08:00	
Scholz Speaks To Putin About Ukraine War, Drawing Concern From Ky...	(RFE/RL) -- Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by telephone on November 15, urging the Kremlin leader to end the war against Ukraine and negotiate with Kyiv for a 'just and lasting peace,' the chancellor's office said. But the first direct conversation in nearly two years between the German and Russian leaders elicited a warning from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said Scholz's call was a 'Pandora's box' that could help Putin 'ease his isolation, Russia's isolation, and engage in conventional negotiations that won't end in anything.' Zelenskiy said such empty exchanges are 'exactly what Putin has been wanting for a long time' as the 2 1/2-year-old full-scale invasion grinds on. Scholz expressed 'unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,' Berlin said. 'The chancellor condemned Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and called on President Putin to end it and withdraw troops,' Scholz's office said. It also said Scholz spoke with Zelenskiy before the Putin call and would speak again afterward. The Kremlin said the conversation came at Germany's request and was 'a detailed and frank exchange of views on the situation in Ukraine.'It repeated Moscow talking points on the origins of the conflict in 'NATO's long-term aggressive policy' and said Russia had 'never refused and remains open to resuming negotiations.' It cited a speech by Putin in June and said any possible deal should take Russian security interests into account along with 'new territorial realities and, most importantly, eliminate the root causes of the conflict.'Putin, the Kremlin said, described Russian-German relations as having suffered 'unprecedented degradation in all areas' and said Russia was prepared for 'mutually beneficial cooperation' in the energy sector. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Scholz talked to him afterward and that Warsaw was satisfied he 'reiterated the Polish position: 'Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.'' Reuters quoted a source as saying Scholz told Putin that the deployment of North Korean troops for combat missions is a significant escalation and expansion of the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSJudE0KpbDHJ	2024-11-15T17:12:43-08:00	
Kim Jong Un Wants North Korea To Mass Produce Suicide Drones	By Soyoung Kim North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants the country to begin mass production of suicide drones, raising concerns that Pyongyang could potentially send these to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine. State media reported that the country’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un visited a test site for the unmanned attack aircraft. 'The suicide attack drones, designed to be used within different striking ranges on the ground and the sea, are to perform a precision attack mission against any enemy targets,' the Korea Central News Agency report said. In tests, the drones 'precisely hit' targets, it said. Kim 'underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,' the report said. Though the report made no mention of the possibility of North Korea manufacturing drones to be sold to Russia, several analysts said that North Korea might look to do just that. The war is the motivation behind North Korean drone development, Bruce Bennett, a researcher at the U.S.-based RAND Corporation told RFA Korean. 'Putin wants cheap weapons, and Kim Jong Un can produce them,' said Bennett. 'I suspect that Russia transferred drone technology to support North Korea’s production.' He also noted that any North Korean ability to mass-produce drones could be a potential threat to South Korea. The successful test of suicide drones as reported by North Korean state media is a concern in light of the deepening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, Bruce Klingner of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation said. Klingner said that North Korea has already provided Russia with artillery shells, ballistic missiles, and over 10,000 troops. He also said that the recent ratification of a comprehensive bilateral security treaty between Russia and North Korea suggests that Moscow might soon increase transfer of military technology to Pyongyang. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department expressed concern over the deepening relationship, calling it and its associated weapons transfers 'a trend that should be of great concern to anyone who is interested in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, preserving the global nonproliferation regime, and supporting the Ukrainian people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSHx9MCMotad2	2024-11-15T17:06:42-08:00	
‘Anarchy If Interim Govt Fails,’ Says Official From Bangladesh’s ...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury After being in the political wilderness for 15 years, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir is a man in a hurry to see his political party, the largest one in Bangladesh, potentially return to power. Fakhrul, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary-general, wants the interim government that was installed after then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country to speed up the reforms required to hold free and fair elections. Many political analysts say the BNP very likely will be elected. Before Hasina’s decade-and-a-half at the helm, Bangladesh twice alternated between voting for her Awami League and the BNP. Hasina left for India after a student protest against job quotas became a mass movement demanding she resign because security forces fired on protesters. More than 800 people died during these movements. After she ran away, an interim administration backed by university students who led the mass movement, civil society members and parties except the Awami League, has been at the helm of affairs in the South Asian nation for a little over 100 days. The mandate of this administration led by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus is to make the country and the state apparatus ready to hold an impartial and democratic general election. Hasina and her Awami League had governed Bangladesh since 2009, winning four consecutive elections, including two boycotted by the BNP and its allies in 2014 and January 2024, and one widely criticized as rigged in 2018. Many of Fakhrul’s BNP colleagues are impatient and clamoring for swift elections, but he said three months is nearly not enough time to repair the damage done to state institutions during 15 years of Hasina’s rule. And repairing many of those institutions is an essential prerequisite for a truly democratic national election. Fakhrul recently sat down with BenarNews for 30 minutes to discuss the future election and reasons for the continued lawlessness in Bangladesh, among other issues. Excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity: BenarNews: What do you expect most from the interim government and has it performed to your satisfaction? Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir: The biggest expectation is that it will complete the [necessary] reforms expeditiously and hold an impartial, free election acceptable to all. During the last 15 years, Hasina and her party destroyed Bangladesh politically, economically and socially. Considering all this, the interim government has moved to constitute an Election Commission, formed a search committee and sought names. They have started the work. That work will be complete soon. BN: You have said many times that the BNP wants to give the interim government 'logical time.' How do you define this? MFIA: By 'logical time,' I mean the time by when the election commission can become a completely impartial body so that an unhindered, fair and impartial election can be held. BN: You say the constitution needs amending. Why? MFIA: The Awami League government destroyed the [original] 1972 constitution and made it a charter of fascism. So its reform is a crying need. Otherwise, nothing can be fixed. BN: The BNP has been repeating that this interim government should not fail. Why? MFIA: The consequences [of it failing] may be dangerous. The [Awami League] fascists may come back. Anarchy may follow … which is not desirable for anyone. BN: After Hasina fled, street protests have been held over trifling issues, officials were forced to resign and some beaten up. Why is there still so much lawlessness? MFIA: That is because Bangladesh has not experienced true democratic practices. They did not dare to speak out. Now they can, and are doing so freely. Additionally, Awami League supporters are causing mischief on the online instructions from India by Hasina. BN: There is uproar in the international media that minority communities such as Hindus were attacked after Hasina fell and continue to be under threat in this Muslim-majority country. Is this happening, and if so, why? MFIA: Let me make this clear: In three districts in southeastern Bangladesh, Hindu idols were vandalized. It was proven that the Awami League’s student wing was behind the attacks, but the government took no action. And there was no uproar in the international media. There were some problems immediately after the political change. But they were not communal. They were political. Take the case of Hasina. She is a Muslim and she fled. The house of Hasina’s Muslim adviser was looted. Why? They were Awami Leaguers. People have massive hate for the Awami League. The Awami League wants to make it an issue that the BNP or Bangladesh is persecuting minorities. BN: Similarly, the Awami League and others allege that militancy will return if the BNP comes to power. What’s your response? MFIA: We have not supported militancy. We will not support militancy – zero tolerance. The Awami League manufactures these stories. Yes, you can say that there is a move toward fundamentalism. And the Awami League is responsible for that. They blocked the path of democracy, and when you do that, fundamentalism is sure to flourish. We were the first government to arrest all militants. BN: As you wait for the election to be announced, what advice do you have for political parties including BNP? MFIA: I have only one. All of us must be patriots, must work for the people’s welfare and not abuse power if in government. We believe the BNP will in no way repeat the Awami League’s mistakes. If we do, we will have to face the same consequences it did.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSF8i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-15T17:04:28-08:00	
Republican Lawmakers Optimistic Trump Can End Russia-Ukraine War	Top Republican members of the House of Representatives say lawmakers have begun discussions about Russia’s war in Ukraine in an effort to carry out President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to quickly end the conflict there. Lawmakers told VOA’s Ukrainian Service that they are optimistic that Trump can achieve his goal. Republican Representative Mike Waltz, who was nominated by Trump this week to be his national security adviser, told VOA that 'the president has been clear in terms of getting both sides to the table and is focused on ending the war and not perpetuating it.' Waltz said that while Trump did not address Russia’s war in Ukraine when he gave a speech to lawmakers at their leadership meeting Wednesday, he said discussions about the war were happening 'off to the side.' He did not give further details. Republican Representative Mike Rogers, who serves as the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, was bullish about Trump’s ability to negotiate a cease-fire. 'I expect the president to negotiate an armistice before the end of the year,' he told VOA. When asked how the United States would pressure Russia to lay down its weapons, he said, 'I have an idea what it is but I’m not going to talk about it.' Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and urged him not to escalate the war, according to U.S. media outlets, first reported in The Washington Post. The Kremlin denies the call took place. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who has been a strong supporter of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, told VOA that Trump wants to have a 'very strong military presence in Europe,' part of a 'path of deterrence that eventually will get us to a period of negotiation.' However, he cautioned that he does not believe that Ukraine has enough leverage right now for successful negotiations with Russia. Russia and Ukraine are engaged in fierce battles in eastern Ukraine, as uncertainty mounts over how a Trump presidency will affect the war and whether the two sides will be pushed into negotiations. Analysts say that both sides are looking to increase their territory before any negotiations take place. When asked about how the U.S. could pressure Russia to the negotiating table, Republican Representative Tom Cole, who serves as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told VOA, 'I think you have to persuade them what is in their best interest.' Cole said he thinks the war has been a disaster for Russia, noting that the conflict pushed Sweden and Finland to join NATO, the Western military alliance formed in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. He said talks in the House have not yet led to any definitive plan on the Russia-Ukraine war, but said, 'I think there is just hope that President Trump can bring this conflict in Europe — the worst conflict since 1945 — to a speedy end.' Trump has yet to detail how he will fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war quickly. During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September, Trump said he 'can work out something that's good for both sides.' When asked at that time whether Ukraine should turn over some of its own land to Russia to end the war, Trump said, 'We'll see what happens.' Vice President Kamala Harris said on the campaign trail that suggestions by the Trump camp to create a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine at the current battle lines 'are not proposals for peace.' 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,' she said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Ukraine and its NATO allies Wednesday that Washington remains committed to putting Ukraine 'in the strongest possible position' in the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Trump told reporters in September that his plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is 'not a surrender.' 'What my strategy is, is to save lives,' he said.

Behind The Iran-Israel Conflict – OpEd	However many charges of aggression, mass murder and worse the Iranian regime chooses to level against Israel, there is no disguising the fact that it is Iran that seeks to destroy Israel, not the other way around. On April 13, 2024 Iran – which essentially means the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – committed a major strategic blunder. Israel’s audacious attack on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus on April 1, 2024 had taken out seven Iranian military advisers, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the élite Quds Force of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Such an operation would normally have provoked Iranian ire and an armed response on northern Israel from Hezbollah. Not on this occasion. Instead the incident was used as the trigger for a fundamental shift in Iranian policy which has led to negative consequences for Iran. They are still to be fully worked through and may, in the final analysis, prove existential. For 45 years – namely, since its foundation in 1979 – the Iranian regime had pursued its self-imposed mission of encompassing the destruction of Israel and its people through funding, arming and supporting organizations, groups and militias prepared to attack the Jewish state. At some point in the period leading up to April 13 Khamenei decided that the time had arrived to change tack. It must have been intense analysis and calculation by his advisers that led him to break the principle that had guided Iran’s foreign strategy for so long, and finally launch Iran’s very first direct onslaught on Israel. How must the figuring have gone? 'Israel has never been weaker. It is bogged down in its war in Gaza. It hasn’t succeeded in eliminating Hamas or recovering its remaining hostages. It is being condemned on all sides for vast numbers of civilian deaths. Hezbollah is attacking it daily on its northern border. Houthi missiles are getting through its defenses. It is the subject of an investigation by the International Court of Justice on a charge of genocide. Imagine the effect of a direct Iranian attack. Think of bombs falling on Israeli cities. Think of Israelis in their hundreds slaughtered and injured. Israel will be humbled. The Abraham Accords will disintegrate, and any hope of their extension will be snuffed out.' Khamenei’s military advisers must have convinced him that a massive fleet of kamikaze UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) would overwhelm Israel’s defenses, and at least some 50% of the missiles would get through. The aerial assault involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. In the event Khamenei’s anticipated military and propaganda triumph turned into a humiliation. What Iran’s military strategists perhaps failed to take into account was the united support of Israel’s allies, and Iran's own unpopularity in the Arab world (Iranians may be Muslim, but they are not Arabs). They surely did not count on Jordan and Saudi Arabia helping to block Iran's UAVs from reaching Israel, nor that the UK and France would join the US in backing Israel's Iron Dome in shooting down the Iranian missiles. Their subsequent failure was to underestimate both the chutzpah and effectiveness of Israel’s security and armed forces. Following the aerial assault of April 13, the Iranians were taken by surprise time and again. Within a week Israel had responded with airstrikes on Iranian military sites in Syria and Iran itself, while against a background of continuing tit-for-tat skirmishes, Israel pursued its hunt for the Hamas leaders responsible for the barbaric attack of October 7, and the Hezbollah leaders who supported them. The targeted elimination of Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’s military wing, on July 13 was followed by the even more telling retribution visited on Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’s political wing. In an especial humiliation for the regime, he was killed in the heart Iran’s capital, Tehran, by an explosion in his guesthouse, on July 31. Then came September 17-18, when hand-held communication devices, such as pagers and walkie-talkies, manufactured specifically for Hezbollah and distributed widely to its operatives, were detonated remotely. At least 42 fatalities and over 3,000 injuries, the vast majority of them Hezbollah operatives, was the result. Though Israel made no claim, the world assumed it was responsible. Albert Einstein is reputed to have said: 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.' Whatever Khamenei's thinking – perhaps he believed his first aerial assault on Israel had been under-powered – he opted for a second, bigger and more focused attempt. He decided to use some 200 advanced Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan missiles, and to target military and intelligence locations. In the event this second Iranian attack, launched on October 1, was only marginally more damaging than the first. Once again most missiles were intercepted by Israeli and US defense systems, including support from US naval vessels stationed nearby. How and when Israel would retaliate became the subject of intense media speculation. The theorizing was temporarily suspended when Iran’s prize collaborator, the head of Hamas, Yahyah Sinwar, was shot dead by the IDF on October 16. While welcoming the news as 'a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world,' US President Joe Biden made it clear that he did not want Israel to target Iran’s nuclear and oil installations for fear of triggering all-out war. When it came, Israel’s response, delivered on October 25, respected his wish and consisted of heavy air strikes on Iranian military targets in Syria and on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure. So Israel and Iran are undoubtedly in conflict, if not formally at war. Anyone who cares to look into the matter can see why no truce can be meaningful. The objective of the Iranian regime, from its foundation in 1979, has been to acquire as much power and influence as possible in order to achieve the key objectives laid down by the regime’s original Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He affirmed repeatedly that the very purpose of his revolution was to destroy Western-style democracy and its way of life, and to impose Shia Islam on the whole world. He identified the United States and Israel as his prime targets, but included what was then the USSR. 'We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, Capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world,' said Khomeini. 'We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet.' By this he meant his strict Shia interpretation of Islam, for elsewhere he had declared that the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, situated in the heart of Sunni Saudi Arabia, were in the hands of 'a band of heretics'. These objectives have driven the regime ever since, and continue to be its raison d’être. 'We shall export our revolution to the whole world,' declared Khomeini. 'Until the cry 'There is no god but Allah' resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.' In short, Iran’s leaders want to destroy the world as we know it. They want to achieve political dominance in the Middle East, overthrow Western-style democracy of which America is the prime exponent, wipe out the state of Israel, and impose Shia Islam across the globe. Whether the West wishes to acknowledge it or not, in combatting Iran, Israel is fighting for the free world as a whole.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-15T09:19:56-08:00	
Sri Lanka’s Leftist Party Exponentially Improves Its Electoral Pe...	In the Sri Lankan Presidential election held on September 21, the candidate of the leftist National Peoples Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake, just scraped through. But in the parliamentary elections held on November 14, his party, the NPP, romped home with a stunning two thirds majority. Sri Lanka's only major leftist party, the National Peoples' Power (NPP), is continuing its dream run in the island nation's electoral politics. It registered a stunning improvement in its electoral standing in the parliamentary elections held on November 14. The NPP secured 159 seats in the parliament of 224 members, which gives it a two-third majority. And it got 61.68% of the valid votes, while in the September 21 Presidential election, its successful candidate, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, got only 42.3% of the votes. An electoral pole vault was on display. After the Presidential election, it was said that if only the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa and the Independent candidate former President Ranil Wickremesinghe had patched up their differences and supported a single candidate, Dissanayake would have been defeated. Premadasa and Wickremesinghe were top leaders of the same party, the United National party (UNP) for decades before they broke up, virtually destroying the Grand Old Party. That argument may have held water in September, but not in November. The voting pattern in the November parliamentary elections showed that even a combination of Premadasa's SJB and Wickremesinghe's National Democratic Front (NDF) would have been no match to Dissanyake's NPP. NPP's Growing Appeal The NPP's appeal had grown exponentially in the past two months. It now covers disparate groups living in different parts of the island and belonging to different ethnic groups. President Dissanayake and his NPP are being seen by more and more people from diverse areas and in diverse communities as the most suitable leader to exercise power in Sri Lanka. Conventional (past) Sri Lankan Presidents and MPs had shown total unconcern for the plight of the common man, people say. They had amassed ill-gotten wealth using State power in total disregard of national economic and security interests. Previously, the NPP was thought to be a left wing representative of the majority Sinhalese, who are about 75% of the population. It seemed as if the NPP had no concern for the minority Tamils and Muslims. This was because the hard core of the NPP was the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which unabashedly and uncompromisingly stood for the Sinhalese' rights viv-a-vis the minorities. But after Anura Kumara Dissanayake became JVP's leader, the party came out of its ideological and communal confines and began to broaden its appeal from the Sinhalese urban working class to the middle and upper classes in all communities and both in the rural and urban areas. Dissanayake reached out to the Corporate sector and assured the entrepreneurs and managers that the NPP will not hinder their growth. This change of image enabled the NPP to make a quantum jump from three seats in the dissolved parliament to 159 seats in the new parliament. Catching up with Minorities A noteworthy aspect of the NPP this time round is that it had put up Tamil and Muslim candidates in the North and East of the island where these minority communities predominate. The NPP candidates here had beaten local Tamil and Muslim bigwigs, like M.A.Sumanthiran in Jaffna. The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the oldest and the largest Tamil party since 1949, got only one seat in Jaffna, the Tamil heartland. But the NPP bagged three there. In Trincomalee, the NPP got 2 seats, while the ITAK got only one. In Batticaloa, another Tamil bastion, the NPP got one seat while the ITAK got three. Party Composition in Parliament In the new parliament of 224 seats, the NPP will have 141 elected members and 18 nominated members (also called National List members). The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), will be second with 40 seats, out of which 35 will be elected members and five to be appointed via the National List. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) comes third after securing eight seats, from which seven are elected and one is a National List seat. The New Democratic Front (NDF) led by former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, will have five seats, out of which three are elected members and two are National List appointments. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by the Rajapaksa family received only 350,429 votes but has managed to secure three seats out of which two (02) are elected. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Sarvajana Balaya, and United National Party (UNP) have secured a few seats. Pros and Cons of Massive Mandate Sri Lankan voters are now discussing the pros and cons of giving the NPP a two thirds majority. Would it make parliament irrelevant, they ask. Parliamentary redundancy is a real possibility because in other countries, a two thirds majority had led to dictatorship. In the party system, MPs have to obey the party 'whip'. The leaders of the NPP, who are actually hard core members of the original JVP, could road roll party MPs to toe the party line which could be rigid. And under the Executive Presidential system that Sri Lanka has, the President is very powerful. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa used his Executive power fully to take unpopular decisions which ultimately led to a mass revolt (called the Aragalaya) that forced him to flee the country. President Dissanayake and the NPP had promised to do away with the Executive Presidency by enacting a totally new constitution. But there is very little chance of this happening. All past Presidents, from Chandrika Bandaranaike onwards, had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency, only to abandon the idea ultimately. Every President and ruling party had wanted to exercise the powers given to the Executive President by the constitution. Challenges Since 2019, Sri Lankans have been suffering from loss of income and jobs, and rising prices since the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis which followed. Sri Lanka had defaulted on loans running into billions of dollars. The NPP has been promising to reduce economic distress. But it is not clear as to how it proposes to remedy the situation. It needs to root out corruption and inefficiency which is endemic. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and economic decision making has distorted the economy and the functioning of the system. This has to be rooted out by the NPP regime. The other equally worrying problem is the management of foreign powers, who, while extending a helping hand with funds and projects, also extract their pound of flesh in terms of economic and political concessions in pursuit of their national, strategic and geopolitical interests. Dissanayake would need expert help to meet his domestic and foreign policy challenges. He is likely to find the task of reconciling his left wing and nationalistic foreign policy predilections with ground realities and realpolitik. This is the reason why former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been repeatedly saying that voters much choose experienced people and that the Dissanayake government must draft experienced people to guide it when it navigates through treacherous waters both at home and overseas. Wickremesinghe has offered his services, being the most experienced in governance among the present crop of politicians. He has been President once and a Prime Minister more than once. Will Power Corrupt? While the NPP is lauded for its stunning performance, the people of Sri Lanka also are worried that absolute power might go to Dissanayake's head. They quote Lord Acton who said: 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' In the past, powerful leaders, whether in Sri Lanka or elsewhere, have not always acquitted themselves well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGqHR2pT8OjE	2024-11-15T09:19:04-08:00	
Gen Z Workers: Values Matter, And So Does Financial Security	Despite appearances and tongue-wagging from older observers, it turns out that Gen Z is much more eager to work hard for both social good and long-term financial security than some might think, according to new research from the Ateneo de Manila University. Steeled by economic uncertainty leading up to—and most especially in the wake of—the COVID-19 pandemic, the youngest Filipinos now entering the workforce greatly value both a stable income and personal achievement. These idealistic yet pragmatic members of Gen Z (born between 1995 and 2012) tend to look for meaningful and fulfilling work environments but also willingly forego creature comforts in favor of long-term financial stability. In their seminal study of Filipino Gen Z employees, the Ateneo researchers uncovered clear distinctions in workplace motivation versus previous generations, particularly Millennials (or Gen Y, born between 1980 and 1994); Gen X (depending on the research agency, born in either 1961 or 1965, up to 1979); and Baby Boomers (born after World War II, in 1946 to 1960/1964). These differences reflect how the unique socioeconomic context of each generation influences their motivations and overall outlook. Family matters Filipino cultural expectations concerning familial responsibility play a unique role in Pinoy Gen Z employees' work decisions. Many in this cohort are motivated by the need to support their families financially—an intrinsic motivator in Filipino culture. For Gen Z Pinoys, contributing to family well-being is a main reason for why they seek competitive salaries and benefits that can support both themselves and their loved ones. 'Family is a significant motivator for their work, as they strive to provide a good life for their loved ones. Some participants (of the study) who are the eldest child also reported feeling a greater sense of responsibility to provide for their family,' the researchers noted. Personal achievement and career growth Moreover, Gen Z puts a premium on personal achievement in the form of career growth and skill development. This focus is reflected in their desire for rapid advancement and fulfillment in their roles. Meanwhile, Gen X, who typically value job security and stability over rapid career growth, are less likely to switch jobs for career advancement alone. Baby Boomers also have a strong sense of organizational loyalty—they often stay with one employer for extended periods—but are less driven by the desire for rapid career advancement. Also, while Gen Z and Millennials are both technologically savvy and open to flexible work arrangements, Gen Z has a preference for hybrid or flexible remote work as they value autonomy and balance. In contrast, Millennials, who largely came of age during the rapid expansion of digital workplaces, are more accustomed to structured team-based settings and in-person collaboration. 'Compared to Millennials, who put more value on interesting work and collegial work environments, Gen Zs tend to focus on securing their future through savings and investments,' the researchers said. On a personal level, Gen Z’s emphasis on meaningful work also differs from other generations. Many Gen Z employees are motivated by work that aligns with their passions and allows them to make a positive impact on others and on society at large. This is partly driven by their experience of growing up in a digitally-connected world, where social issues and values-driven missions are increasingly visible and influential. Millennials, who came of age just as the digital world was emerging, also share some of this values-driven focus and likewise seek out work environments that foster a sense of community and purpose. However, Baby Boomers and Gen X tend to prioritize job security and are generally less motivated by the need for their work to align with personal or social values. What employers should know All of these generational differences suggest that companies aiming to retain Gen Z employees should focus on fostering career growth; aligning organizational values with broader social impact; and providing robust financial benefits that cater both to immediate needs and long-term security. Otherwise, companies that rely solely on traditional job security and loyalty strategies might find themselves less effective in engaging and retaining this youngest cohort of employees. Overall, Gen Z’s workplace motivations combine financial pragmatism, personal achievement, and values-driven work in a way that distinctly sets them apart from older generations. 'Financial security is one of Gen Z’s motivating factors, as they view work as an avenue for them to earn and save money for their future. Even though Millennials put a premium on compensation, the Gen Z respondents are more specific as to how they want to use their salary,' the Ateneo researchers explained. 'They also want their work to have an impact on others and society. They want to see how their work contributes to the organization’s mission in general,' they added. Mikee C. Talamayan, Dr. Mendiola Teng-Calleja, and Dr. Jaimee Felice Caringal-Go of the Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology and the Ateneo Center for Organization Research and Development published their paper, 'Motivating Filipino Generation Z employees at work: enablers and outcomes,' in the journal Evidence-based HRM in October 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdM7LdlTCiexP	2024-11-15T09:16:37-08:00	
The Evolution Of International Political Sociology (IPS): An Expl...	International Political Sociology (IPS) stands as an interdisciplinary field at the crossroads of international relations (IR), sociology, and political theory. Rooted in the critique of traditional IR paradigms, IPS seeks to bridge gaps between domestic, transnational, and global dynamics, focusing on how social processes shape and are shaped by politics at multiple levels. This article traces the evolution of IPS through nine pivotal theories that have significantly influenced its development. 1. Realism and Its Sociological Limitations Realism, particularly dominant during the mid-20th century, is often seen as a precursor to IPS because of the challenges it inadvertently posed for sociological inquiry. Rooted in the belief that international politics operates in an anarchic system where states pursue power and security, realism largely ignored social forces and non-state actors. While classical realists such as Hans Morgenthau acknowledged human nature's role, structural realists like Kenneth Waltz focused solely on systemic constraints. The sociological critique emerged from this omission, questioning how domestic social structures, cultural contexts, and transnational relationships inform state behavior. IPS grew partly as a reaction to realism's narrow focus, seeking to incorporate broader societal forces into its analysis. 2. Liberalism and the Role of Transnational Actors Liberalism countered realism by emphasizing the role of cooperation, international institutions, and non-state actors in fostering global peace. The liberal theory introduced the concept of transnational networks, including corporations, NGOs, and epistemic communities, which influenced global governance and policy-making. IPS drew from liberalism by highlighting how social interactions among these actors create norms, identities, and practices that transcend borders. The sociological turn in liberal thought underscored the role of individuals and collective actors in shaping political outcomes, a cornerstone of IPS. 3. Constructivism: The Social Fabric of International Politics Constructivism, championed by scholars like Alexander Wendt, marked a significant shift by emphasizing the socially constructed nature of international politics. Unlike realism and liberalism, which viewed the international system as a given, constructivism argued that state interests, identities, and norms are products of social interactions. IPS expanded on constructivist insights, delving deeper into how power and discourse shape these interactions. The field investigates not only the construction of state identities but also how global hierarchies and local practices intersect, producing complex political and social outcomes. 4. Postcolonial Theory: Unearthing Power Dynamics Postcolonial theory challenges Eurocentric narratives in international relations by foregrounding the histories and experiences of colonized peoples. Thinkers like Edward Said and Gayatri Spivak revealed how colonial legacies persist in contemporary global politics through power imbalances and cultural domination. IPS integrates postcolonial insights to explore how global inequalities are reproduced and resisted. By examining issues such as migration, border politics, and racialized hierarchies, IPS emphasizes the role of marginalized voices in reshaping international politics. 5. Feminist Theory: Gendering Global Politics Feminist theory introduced a critical lens to understand how gender shapes international relations. Scholars like Cynthia Enloe highlighted the often-overlooked contributions of women in global politics, from their roles in war economies to their activism in peace movements. IPS builds on feminist critiques by analyzing how gender intersects with race, class, and nationality in global contexts. The focus on micro-level practices, such as the everyday lives of migrants or the gendered impacts of security policies, reflects the field's commitment to nuanced, intersectional analysis. 6. Foucauldian Perspectives: Power, Discourse, and Governance Michel Foucault's theories of power and discourse profoundly influenced IPS. Foucault shifted the focus from state-centric power to the diffuse, everyday practices through which power operates. His concept of 'governmentality' — the art of governing beyond the state — provided a framework for understanding global governance as a network of practices involving states, institutions, and individuals. In IPS, Foucauldian approaches examine how security, development, and migration policies are shaped by specific discourses and practices. For instance, the securitization of borders reflects not just state interests but broader societal anxieties and normative frameworks. 7. Theories of Globalization: Interconnected Realities The rise of globalization theories in the late 20th century offered new ways to conceptualize the interconnectedness of the world. Scholars like Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells examined how technological advancements, economic integration, and cultural exchanges reshape social and political life. IPS incorporates globalization theories to study how local and global processes interact. For example, it explores how global financial markets influence domestic policies or how diasporic communities maintain transnational ties while navigating local identities. 8. Critical Security Studies: Rethinking Security Critical security studies (CSS) emerged as a direct challenge to traditional security paradigms that prioritized state-centric, military-focused approaches. Drawing from constructivist and poststructuralist insights, CSS redefines security as a social construct, encompassing issues like human security, environmental threats, and cybersecurity. IPS aligns closely with CSS, emphasizing the role of societal actors in defining and contesting security policies. By examining how security discourses shape identities and practices, IPS reveals the underlying power dynamics in seemingly neutral policies. 9. The Anthropological Turn: Everyday Practices in Global Politics The anthropological turn in IPS focuses on the micro-level practices that constitute global politics. Drawing from ethnography and cultural anthropology, this approach examines how ordinary people experience and influence international phenomena, such as migration, trade, or conflict. This perspective challenges top-down analyses by highlighting the agency of marginalized groups and the significance of local knowledge. For instance, studying refugee communities' coping mechanisms reveals how global migration policies are negotiated and resisted on the ground. Conclusion International Political Sociology represents a dynamic field that bridges the theoretical and practical, the global and local, and the structural and individual. Its evolution reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of international relations and the inadequacy of traditional paradigms in capturing this complexity. By integrating insights from realism, liberalism, constructivism, postcolonial and feminist theories, Foucauldian perspectives, globalization studies, critical security studies, and anthropology, IPS offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the social dimensions of global politics. As the field continues to grow, it remains committed to interrogating power, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue. The theories discussed here underscore IPS's central premise: that the political is inherently social, and the global cannot be understood without the local.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-11-15T09:15:31-08:00	
How Anthropological Theories Shaped International Relations: An E...	Anthropology, as the study of human cultures, societies, and behaviors, has significantly influenced the field of International Relations (IR). It has offered unique perspectives on understanding global politics, power dynamics, and the role of human agency in shaping international systems. This article delves into some of the prominent anthropological theories and their profound contributions to IR, illustrating the interdisciplinary synergy that has enriched the study of global affairs. 1. Structural Functionalism Developed by scholars like Émile Durkheim and Bronisław Malinowski, structural functionalism examines how societal structures serve specific functions to maintain social order. In IR, this theory underscores how institutions, norms, and rituals stabilize international systems. For example, international organizations such as the United Nations or World Trade Organization can be analyzed through this lens. Just as kinship systems maintain cohesion in traditional societies, these global institutions mediate conflict, distribute resources, and establish norms for cooperation. Structural functionalism also explains the persistence of cultural practices and their impact on diplomacy. Rituals and ceremonies in statecraft, such as summits or treaty signings, serve functional purposes by reinforcing trust and shared values among nations. By highlighting the importance of systemic interdependence, this theory provides IR scholars with a framework to understand how global structures operate cohesively despite underlying conflicts. 2. Cultural Relativism Franz Boas's principle of cultural relativism emphasizes understanding societies on their own terms, free from ethnocentric judgments. In IR, this theory challenges Western-centric perspectives, advocating for a nuanced understanding of non-Western states and cultures. For example, during negotiations or conflict resolution, cultural relativism encourages policymakers to consider diverse worldviews. The Westphalian model of sovereignty may not resonate with societies that prioritize communal over individual rights. Similarly, concepts like democracy and human rights must be contextualized within local traditions and histories. Incorporating cultural relativism into IR fosters more equitable global governance by avoiding the imposition of universal norms that might disregard cultural specificities. It also informs ethical foreign policies, ensuring respect for the diversity of global political systems and cultural practices. 3. Symbolic Anthropology Pioneered by Clifford Geertz, symbolic anthropology explores how symbols and rituals shape meaning within cultures. This theory has influenced IR by shedding light on the symbolic dimensions of diplomacy, statecraft, and international norms. For example, national flags, anthems, and state ceremonies serve as powerful symbols that reinforce identity and unity. In IR, these symbols play crucial roles during negotiations and conflicts. The waving of a white flag as a symbol of truce or the use of olive branches in diplomacy underscores the importance of shared meanings in mediating international relations. By analyzing these symbolic practices, IR scholars gain insights into how states construct and communicate their identities on the global stage. Symbolic anthropology thus enriches the understanding of how culture shapes international interactions. 4. Structuralism Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralism focuses on the deep, underlying structures of human thought that shape cultural practices. In IR, this theory highlights how binary oppositions like 'us vs. them' or 'friend vs. foe' structure international politics. Structuralism provides a lens to understand how narratives of identity and difference underpin global conflicts and alliances. For instance, the Cold War was not just a geopolitical rivalry but also a clash of ideological binaries: capitalism vs. communism. Similarly, global anti-terrorism policies often rely on constructing oppositions between 'civilized' and 'uncivilized' actors. By unpacking these binaries, IR scholars can critique the assumptions underlying policies and identify paths toward more inclusive global frameworks. 5. Post-Structuralism Post-structuralism, influenced by Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, deconstructs the assumptions and power dynamics embedded in social and political systems. In IR, this theory challenges dominant narratives and explores the construction of power and knowledge. For example, post-structuralism interrogates how terms like 'terrorism' or 'rogue state' are constructed and deployed to justify military interventions. It also critiques the universalizing tendencies of global governance, revealing how they often privilege Western ideologies. By emphasizing the fluidity of meaning and the role of discourse, post-structuralism empowers IR scholars to rethink rigid frameworks and embrace alternative perspectives on global issues. 6. Political Ecology Political ecology examines the relationships between environmental issues, political systems, and social structures. In IR, this theory has become increasingly relevant in addressing global challenges like climate change, resource conflicts, and environmental justice. For instance, political ecology highlights how resource scarcity can exacerbate tensions between states or within regions, as seen in water disputes along the Nile River. It also critiques global environmental policies that marginalize indigenous communities or perpetuate colonial legacies. By linking ecological concerns with power dynamics, political ecology broadens IR's scope, emphasizing the need for sustainable and inclusive global governance. 7. The Gift Theory Marcel Mauss's theory of the gift explores the obligations of giving, receiving, and reciprocating in social relationships. This concept has been adapted in IR to analyze foreign aid, economic diplomacy, and alliance-building. Foreign aid, for instance, is not purely altruistic but often involves expectations of political or economic returns. The theory of the gift reveals how these exchanges reinforce hierarchical relationships between donor and recipient states, shaping global power dynamics. By unpacking the symbolic and material dimensions of exchange, this theory provides valuable insights into the complexities of international economic relations. 8. Interpretive Anthropology Interpretive anthropology, associated with Clifford Geertz, emphasizes understanding cultures through the meanings people assign to their actions. In IR, this theory informs the study of international norms, values, and practices. For example, the concept of sovereignty varies widely across cultures. Interpretive anthropology allows IR scholars to analyze how different societies interpret and implement this principle. It also aids in understanding the cultural dimensions of global conflicts, such as the role of religion or tradition in shaping political movements. This theory enriches IR by highlighting the importance of meaning-making in global politics, fostering deeper cross-cultural understanding. 9. World Systems Theory Immanuel Wallerstein's world systems theory examines the global economy as a hierarchical system comprising core, semi-periphery, and periphery nations. While rooted in sociology, this theory draws heavily on anthropological insights into labor, production, and cultural exchange. In IR, world systems theory critiques the inequalities inherent in global capitalism. It highlights how peripheral nations are often exploited for their resources and labor, perpetuating economic dependence on core nations. This perspective informs debates on globalization, development, and postcolonialism. By emphasizing structural inequalities, world systems theory offers a critical lens for analyzing global economic and political relations. 10. Agency and Structure Debate The agency-structure debate in anthropology explores the interplay between individual actions and systemic forces. This debate has influenced IR by highlighting the role of human agency in shaping international systems. For instance, while global structures like capitalism or diplomacy constrain states, individual leaders and social movements often challenge or reshape these systems. The Arab Spring exemplifies how collective agency can disrupt entrenched political orders. By integrating agency into IR analysis, this theory emphasizes the potential for change and innovation in global politics, challenging deterministic frameworks. 11. Ethnographic Methodology in IR Ethnography, the hallmark of anthropology, has enriched IR by providing tools for in-depth, qualitative analysis of international phenomena. Through participant observation and fieldwork, ethnography uncovers the lived experiences of individuals affected by global policies. For example, ethnographic studies of refugee camps reveal how international aid policies are implemented on the ground, often highlighting discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes. Similarly, ethnographic research on diplomatic practices sheds light on the informal dynamics that shape international negotiations. By centering human experiences, ethnography bridges the gap between abstract theories and real-world practices, making IR more grounded and inclusive. Conclusion The intersection of anthropology and international relations has fostered a richer understanding of global politics by emphasizing culture, meaning, and human agency. The theories discussed here — from structural functionalism to ethnography — illustrate how anthropological insights challenge dominant paradigms, uncover hidden power dynamics, and offer alternative frameworks for addressing global challenges. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the integration of anthropology into IR will remain vital for fostering cross-cultural understanding, promoting equity, and navigating the complexities of global governance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMaaIZUMRPZz	2024-11-15T09:13:33-08:00	
Pentagon Will Work Quickly To Meet President Biden’s ‘Surge’ Comm...	By C. Todd Lopez In September, President Joe Biden announced he plans to 'surge' security assistance to Ukraine. That surge includes plans to ensure all remaining congressionally authorized funding to support Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority, should be transferred to Ukraine before the administration closes out activities in January. Executing that presidential drawdown authority, which means moving some $5.5 billion in gear from U.S. military inventory to Ukraine before Jan. 20, is a tall order. But Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the Defense Department has demonstrated a remarkable ability to quickly get things done over the past three years. 'It is a short time … just under 70 days,' Singh said during a briefing today. 'This department can do incredible work in that amount of time. The president made clear that … he wants to spend down the authority that Congress has allocated and authorized before he leaves office. We're going to work very hard to make sure that happens.' Since Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has provided about $60.4 billion in security assistance. On Nov. 1, for instance, the department initiated the 69th presidential drawdown authority package to Ukraine, worth some $425 million. 'I expect that for the next coming months of this administration, you're going to continue to see those packages draw down from ... what's available in our stockpiles,' Singh said. 'Again, we're committed to ensuring that Ukraine has what it needs to be successful on the battlefield.' Singh also said that the department has been, since the first transfer of military hardware to Ukraine though PDA, cognizant of what's being sent and of what the department needs for itself to ensure that readiness is maintained. That's something that's not going to change, she said. 'We're constantly refilling our shelves and our stockpiles,' she said. 'The secretary is not going to allow the department to dip below readiness levels that he doesn't feel comfortable with. So, as we continue to refill our own shelves, you're going to see equipment, capabilities continue to flow out.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFowK7vNfNby	2024-11-15T09:11:23-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Impending Descent Into Islamist Republic – OpEd	Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus's interim administration apparently plans to turn Bangladesh into an Islamist Republic. The country's Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman has said that the word 'secular' should be removed from the nation's Constitution since '90% of the population is Muslim'. Asaduzzaman came up with this argument during a court hearing on the legality of the 15th Amendment, which was passed during the ousted Awami League's tenure in power and which guarantees Bangladeshis freedom to practise their religions. That amendment partly did not undo the status of Islam as state religion enforced in 1988 during the military rule of General H M Ershad, who was later ousted by a popular agitation, but it gave religious minorities freedom to practise their religion. 'Earlier, there was constant trust and faith in Allah. I want it the way it was before. It is said in Article 2A that the state shall ensure equal rights and equality in the practice of all religions. Article 9 talks about 'Bengali nationalism'. It is contradictory,' Asaduzzaman argued during the court hearing. Since he is the chief law officer of the interim government, his pitch in court would not be possible without green light from chief advisor Muhammed Yunus, whose liberal image abroad is clearly in contradiction to ground realities in Bangladesh since the ouster of the Awami League government. Pogroms Against Hindus, Buddhists Someone in Bangladesh claiming to be an 'Islamic Joddha' (Islamic Fighter) forwarded a Facebook post by Islamic Chatra Shibir (student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami) that claimed killing seven Hindus in the recent violence rocking the country's port city of Chittagong last week. The post claims, 'teaching Hindus in Chittagong the lesson they deserved because they had become too bold.' It also called on all to support our 'Muslim army' which, it says, has got 200 Hindus arrested to be 'taught the right lesson.' The attacks on a Hindu locality in Chittagong followed protests by Hindus in the city over a Facebook post by a local Muslim youth seeking a ban on ISKCON. During the protests, police and army mercilessly attacked Hindus, alleged local community leaders. Buddhist tribespeople in the Chittagong Hill Tracts faced similar attacks during a military crackdown following some clashes between them and Muslim settlers last month. A few tribespeople were killed during what community leaders described as 'unprovoked firings.' Indian, US reactions India has strongly urged Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Mohammed Yunus to take steps to stop violence against Hindus and other minorities. 'We have observed that there have been attacks on the Hindu community in Chittagong. Their properties have been looted, their business establishments have been looted. These happened following incendiary posts on social media targeting Hindu religious organisations,' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. Interestingly just before he won the US Presidential Election, Donald Trump lashed out at growing violence against minorities in Bangladesh. 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump's choice to head National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has also lashed out at 'atrocities against Hindus and other religious minorities in Bangladesh.' In a video of hers widely circulating in the social media, Gabbard described these atrocities as 'a continuation of the atrocities perpetrated by the Pakistani rulers.' Gabbard is a practicing Hindu known for her close relations with India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Yunus administration has so far dismissed Indian concerns over growing attacks on minorities as 'highly exaggerated,' but with Trump all set to take charge, it can no longer be in self denial over the total lawlessness and anarchy prevailing in Bangladesh. Yunus promised rule of law when he took charge of the interim administration, for which there is no provision in the Bangladesh constitution, but which was apparently justified by the 'Doctrine of Necessity' that has often been used to justify military takeovers in Pakistan. Bangladesh's Growing Mobocracy Since the installation of the interim government and the dissolution of the parliament which the erstwhile Awami League has described as 'illegal', a culture of mobocracy seems to have taken root. All high level functionaries who could not be ousted legally, have been forced to resign by mobs led by student leaders who brought down the government of Sheikh Hasina. All Vice Chacellors, Pro-VCs, even Treasurers in 50 universities of the country have been forced to resign by violent mobs led by the student leaders who have owned up to close links to radical groups like the Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Islami Chatra Shibir. According to media reports, 175 School Headmasters have been forced to resign. Many of them were Hindus and quite a few of them were women. The mobs subjected them to visible humiliation. All Supreme Court judges and many High Court judges including the Chief Justice and Attorney General were forcibly removed by similar mob action, as well as ⁠33 permanent secretaries and 11 ambassdors have bern arbitrarily removed, much before end of their tenure. ⁠Nearly 300 secretaries and Additional secretaries and many more Joint Secretaries, a few hundred police commissioners downward, and Joint secretaries have been appointed without any due process. There has been a wholesale reshuffle in banks and other top financial institutions, mostly on an arbitrary basis. Most of those ousted were seen as close to the Awami League and many of those now installed are known to be close to Islamist radical groups. NHRC resignations Last week, all members of Bangladesh's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) resigned shortly after releasing a report on rising mob violence. The NHRC, chaired by Kamal Uddin Ahmed, along with members Md Salim Reza, Aminul Islam, Kongjari Chowdhury, Biswajit Chanda, and Tania Haque, submitted resignation letters to the president. The NHRC resignations came just days after the release of a report detailing a sharp rise in mob violence and crimes such as beatings, rapes, and political harassment in October. The report also exposed violent attacks on political figures, contributing to growing concerns about human rights and safety in Bangladesh. The NHRC spokesperson, Yusha Rahman, confirmed the resignations but could not specify the underlying cause. The political and communal unrest intensified following Hasina's exit, worsening the nation's human rights scenario. The NHRC's report, which underscored these escalating crimes and unrest, appears to have amplified the gravity of the situation, possibly prompting the commission members to step down. The increasing violence and political instability continue to shape the national landscape, posing significant challenges for the interim government. Ridiculous Cases Yunus' promised Rule of Law has been characterised by pursuit of vendetta as state policy. Nearly 200 cases, mostly with charges of murder, have been filed involving over 200,000 Awami Leaders and activists. Some of them, like the murder case against top cricket icon Shakib Al Hasan and lawyer Z.I Khan Panna, are downright frivolous. Shakib, an Awami League lawmaker, was away playing cricket in Canada at the time of the crackdown on student protestors when the murder he is accused of happened. Panna supported the student protests but fell foul with them for criticising their subsequent conduct after establishment of the Interim government. The height of irony is thst the complainant in the murder case accusing Panna does not know the lawyer and has gone on record to say so. The whole idea is to harass, intimidate and humiliate anyone opposing the mobocracy. Media censorship is enforced by a culture of terror and threat and many journalists and editors have been framed in cases with murder charges. Already, even leading western publications like 'Time' are suggesting a change of national mood with many saying 'Hasina's times were much better.' Owner of two small shops, Hasina Jahan pandered to this feeling with her own story. 'During Hasina's rule, we paid a monthly subscription of few hundred rupees a month to her partymen. Now both my shops have been looted and I am ruined. I am surviving by giving tuition to school students and my sister is making a few bucks by escorting toddlers from well-off families to school,' Hasina told the Federal. 'We don't judge rulers by their politics but by our own experience. See the uncontrollable price rise now,' she stressed to point to Yunus' biggest failure -- control the price of essential commodities like foodstuff. The student leaders and the Islamist radical groups they hail from have periodically taken to the streets to demand resignation of President Shahabuddin Chuppu. Some of them have even called for removal of army chief General Waqar-u-Zaman. Recently one of the newly appointed advisor Mahfuz Alam pulled down the portrait of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from Banga Bhavan, seat of the Bangladesh presidency. Alam, described as the 'mastermind' of the agitation that led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, has been a hardliner from the radical Islamist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir. He was first inducted as Yunus' personal assistant and then upgraded to a full fledged advisor. But now the student leaders appear to be upset with some of the newly appointed advisors like film Director Mostafa Sarwar Farooqi whose wife Tisha acted in the Mujibur Rahman biopic. Finally the contradictions within the Interim government is beginning to surface. Army to get more powers Amidst the raging chaos, it is reliably learnt that the 'magistracy powers' given to the Army for two months will be extended. Even the borderguards and coastguards will now be given these powers. This enables the military and paramilitary units to arrest anybody on mere suspicion of their involvement with efforts to disturb law and order. Analysts see this as an attempt by Yunus and his coterie to stay in power by avoiding early elections, which has been demanded by the country's leading political parties, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ousted Awami League. The BNP, which was initially pleased with the Awami League's ouster, has now threatened to hit streets unless elections are announced. The Awami League has already resumed agitations for 'restoration of democracy.' The interim government clearly cannot manage to handle the street agitation of the top parties without the brazen use of the military and paramilitary forces, which are crucial to back up the Islamist radicals under cover of student mobs for the battle of the streets in Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdIfjrwjYW0C_	2024-11-15T09:09:06-08:00	
Jammu And Kashmir: Countering Pakistan’s Disinformation Campaign ...	Pakistan’s Social Media Kashmir Blitz It’s no secret that Pakistan relies heavily on indiscriminate use of social media to not only peddle its pathetic Kashmir narrative but also beguile local youth into picking up guns for waging Rawalpindi’s proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir [J&K]. What’s rather surprising is that New Delhi seldom draws attention of the international community to this concerted disinformation campaign being masterminded by Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI]. One of India’s leading English daily recently carried an illuminating article on this subject, in which it's mentioned that when compared with the same period last year, the more than 2,000 ‘posts of concern’ flagged during October-November, translates into more than a 22 percentage increase. Quoting 'a senior officer in the central security establishment,' the report mentions that there was a concerted effort by Pakistan to use social media to 'influence and exploit' impressionable minds and radicalise them for anti-national activities. This is indeed very disturbing news. New Delhi’s Response The newspaper report ibid merits deliberation for two reasons. Firstly, inclusion of factual data collated by security and intelligence agencies not only adds authenticity to the piece but also reveals the enormity of Pakistan’s sinister psychological warfare programme. Secondly, whereas the specific information provided has definitely been shared by those in the know with the author, the sources haven’t been named, which indicates that the powers-that-be are for reasons unknown, reluctant to make an official disclosure on this serious issue. Though allowing Islamabad to get away with its falsehood on Kashmir appears inexplicable, New Delhi certainly must be having good reasons for its reticence on this issue. For one, trying to rebut patently absurd claims and untenable contentions doesn’t make good diplomatic sense and only gives the balderdash an additional lease of life. Two, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry has a proclivity of shooting itself in the foot and as such giving it a long rope by keeping silent is in itself a good strategy. Remember Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi admitting on TV that abrogation of Article 370 was India’s 'internal matter'? Or Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari publicly accepting that 'We face a particularly uphill task to try and get Kashmir onto the centre of the agenda at the United Nations'? And by telling his countrymen that 'You should not live-in [a] fool’s paradise' as 'Nobody will be standing there [at UNSC] with garlands in hands,' didn’t Qureshi univocally acknowledge that Islamabad’s massive anti-Article 370 abrogation diplomatic offensive had no substance whatsoever? Necessity of Counter Action Islamabad's bombast on the Kashmir issue may be ignored, but its efforts to beguile Kashmiri youth into joining terrorist ranks definitely needs to be countered through a comprehensive campaign aimed at increasing awareness that exposes Pakistan’s menacing game-plan in J&K. Today’s generation in Kashmir is largely unaware of how for more than three-and-a-half decades their people have been used as cannon-fodder by Pakistan just to further its self-serving interests. Islamabad’s perfidy needs to be called out in order to save local youth of impressionable age from getting lured into terrorism, and this can best be done by citing facts revealed by those responsible for promoting this senseless violence. Reality Check Unlike Islamabad which has no other choice but to rely on disinformation for luring Kashmiri youth into terrorism, all that New Delhi has to do is to educate them of Pakistani perfidy by drawing their attention to true instances that unambiguously expose its double dealings. A few examples: Objective of 'Armed Struggle' Kashmiri youth need to realise that the actual objective of the so-called 'armed struggle' in J&K is not achieving 'azadi' [freedom] but solely for the purpose of bleeding India ‘through a thousand cuts’. They should be aware that Pakistan’s ex President and former army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf has himself admitted this during a TV interview by stating that '... Kashmiris who came to Pakistan received hero reception here. We used to train them and support them. We considered them as Mujahideen who will fight with the Indian Army...' [Emphasis added]. HM chief Syed Salahuddin who also heads the United Jihad Council, an umbrella organisation created by ISI to coordinate the activities of terrorist groups fighting and calls upon young Kashmiris to pick up the gun has endorsed Gen Musharraf’s revelation that the so-called 'armed struggle' has nothing to do with azadi as 'we are fighting Pakistan’s war in Kashmir.' With both the former Pakistan army chief who oversaw terrorist activities in J&K as well ISI's minion Salahuddin who's responsible for conducting terrorist actions in this region admitting that the aim of its so-called 'armed struggle' in Kashmir is solely to wage a proxy war against India, Kashmiri youth need to more careful and not end up being fooled into being used as pawns by Rawalpindi. Assassinations The youth should be reminded that ISI is responsible for assassinating those Kashmiri leaders who opposed Pakistan’s interference in Kashmir. This is evident from former All Parties Hurriyat Conference [APHC] chairman Prof Abdul Ghani Bhat’s 2011 revelation that J&K Peoples Conference chairman Abdul Ghani Lone, All J&K Awami Action Committee chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammad Farooq and J&K Liberation Front [JKLF] ideologue Prof Abdul Ahad Wani 'were not killed by the army or the police-they were targeted by our own people.' Even Pakistan based JKLF founder Amanullah Khan has gone on record admitting that the ISI created HM terrorist group espousing Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan had killed more JKLF officials than Indian security forces. In an interview given to Arif Jamal, author of a seminal book on terrorism in J&K [Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir] Rawalpindi based HM commander Ajmal Khan claimed that his outfit had eliminated 'about 7,000 political rivals [mainly JKLF cadres]'. However, Masood Sarfraz, a former close confidante of Salahuddin maintains that 'the actual number [of Kashmiris killed by HM] is many times higher.' Pro Pakistan Camp’s Doublespeak The defining feature of the ISI sponsored political as well as military campaign in Kashmir is that while both APHC leaders and terrorist commanders demand others to make sacrifices, they themselves conveniently keep their own kith and kin out of harm’s way. For example, though senior APHC leader SAS Geelani maintained that'We [APHC] never denied or ignored the role of gun[s] in our struggle,' he ironically never made any of his sons join any terrorist group. Instead, in 2016, Geelani’s grandson suddenly landed a cushy government job as research officer in Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre in a gazetted grade equivalent position that had been lying vacant since 2005. There is strong evidence to suggest that the then Mehbooba Mufti government offered Geelani’s grandson this job as a quid pro quo for the APHC patriarch’s indulgence in stopping the violence that erupted after HM commander Buran Wani’s killing in an encounter. Such underhand deals are not uncommon and even HM chiefSalahuddin reportedly got a seat in a medical college for his son in a similar sweetheart deal brokered by J&K's Intelligence Bureau [IB] chief and approved by the then Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah! Salahuddin proudly accepts motivating Kashmiri youth into picking up the gun by assuring each aspirant that by doing 'he would get into the real life after this death and he would get peace. Khuda usse raazi hoga' [Allah would be pleased with him]. However, isn't it strange that the HM chief has cleverly ensured that his own sons don’t get a chance to get into 'real life' after death and earn divine blessings? Rather than picking up the gun, two of his sons had instead taken up jobs and served the same government that Salahuddin so vehemently accuses of strengthening what he perceives is New Delhi’s ‘forcible occupation’ of J&K! Additional Issues There’s no dearth of live examples that explicitly prove that despite all its emotional rhetoric, Pakistan has no love lost for the people of Kashmir. How does the recent targeted killing spate of migrant workers and grenade attack on innocent civilians in a local flea market by ISI sponsored terrorists further the so-called ‘Kashmir cause’ defies comprehension. This unsettling case in point leaves no scope for any doubts that other than creating mayhem and a heightened sense of insecurity amongst locals and tourists, such violence achieves nothing else. If such aimless violence continues, it will certainly dissuade tourists from coming to Kashmir and this in turn will adversely impact thousands of locals dependent on the tourism industry. The moot point is that if Pakistan really cares for the wellbeing of Kashmiris as it so vociferously claims, then would it precipitate conditions that deprive locals of their livelihood and order grenade attacks on Kashmiris? So, it's abundantly clear that for Islamabad, creating an illusion to buttress its ludicrous claim that normalcy eludes J&K is more important than the safety and wellbeing of Kashmiris. Adolf Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels had rightly opined that 'If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it,' and that’s why New Delhi cannot afford to be complacent. Pakistan is waging a multi-dimensional proxy war against India and as such every move that it makes needs to be appropriately addressed and befittingly replied to.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFSImCsqq4-8	2024-11-15T09:08:03-08:00	
President-Elect Donald Trump And Quandary Over The Russia-Ukraine...	Amid the uncertainties surrounding the incoming Donald Trump administration's likely position and role in the Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow has escalated its war efforts and launched missiles on Kyiv on November 13 - its first missile attack on the Ukrainian capital since August. In response, Ukraine has received temporary solace in the US Secretary of State Blinken's pledges that the 'Biden government will do what it can for Ukraine before leaving office.' With Trump's second term as president in US at the beginning of coming year, uncertainties spiral as to which direction more than three years of Ukrainian resistance and fight against the Russian territorial incursion would take. While President-elect Trump has made it clear he is going to end the war in just one day, it has generated anxiety and debate as to how he is going to accomplish this. He has asserted that the US has no appetite to remain entangled in the wars in distant places where the country does not perceive any direct interest being served. Trump does not want to uphold the international liberal order underlining American exceptionalism either. His transactional worldview suggests that there are no deep ideological divisions in the world as many would like to pit the liberal values upheld by the US against the convergence of authoritarian values championed by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. During his campaign trail, he not only stressed his previous tenure being successful in its diplomatic manoeuvres by managing the great power relations without getting the US entangled in wars but emphasized the way it could successfully fight against the ISIS as well. Ukraine and Russia would Prefer Negotiations to War Ukraine being a small power compared with Russia has been holding off Russian invasion by putting up stiff resistance with its will power and military as well as financial assistance from Europe and the US. It has also enhanced its indigenous capability of producing more weapons. However, external assistance has plateaued even as it needs far more arms and ammunitions to fortify its frontline. While the Western powers have instilled in Ukraine the hope that it can get back its lost territories and restore its 1991 borders, their assistance was not up to the level and proportion that could overpower Russia. The NATO moved cautiously so as not to cross the Russian redlines and allow Ukraine to use long range missiles that could target any part of Russian territory let alone grant membership to it. Meanwhile, Ukraine entered into bilateral security agreements with certain European countries but that is not enough to assure Ukraine of protecting its territories against Russian creeping invasion. In the absence of negotiations tilting in favour of it, Ukraine was not replenished with sufficient military assistance and not allowed to muster enough military muscle to turn the tide of war decisively in its favour. While Russia received fighters from North Korea to maintain its predominance, Ukraine could not receive men in boot from its supporters despite the dire need of them. It has not been able to fortify its defences against the Russian forces within its territory losing ground to the latter. To recover these territories from Russian control, Ukraine would need massive western assistance. Ukrainians would never like to see losing these territories to Russia. Any negotiation that Ukraine enters into from a position of weakness would allow Russia to redraw its map by formally including these territories to its existing boundaries. On the other side, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky whose popularity is gradually dwindling can escape a change of regime by defending these territories from Russian occupation. In the hope of greater and steady assistance from these powers and to demonstrate Russia that the game was going to be a tough one, Ukraine, for the first time, made an incursion into the Russian territory and occupied parts of Kursk region. Now, perceiving the Ukrainian hopes destined to get faded soon, Russia has upped the ante by escalating the war. Both Ukraine and Russia although have been worn out in the protracted war, they will want a negotiated settlement but will never want to be perceived to be in the losing side by their people following the loss of so many lives from their armed forces including mercenaries and conscripted soldiers and civilians. Russian President Vladimir Putin's stated objectives of demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine while remain opaque in their definitions, Russia can demonstrate victory to its people by formally annexing the Ukrainian territories it has occupied over these three years of war. On the negotiating table, it would want guarantees that Ukraine would not be a part of NATO and the military pact would stop eastward expansion by withdrawing all kinds of military activities around and assistance from Ukraine. President-elect Trump would use different tactics to bring Russia to the negotiating table to end the protracted war given his transactional world views. Apparently, he shares good equations with President Putin but Moscow has viewed his electoral victory tepidly. Trump reportedly said unless Russia comes to a negotiating position, Ukraine would be armed to teeth to force it to compromise. War Gravitates Towards Negotiations But Without Blueprint The US under the Biden administration and the European countries have so far refrained from devising and offering any viable plans to end the war through negotiations. These powers as well as Russia and its informal allies continue to buttress their positions in the war without any plans for 'the day after'. Although some neutral powers have taken initiatives to make peace through negotiations, these have not been effective due to their plans being removed from ground realities. Ukraine and the European powers are unlikely to be moved by plans which cede Ukrainian territories to Russia. The European powers without American support cannot push Ukraine to a position of strength. The recent Presidential elections in US suggest that people have lesser appetite for supporting the causes and squandering of American resources for distant countries whereas economic concerns such as inflation and immigration have greater resilience with the masses. In this light and keeping in with speeches of the President-elect Trump during campaign trail, it is obvious that Ukraine is most likely to be bereft of substantial amount of American funds and military assistance which could turn its fate in its favour. There is a growing realisation within the political circle as well that the US has been hard-pressed to sustain military supplies to allies in various theatres of wars and conflicts such as simultaneous supplies of military aircrafts and missiles to Israel and Taiwan have led Pentagon to cancel supplies of the same to Ukraine. Once the Republicans come to dominate both the houses of the Congress, Ukraine in need of desperate military and financial assistance would face further hiccups in the chances of getting them. However, if Ukraine is pushed to negotiation from the current battlefield realities, Russia is sure to gain almost all the advantages that a victory in the war would have allowed. War-fatigued Russia has been sticking to wait out the Western commitment to Ukraine, if that happens then Moscow has everything to relish. There are neoconservatives from the GOP who still believe that American primacy in world affairs must prevail and Russia must pay a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine. In February 2024, twenty two Senators/national security hawks from the Republican Party supported military assistance to Ukraine joining with the Democrats and defying the GOP's stance. President-elect Trump himself might not want Russia to win all these advantages let alone the believers of American exceptionalism and its primacy. Nobody knows what is on the anvil a ceasefire, armistice or a frozen conflict. However, it is really a matter of concern how both the parties to the war can be brought to a negotiation table without any of them being perceived defeated by their own people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdPx3o3vNCgAV	2024-11-15T09:06:13-08:00	
Christian Bashers Rip Hegseth And Huckabee – OpEd	They’ve started already. One week after the election and the Christian bashers are foaming at the mouth over president-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense and Mike Huckabee to be U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Hegseth is a strong Christian who literally wears his religion on his body (he has more than a dozen tattoos emblazoned on his right arm and chest). To be sure, that is bizarre, but that is not what his critics are upset about. They don’t like what the tattoos represent—Christianity. If he had metal spikes hanging from his nose, or had tattoos honoring Lucifer on his neck, that would be fine. But once Jesus is brought into the mix, that’s a call to arms. Indeed, the Christian bashers are explicitly calling him out for wanting a call to arms—they are saying he wants to bring back the Crusades. The Jerusalem Cross on Hegseth’s chest is driving them mad. The left-wing folks at the Daily Beast informed their fans that it is 'a 13th century Crusades symbol, over his right bicep.' They are twice wrong. They are off by 200 hundred years (it dates back to the 11th century, 1099 to be exact) and it is located on his chest, not his right arm. After the overthrow of the Crusader state in 1291, the Jerusalem Cross remained a symbol of Jerusalem for Christians, and today it is the emblem of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, hardly an extremist organization. Another reminder of the Crusades is the Latin phrase, 'Deus Vult,' which means 'God wills it': it is on Hegseth’s right bicep. It is true that it was a rallying cry during the First Crusade. So what? A human rights left-wing activist group from the U.K., Action on Armed Violence, is also exercised about all the Crusader symbols. It says 'Deus Vult' was invoked to 'justify acts of religious violence.' The Bulwark, a publication by the angry never-Trumper Bill Kristol, says these Crusader images are 'disturbing.' What is really disturbing is their ignorance. The Crusades were a defensive reaction to Muslim aggression. Princeton’s Bernard Lewis, one of the world’s most noted historians, says, 'The Crusade was a delayed response to the jihad, the holy war for Islam, and its purpose was to recover by war what had been lost by war—to free the holy places of Christendom and open them once again, without impediment, to Christian pilgrimage.' Also, the Crusaders were volunteers, not papal conscripts. Just as important, according to St. Louis University professor Thomas F. Madden, who has written extensively on this subject, 'All the Crusades met the criteria for just wars.' Action on Armed Violence and the Bulwark slam Hegseth for his ties to Christian nationalism. As I recently pointed out, this is one of the greatest anti-Christian smear jobs of our day. Digging deep, any researcher worth his salt knows how vacuous these charges are. Examples of 'Christian nationalism' include saying in public, 'Blessed is the nation whose God is Lord.' That happens to be Psalm 33:12. Those who say that Trump 'loves the United States of America. He loves God,' are cited as examples of this bogeyman. Singing 'God Bless America' is another indicator of Christian fanaticism. Mike Huckabee is an Evangelical Christian who is a rock-solid supporter of Israel. But according to John Hudson at the Washington Post that is a problem. He is worried that people like Huckabee, who believe that in the covenant that God made to Abraham about Israel, 'have turned that belief into a right-wing brand of Zionism.' Similarly, the militants at J Street have lashed out at Huckabee for his 'extremist views.' Louis Moreno, a former U.S. Ambassador who knows Huckabee, calls him an 'utter nut case.' Why? Because the former Arkansas governor believes in the biblical account of the end of times. If he believed the fiction that the sexes are interchangeable, that would be considered reasonable. Vanity Fair wins the prize for the most irresponsible accusation against Huckabee. After it posts a short critical account of Trump’s nominee, it offers what it calls a Fun Fact. 'Huckabee is a Christian Zionist; Christian Zionists believe ‘Muslims, Jews, and non-Christians are ultimately damned.’' Where did that incendiary comment come from? Apparently from the website of Political Research Associates, a left-wing outlet. It has a post, '101 Christian Zionists,' with lots of statements and links to its sources. On p. 2 it lists five beliefs that it attributes to Christian Zionists, including the one mentioned by Vanity Fair. But unlike most of the other beliefs it cites, this one is not linked to any source, nor is it in quotes. In other words, it was made up by Political Research Associates and Vanity Fair cited it as if it were authoritative. Radicals hate Pete Hegseth because he is a committed Christian and a patriotic American. They hate Mike Huckabee because he is a committed Christian who defends Israel.

Self-Perception And Body Image Of Women: An Overview – OpEd	Self-perception and body image are complex and powerful aspects of identity, especially for women, who face unique societal pressures and expectations. The key insights into self-perception and body image among women include: a. Media Influence: Media, including social media, has a significant impact on body image. Photoshopped images, filters, and idealized beauty standards create unattainable ideals. Many women feel pressured to conform to these ideals, which can lead to dissatisfaction with their own bodies. The 'thin ideal' has long been prevalent in Western media, though there’s been a shift toward celebrating a more diverse range of body types. However, some media still focus on specific body types or features, which can make it hard for women to fully accept their natural shapes. b. Social and Cultural Pressures: Society often links a woman's worth to her appearance, creating pressure to look a certain way. Cultural ideals vary but can include expectations about weight, skin colour, hair, and facial features. Family, friends, and even romantic partners can influence body image through comments and feedback, whether positive or negative. For example, offhand remarks about weight can shape how women see themselves and contribute to self-esteem issues. c. Age and Body Image: Body image concerns can start early, with many girls becoming aware of societal beauty standards by adolescence. Teenage years are a critical period, where comparisons to peers and celebrities are common, often resulting in self-criticism. As women age, body image concerns may shift. Older women may experience changes in self-perception due to life events like pregnancy, menopause, or aging, which can affect the body in various ways. d. Psychological Impact: Negative body image can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Many women internalize societal standards, feeling inadequate if they don’t match these ideals, which affects mental health. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are extreme manifestations of body image issues and are often rooted in a negative self-perception. Women are disproportionately affected by these conditions, highlighting the mental health risks associated with body image struggles. Self-perception and body image are deeply personal and shaped by external forces. A supportive social environment and access to positive, diverse representations can help foster healthier body image perceptions for women. Causes of change Changes in self-perception and body image can be driven by various factors, ranging from personal experiences to societal trends. These shifts can have both positive and negative effects on how individuals view themselves. The major causes of changes in self-perception and body image include: a. Life Stages and Physical Changes: Adolescence: Puberty brings significant physical changes that affect how young people see themselves. These changes can bring insecurity, especially if adolescents feel they do not align with societal ideals. Pregnancy and Postpartum: Pregnancy changes the body drastically, and new mothers may experience shifts in self-perception. Postpartum, women often face new physical realities that can affect body image. Aging: As people grow older, physical changes like wrinkles, changes in body shape, and hair loss can alter self-perception. Aging is often stigmatized, which can contribute to negative body image. b. Weight Changes and Health Conditions: Weight Gain or Loss: Major weight fluctuations, whether from lifestyle changes, medical conditions, or intentional weight loss, can lead to shifts in body image. People often reassess their self-perception based on their body’s current state. Health Issues and Disabilities: Chronic illness, injury, or disability can alter body functionality and appearance, impacting how people feel about themselves. For some, this shift might bring self-acceptance, while for others, it can lead to self-consciousness. c. Cultural and Societal Trends: Beauty and Fashion Trends: As society's beauty ideals change over time, so does body image. For example, the 'thin ideal' of the 1990s and 2000s has gradually shifted toward celebrating more diverse body shapes. Gender Roles and Expectations: Cultural and societal expectations of gender roles also influence body image. For women, these roles may include pressure to appear youthful, fit, and attractive, while men might face pressure to look muscular and strong. d. Mental Health and Self-Esteem: Low Self-Esteem: People with low self-esteem are more likely to be self-critical about their appearance. This can intensify changes in body image over time, leading to dissatisfaction even when there’s no actual change in appearance. Mental Health Conditions: Conditions like depression, anxiety, or body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can distort self-perception, leading individuals to see themselves in a negative or unrealistic light. e. Relationships and Romantic Partners: Romantic Relationships: Partners’ opinions can heavily impact self-perception. Positive reinforcement can boost body confidence, while criticism or comments about appearance can lead to self-doubt and insecurity. Breakups and New Relationships: After a breakup, people might reassess their appearance or focus on personal improvement. Similarly, entering a new relationship can sometimes bring renewed focus on appearance. Overall, self-perception and body image are highly dynamic and can shift with life’s stages, societal influences, and internal growth. Encouraging a healthy, balanced view of oneself, while challenging negative influences, can foster a positive self-image. Management of concepts Managing self-perception and body image involves building a positive relationship with oneself, embracing a balanced perspective, and developing coping strategies to handle external pressures. There are some strategies that can help improve and manage self-perception and body image: a. Limit Negative Media Exposure: Curate Your Social Media Feed: Follow accounts that promote body positivity, diversity, and self-acceptance. Unfollow those that lead to negative self-comparisons or unrealistic standards. b. Focus on Health, Not Appearance: Set Functional Goals: Aim to improve strength, energy, flexibility, or mental well-being rather than focusing exclusively on appearance-based goals. Listen to Your Body: Practice mindful eating, regular physical activity, and rest. Appreciate your body for its capabilities and try to connect health efforts to how you feel rather than how you look. c. Engage in Therapy or Counselling: Seek Professional Help: Working with a therapist, especially one trained in body image or self-esteem issues, can help you explore the roots of negative self-perception and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT is particularly effective for managing body image issues, as it helps you recognize and alter negative thought patterns and behaviors related to self-image. d. Limit Comparisons: Avoid Social Comparisons: Comparing yourself to others, whether in person or online, is a common source of body dissatisfaction. Remind yourself that everyone has unique strengths and features, and focus on your own journey. Use Journaling: Journaling can help you explore and understand your personal journey with body image without judgment or comparison. Reflect on your own achievements and progress rather than external standards. Improving self-perception and body image is a journey that takes time and patience. Building a supportive environment, practicing self-care, and reframing negative thoughts can help us develop a healthier, more balanced self-image.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFohquz_oOlm	2024-11-15T09:04:30-08:00	
A Leader’s Quest: Restoring Dignity And Autonomy In A Divided Lan...	Omar Abdullah’s return to office as Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in October 2024 is a powerful moment for the region, marking a shift towards a potential restoration of autonomy and statehood lost after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. Following a decisive election victory by the National Conference, Abdullah stepped into leadership at a time when Jammu and Kashmir faces unique political and social challenges. The abrogation of Article 370 had stripped the region of its special status and divided it into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Abdullah’s leadership has reignited hopes for restoring the region’s statehood, creating a strong foundation for a future rooted in self-governance and regional identity. Omar Abdullah’s first move as Chief Minister was the formation of a ten-member Council of Ministers, chosen carefully to ensure an equal representation of voices from both Jammu and Kashmir regions. This inclusive approach is seen as a way to foster harmony and regional unity, recognizing the distinct needs and aspirations of the area’s diverse population. The National Conference’s commitment to equitable representation underscores Abdullah’s intent to navigate Jammu and Kashmir’s future through collaborative governance. By bringing balanced voices to the council, Abdullah has signaled his awareness of the socio-political complexities and his dedication to a collective approach in tackling the region’s challenges. One of Abdullah’s earliest and most decisive actions came on October 17, 2024, when his cabinet unanimously passed a resolution calling on the central government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. This move, which quickly gained approval from Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, was a significant step in formalizing the statehood cause. Although Abdullah faced some criticism for not first putting the resolution to a vote in the Assembly, his direct action reflects the urgency he attaches to this issue. The resolution for restoring Article 370, which the J&K Assembly passed on November 6, 2024, further highlighted Abdullah’s dedication to autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 and Article 35A, prior to their revocation, had granted Jammu and Kashmir a unique status within India, including the right to have its own constitution and considerable autonomy over local governance. Article 370 allowed the state legislature exclusive powers to make laws on various matters, such as property ownership and residency rights, while Article 35A provided the legislative authority to define 'permanent residents' and ensure exclusive rights to them. The 2019 revocation of these articles brought Jammu and Kashmir fully under the Indian Constitution, opening the region to settlement from other states and changing the landscape of property ownership, employment, and welfare benefits. The November resolution, led by Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, called for a dialogue with the Indian government to reinstate these protections. While BJP members in the Assembly protested and argued the resolution was not on the day’s agenda, Speaker Abdur Rahim Rather moved forward with a vote, ultimately leading to its passage. This decision, while divisive, was seen as a bold reaffirmation of the region’s desire for autonomy, and Abdullah’s role in pushing this agenda underscores his commitment to restoring constitutional safeguards for Jammu and Kashmir. Despite these promising steps, Abdullah’s administration is limited by the constraints placed on the Union Territory Assembly, following amendments that vested the Lieutenant Governor with considerable power over administrative and legal matters. Nonetheless, the Assembly remains an essential platform for the people of Jammu and Kashmir to voice their concerns, including their advocacy for statehood, human rights, and political representation. Under Abdullah’s leadership, the Assembly has amplified calls for addressing these issues, reinforcing that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are actively engaged in shaping their future despite the Union Territory’s limited legislative power. Abdullah’s administration has made it clear that it will continue to prioritize advocacy for autonomy, underscoring the Assembly’s role as a voice for the people’s aspirations, even amid political limitations. The future of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood restoration efforts, however, remains uncertain. Abdullah’s actions have brought the issue to the forefront of Indian politics, and the assurances from Home Minister Amit Shah and the formal endorsement from Lieutenant Governor Sinha suggest positive momentum. Yet, many are wary of potential delays from the central government, which must balance its commitment to Jammu and Kashmir with broader national priorities. The ongoing efforts by Abdullah’s administration to secure statehood and constitutional guarantees will likely be met with both support and resistance, reflecting the complexities of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Indian Union. Whether these initiatives lead to lasting change or encounter further delays, Abdullah’s leadership continues to represent the resilience and resolve of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as they pursue a future rooted in self-governance and restored identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIff6SFsl4cye	2024-11-15T09:02:37-08:00	
Tourism In Pakistan: Discovering The Hidden Paradise Of Kashmir –...	Pakistan, with its diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage, is gradually emerging as a top travel destination. While the bustling cities of Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi often take center stage, there's one region in the northern part of the country that remains an undiscovered gem- Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Known for its breathtaking natural beauty, AJK is becoming increasingly popular among tourists looking for an escape from the ordinary. With its lush valleys, pristine lakes, snow-capped peaks, and serene meadows, AJK is often called the 'Switzerland of the East' or 'Heaven on Earth.' For much of its modern history, Azad Jammu and Kashmir was a place visitors couldn’t easily reach. Political tensions and regional conflicts kept this stunning area off the map for international tourists. However, following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2004, the region slowly began to open up. What was once a place of uncertainty has now blossomed into one of the most promising tourist destinations in Pakistan. Over the years, the number of visitors has steadily increased, and the region's tourism infrastructure has begun to improve. In 2015, more than a million tourists visited the area, and that number has continued to grow each year. AJK offers a rich mix of natural beauty and tranquility that is difficult to find elsewhere. The towering peaks of the Himalayas, the winding rivers, and the thick forests all create an atmosphere that feels almost otherworldly. One of the most famous spots is Neelum Valley, a stunning stretch of land nestled between the mountains. With its flowing rivers, verdant meadows, and charming villages like Keran and Sharda, it’s the perfect place to disconnect and experience the beauty of nature. The valley is a haven for hikers, photographers, and anyone seeking a peaceful retreat away from the noise and stress of everyday life. Another must-see is Ratti Gali Lake, located high in the mountains at over 12,000 feet. This alpine lake is surrounded by snow-covered peaks, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene that draws photographers, nature lovers, and adventurers. The azure waters of the lake reflect the towering mountains, making it a perfect spot for those seeking both adventure and serenity. But it’s not just the scenery that makes AJK so special. The region is also steeped in history and culture, making it a place of both natural and historical exploration. From the ancient Sharda Peeth temple, an important pilgrimage site, to the ruins of forts and historical buildings scattered across the region, AJK is a treasure trove of culture and history. The blend of Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Central Asian influences gives the region a unique cultural identity that sets it apart from other parts of the world. The hospitality of the people is another highlight. Known for their warmth and friendliness, the people of AJK go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome. Local cuisine is an essential part of the cultural experience, with traditional Kashmiri dishes like Wazwan and flavorful teas like Kahwa offering a taste of the region’s rich culinary heritage. Food lovers will find themselves enjoying the variety of spices and flavors unique to this mountainous region. While tourism in AJK is still in its early stages compared to other global destinations, the potential is immense. Over the past few years, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has made significant investments in tourism-related infrastructure, such as better roads, improved hotel accommodations, and enhanced facilities for visitors. These efforts are already paying off, with tourism revenue steadily increasing and more visitors arriving each year. In fact, in 2017 alone, AJK attracted 1.75 million tourists, up from 1.14 million in 2015, and the region’s tourism earnings amounted to PKR 67.378 million in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The financial impact of tourism is not limited to just AJK—it’s a key part of the larger picture for Pakistan’s economy. In 2017, Pakistan’s tourism sector contributed an impressive 7.4% to the country’s GDP, which amounted to around PKR 2,349 billion. Tourism in Pakistan has been a significant source of jobs, with the sector generating over 1.4 million jobs, or 2.5% of the country’s total employment. The tourism industry is expected to continue growing, with a predicted 7% increase in the sector in 2018, further solidifying its role as a key economic driver. Tourism also plays a crucial role in foreign exchange, as visitor exports accounted for 3.6% of Pakistan’s total exports in 2016. Moreover, Travel & Tourism investment amounted to PKR 410.4 billion in 2017, contributing 9.1% of total national investment. The government of Pakistan has been actively working to promote tourism in regions like AJK, recognizing its potential to boost the local economy, create jobs, and enhance the country's international image. The growing number of tourists, the increase in infrastructure investment, and the rise in tourism earnings all signal a bright future for AJK’s tourism industry. The region's growing popularity is also benefiting the local economy. More tourists mean more jobs, whether in hospitality, transportation, or small businesses that cater to visitors. In fact, tourism in AJK is expected to become one of the main drivers of economic growth in the region. It’s not just about the natural beauty or the historical sites- it’s about the opportunity to create jobs, stimulate local economies, and give the world a glimpse of a place that was once hidden away. Looking ahead, the future of tourism in Azad Jammu and Kashmir is incredibly bright. As more visitors from around the world discover the region, it’s likely that AJK will become a key destination for travelers seeking a unique experience. The government is continuing to improve security, infrastructure, and visa policies to make the region more accessible, and as these efforts progress, the tourism industry will likely see rapid growth. Pakistan as a whole is beginning to understand the true value of its tourism potential. With regions like AJK offering stunning landscapes, rich history, and warm hospitality, the country is well-positioned to become a major player in the global tourism market. It’s clear that places like Azad Jammu and Kashmir are not just valuable for their natural beauty- they are also vital to the country’s economic future. AJK’s rapid rise as a travel destination is a testament to its potential. As more people visit, the region’s beauty and hospitality will continue to shine, offering a peaceful and unforgettable escape. For anyone looking to explore the untouched beauty of northern Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir is waiting to be discovered- a place that feels like a dream come true, and one that is poised to leave a lasting impression on all who visit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIVpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-15T09:01:40-08:00	
South Africa: Precision Policing A Vital Element Of Reducing Fire...	By David Bruce Mass killings have wreaked havoc in numerous South African communities in recent months. Along with the devastating murder of 18 people in Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape province on 28 September, other attacks have taken a heavy toll on human life. These occurred in places as disparate as Qumbu, Bityi and Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, Bishop Lavis and Atlantis in the Western Cape, Orange Farm in Gauteng province and Orkney in North West province. We don’t know the exact reasons for each of these incidents. But there can be no doubt that the widespread availability of firearms to those involved in crime makes mass killings more possible and more likely. These killings are one of many reasons the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), in a new policy brief, is calling for the South African Police Service (SAPS) to develop an integrated strategy to reduce firearm crime. This should ensure clear and measurable reductions in all categories of crime associated with the use of guns. Mass killings have become an embedded feature of violence in South Africa. The number of people killed in Lusikisiki is slightly higher than the death toll at the Mdlalose Tavern shooting in Soweto in July 2022, when 16 people were killed. In April 2023, 10 family members died in a single shooting incident in Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal province. The widespread availability of guns undoubtedly makes mass killings more possible and more likely Mass killings have reached unprecedented levels in South Africa since the early 1990s. SAPS data for July-September 2023 showed 125 people killed in incidents with four or more deaths. Recently released data compiled by Gun Free South Africa showed a similar number had been murdered in shootings of four or more people in the past three months. Firearms are crime enablers and violence multipliers. They make a massive contribution to crime-related deaths, injury and fear in South Africa. Police data indicates that guns were used in 12 000 to 16 000 murders in South Africa over the 2023/24 year. There were also between 17 000 and 20 000 cases of attempted murder, where people sustained non-fatal firearm injuries. The severity and complexity of many of these injuries place an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Inga Mkoko, who was 25 at the time of the Mdlalose tavern shooting, spent three weeks in intensive care and six months in hospital. He had both legs amputated and lost four fingers. Notwithstanding the large number of firearm-related deaths and injuries, guns are mostly used to threaten victims without the weapons being fired. Fear of firearms makes them the favoured instrument for coercion in robberies, extortion and some incidents of rape. They also play a major role in taxi violence and violent organised crimes such as extortion and conflict between gangs involved in the illegal drugs or mining trade. SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime, but cannot do so using its established approach The fact that criminals have the capacity to use equivalent levels of force to the police directly undermines the state’s ability to exercise authority. Virtually all killings of SAPS members are with firearms. The SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime. But it cannot do so using its established approach that relies mainly on the recovery of illegal firearms. A key element is making optimal use of available data. As a starting point, police should use crime statistics to identify the areas where most firearm crime occurs. The recently released ISS policy brief illustrates how this can be done. The SAPS should be able, quite easily, to map firearm crime. Effective mapping is vital to ensuring that police resources are deployed in a precise way, targeted at the groups involved and places where it’s occurring. A key solution is making optimal use of available data to quickly and accurately map firearm crime Beyond mapping, the SAPS should invest in strengthening information management systems to synthesise information on firearm crime. This includes crime reports, ballistic data, interviews with suspects, victims and witnesses, and details from sources in the community. This process, along with crime investigation, should then be used to identify, arrest and prosecute perpetrators of firearm crime. This approach can also dramatically improve our understanding of where guns used in crime are coming from. Tracing the source of these weapons would allow for proactive interventions to close loopholes that enable criminal access to firearms. Recovery of illegal firearms is not enough. South Africa needs a practical firearm reduction strategy that provides for collaboration between appropriate state, private sector and civil society role players. There is knowledge and experience of firearm crime reduction in South Africa and internationally that SAPS can draw on. Effective implementation of an integrated firearm crime reduction strategy should be an exercise in learning how a more effective SAPS can work. Without it, gun crime is likely to continue devastating many families and communities. Read the ISS policy brief ‘Targeting firearm crime will make South Africa safer’ by David Bruce, here.

RCEP Provides A Path To Regional Trade Cooperation – Analysis	By Iman Pambagyo and Donna Gultom As global trade began to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 10 ASEAN member states and their five FTA partners sealed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement on 15 November 2020 during a summit of participating country leaders. Requiring eight years of negotiation to complete, the RCEP initiative was first introduced when Indonesia was chair of ASEAN in 2011 with a view to consolidating the existing ASEAN Plus One FTAs to deepen and expand regional value chains. The basic concept of RCEP was endorsed by leaders of 16 countries in November 2012 in Phnom Penh, and the first round of negotiations took place in March 2013 in Brunei Darussalam where negotiators had more questions than answers on how to translate the RCEP concept into an effective trade agreement. Initially, RCEP was negotiated among 16 countries — ten ASEAN countries and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. At the RCEP Summit in late 2019, India decided to leave the negotiations due to difficulties at home. India’s exit raised doubts among some non-ASEAN negotiating parties that the targeted total market size of RCEP would shrink from 3.7 billion to 2.3 billion people. ASEAN’s leadership in getting negotiations across the finish line proved critical. The key message conveyed to the non-ASEAN participating countries was that RCEP was not merely about market access. RCEP would also serve as a platform for countries in proximity to ASEAN to enhance regional cooperation and to deepen and expand the regional value chains that already existed under ASEAN Plus One FTAs — contributing to the economic advancement of individual partners as well as the region. After going through the ratification process with individual participating countries, RCEP eventually entered into force on 1 January 2022. Representing around 30 per cent of the world’s GDP, 28 per cent of global trade and 32 per cent of global foreign direct investment flows, the RCEP Agreement was championed to significantly benefit all its parties through the intensification of trade in goods and services, investment, trade facilitation and cooperation among members. RCEP has been in place for over two years, but available data suggests that utilisation of the preferential treatment under the Agreement — especially on trade in goods — is still far below what had been expected, with China, Japan and Korea currently the main beneficiaries. But this should not come as a surprise. RCEP was concluded against the backdrop of a trade war between the United States and China, which has had adverse impacts on other countries, including most RCEP members. RCEP also entered into force when global trade had to deal with the spread of COVID-19, continued geopolitical rivalries among major powers, war in Ukraine and climate change issues affecting logistics in the Panama Canal. The war between Israel and Hamas and the security threats to shipping lines through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have added to concerns that world trade is disintegrating. Eight years of RCEP negotiations have shown that focusing on shared economic interests can lead to mutual benefits instead of an escalation of disagreements toward open conflicts. ASEAN played an important role in keeping all parties engaged constructively when its negotiation encountered non-economic hurdles between Japan and South Korea and between India and China. Statements by leaders at various RCEP summits suggest that the spirit of cooperation incentivised them to create a region of strong collaboration towards shared prosperity, regardless of differences in political, economic and social systems. While RCEP does not the disciplines of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Peter A Petri and Michael Plummer — writing for the Brookings Institution in 2020 — note that ‘the effects of RCEP are impressive’ and that ‘it incentivises supply chains across the region but also caters to political sensitivities’. RCEP was made possible because negotiations were advanced in an ‘ASEAN way’ — consensual, flexible and sometimes very slow. This negotiation style needs to be applied as a trade diplomacy strategy by its members when trying to build cooperation and collaboration between RCEP and other economic groupings such as the EU, Southern Common Market and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. The ‘ASEAN way’ able to seal the deal when there is consensus and flexibility but progresses slowly and carefully when dealing with contentious issues, which otherwise bring negotiations to an impasse. All the RCEP countries now have experience negotiating unusually complex issues. This experience can be applied when they embark on global trade diplomacy with non-RCEP countries and regions.

A Deep Dive Into The India-Russia Economic Relationship – Analysi...	By Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash In the past decade, the core drivers of India-Russia relations have begun shifting. The traditionally dominant military-technical partnership has declined, with India buying less Russian weapons, technology and military platforms. The economic pillar stagnated as military dealings slowed, with bilateral trade hoveringaround the US$ 10-11 billion mark. However, since 24 February, 2022, there has been a dramatic uptick in economic ties, with India emerging as Russia's second-largest trade partner. In 2022, bilateral trade surgedto US$ 49 billion, and by the end of 2023, US$ 65 billion. This uptick in trade is primarily attributed to the increasing discounts on oil purchases offered to Indian refiners, as India did not join the sanctions regime against Russia. Along with increasing oil trade, the non-oil trade has also marginally increased in the trade basket. Along with these new trends in bilateral trade, there is a significant overestimation of the India-Russia economic cooperation, which has led to condemnation from the Group of Seven countries (G7), comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States). Trends in the Ttrade basket While it’s no surprise that hydrocarbon imports dominate the trade basket, in 2023, US$ 54 billion of the US$ 65 billion exports comprised oil imports from Russia. Similar trends were reflected in the previous year; out of the US$49 billion total trade,US $38 billion constituted oil imports. The overall trade has grown with the increasing oil and mineral imports from Russia. For instance, in 2021, bilateral trade was US$ 12 billion, where oil and mineral fuels constituted only US$ 5.2 billion of the total trade, leaving US$ 6.8 billion in non-oil trade. In 2022 and 2023, non-oil trade increased to US$ 11 billion, a significant growth, indicative of bilateral trade increasing. Since 2022, Russia’s fertiliser exports have grown substantially. The average Indian import of Russian Fertiliser was around US$ 600 million; however, in 2022-23, fertiliser imports increased to US$ 3 billion. It later declined in the following year, primarily because Russia ended previous discounts on the sale of di-ammonium phosphate. Further, the import of precious stones, metals, and jewellery has increased since 2021. Similarly, Russia’s export of edible vegetables and animal and vegetable fats has increased.

Pharmaceutical exports are steadily declining. By 2024, pharmaceutical exports from India had declined to US$ 386 million (see Fig 1.2). Further, trade across items such as tea, coffee, and spices has fluctuated, as well as with clothing accessories. However, the export of some commodities has increased since the invasion, such as iron and steel, electrical machinery and consumer electronics, organic and inorganic chemicals, compounds of precious metals, rare-earth metals, soap and by-products, ceramic products, automobiles and spare parts, and medical and surgical equipment. However, one of the biggest Indian exports that surged in 2023-2024, since the invasion, was the export of machinery and mechanical appliances, which increased from US$ 320 million to US$ 650 million. Further, in 2024, from April to August, machinery imports rose to US$ 700 million. The increase in export volumes of these goods is one of the reasons why India’s total export surged from US$ 3.1 billion to US$ 4.2 billion in 2024. Based on early projections for 2024-2025, it is likely that trade across consumer goods, electronics, machinery, and spare parts will increase. The improvement in trade and increasing avenues for economic cooperation have emerged due to the vacuum left by Western firms in the Russian economy which allowed Russia to spend the rupees accumulated in its accounts since February 2022.

India’s trade with Russia, even though diversified, is not on a large scale in comparison to other Group of 20 (G20) countries (sans Russia). Neither are there any vast business interests for Indian elites in Russia, apart from oil and pharma, which is why trade data does not reflect any new avenues of trade except in consumer goods and electronics. In November 2022, Moscow sent a list of goods to New Delhi for delivery, including parts for cars, trains, and aircraft. The list consisted of more than 500 entries. It is clear that New Delhi has not supplied Russia with any of the big-ticket items, such as aircraft engines or equipment with high dual-use capabilities (beyond spare parts), as bilateral trade data reflects that trade for the parts requested by Moscow has been minimal. Furthermore, New Delhi’s defence imports to Russia are a by-product of the bilateral military-technical partnership and to setup joint ventures. Further, trade data does not reflect any sale of restricted critical technology to Russia, as claimed by a few sources. The sources cite drones worth US$ 5 million and goods worth US$ 600,000 that were re-exported via Kyrgyzstan. Recently, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against 19 Indian firms for their alleged involvement in the supply of dual-use goods to Moscow, including a few pharmaceutical companies based in Mumbai re-exporting Dell Technologies’ most advanced server, Dell PowerEdge XE9680, worth US$ 434 million to Russia. Despite these claims, no evidence clearly substantiates them. For instance, with regards to the first claim of India exporting drones via Kyrgyzstan, the numbers do not add up. Since 2022, trade with Bishkek for electronic products has not crossed US$1 million. Similarly, in the case of arms and ammunition and parts, the trade does not exceed US$ 480,000. Furthermore, in a globalised world where trade takes precedence, trading firms in countries near Russia re-route such trade. For instance, several US and European firms exported US$ 1.2 billion worth of microchips, which were later re-routed from Türkiye and Kazakhstan. Therefore, despite allegations, trade data does not justify the charges. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in response to the criticism, stated that the firms involved did not violate any Indian law, as New Delhi did not recognise non-UN-approved sanctions. Since early 2024, Western sanctions against Russia have intensified, compelling India to take a stance. For instance, early this year, TotalEnergies invoked a force majeure on Russia’s Arctic LNG-2 project, which led to production being suspended. In the past, Indian firms were interested in purchasing stakes in Novatek’s (a major Russian gas company) Arctic LNG-2 project as part of New Delhi’s outreach to the Russian Arctic. However, the subsequent rounds of European Union (EU) sanctions targeting Russian Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) have prompted New Delhi to announce that it would not purchase LNG from the Arctic LNG 2 project. Interestingly, despite waves of sanctions against Russian energy, the EU continues to import LNG from Russia. Imports have increased by 20 percent this year. The EU has a selective approach to imposing and complying with sanctions. On the one hand, it criticises New Delhi with allegations of India reinforcing the Kremlin coffers, fueling Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. On the other hand, the EU continues to purchase Russian energy. Issue of payments Lastly, even though India was able to address payment issues by extending the Special Rupee-Vostro account facility to Russian businesses, certain challenges remain. Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, have limited foreign portfolio investments by Sberbank AG, Russia’s largest bank, to hydrocarbons only. Furthermore, because of Russia's classification as a 'high-risk' country by the Financial Action Task Force, the commerce ministry’s Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) continues to place Russia in the same category, despite the MEA and the Indian Embassy in Moscow’s request for a reevaluation. Conclusion India’s trade with Russia must be viewed from the point of view of one driven by supply and demand factors and not through the intervention of a political apparatus. With bilateral trade likely to continue and intensify with Russia, the intensity of secondary sanctions might impact New Delhi’s economic engagement with Moscow. India is presented with a set of challenges: it must sustain its engagement with Moscow while continuing to further its cooperation with the West, all while ensuring that its short-and medium-term energy security needs are addressed. Navigating these challenges will be essential for India as it seeks to balance its strategic interests in a complex global landscape.

Bending Reality: How Surrealism Reveals The Subjectivity Of Time ...	Time, as a concept, has perplexed humanity for centuries. Our understanding of it oscillates between the linear and cyclical, the tangible and the surreal, the mathematical and the metaphysical. But more than anything, time is subjective—an experience rather than a measurable constant. When examined through the lens of surrealism, time emerges as not merely a sequence of events but a fabric that our perceptions, desires, and fears weave. The Nature of Time To understand why time is subjective, it is essential to distinguish between 'clock time,' or chronological time, and 'psychological time.' Clock time is the scientific, standardized measurement—seconds, minutes, hours—that our society depends on to synchronize actions. Psychological time, however, is an entirely personal experience. It can stretch and compress, influenced by our emotions, memories, and the intensity of the moment. Surrealism and the Dream State of Time Surrealism, as a movement, broke free from the constraints of logic, reality, and linearity. It allowed artists and thinkers to explore dreams, subconscious desires, and emotions in their raw, unfiltered forms. Central to surrealism is the fluidity of time, which often appears distorted, repetitive, or looping within surrealist works. This is famously depicted in Salvador Dalí's 'The Persistence of Memory,' where clocks melt in a barren, dream-like landscape. Here, time is not rigid; it is malleable, warped by the environment and the viewer's interpretation. Dalí's melting clocks illustrate an essential surrealist idea: time as an extension of the mind, subject to interpretation and transformation. Just as the subconscious mind operates outside of conventional temporality, surrealist art challenges viewers to experience time without strict boundaries. Freud, the Unconscious, and the Nonlinear Sigmund Freud, whose work heavily influenced surrealist artists, emphasized that the unconscious mind operates outside of linear time. In dreams, he argued, events from different periods of our lives coexist, sometimes merging, altering, or repeating. Surrealism tapped into this psychological framework, breaking down chronological barriers and presenting a world where past, present, and future coalesce. In surrealist paintings, there's often a sense that scenes do not unfold in a specific order but rather coexist in a single, fragmented reality. This idea is supported by the dream-like quality of time in surrealist works. Max Ernst's collages, for instance, bring together disparate, often anachronistic elements—a modern object might appear beside a medieval scene, blending temporal periods into one. Through these juxtapositions, Ernst mirrors the way memories and dreams function, where time is not consistent but scattered, dense, and elusive. Time in the Works of René Magritte Belgian surrealist René Magritte often manipulated time by contrasting ordinary objects in unusual contexts, giving viewers a sense of disorientation. Magritte's 'Time Transfixed' exemplifies this approach, showing a locomotive emerging from a fireplace. Here, two elements representing movement and stillness intersect. This unexpected pairing creates a surreal temporal illusion, blurring distinctions between 'now' and 'then,' motion and pause. Magritte's art demonstrates the surrealist view that time need not be sequential or rational. In our internal experience, memories and events bleed into each other, and logic becomes secondary to sensation. Surrealism, therefore, encourages us to question our perception of time as an orderly flow. Time and Memory: The Persistence of the Past One reason why time feels subjective is its connection to memory. Philosopher Henri Bergson argued that our experience of time is shaped by our memories, which accumulate and form an ever-expanding repository. This non-linear model of time resembles a spiral more than a line; the past continually resurfaces, influencing our experience of the present. Surrealist art often explores this fluid relationship between memory and time. Yves Tanguy, for instance, created vast landscapes filled with bizarre, indeterminate forms. These forms evoke a sense of déjà vu, as if the viewer has glimpsed them in a dream. The familiar becomes strange, and the past blurs with the present, highlighting the surrealists' view of time as a dimension molded by memory and nostalgia. The Subjective Flow of Time: Psychological Studies Psychologists have studied how emotions alter time perception. For example, moments of fear or exhilaration seem to stretch time, while monotonous tasks compress it. Surrealism plays on this perception by bringing viewers into scenes that are neither fully real nor dreamt, allowing time to lose its rigidity. In surrealist paintings, clocks are often distorted, disjointed, or absent altogether. This echoes our psychological experience of time: in intense moments, it becomes flexible, a quality that surrealism makes tangible. The surrealist movement embraced these subjective variations, presenting them as a more 'authentic' experience of time. Instead of a relentless tick-tock, surrealist time is alive, capable of slowing, freezing, or looping—a malleable entity. Time as Cyclical and Eternal Surrealist philosophy often aligns with the idea of cyclical or eternal time, as opposed to linear time. The works of Giorgio de Chirico illustrate a kind of eternal return, an endless repetition of similar scenes with subtle variations. His paintings, often set in timeless, deserted cityscapes, evoke a sense of déjà vu, an endless present. De Chirico's work suggests that time is not something we progress through but a state we are perpetually within. This echoes the Nietzschean concept of 'eternal recurrence,' which posits that all events endlessly repeat. Through surrealist art, the viewer is invited to contemplate the nature of existence and to experience a 'timeless' state where moments are not markers of progression but of repetition. The Legacy of Surrealism on Modern Perceptions of Time The surrealist approach to time has profoundly influenced modern philosophy, literature, and film. Works such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' and films like Inception and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind embody surrealism's treatment of time. These stories unfold in fractured, dream-like ways, mixing past, present, and future into complex patterns that defy linear logic. Surrealism's radical reimagining of time has thus permeated popular culture, resonating with our innate understanding that time is not simply measurable intervals but a deeply subjective and often illogical experience.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CjcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-14T16:42:19-08:00	
Kremlin, With Help From North Korea, Stages Major Push To Recaptu...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. North Korea and Russia Launch a Large-Scale Offensive in Kursk Augmented by 10,000 North Korean servicemen, the Russian military has amassed 50,000 troops for a large-scale counteroffensive to reclaim the Russian region of Kursk from Ukrainian forces. Open-source intelligence suggests that the campaign has already begun—at an overwhelming operational tempo. According to Ukrainian officials, the North Korean contingent, divided into an assault detachment and a group of supporting forces, is engaged in combat operations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov have stated that Pyongyang’s troops have already suffered casualties. Ukrainian intelligence has also determined that at least three high-ranking North Korean generals have combat deployed to oversee Pyongyang’s movements in the field. The most senior figure in the group is General Kim Yong Bok. Kim is the vice chief of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) General Staff, the commander of Pyongyang’s special forces, a military advisor to Kim Jong Un, and a member of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Central Committee. Russia’s Kursk offensive features a noteworthy composition of forces. Naval infantry formations, particularly the 810th and 155th Brigades, are leading the offensive action to break Ukrainian lines. Social media reports have highlighted the involvement of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) in the effort. Russia’s defense industry has equipped the Kremlin’s marines with newly produced BTR-82 armored personnel carriers (APCs) to provide the units with protection, operational flexibility, speed, and mobility. Despite these advancements, Ukraine’s heavy detachments, such as the 47th Mechanized Brigade and the 95th Air Assault Brigade, have so far demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding their ground and inflicting damage on the Russian formations. Ukraine’s accumulated gains in Kursk have significant strategic implications and provide Kyiv with considerable diplomatic leverage. If United States President-elect Donald Trump seeks to impose a ceasefire and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Kyiv will be able to use the Russian territory it holds as a bargaining chip. The Kremlin is working to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk to deprive Kyiv of this leverage before the new US administration takes office. 2. Russian and Ukrainian Forces Exchange Massive Drone Barrages During the night of November 9, the Russian military launched a loitering munition salvo against multiple Ukrainian cities, including Zhytomyr, Odesa, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin launched 145 Iranian Shahed drone warfare systems from multiple sites including occupied Crimea. Ukraine’s air defenses intercepted only 62 of these drones. The strike, like many of the Kremlin’s prior attacks, risked significant collateral damage: some Russian drones wandered off their flight paths into Belarus and Moldova. In a previous strike, Russian loitering munitions hit the Estonian ambassador to Kyiv’s apartment building. The surge in Shahed attacks suggests that Russia and Iran’s joint drone manufacturing plant has further increased its production capacity. Kyiv answered the Kremlin’s salvo on November 10 with its largest drone strike since the beginning of the war. Russian air defense crews engaged 70 Ukrainian drones, 34 of which were targeting Moscow. Ukraine’s strike halted operations at the Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow, severely disrupting Russian air traffic. The war between Russia and Ukraine has served as both a proving ground and an innovation incubator for armed drones, yielding new technologies, weapons systems, and concepts of operations (CONOPS) in the realm of unmanned systems. 3. Battlefield Assessment The Russian military has sought to capitalize on its offensive momentum by making a concerted push on the southern Donetsk front. Despite record-high personnel losses, Moscow’s forces have gained territory after seizing Vuhledar in October of this year. After the reported fall of Selydove, Russia’s next objective is the important logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Russian forces have also heightened their offensive activity in Kurakhove. A critical dam was recently destroyed, likely by Russian forces, which will exacerbate flooding in the area. The Ukrainian 46th Brigade is manning the defensive line in the face of growing Russian pressure. The Ukrainian General Staff has also detected heightened Russian military preparations in southern Ukraine, suggesting a large-scale Russian push that could threaten Zaporizhzhia. This effort, combined with ongoing Russian pressure in the east and counteroffensive operations in Kursk, could stretch Ukraine’s military even further. Kyiv is in danger of suffering drastic setbacks on the battlefield unless it can initiate changes with the help of its allies.

Blinken Atrocious In A Dangerous World – OpEd	It is hard to credit one of the least impressive Secretary of States the United States has ever produced with any merit other than being a plasterwork that, from time to time, moved with caution on the world stage for fear of cracking. On the stage, Antony Blinken’s brittle performances have been nothing short of unimpressive, notably in pursuing such projects comically titled 'Peace in the Middle East.' Each time he has ventured to various regions of the world, the combatants seem keener than ever to continue taking up arms or indulging in slaughter. A sense of Blinken’s detachment from the world can be gathered from his Foreign Affairs piece published on October 1, intended as something of a report on the diplomatic achievements of the Biden administration. It starts off with the sermonising treacle that is all a bit much – the naughty states on the world stage, albeit small in number (Russia, Iran, North Korea and China), 'determined to alter the foundational principles of the international system.' The Biden administration had, in response, 'pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad.' This served to counter those challengers wishing to 'undermine the free, open, secure, and prosperous world that the United States and most countries seek.' Then comes the remark that should prompt readers to pinch themselves. 'The Biden administration’s strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago.' An odd assessment for various reasons. There is the continued war in Ukraine and Washington’s refusal to encourage any meaningful talks between Kiev and Moscow, preferring, instead, the continued supply of weapons to an attritive conflict of slaughter and such acts of industrial terrorism as the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline. There has been the relentless watering down of the 'One China' understanding over the status of Taiwan, along with continued provocations against Beijing through the offensive pact of AUKUS with Australia and the UK. That particularly odious pact has served to turn Australia into a US military garrison without the consent of its citizens, an outcome sold to the dunces in Canberra as utterly necessary to arrest the rise of China. Along the way, an arms buildup in the Indo- and Asia-Pacific has been encouraged. With such a view of the world, it’s little wonder how blind Blinken, and other members of the Biden administration, have been to Israel’s own rogue efforts at breaking and altering the international system, committing, along the way, a goodly number of atrocities that have seen it taken to the International Court of Justice by South Africa for committing alleged acts of genocide. Through his various sojourns, the point was always clear. Israel was to be mildly rebuked, if at all, while Hamas was to be given the full chastising treatment as killers without a cause. When the barbarians revolt against their imperial governors, they are to be both feared and reviled. In June this year, for instance, Blinken stated on one of his countless missions for a non-existent peace that Hamas was 'the only obstacle' to a ceasefire, a markedly jaundiced explanation given the broader programs and objects being pursued by the Israeli Defence Forces. Hamas has been accused of being absolutist in its goals, but one can hardly exempt Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the charge. Not for Blinken: 'I think it is clear to everyone around the world, that it’s on them [Hamas] and that they will have made a choice to continue a war that they started.' On the issue of aid to Gaza’s strangled, dying population, Blinken has been, along with his equally ineffectual colleague in the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, cringingly ineffective. Their October 13 letter sent to their Israeli counterparts made mention of several demands, including the entry of some 350 aid trucks into Gaza on a daily basis, and refraining from adopting laws, now in place, banning the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Each demand has been swatted back with a school child’s snotty petulance, and aid continues being blocked to various parts of Gaza. On October 24, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action (AJP Action) 'urgently' called on the Secretary of State 'to stop wasting his time with failed diplomatic visits and to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.' Those at AJP Action must surely have realised by now that Blinken would be utterly rudderless without those failed visits. Indeed, Osama Abu Irshaid, Executive Director of the organisation, went so far as to say that 'Blinken’s diplomatic theatre is enabling Netanyahu’s war crimes.' To arm and fund Israel 'while requesting a ceasefire' was a policy both 'hypocritical and ineffective.' Such is the nature of that sort of theatre. In the meantime, the tectonic plates of international relations are moving in other directions, a point that has been aided, not hindered, by the policy of this administration. Through BRICS and other satellite fora, the United States is finding itself gradually outpaced and isolated, even as it continues to hide behind the slogan of an international rules-based order it did so much to create. This is not to say that the US imperium has quite reached its terminus. If anything, the Biden administration, through the good offices of Blinken, continues to insist on its vitality. But US hegemony long left unchallenged is, most certainly, at an end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkVSH0qoyici	2024-11-14T16:38:16-08:00	
Biden’s Legacy: Handing A Resurgent American Empire To Trump – Op...	One of the lasting legacies of U.S. President Joe Biden will be that he reinvigorated the American empire despite the risk of an increasingly authoritarian Donald Trump returning to lead it. Over the past four years, President Biden has continually ignored criticisms of U.S. empire and the dangers it poses to the world to direct the empire’s expansion. He has overseen the enlargement of NATO, the exploitation of Ukraine to weaken Russia, a military buildup in the Indo-Pacific to encircle China, and the backing of Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East. To this day, the Biden administration boasts about its imperial maneuvers, even with the knowledge that a far more dangerous Trump administration will soon be in a position to exploit U.S. imperial power for its own purposes. 'I think we’ve done remarkable things,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin marveled on November 7, two days after the election. 'We were able to manage challenges and resources—and I think that put us in a pretty good place.' Rebooting the Empire When President Biden first entered office in January 2021, one of his top priorities was to restore the global American empire from the chaos of the first Trump administration. Seizing upon the imperial trope of the United States as an organizer of the international system, Biden spoke about the need for the United States to restore order to a chaotic world. 'We are the organizing principle for the rest of the world,' Biden said in 2022. Despite some initial failures, including the collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan, the Biden administration achieved many of its imperial goals, such as the revitalization of U.S. alliances, a major strategic advantage of the United States over its rivals. Trump has repeatedly asserted that the United States is a nation in decline, seizing upon President Biden’s cognitive decline and some of his imperial failures to insist that the United States is no longer respected. Soon, however, he will find himself in a position to lead a resurgent empire. After all, the Biden administration spent the past four years rebooting the American empire, bolstering U.S. imperial power while making some its most brazen moves in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East. The Transatlantic System The Biden administration has significantly reinforced U.S. power in Europe. Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed a major challenge to the U.S.-led transatlantic system, the Biden administration has turned the situation to its advantage. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the Biden administration has worked to enlarge and empower NATO, bringing more countries into the alliance while increasing its spending on military operations. There are now more than 100,000 U.S. soldiersstationed across Europe, the largest number since the mid-2000s. The Biden administration has also taken advantage of the war to weaken Russia. By arming the Ukrainian resistance and imposing powerful sanctions on the Russian economy, the United States has led a concerted effort to entangle Russia in a quagmire. The administration’s basic approach has been to provide Ukraine with enough military assistance to hold its positions against Russia but not enough to push Russia out of the country. According to Austin, the primary reason why Ukrainian soldiers have been able to keep fighting is 'because we have provided them the security assistance to be able to do it.' Despite the approximately one million casualties on both sides, administration officials have insisted upon maintaining their approach, prioritizing their goal of making the war into a strategic failure for Russia over the ideal of safeguarding the security and sovereignty of Ukraine. 'What we’ve witnessed and I think what the world has witnessed is a declining superpower in Russia making one of its last-ditch unlawful efforts to go in and seize territory,' State Department official Richard Verma said in September. 'This is really a declining power in so many ways and frankly not a very effective military power.' The Transpacific System While the Biden administration has strengthened the U.S. position in Europe, it has also reinforced the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific. Even as China has pushed back against the U.S.-led transpacific system, especially in the South China Sea, the United States has strengthened many of its advantages over China. One of the Biden administration’s major moves has been to build out the U.S. hub-and-spoke model, the U.S.-led imperial structure that keeps the United States positioned as the dominant hub of the Pacific. Not only has the administration fortified the spokes, or the U.S. allies and partners that encircle China, but it has facilitated multilateral cooperation among the spokes, mainly by working through the Quad and other regional groupings. In a related move, the Biden administration has intensified U.S. military operations across the region. An estimated 375,000 U.S. soldiers and civilian personnel now operate across the Indo-Pacific, forming the highest concentration of U.S. military service members in a region that extends beyond the United States. 'In the Indo-Pacific, I think we are seeing a resurgent United States,' Defense Department official Ely Ratner commented last year. Complementing its military moves, the Biden administration has bolstered U.S. economic power. As it has worked to decouple China from multiple sectors of the U.S. economy, it has spearheaded the formation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which reinforces the U.S. position as the center of economic power in the Pacific. 'Contrary to the predictions that the PRC would overtake the United States in GDP either in this decade or the next, since President Biden took office, the United States has more than doubled our lead,' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted in October. The Middle East Of all the signs of a resurgent American empire, however, perhaps none is more telling than U.S. action in the Middle East. Over the past year, the Biden administration has made it clear that the United States is more capable than ever to spread havoc and destruction across the region. Since Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack against Israel, the Biden administration has openly backed Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East, all with little consequence for the United States. The Arab states in the region may have once countered Israel by going to war or organizing oil embargoes against the United States, but they have done little to deter the United States from backing Israel’s military operations. In fact, the Arab states are now more likely to come to Israel’s defense, just as they did when they helped Israel counter Iran’s missile attacks in April and October. The Biden administration may sometimes criticize Israel for how it has conducted its military operations, especially given the fact that Israel has laid waste to Gaza, but through it all, administration officials have been quietly satisfied with how they have enabled Israel to conduct military operations without facing any major retaliation. The Biden administration’s imperial management of the region demonstrates that the United States is now so powerful that it can unleash its strategic asset on the Middle East without having to engage in a wider war. 'I think we’ve done a magnificent job there,' Austin mused earlier this month, taking pride in U.S. imperial achievements while displaying little concern for the people of Gaza or the Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas. The Future under Trump As the Biden administration has recharged the American empire, it has never stopped to question its actions. Not even internal dissent within the State Department and other federal agencies over the administration’s complicity in the destruction of Gaza has led to any kind of reckoning over the manner in which it has employed imperial violence around the world. Perhaps most telling has been the Biden administration’s response to charges that Trump is a fascist. Top administration officials have agreed with the assessments, some made by leading scholars of fascism and others issued by former high-level officials in the first Trump administration. But leaders in the Biden administration have never questioned their belief that they must do everything they can to strengthen the U.S. empire. Rather than considering what it would mean for a fascist to take control of the most powerful empire in the world, the Biden administration has spent more time considering how to ensure the empire’s survival. In recent months, one of its top priorities has been to 'Trump-proof' the empire, meaning that administration officials are searching for ways to ensure that U.S. imperial structures survive the chaos of a second Trump presidency. Now that Trump’s re-election is here, however, the Biden administration is facing a far more disturbing reality. President Biden’s legacy will be the handover of a resurgent American empire to 'the most dangerous person' in America, all with dire implications not just for the people who are targets of Trump’s wrath but for the many people around the world who are victims of U.S. imperial practices.

Myanmar’s Rare Earth Revolution: A Geopolitical Gamechanger – OpE...	As President-elect Donald Trump assembles his new administration, a complex geopolitical chess game is unfolding in Myanmar. The intersection of rare earth minerals, a protracted civil war, and shifting global alliances has created a perfect storm that demands immediate attention from Washington. This situation not only presents a critical foreign policy challenge but also offers a unique opportunity to reshape the balance of power in Southeast Asia. Recent developments have dramatically altered the landscape of Myanmar's rare earth industry and its global impact. Myanmar has emerged as the world's largest supplier of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), surpassing even China in exports. Last year, Myanmar exported approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REOs) from ion-adsorption clays to China, far exceeding China's domestic IAC mining quota of 19,000 tons. This positions Myanmar as the leading global exporter of heavy REOs, with its exports accounting for as much as 50% of the global heavy rare earths supply. The situation has been further complicated by recent events in Myanmar's ongoing civil war. The opposition forces in Myanmar have made remarkable gains throughout the country, particularly in areas controlled by ethnic armed organizations. Operation 1027, launched in October 2023 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, marked a turning point in the conflict. This coordinated offensive saw resistance forces capture over 500 military outposts and several key towns, dealing a severe blow to the military junta's control and morale. In a significant development, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) seized control of the country's rare earth mining region in mid-October 2024. The KIA took over a leading mining center that includes production sites in Pang War, Chipwi, Phimaw, and Hsawlaw. This takeover has effectively halted mining operations, disrupting the global supply chain and prompting China to impose a trade embargo on Myanmar. The National Unity Government, an anti-junta body that oversees many of the newer civilian groups, claims that junta opponents now control 60% of the country. While this control remains largely peripheral, the resistance's success has been unprecedented. The junta faces a range of serious problems, including declining morale, defections, a failure to recruit enough people to keep the army's size stable, and terrible conditions for soldiers. China's role in this conflict is crucial and complex. While China controls nearly 90% of global rare earth processing capacity, it has effectively outsourced much of its extraction to Myanmar. Beijing has consistently promoted sham elections and forced ceasefires that ultimately benefit the military junta. However, China's approach is primarily driven by its strategic interests, including access to Myanmar's natural resources and its crucial geographic position for China's Belt and Road Initiative with ocean access from landlocked western China. Given these developments, it is imperative for the United States to seize this moment and increase its support for Myanmar's resistance rather than making unsustainable deals with the military junta like China is doing. The reasons are compelling, ranging from advancing democracy to securing strategic geopolitical gains and addressing humanitarian imperatives. President-elect Trump's recent cabinet nominations signal a hardening stance on China and a renewed focus on securing America's supply chains. Senator Marco Rubio, the incoming Secretary of State, has long been a vocal critic of China's dominance in the rare earth market. He was also a staunch advocate for democracy in Burma. Senator Marco Rubio has deep concerns about China's control of the world's rare earth supply and wrote several articles and introduced legislations about rare earths and China. Links to these are provided in the references following the article. Representative Michael Waltz, set to become National Security Adviser, brings his military background as a Green Beret veteran and hawkish views on China to the table. Waltz's appointment suggests a continued focus on countering Chinese influence. Representative Mike Waltz has been a vocal and active opponent of China across multiple fronts. As a member of the House China Task Force, he has proposed legislation to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese minerals and protect American universities from espionage. Waltz has consistently criticized China's control over critical supply chains, its military expansion, and investments in U.S. industries. He has condemned China's human rights abuses, called for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and described the U.S.-China relationship as a 'cold war.' Waltz's actions and statements reflect a strong stance against China's growing influence, advocating for policies that prioritize countering the China threat in U.S. foreign policy. Representative Elise Stefanik, nominated as UN Ambassador, rounds out a foreign policy team that seems poised to challenge the status quo. She is the No. 4 House Republican and a staunch Trump ally. She is in the Congressional Chinese Task Force, the armed forces committee and the intelligence committee. Representative Elise Stefanik has taken numerous legislative actions against China, focusing on national security, economic concerns, and human rights. She has introduced bills like the 'Confronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Act' to sanction entities involved in human rights abuses, the 'End College Chinese Communist Partnerships Act' to limit Chinese influence in American universities, and the 'Countering CCP Drones Act' to prohibit Chinese drone operations on U.S. communications infrastructure. Stefanik has also co-sponsored legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese military-affiliated companies and worked to remove Confucius Institutes from U.S. universities. Additionally, she has been involved in efforts to protect American patient data from Chinese biotechnology companies and has advocated for transparency in agreements with China, particularly regarding the WHO. In the Senate, John Thune from South Dakota has been elected as the new Senate Republican leader, succeeding Mitch McConnell. This position is crucial as it will involve working closely with the incoming Trump administration on legislative matters, including foreign policy initiatives. Senator John Thune has taken several actions against China. He co-introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senator Angus King to challenge China's self-designation as a developing country at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This resolution aims to reform WTO rules to prevent economically advanced countries like China from exploiting developing country status for unfair trade advantages. Thune has also advocated for strengthening U.S. national security and economic competitiveness to counter China's influence. He emphasizes the importance of passing timely defense authorization bills, investing in military capabilities, and developing a robust trade policy to compete with China's growing economic and strategic influence. Additionally, Thune supports initiatives to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals and energy resources. This new administration has an opportunity to set a new course – one that secures America's technological future while also championing sustainable practices and human rights. The window of opportunity for impactful U.S. involvement in Myanmar is now. By supporting Myanmar's Spring Revolution, the United States can reaffirm its commitment to democracy, gain strategic advantages in a crucial region, and potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. As we enter what Rubio calls 'an era of pragmatic foreign policy,' this pragmatism must extend to addressing the complex situation in Myanmar, balancing strategic interests with ethical considerations and long-term regional stability. The time for decisive action is now – the U.S. must not miss this historic opportunity to make a significant impact in Myanmar and beyond, while also securing its own interests in the critical rare earth mineral supply chain. Supporting the resistance, rather than making deals with a weakening military junta, is not just the right thing to do – it's the smart thing to do for America's long-term strategic interests.

Robert Reich: Matt Gaetz As AG Would Be Laughable If It Weren’t S...	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as America’s next attorney general. This would be laughable were it not so utterly dangerous. Gaetz as attorney general would all but guarantee that Trump weaponizes the Justice Department against his enemies — past, present, and future. Ever since Trump was first indicted, Gaetz has been defending him — alleging that the prosecutions of Trump were politically motivated, that Joe Biden was behind them, charging the Biden administration with vindictiveness toward Trump, and asserting that Trump would have every right to engage in similar vengeance toward Trump’s political enemies. In making these bogus claims, Gaetz has often used identical language to Trump’s wildly partisan and incendiary claims. I worked in the Justice Department in the years following Richard Nixon’s attempt to use the department to prosecute and intimidate Nixon’s enemies. To restore faith and trust in the department, President Gerald Ford appointed Edward Levi as attorney general. Before his appointment, Levi had been dean of the University of Chicago Law School and president of the University of Chicago. One of Levi’s most important accomplishments was to insulate the Department of Justice from political interference by establishing a set of rules that prevented the White House from privately contacting an attorney general or any other Justice Department officials. How far we’ve fallen. Gaetz, a 42-year-old congressman from Florida, has zero qualifications for being the highest law enforcement official in the land. He has never been a government attorney, never been a judge, never taught law or burnished his legal standing in any way. Quite the contrary. Gaetz is now under investigation by the House Ethics Committee in connection with a sex-trafficking scandal. (The Justice Department investigated Gaetz for his alleged involvement with a girl who was 17 at the time to determine if he paid for sex in violation of federal sex-trafficking laws, but it closed the investigation last year after career prosecutors were reportedly unsure about the credibility of two central witnesses.) If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department’s more than 100,000 employees at a time when Trump’s allies are demanding a purge of career DOJ staffers who may have opposed some of Trump’s efforts during his first term or worked on cases involving Trump or his supporters. Gaetz has defended Trump at every turn, arguing that Trump has never violated any federal laws. Gaetz voted with about 150 of his Republican colleagues to overturn Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. He also participated in what federal prosecutors have characterized as a rehearsal for 'Stop the Steal' efforts — protesting the results of a hotly contested Senate race in Florida with members of the Proud Boys and other Trump loyalists. After Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Gaetz was defiant. 'We’re ashamed of nothing,' he said publicly. In other words, nominating Gaetz to be attorney general is only slightly less absurd than nominating Vladimir Putin to be secretary of defense. The key question is whether Gaetz can be confirmed by a Republican Senate. Two key Republican moderates have already indicated they would likely vote against him. Senator Susan Collins said she was 'shocked' by the nomination; Senator Lisa Murkowski said he was not a serious contender for the job. But Senator Lindsey Graham — currently the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a reliable weather vane for the unscrupulous — said he was surprised Trump picked Gaetz, whom he called 'clever,' and predicted Gaetz would face 'tough questions' at his confirmation hearing. But Graham also said he was inclined to support presidential appointments. Gaetz’s nomination is really a test by Trump of how far he can go intimidating, bullying, and generating fear among Senate Republicans. No Senate Democrat will vote for Gaetz, so Trump and his allies are viewing the Gaetz nomination as a test of loyalty to Trump. This will be the clearest signal yet of whether Republican senators are ready to do Trump’s bidding on all sorts of sensitive issues, including cutting back Social Security and giving Putin what he wants in Ukraine. If Trump can get 51 votes for Gaetz, he can get a Senate majority for just about anything Trump wants to do.

What Should President Trump Do Once He’s In Office? – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen A few months ago I wrote a piece for FEE on Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei. Milei took on the presidency of Argentina with a particularly pressing challenge: government overspending was driving out-of-control money creation and its by-product—inflation. Milei’s goal was explicit. He promised to cut government largesse. In my article, I argued that his success in doing so would be entirely dependent on his ability to cut down the bureaucracy. To quote the article: Bureaus have no incentive to stop unsustainable spending habits like we have seen in Argentina. If anything, their existence requires them to prevent reforms that take from their agendas and budgets. There is still work to be done. As noted at the beginning of the piece, this is really just the first step in eliminating the bureaucratic bloat. But it is a necessary first step. In the United States, we find ourselves in a less urgent situation. Inflation has caused serious distress and harm for some, but our inflation rate is nowhere near the likes of Argentina. However, it is clear that the US is trending in the wrong direction with respect to government spending. The growth of the United States debt accelerated after Covid and is reaching dizzying levels. If the United States is unable to rein in spending, a future characterized by hyperinflation the likes of Argentina seems likely. What should the newly elected President Trump do to prevent this? To answer this question, we’re going to borrow wisdom from a group of thinkers dubbed the Late Scholastics. This was a group of Catholic thinkers from the 16th and 17th centuries who advised royalty and businessmen in their economic dealings. Much of what I write here will be drawn from Faith and Liberty: The Economic Thought of the Late Scholastics by Alejandro A. Chafuen. Although the Scholastics were situated in the setting of monarchy, their proposals for reining in government over-spending were targeted at the executive, and, in that sense, their advice is entirely applicable to the US president. The Late Scholastics coalesced around three proposals. Let’s look at each one. Proposal 1: Canning the Court First, Late Scholastic scholars advised monarchs to shrink the size of their 'courts.' The court was a group of the executive’s advisors, similar to our president’s cabinet today. For this advice on shrinking the court, we can turn to Late Scholastic thinker Pedro Fernández Navarrete. Chafuen highlights that Navarrete did not merely recommend stopping the growth of the court; he believed in actively shrinking it. In Navarrete’s words: …[it is not sufficient] to prevent future enlargement of the royal court. We need to clean it up and purge it of its present excess of hangers-on. People may say that this is an extreme suggestion since the court supports so many people, but the disease has become so grave and so evident that we have no excuse not to employ the remedy. These 'hangers-on' in the court generated demand for the king to increase spending, but added very little. As a result, spending grew, and taxes and currency debasement along with it. Our modern bureaucrats are no different. Chafuen points out how Navarrete compares this to bloodletting. You may lose some good blood (good bureaucrats), but it is necessary to do so in order to lose the bad blood (bad bureaucrats). Similar to Milei, if Trump is serious about dealing with our debt, cutting the bureaucratic fat should be the first goal on the table. It seemed unlikely that we would have gotten this sort of policy from the left. Joe Biden drew controversy recently by claiming that Donald Trump should be locked up… politically (whatever that means). In his comments which immediately preceded this claim, Biden was lamenting Trump’s Supreme Court immunity decision and, right before that, he expressed worry about Trump cutting bureaucracy. President Biden said of Trump, 'He is talking about doing away with the entire Department of Education… This is the guy who also wants to replace every civil servant—every single one.' It seems that removing executive bureaucracies and bureaucrats would be within the rights of the executive, but, if Biden is any indication, we wouldn’t have seen a President Harris exercising that authority. Trump, as of now, seems poised to do this. He has already said he is working on closing up the Department of Education in Washington DC (though it’s unclear if he is talking about ending the department entirely or just reorganizing and relocating it). If Trump follows through on this promise, made by many-a-republican before him, it will be a sign he is taking this advice seriously. Proposal 2: Sacrificing Subsidies The second proposal is a little more straightforward but still important. Late Scholastic thinker Juan de Mariana argued that the king should cut back on subsidizing private interests. Chafuen chronicles Mariana’s list of worries which included spending on 'public prizes… pensions, benefits, and offices.' The subsidization of pensions and retirement in general is not a foreign worry for the US. A significant amount of tax revenue goes to keeping Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems afloat. Over one-fifth of government spending goes to Social Security. The program has grown so expensive that within the next two decades it will run out of money, forcing either a benefit decrease or a tax increase. This is to say nothing of the corporate bailouts and Covid stimulus subsidies we’ve come to accept over the last few years. Meanwhile, many are agitating for more bailouts in the form of loan forgiveness of various kinds. Finally, private subsidies are given in large amounts to the industry we’ll discuss in our last proposal: the military-industrial complex. Proposal 3: Pursuing Peace The final proposal we’ll cover, also from Mariana, is that the king should stop pursuing 'unnecessary wars and nonessential enterprises.' It’s long been recognized that 'war is the health of the state.' War funnels private tax dollars to special interest groups, who in return support hawkish politicians. Wars also create a large class of bureaucrats who, as we discussed, generate more demand for foreign intervention. The United States has nearly 800 military bases across the world. The two decades of military intervention that followed the 9/11 attacks have cost the US an estimated $9 trillion. That’s more than a quarter of our national debt. The common theme throughout history is that great military powers tend to over-extend their empires. This over-extension both generates multiple fronts of conflict and creates resource stresses at home which are by and large borne by the citizens. President John Quincy Adams (son of founding father John Adams) summed up America’s commitment to freedom and to the citizenry well in a speech to the US House in 1821: Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. If Trump is serious about tackling our spending problem, he needs to get serious about the modern tendency of spending our resources searching for, fighting, and even creating monsters abroad. No country can afford to be the policeman for all other countries, nor is such a job compatible with America’s foundational liberal values. It’s my hope that Trump will finally break the cycle of ignoring our looming debt issues. The proposals of the Late Scholastics would be a great place to start.

How Targeting UN Could Harm Israel’s Own Interests – OpEd	The recent Israeli measures against the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)—including two controversial bills to ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli territory and areas under Israel’s control—are certainly a distressing development. In the early years of Israel’s statehood, after its 1948 establishment, Israel’s UN membership was held up for two years due to unresolved questions around the status of displaced Palestinians. The United Nations was still quite young when it passed Resolution 194, which recognized the rights of Palestinian refugees to return home and receive compensation for their losses—a commitment that has influenced rounds of talks over the decades. Since then, this resolution has been a pivotal point in discussions between Palestinians and Israelis. Palestinians have continued to demand that Israel acknowledge its role in this forced displacement and provide compensation, seeing it not only as a matter of historical fact but as an overdue moral obligation. Today, Israel’s treatment of UNRWA reflects the chronic tension between its own state objectives and a humanitarian question the UN has never abandoned. Israel’s recent actions raise pricking questions about its commitment to that international consensus and the lingering need for accountability in this conflict. The United States, in order to address the dire conditions faced by Palestinian refugees along Israel’s borders, played a major role in establishing UNRWA in 1950. This agency, originally backed by substantial American funding, became a critical lifeline for Palestinian refugees across the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, continuously serving a population that is now almost six million. Since its inception, UNRWA has remained a purely humanitarian outfit in every sense, focused solely on delivering essential services such as education, food, medical care, and fuel to a community facing immense hardship. However, this lifeline faced a serious setback during the Trump administration, which squeezed U.S. contributions. Biden, due to mounting pressure from pro-Israel factions in Congress, partly upheld this a stance . The funding gap has emboldened Israel’s right-wing extremist leaders to diminish the significance of the Palestinian refugee crisis in global discourse. Obviously, without UNRWA, Palestinians risk losing their most vital support system, which provides stability in an otherwise precarious situation. Although UNRWA operates strictly within its UN mandate, its mere presence has become a focal point in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the years, Israel’s supporters have worked to erode the agency’s reputation, urging major contributors to withhold funding or, in some cases, presenting dubious claims about UNRWA’s operations. The accusation that UNRWA staff were somehow complicit in Hamas’ attacks on October 7 was promptly investigated by a special UN committee. The findings were unequivocal: no evidence linked UNRWA staff to any wrongdoing. The inquiry exposed and rebutted Israel’s baseless allegations. The UN inquiry divulged that Israel hadn’t provided names or credible information to substantiate these allegations. In fact, UNRWA had been requesting such details from Israel since 2011, with no response. This episode has exposed the continued challenges faced by UNRWA in executing its mandate amidst politicized pressure from Israel. In a stunning turn of events on October 28, Israel’s Knesset overwhelmingly voted to ban the UNRWA from operating within Israel, with 92 out of 120 members supporting the move. In a second measure, 87 Knesset members also approved a ban on Israeli state authorities interacting with UNRWA, effectively hobbling its capacity to operate in the Occupied Territories. This week, foreign ministers from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the UK warned of the 'devastating consequences' this ban could unleash across the West Bank and Gaza. Shortly before this, in another blatant display of brutal aggression, Israeli authorities seized the land in East Jerusalem housing UNRWA’s headquarters, reportedly to construct 1,440 new settlement units. This move contravenes international law. The timing and audacity of these actions have left the international community grappling with a troubling reality. Israel’s plans to dismantle the very mechanisms designed to support and assist vulnerable Palestinians will not only aggravate the humanitarian crisis but also deepen the operational problems for the agency. In choosing to silence the very agency tasked with aiding displaced Palestinians, Israel is seriously damaging its own legitimacy on the global stage. In so doing, Israel is actually strengthening the case of those who question that very legitimacy. Ironically, in attempting to erase the presence of Palestinian refugees from its landscape, Israel’s actions could very well enhance the visibility of that issue.

Middle East Reacts To Trump’s Dalliance With Zionism – OpEd	The election victory of Donald Trump in the November 5 election is being perceived in the West Asian region with growing anxiety as presaging the US aligning one hundred percent with the Zionist project for Greater Israel. Although Trump has kept out vociferous neocons from his government positions, the same cannot be said for pro-Zionist figures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims he has spoken three times with Trump already since the election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' The 'components' implies that Netanyahu hopes to get a blank cheque from Trump to accelerate the ethnic cleansing in Gaza, for annexation of West Bank, violent reprisals against Palestinians and, most important, to carry the war right into Iranian territory. Three events in as many days this week show the first signs of a backlash building up. On Monday, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei gave Tehran’s first official reaction to Trump’s election victory. Baqaei took a nuanced line saying, 'What matters to us in this region is the United States’ actual behaviour and policies regarding Iran and the broader West Asia.' Notably, Baqaei expressed 'cautious optimism that the new [Trump] administration might adopt a more peace-oriented approach, reduce regional hostilities, and uphold its commitments.' (Tehran Times) Baqaei also refuted the recent allegation by Washington that Iran was involved in plots to assassinate Trump. He called the Biden Administration’s allegation as 'nothing more than an attempt to sabotage relations' between Tehran and Washington by 'laying traps to complicate the path for the next administration.' Baqaei also held out an assurance to the incoming US administration that Tehran firmly adheres to a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He announced that Rafael Grossi, head of International Atomic Energy (IAEA) was due to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday night. Taken together, Baqaei’s remarks suggest that Iran hopes there’s still daylight possible between Trump and Netanyahu. The clincher here would have been the remark that Trump slipped into his victory speechwith great deliberation on November 6 that 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars.' Trump was on record during his election campaign that 'I don’t want to do damage to Iran but they cannot have nuclear weapons.' Tehran’s consultations with Grossi responds to Trump’s concern. This is smart thinking. Iran’s non-provocative stance would mean there is no alibi for attacking Iran. That said, however, the 'known unknown' still remains — namely, Iran’s retaliation to the Israeli attack on October 26. On November 2, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a video released by Iranian state media, promised 'a crushing response' to Israeli attack. Conceivably, the period till January 20 when Trump is sworn in, is going to be critical. Meanwhile, this week witnessed that Iran and Saudi Arabia have given verve to their detente, which is now manifesting as Riyadh’s solidarity and open support for Iran in its growing confrontation with Israel. Amidst the growing tensions in the region, the chief of staff of Saudi Arabia’s armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on November 10 and met with his Iranian counterpart General Mohammad Bagheri. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke on the phonewith Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone in the context of a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) – Arab League in Riyadh on November 11-12. Iran has extended an invitation to MbS to visit Tehran! Two hugely significant highlights of the Riyadh summit have been, first, the Saudi prince’s inaugural address where he warned Israel against hitting Iran. This marked a historic turn by Riyadh toward Tehran-Israeli conflict, and away from US-supported normalisation with Jerusalem. MbS told the summit that the international community should oblige Israel 'to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands.' Again, Saudi Arabia accused Israel for the first time of committing 'genocide' in Gaza. MbS told the leaders who gathered in Riyadh, that the kingdom renewed 'its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people…' Trump has been put on notice that he’s meeting a radically different geopolitical landscape in West Asia compared to his first term as president. The Trump transition team is keeping its cards close, offering NatSec Daily a boilerplate statement that Trump will take 'necessary action' to 'lead our country' and 'restore peace through strength.' But warning bells are ringing. The key pillars of Trump’s 'maximum pressure' strategy against Tehran — isolating Iran and ramping up economic pressure while maintaining a credible threat of military force as deterrent — have become wobbly. On the other hand, the massive Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1 and the colossal failure of the Israeli air strike on Iran twenty-six days later convey a loud message all across West Asia that Israel is no longer the dominant military power it used to be — and there is a new sheriff in town. Trump will have to navigate the fallout of both sides of this issue with diminished US diplomatic and geopolitical capital at his disposal. Meanwhile, Tehran is also deepening its cooperation with Russia, which adds a giant new Ukraine-sized complexity to Trump’s Iran policy. While in Eurasia, the US has allies, Trump is navigating in West Asia pretty much alone. The US’ stark isolation comes home dramatically by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s announcement on Wednesday that Turkey, a NATO member country, has severed all ties with Israel. Erdogan disclosed this to journalists aboard his plane after visiting Saudi Arabia. A regional trend to ostracise Israel is visible now and it is destined to expand and deepen. The summit in Riyadh witnessed the African Union joining hands with the Arab League and OIC to sign a tripartite agreement on Tuesday to establish a mechanism to support the Palestinian cause, which will be coordinated through the three organisations’ secretariats as a game changer to strengthen their influence in international forums. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan noted that the three organisations will now onward speak with one voice internationally. Even as the summit concluded in Riyadh, Crown Prince Salman had a call on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin readout stated that the two leaders 'reaffirmed their commitment to continue the consistent expansion' of Russian-Saudi ties and specifically 'stressed the importance of continuing close coordination within OPEC Plus and stated the effectiveness and timeliness of the steps being taken in this format to ensure balance on the global energy market.' On the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Kremlin readout noted with satisfaction that 'the principled approaches of Russia and Saudi Arabia with regard to the Middle East settlement are essentially identical.' MbS’ initiative to re-invigorate his conversation with Putin can only be seen against the backdrop of the profound misgivings in Riyadh regarding the Trump-Netanyahu bromance and the spectre of a possible regional war haunting the region stemming out of Israel drawing encouragement from the seamless US support expected through the coming 4-year period for the Zionist cause.

West Repeating Error Of 1980s And Overrating Moscow’s Strength An...	In the 1980s, Western governments and experts overrated both the strength and likely longevity of the Soviet Union, with many assuming it would survive and perhaps even prosper over at least several decades. Now, Peter Zashev says, their successors are making a similar mistake about Putin’s Russia. In fact, the Russian scholar now at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga says, 'Putin’s Russia is weak, even very weak,' despite the bluffing Moscow has once again used with such success to convince the West otherwise (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/12/sploshnoi-blef-i-bravada-rossiya-putina-slaba-ochen-slaba-a147419). Now just as at the end of Soviet times, Zashev says, many in the West are failing to see this and making miscalculations as a result. In reality, he continues, 'the Putin regime has many weak points, and they are not some Achilles’ heel but rather other parts of the body politic, much larger' and therefore much for likely to kick in sooner than most expect. To make his point, Zashev lists four such weak points: the absence of an ideology, Putin’s inability to gain support unless he pays for it, Putin’s constant need to display his strength which in the nature of things ultimately leads to overreaching and defeat, and an economy that looks superficially strong but in fact is riven with problems. First of all, he argues, Putin’s Russia 'simply doesn’t have an ideology. Instead, it offers a strange, unnatural and rather perverse mixture of Orthodoxy, Stalinism, anti-Americanism, militarism, Sovietism' and much else besides. What is on offer is intended to cover but in fact calls attention to the fact that 'no one loves Putin unless they are paid to do so.' To conceal that reality, Zashev continues, Putin must constantly show himself to be powerful enough to win everything he gets involved with; but at present, he can’t even defend Kursk Oblast let alone take Kyiv, he can’t defend Russia’s airports or oil dumps and everyone can see that. He will try to create situations in which he can win, but he won’t be able to. The reason is the fourth weak point of the Putin system, the economy. It is just treading water now but is falling ever further behind the rest of the world in terms of innovation and modernization. And that creates a situation in which the entire system can become unbalanced and then collapse. Zashev concludes: 'The system appears to be working so far, but the example of the USSR should remind us how easily such a system can become unbalanced and what its suddent and rapid destruction this will lead to: – and more than that, that 'the end will come much faster than we can imagine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CmXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-14T16:04:45-08:00	
How Does Marco Rubio, Trump’s Pick For Secretary Of State, See Th...	By Todd Prince and Tony Wesolowsky (RFE/RL) -- President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Senator Marco Rubio to be his top diplomat as the incoming administration prepares to navigate an increasingly perilous world, with wars raging in Europe and the Middle East and competition heating up with China in the Asia-Pacific. In choosing Rubio -- a senator known for taking a tough line on many foreign policy issues -- the president-elect is seeking someone who largely shares his views on the most pressing international topics, says Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'Rubio is someone who has ideological and political alignment with Trump on several key national-security issues like great-power competition, countering China, countering the Islamic [Republic of] Iran, and reinstating the maximum-pressure campaign,' Taleblu told RFE/RL. In a wide-ranging interview last week with media before being tapped as secretary of state, Rubio said the decades-long period of unchallenged U.S. global dominance following the collapse of the Soviet Union had ended, replaced by a new Cold War-like era. He warned that the United States can't stretch itself too thin with global commitments, saying Washington must be 'pragmatic' in its pursuits abroad. 'We're the most powerful [country], but we too have limited resources…so we have to invest both our time and our money on things that serve our core national interest,' Rubio said in a November 7 interview with EWTN, a U.S.-based cable network. Rubio, a Cuban-American, played an influential role in shaping Trump's policy on Venezuela during the latter's first term as president from 2017 to 2021. The New York Times described Rubio at the time as Trump's 'virtual secretary of state for Latin America.' The three-time Florida senator, who challenged Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, comes to the job with ample foreign policy experience, having served on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. If ultimately confirmed by the Senate, Rubio, 53, would be the first Latino to serve as secretary of state. And while Latin America will certainly be an important focus for Rubio, it will take a back seat to more pressing U.S. foreign policy concerns, namely China's global rise, Iran's threat to the Middle East, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Priority No. 1: China When it comes to demands on U.S. military, political, and financial resources, Rubio wants the focus to be on China. 'I think the future of the 21st century is going to largely be defined by what happens in the Indo-Pacific. And I think China would love for us to be bogged down in Europe in a conflict and not focused on what's happening in the Indo-Pacific,' Rubio said on November 7. Rubio, who served as a co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, has consistently advocated taking a hard line on China. He led efforts to arm Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing. He called for direct shipments of U.S. munitions and advanced military technologies in hopes of deterring China from attacking the island. Rubio has also been vocal about Beijing's human rights record, pushed for a U.S. industrial policy to better compete with China, and backed tariffs on Chinese goods. He sought to ban imports of Chinese goods made with forced labor by Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in western China and prevent China from circumventing Trump-era tariffs by relocating production to Mexico. NATO And Ukraine Rubio has repeatedly supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in its defensive war against Russia and described Ukrainians as 'incredibly brave and strong.' In February 2022, immediately following Russia's full-scale invasion, he co-sponsored the NYET Act in the Senate, which aimed to 'bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities' and impose sanctions on Russia. However, Rubio has also said Russia's war against Ukraine has reached a 'stalemate' and 'needs to be brought to a conclusion.' He was among a minority of senators who, earlier this year, opposed a foreign-assistance bill that included $60 billion in aid for Ukraine. The bill eventually passed in April, bringing total U.S. aid to Ukraine since February 2022 to almost $175 billion -- about as much given by all of Europe combined. Rubio has highlighted that imbalance, emphasizing that Washington should push Europe to take a larger role in handling its own security issues in order to allow the United States to prioritize challenging China in the Indo-Pacific. In last week's interview with EWTN, Rubio said it was 'unrealistic' to expect the United States to approve tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine every 10 months. He said European members of NATO need to step up their contributions to the alliance. 'Every day in our own country, [we are] grappling with [the question of] how do we provide assistance to Americans, even as we have these defense requirements that we're spending a lot of money on, and these [European NATO] countries are not making that choice,' he said. While Rubio sees Russia as a threat to U.S. security and backs Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, he said Kyiv will have to negotiate an end to the war. Rubio said Russia has just too many resources at its disposal, including weapons and men, to allow it to continue the fighting despite suffering extraordinary losses. Iran: 'No Appeasement' In the Middle East, Rubio has long taken a tough stand on Iran, describing its theocratic government as a 'terrorist regime' for financing groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, both designated terrorist organizations by the United States. As a senator, he was a fierce critic of U.S. President Barack Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), which restricted Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Critics of the deal argued it empowered Iran, offering too much relief from sanctions without guarantees it wouldn't someday produce a nuclear bomb. In 2018, Trump, who was then president, pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. More recently, Rubio co-authored three bills punishing Iran that were signed into law this year. The bills authorize placing sanctions on Iranian oil exports and top Iranian leaders for human rights abuses, as well as foreign entities and governments supporting Hamas. An Iranian client, Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, triggering a regional war that threatens to engulf more states. Rubio in September criticized the Biden administration for dragging its feet on enforcing the Iranian oil sanctions, which are aimed at crippling the government's finances. It has also failed to move forward on the human rights sanctions. Depending on what the incoming administration is faced with in Iran when it takes office, analyst Taleblu says -- noting the volatile situation in the Middle East -- he would expect a Rubio-led State Department to make good on enforcement of the sanction bills. A vocal supporter of Israel, Rubio has backed the country's right to defend itself from Iranian threats. Following Tehran's missile strikes on Israel on October 1, Rubio publicly backed an asymmetrical response. Afghanistan Rubio has also taken a hard line on the Taliban, arguing the militant Islamist group should be described as a 'terrorist organization' by Washington. In March, the Florida senator introduced a bill in the Senate calling for an end to an end to U.S. aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, arguing that some of that money could end up with 'terrorist groups.' In remarks to the Senate, Rubio said, 'A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan poses a direct threat to U.S. national-security interests and to our allies in the Middle East and Central Asia.'

What To Expect From The Trump National Security Team – OpEd	By Dave Patterson When former President Donald Trump won an impressive re-election, national security wonks went wild with speculation on how Trump 47 would treat the Pentagon. The liberals portrayed the worst possible national security future, casting Trump as a tyrant who would use the active-duty military to impose his will on US citizens. Most of the gloom-and-doomers are 'never-Trumpers' and have views of little relevance. Trump Rapidly Forms National Security Staff As the Trump Defense Department transition team starts to form its slate of Pentagon and other national security staff, what amounts to a fifth column is forming inside the five-sided building. Media reports show that Trump did not calculate how divisive what he called 'the enemy within' really was. There seems to be a cadre of unnamed defense officials holding clandestine gatherings to devise ways to thwart their commander-in-chief. These people need to remember that 75 million voters repudiated their flawed point of view. News of this despicable behavior was made public in a CNN report: 'Pentagon officials are holding informal discussions about how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically and fire large swaths of apolitical staffers, defense officials told CNN … Trump’s election has also raised questions inside the Pentagon about what would happen if the president issued an unlawful order, particularly if his political appointees inside the department don’t push back.' These reports could be chalked up to chatter among those in the suggestion-making class, always a noisy minority in any administration. These comments are troubling because these voices gain prominence through the mindless echo chamber of the conventional media. To set the record straight about what presidents can do and have done, take the phrase 'how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically.' This notion is a forecast for the darkest and most malevolent intentions, unprecedented in American history. However, putting that phrase in historical context, Military.com explained past commanders-in-chief have used soldiers domestically six times. Which leads one to ask those worried about President Trump: 'Do you mean like President Abraham Lincoln using federal troops to quell the New York City draft riots? Perhaps you are talking about President Herbert Hoover when he used the US Army, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, to remove veterans who set up an encampment on Capitol Hill, or in 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson called in the 82nd and 101st Airborne units to put down ‘Detroit’s 12th Street Riot,’ or maybe you mean the use of 13,600 armed soldiers that restored order when riots erupted nationwide following the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Maybe you are referring to the Los Angeles riots when several hundred Marines restored order in 1992.' Should anyone forget, President Dwight Eisenhower deployed active-duty soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division in 1957 to escort nine black students to a newly integrated Central High School in Little Rock, AR. In each of these instances, federal military forces were used domestically because it was necessary to preserve the lives and property of US citizens. That reasoning was precisely how President-elect Trump phrased his intentions about when federal troops would be needed. However, on a more practical level, Trump administration appointees will be swimming upstream, particularly in the Pentagon, to achieve the Trump agenda. For Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) steps up to take the position. Current Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) will be Trump’s National Security Advisor. Fox News personality and veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars Pete Hegseth will be Secretary of Defense. A Non-traditional Choice Hegseth, Rubio, and Waltz will constitute the principal national security team; the most non-traditional choice is Hegseth to lead the Pentagon. However, he will have a mandate to turn the Defense Department from a den of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activists into a fighting force capable of again deterring aggressors and, if deterrence fails, to defeat any adversary soundly. Many recent assessments of the US Armed Forces have questioned whether that is possible now. Trump sees Hegseth as a no-nonsense, thoughtful leader who will bring back structure, order, and discipline to the Pentagon. Quoting Trump, The New York Times wrote, 'Pete is tough, smart, and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — our military will be great again, and America will never back down.' As the new administration nominees are announced, each has been selected to achieve the Trump agenda. Turning the massive ship of state from the path 60% of voters said is going in the wrong direction will be an immense undertaking and may be painful. However, America will be better for the effort.

The Choices That Australia Makes – OpEd	If you go to the bluff at Kings Park in Perth, Australia, you can overlook the Swan River and enjoy a remarkable view. Across the bay, there is a phalanx of steel and glass buildings that rise to the skies. Each of these buildings carries a sign that glistens in the sharp sun: BHP, Rio Tinto, Chevron, Deloitte, and others. Kings Park no longer survives merely with the patronage of the British King, who continues to claim sovereignty over Australia. Part of it is now named Rio Tinto Kings Park, needing the corporate profits from this enormous mining company to sustain its charms. Down one of the avenues of the park there are trees set apart by a few meters, and at the base of these trees are small markers for dead soldiers from past wars; these are not graves but remembrances that are crowned by Australian flags. The park brings together the three crucial pieces of Western Australia, this province of which Perth is the capital which is the size of Western Europe: the British monarchy, the mining companies and its affiliates, and the role of the military. Of Kings A few days before I arrived in Canberra, an aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted the celebration of King Charles III to say, 'You are not my king. This is not your land.' It was a powerful demonstration against the treatment of Australia ever since the arrival of English ships to the country’s east in January 1788. In fact, the British crown does claim title to the entirety of the Australian landmass. King Charles III is head of the 56-country Commonwealth and the total land area of the Commonwealth takes up 21 percent of the world’s total land. It is quite remarkable to realize that King Charles III is nominally in charge of merely 22 percent less than Queen Victoria (1819-1901). The day after Senator Thorpe’s statement, a group of aboriginal leaders met with King Charles III to discuss the theme of 'sovereignty.' In Sydney, Elder Allan Murray of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council welcomed the King to Gadigal land and said, 'We’ve got stories to tell, and I think you witnessed that story yesterday in Canberra. But the story is unwavering, and we’ve got a long way to achieve what we want to achieve and that’s our own sovereignty.' When Captain James Cook (1770) and Captain Arthur Phillip (1788) arrived on this Gadigal land, they were met by people who had lived in the area for tens of thousands of years. In 1789, a smallpox epidemic brought by the British killed 53 percent of the Gadigal, and eventually—through violence—they reduced the population to three in 1791. It is accurate, then, for Elder Murray to have said to the press after King Charles III left that 'The Union Jack was put on our land without our consent. We’ve been ignored.' What remained were barrangal dyara(skin and bones, as the Gadigal would have said). Given the value of the land in Sydney, the Gadigal clan would today be one of the richest groups in the world. But apart from a few descendants who do not have title to the land, the ghosts of the ancestors walk these streets. Of Minerals Australia is one of the widest countries in the world, with a large desert in its middle section. Underneath its soil, which has been walked on by a range of Aboriginal communities for tens of thousands of years, is wealth that is estimated to be $19.9 trillion. This estimate includes the country’s holdings of coal, copper, iron ore, gold, uranium, and rare earth elements. In 2022, Australia’s mining companies—which are also some of the largest in the world—extracted at least 27 minerals from the subsoil, including lithium (Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium, annually providing 52 percent of the global market’s lithium). On May 24, 2020, Rio Tinto’s engineers and workers blew up a cave in the Pilbara area of Western Australia to expand their Brockman 4 iron ore mine. The cave in the Juukan Gorge had been used by the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people for 46,000 years and had been kept by them as a community treasure. In 2013, Rio Tinto approached the Western Australian government to seek an exemption to destroy the cave and to extend the mine. They received this exemption based on a law called the Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972, which had been drafted to favor mining companies. Rio Tinto, with substantial operations in Western Australia and around the world, has a market capitalization of $105.7 billion, making it—after BHP (market cap of $135.5)—the second largest minerals company in the world (both Rio Tinto and BHP are headquartered in Melbourne). Hastily, BHP began to reconsider its permission to destroy 40 cultural sites for its South Flank iron mine extension in the Pilbara region (and after its investigation and conversation with the Banjima community) decided to save 10 sites. Craig and Monique Oobagooma live in the northernmost homestead in Australia near the Robinson River. They are part of the Wanjina Wunggurr, whose lands are now used for the extraction of uranium and other metals and minerals. The uranium mines in the north are owned and operated by Paladin Energy, another Perth-based mining company that also owns mines in Malawi and Namibia. There is also a large military base in nearby Yampi. Craig told me that when he walks his land, he can dig beneath the soil and find pink diamonds. But, he says, he puts them back. 'They are sacred stones,' he says. Some parts of the land can be used for the betterment of his family, but not all of it. Not the sacred stones. And not the ancestral sites, of which there are only a few that remain. Of Militaries In 2023, the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom signed an agreement to preserve 'critical minerals' for their own development and security. Such an agreement is part of the New Cold War against China, to ensure that it does not directly own the 'critical minerals.' Between 2022 and 2023, Chinese investment in mining decreased from AU$1809 million to AU$34 million. Meanwhile, Australian investment in building military infrastructure for the United States has increased dramatically, with the Australian government expanding the Tindal air base in Darwin (Northern Territory) to hold U.S. B-1 and B-52 nuclear bombers, expanding the submarine docking stations along the coastline of Western Australia, and expanding the Exmouth submarine and deep space communications facility. All of this is part of Australia’s historically high defense budget of $37 billion. In Sydney, near the Central Train station, I met Euranga, who lived in a tunnel which he had painted with the history of the Aboriginal peoples of Eora (Sydney). He had been part of the Stolen Generation, one in three Aboriginal children stolen from their families and raised in boarding schools. The school hurt his spirit, he told me. 'This is our land, but it is also not our land,' he said. Beneath the land is wealth, but it is being drained away by private mining companies and for the purposes of military force. The old train station nearby looks forlorn. There is no high-speed rail in vast Australia. Such a better way to spend its precious resources, as Euranga indicated in his paintings: embrace the worlds of the Aboriginal communities who have been so harshly displaced and build infrastructure for people rather than for wars.

Abolish The Department Of Homeland Security – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken The Trump transition team on Wednesday announced that he is nominating South Dakota governor Kristi Noem as the next head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In the coming weeks, we’ll hear a lot about Noem’s personal politics and origins. We’ll also hear about how the DHS is, as the AP puts it, 'one of the biggest government agencies that will be integral to his vow to secure the border and carry out a massive deportation operation.' Unfortunately, all this misses the most important point about the DHS which is that the DHS was invented in 2002 to justify more government spending, to reward political allies, and to influence local governments with federal grants. For voters who supported Trump because they thought a Trump presidency might actually reduce government waste, they should now be asking why Trump is appointing any new DHS head at all. The only thing Trump should do with the DHS is abolish it. For younger readers, or people with terrible memories, this might sound radical or extreme. But, I can assure you, dear reader, that the United States somehow managed to get along for more than 225 years before this Department was created twenty-two years ago by Congress and the Bush Administration. Much of what the Department does today was not new in 2002, of course. The federal government already had a border patrol, and it already collected tariffs on imports. The Coast Guard was alive and well. The Secret Service already existed, as did various agencies related to nuclear energy and the inspection of agricultural projects. But, the DHS has always been more than just a reorganization of existing agencies. The DHS has overseen new slush funds for domestic police departments. It is the DHS that has largely facilitated the militarization of local police forces. As Wired put it in 2020, 'the Homeland Security Grant Program has funneled billions of dollars to law enforcement agencies to acquire military-grade equipment.' Nonetheless, the creation of the DHS has done nothing to make the border more secure, or to facilitate the enforcement of tariffs. The DHS has never been necessary to patrol US coastal waters. Rather, federal bureaucrats and elected officials pursued the creation of this new enormous government department for political reasons. The DHS was created to be a cabinet-level agency, and the thing about cabinet-level status is that the move makes it easier for the bureaucrats in charge of the agencies to politically agitate for more government spending in their favor, and to push bigger government in general. It’s no coincidence that as the US government has grown ever larger and more intrusive, so has the number of cabinet-level agencies. So, now we have the EPA, the SBA, and the departments of HUD, Energy, and Education all provided with more direct access to the president and the media. Everything they do is deemed 'essential.' Everything they do, we’re told, is a matter of national importance. DHS is no different. When the 9/11 attacks occurred, they exposed the sheer incompetence, laziness, and inefficiency of government security and defense organizations. Year after year, hundreds of billions of dollars were poured into these organizations — in addition to the countless billions spent on the Pentagon. But when they were shown to be asleep at the switch, what happened? Rather than have their budgets cut, and senior officials fired in droves — as should have happened — George W. Bush and his cronies decided that what the federal government really needed was a new department into which billions more in taxpayer money could be poured. The was politically important in the sense that making DHS a department made it easier to call for every more funding for its constituent agencies. It has certainly worked. Prior to the creation of the DHS, 'homeland security' functions were rarely funded at levels exceeding 20 billion dollars per year. Since 2002, though, federal spending on these functions—now consolidated into the DHS—has soared. Since 2001, the total budget for these activities has nearly tripled, rising from $28 billion in 2001 to $112 billion in 2024. (That’s in inflation-adjusted 2023 dollars.) Since the Cold War ended, by the way, spending on so-called homeland security has increased by more than six-fold. Since 2001, has it really become almost three times more expensive—in inflation adjusted terms, mind you—to patrol the border, to collect tariffs, and to check luggage for guns at the airport? It is difficult to see how. What we do know is that the DHS has become an important pass-through for government largesse. Some of this goes to local governments, and these dollars give the federal government more power by providing yet another carrot the feds can hold out to local politicians. Billions more goes into the FEMA black hole which spends prodigiously on federal agents who use DHS dollars as a means of punishing their political opponents. While the Department was created in response to the 9/11 attacks, the Department does nothing to address anything like a 9/11-style attack. All the agencies that were supposed to provide intelligence on such attacks — the FBI for instance, which failed miserably on 9/11 — already exist in other departments and continue to enjoy huge budgets. Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration — an agency that has never caught a single terrorist—has managed to smuggle at least $100 million worth of cocaine. Once upon a time, 'homeland security' was supposed to be the job of the Department of Defense. but, it seems the Pentagon has been too busy in Ukraine or Iraq to trouble itself with the defense of the borders and airspace of the United States. In spite of having been freed of its responsibility for 'the homeland,' however, the Pentagon’s budget just keeps getting bigger. In 2024, it was at a thirteen-year high and remains—in inflation adjusted terms—above the levels of Reagan’s Cold War spending spree. Pentagon spending is up by 57 percent, inflation-adjusted, since 2001. There is no doubt, however, that heading the Department in Washington will be great for the career of Kristy Noem. She’ll get invited to cabinet meetings, go on national TV, and generally enjoy the pampered life of a high-ranking bureaucrat. Meanwhile, American taxpayers will pay more and more, in depreciating dollars, for yet another federal department.

The Absurdity Of War And Its Ethical Echoes In AI – OpEd	By Rafael Hernandez de Santiago In a city where artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize everything from grocery shopping to pet care, one question looms larger than the latest tech trend: What happens when we forget the lessons of humanity in the quest for efficiency? As our screens flash with notifications, a local philosopher and self-proclaimed ethical warrior, Mr. Raf, urges us to reflect on the often-ignored costs of conflict — both in the battlefield and in our evolving digital landscape. 'War, like a poorly programmed AI, often leads to catastrophic outcomes,' Raf quipped during a recent lecture. 'Blood is not even useful for making mud. It’s just messy!' In the annals of history, war has always demanded a staggering price, and not just in dollars and cents. The most chilling aspect is the loss of human life. Each casualty in conflict is not merely a statistic; it represents a unique individual — someone with hopes, dreams, and loved ones. 'When we wage war, we’re not just destroying buildings; we’re dismantling lives,' Raf stated, recalling the painful remnants of countless conflicts. According to the World Health Organization, wars claim tens of thousands of lives annually, and the toll is not limited to soldiers. Civilians — those who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time — find themselves swept into the storm. 'Imagine being at a family picnic and having it interrupted by artillery fire. That’s no way to spend a Saturday!' Raf remarked dryly, emphasizing the absurdity of violence amid humanity’s gatherings. But the scars of war run deeper than physical loss. The psychological impacts are profound and often overlooked. Soldiers return home carrying the invisible burdens of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. 'It’s like bringing a demonic AI home from work; you can’t just turn it off!' Raf lamented. He highlighted that the horrors of war haunt veterans and civilians alike, leaving a legacy of trauma that can echo through generations. The emotional toll on children, especially those growing up in war zones, is particularly alarming. 'You think kids have it rough with homework? Try growing up while bombs are falling!' Raf added, shaking his head in disbelief. The trauma these children endure can shape their futures, perpetuating cycles of violence and despair. Then there is the economic fallout, which can feel as invisible as the psychological scars but is no less devastating. The funds poured into military campaigns could be better spent on education, healthcare, and infrastructure. 'Let’s not forget the opportunity cost here,' Raf urged. 'Imagine the roads we could build or the schools we could fund instead of financing yet another conflict.' The irony is palpable: We invest billions in creating more sophisticated weapons while ignoring the very real problems we could solve with those resources. 'It’s like spending all your money on a fancy coffee machine but not using it to make coffee. What’s the point?' he quipped. Even our planet bears the scars of warfare. From bombings that raze forests to chemical weapons that poison water supplies, the environmental destruction wrought by conflict is catastrophic. 'War is like a poorly designed AI: It doesn’t just affect the immediate environment; it disrupts the whole ecosystem,' Raf argued. 'The trees don’t just fall; they take entire habitats with them. If we’re going to wage war, we’re also declaring war on the Earth itself.' The consequences of this destruction are felt long after the fighting stops. Communities left with barren land and polluted water face dire challenges. 'It’s a vicious cycle: War devastates, and the aftermath leaves people hungry and desperate,' he said. Raf’s mantra — 'Blood is not even useful for making mud' — serves as a stark reminder of the senselessness of war. 'It’s a truth that echoes through history: Conflicts often end in stalemates or resolutions that could have been achieved through dialogue,' he pointed out. The philosopher Aristotle once said: 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.' Yet, in war, we often accept the thought of violence without questioning its futility. 'Wouldn’t it be great if we could use all the energy we spend on fighting to solve our differences peacefully?' Raf proposed. 'Imagine an AI that mediates disputes instead of escalating them. Now that’s the kind of machine we need!' As Techville embraces the future of AI, Mr. Raf advocates for an ethical approach — one that learns from the past. 'If we can’t teach AI to value human life, we might as well hand over the keys to a malfunctioning robot,' he cautioned. 'We need to instill the values of diplomacy and cooperation in our technology.' In this context, the role of the international community becomes crucial. 'We must prioritize dialogue over military intervention,' Raf emphasized. By addressing root causes like poverty and inequality, we can create a world where conflicts are less likely to arise. 'Investing in education and social justice is like teaching AI to be kind — it’s not easy, but it’s necessary.' In a world increasingly defined by AI and technological advancement, it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of history. 'Peace isn’t just a noble idea; it’s essential for our survival,' Raf declared. As he concluded his talk, the crowd erupted in applause. 'Let’s strive for a future where our conflicts are resolved through dialogue, and where human life is cherished above all else,' he urged. 'After all, if we can’t learn from our past, how can we expect our machines to do better?' In Techville, where the buzz of technology mingles with the echoes of history, Mr. Raf stands as a beacon of hope. He reminds us that as we navigate the ethical landscape of AI, the lessons of humanity must guide our way. With a wink, he added: 'And maybe one day, we’ll look back and wonder why we ever thought war was a good idea in the first place!' • Rafael Hernandez de Santiago, viscount of Espes, is a Spanish national residing in Saudi Arabia and working at the Gulf Research Center.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkFdwgyqTMbo	2024-11-14T15:50:40-08:00	
Czech FM: If Europe Wants US Protection Against Russia, It Must S...	By Aneta Zachová (EurActiv) -- The United States remains Europe’s greatest ally regardless of who is in the White House, said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský, adding that to face Russia, the EU should back newly elected US President Donald Trump's China policy. 'We share common interests and values that endure,' Lipavský (independent) said at the opening of the Aspen Institute conference in Prague on Thursday (14 November). The head of Czech diplomacy also stressed that Europe should see a change in the US administration as an opportunity to take more responsibility for its own security. 'It is clear that the United States can no longer police the world alone. If we want to ensure prosperity and security in the transatlantic area, both sides must contribute,' he added. 'We must continue proving that we do not shy away from challenges and that we have courage and determination,' the Czech minister said, commenting that Trump respects those willing to stand up and fight. According to Lipavský, the US will increasingly focus on China and protecting the Taiwan Strait. 'Europe needs to focus on what is happening at its borders. If we expect a strong US commitment to our protection against Russian imperialism, we must be prepared to support them, which means also facing the challenge posed by China,' he explained. Lipavský noted that global instability is on the rise, with recent years bringing further shifts on the geopolitical stage. China’s influence and its ambitions to reshape the international order are growing, he added. 'The Kremlin seeks to disrupt transatlantic ties by aligning with Iran and North Korea. North Korean soldiers are already in Europe, and the axis of evil has thereby been fully revived,' said Lipavský.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9Cn95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-14T15:48:00-08:00	
Malaysia Protests New Philippine Maritime Laws For South China Se...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia said it is protesting two new Philippine maritime laws that it contends encroach on its boundaries in the South China Sea, amid heightened regional tension over Beijing’s increasing assertiveness about its expansive claims. In October, Malaysia lodged a similar complaint against Vietnam following a BenarNews article about Hanoi’s expansion on a South China Sea reef both countries claim, Reuters news agency reported last week. One security analyst said that despite regional tension, there is little risk of confrontation between Malaysia and the Philippines, or Vietnam, while a regional observer said that Manila and Hanoi were the transgressors in both cases. Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamad Alamin told his country’s parliament on Thursday that the new Philippine lawsencroach on Malaysia’s oil-rich state of Sabah, which borders the South China Sea. 'We’ve finalized and reviewed key issues in our protest note, which we’ll send today [Thursday] to affirm our commitment to protecting Sabah’s sovereignty and rights,' Alamin said, referring to the state on Borneo island that is claimed by both Malaysia and the Philippines. Manila on Nov. 8 enacted the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act, which Alamin said extend into Malaysia’s boundaries mapped out in 1979, which Kuala Lumpur regards as internationally recognized. Manila had said the laws were intended to strengthen Manila’s maritime claims and restrict foreign ships and aircraft to designated lanes, to align with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Philippine officials did not immediately respond to Alamin’s comments to Malaysian lawmakers. Located off the southwestern region of the Philippines, Sabah has long been a thorny issue between the neighboring countries. In September 2020, the two countries took their dispute over who owns Sabah to the United Nations. The dispute remains unresolved. Separately, in June 2023, a Paris court upheld Malaysia’s challenge to a U.S. $15 billion arbitration award to purported heirs of an erstwhile sultanate called Sulu, part of which is in Sabah. An arbitration court in Paris had in February 2022 ordered Malaysia to pay that amount to settle a colonial-era land deal. The former Sultanate of Sulu was based in a small archipelago in the far southern Philippines. An analyst at the non-profit Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies said Malaysia has had to deal with the Philippines’ expansion efforts in the South China Sea. 'From the point of view of Malaysia, the Philippines is the troublemaker-in-chief,' Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the council, told BenarNews. He said the Philippines destroyed Malaysian sovereignty markers in the Spratlys, a South China Sea island chain, in the 1970s and 1980s and later occupied Commodore Reef within the Malaysian exclusive economic zone. A country’s EEZs extends up to 200 nautical miles from its coastline. 'So based on this bilateral ‘history,’ Malaysia can only interpret negatively any further move of the Philippines, at least as long as the Sabah case is not solved,' Blandin said. Blandin said Vietnam had also destroyed markers at two maritime features in Malaysia’s EEZ before occupying them. Another analyst, Shahriman Lockman at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia, blamed Vietnam’s actions. 'Recent reports of Malaysia’s protest note to Vietnam, if accurate, reflect a growing impatience with Vietnam’s recalcitrance in the South China Sea and reluctance to engage in constructive discussions – behavior that deserves as much attention as China’s,' Lockman, a senior analyst at the institute, told BenarNews. 'Even so, I don’t anticipate any major escalation as long as Vietnam tries to restrain its fishermen who have a tendency to intrude into foreign EEZs, not only in Southeast Asia but across the Asia Pacific.' Lockman added that protests regarding territorial claims were normal. 'This is just a routine aspect of diplomatic relations – a typical day at the office for our diplomats,' he said. 'As countries build the legal foundations for their territorial and jurisdictional claims, it’s inevitable that overlaps are going to be reiterated.' 'Unless Manila actively pursues its legal claims, I don’t see a high risk of confrontation with Malaysia,' he said. Overlapping claims Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Brunei and Indonesia, as well as Taiwan, hold overlapping claims in the South China Sea and its islands and reefs. Beijing claims nearly all of the sea as its own based on historic rights, which were invalidated by a 2016 arbitration ruling by the international court in The Hague, Since the Philippines enacted its two new laws, Beijing and Manilahave launched protests against each other over contested South China Sea claims. Following Beijing’s protest, Marcos on Thursday said his government would maintain its stance on its South China Sea territories, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. '[T]hey will continue to protect what they defined as their sovereign territory,' he told journalists. 'Of course, we do not agree with their definition of sovereign territory.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CrENeJA6YRdr	2024-11-14T15:45:30-08:00	
The Shifting Nature Of Journalism: Its Being Turned Upside Down –...	Over the last few years, journalism has undergone a massive change. The media organizations many journalists work(ed) for are also in the process of being turned upside-down. What can be described as the mass media in some form employed around 95 percent of journalists, where their prime function was to disseminate news, information, and objective analysis to the public at large. The mass media was portrayed as the 'Fourth Estate', a body that would act as a check and balance to government in a democratic system. Journalism is not always what it appears to be The uncovering of the Watergate break-in and the pursuant cover-up by the White House, which eventually brought down US president Richard Nixon, has been described as the epitome of investigative journalism. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein received much of their information from an insider whistleblower, known as ‘Deep Throat'. However, the revelation that ‘Deep Throat’ was Mark Felt, an assistant director of the FBI at that time, arises another possibility. The possibility that information provided by Felt to Woodward and Bernstein was intended by the ‘Deep State’ to end Nixon’s presidency. Felt was (perhaps unsuspectingly) an agent of the ‘Deep State’ on a mission to end a presidency. The lesson is there is truth, and there are motivations behind truths, where the public may never find out the reality of the situation. This example above, shows the power of journalism in finding the truth, or the flip side, where journalism is susceptible to being used by unidentified forces for the purposes of fulfilling hidden agendas. Journalism has been manipulated over the centuries, where the most well-intentioned journalists have either been misled, or themselves been dishonest. Journalism is often a pivot point between exercising the aspirations of the ‘Fourth Estate’, or acting for the Deep State. Much reporting has been influenced, either intentionally or unintentionally by state narratives. Weapons of mass destruction, Y2K, and Black Lives Matter (BLM) were partly media creations. Images of Obama, Biden, Trump, Assange, Putin, Zelenski, and others were carefully crafted by the legacy media, shifting public opinion either for or against them. This paradox of sorts has over the last 30 years created a loss of confidence and trust by the public in the legacy media. The public has grown wise. In the recent US presidential election, major legacy network audiences plummeted. Audiences moved across to the independent media, as faith has been lost in legacy journalism. Many journalists through pushing partisan narratives helped to destroy their employers. This will lead to fire-sales in the not too distant future. Comcast is already trying to sell MSNBC. Today’s journalistic landscape is vastly different to what it once was. Traditionally, graduates of journalism, economics, arts and other humanities would start their careers in journalism through what was once a very stable industry. Alternatively, cadet journalists would move into one of the satellite areas, such as local newspapers, regional radio, television stations, or specialist magazines. Over time, some would rise up to senior reporter and eventually editor in print media. Some would enter investigative journalism in crime, business or government. In television and radio, some would become a host or anchor of their own programs. Becoming the anchor of the news desk, or anchor of a long running high rating program was the pinnacle of the profession. Successful journalists would be given their own columns in print media, where they would focus on Op Eds, that in the past were very influential in shaping public opinion. In the past journalists tended to settle within legacy media corporations which represented their political beliefs, being left, centre, or right. Up until around 2010, being a journalist within the legacy media was considered a good career choice. One had a career path. Journalists would tend to move from one corporation within the legacy media to another, or an international media organization, which grew out of the CNN success in the 1980s. Very few would ever go out of the industry as an independent. The systemic control over narratives of the legacy media created a prism that has forced out some of the best journalists. The impending mass layoffs of journalistic staff at legacy media companies due to declining audience sizes will act as a great impetuous of independent journalism in the near future, which took a foothold during the Covid pandemic, and came of age during the recent US presidential election. The rest of the world is following this trend and set to play a major role in future elections. The new journalistic landscape This rise of the internet and ability of people to utilize platforms like YouTube from 2010 onwards as it became more sophisticated, provided a potential platform for citizen journalism. The so-called Arab Spring around the 2010s showed the potential of social media for groups to get information out to the public. Prior to this period, WHO rather than WHAT was the prime determinant of who was heard on the media and published. This prevented any balance of views getting public airing. Initially social media changed that. In addition, many academic journalists opened their own websites and published articles in websites such as this one, offering new perspectives to potential readers. These conditions precipitated the beginnings and rise of the early independent media. Podcasting is the new frontier in journalism. Podcasting was looked down up as glorified blogging, which was more opinionated than factual in most cases. A number of podcasts excelled during the recent US presidential election campaign and challenged the legacy media’s viewing audience numbers. Many prominent podcasters are now becoming household names within the independent media. The adversarial David Frost mode of interviewing is being replaced with a successful 'sit down coffee talk' style that has become a trademark of Joe Rogan. Many prominent journalists and broadcasters from the legacy media such as Tucker Carsen, Megyn Kelly, Russell Brand, and many others have moved across successfully to independent journalism. Some of the successes have their own staff of researchers, journalists and production crews. The very top echelon are financially much better off than when they were employed in the legacy media. Rumble, Spotify, and X (formally Twitter) are becoming premier platforms for podcasters. This area is growing exponentially. They have taken much of the audience the legacy media once had. Many print journalists have now moved across to Substack. The Substack platform allows articles with audio versions, podcasts, and video broadcasts. Substack is accompanied by Notes, which is a 'Twitter like' feed based community that is rapidly becoming a ‘go to’ place. Seymour Hersh, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Bari Weiss, among thousands of other journalists have moved across to this reader supported platform. These sites have paywalls and collect subscriptions from readers. Some of the successful Substack sites are reported to earn USD 500,000 gross revenue per annum. Substack is still growing very fast. However, many new sites fail to deliver what they promise and become dormant, leaving subscribers in the lurch. Many other business model news portals have mushroomed across the world, relying on advertising from their websites. However, many fall by the wayside, unless they are financed externally by a benefactor. Many of these sites are also being blocked by government authorities, which is becoming a major hazard in the independent news industry. Independent media has shown itself much more capable of going after and exposing the 'Deep State' than the legacy media. Legacy media has been shown to have ‘relationships’ with agents of the Deep State, and influenced from the large revenue streams that Big Pharma provided. Those in this new media aren’t burdened by the editorial lines and narratives the legacy media has been caught up in. It appears to be only the conservative side of the independent media that is taking a critical look at president elect Trump’s new appointments. Pushback against independent media The tool of choice by the establishment to pushback against the independent media are the so-called factcheckers. Factcheckers are usually funded by left leaning political organizations, big pharma, governments through clandestine means, and even the intelligence agencies. The factcheckers with their adversarial approaches usually attempt to destroy narratives, rather than directly tackle facts. The flood arguments with superlative information. Quite often, the factcheckers themselves are often incorrect and misleading, and very difficult to communicate with and obtain a reply, if challenged. During the pandemic factcheckers often attacked recognized world experts. These organizations were based upon journalists, where medically qualified staff didn’t even exist within their organizations. The legitimacy of some of these factcheckers are mostly self-proclaimed. This highlights a group of journalists within the industry who could be best described as presstitutes. Presstitutes are ‘hired guns’ employed to put out particular narratives and stories into the public domain. The spread 'fake News’, or mis-information deliberately. This is very wide spread throughout the legacy media today. Pressititution has been allowed to flourish today because the legacy media is one of the few places those who want a career as a journalist can be employed. They have no choice but to be lucratively paid pressititutes. This is destroying the attractiveness of journalism today, which is losing favour as a tertiary education pursuit. Jobs in public relations, media promotion and advertising usually turn out to be much more lucrative, and provide better upward career mobility. A word about AI One of the biggest threats to the journalism industry is Artificial intelligence (AI). Content in online news portal is sometimes created through AI, making it unnecessary to employ content writers. Articles can be quickly produced through the technology, edited, and posted. However, AI is based upon ‘grounded knowledge’ already on the internet. Acetic and decorative descriptions created upon feelings of the moment are difficult to recreate in situational news or topic situations. As yet, AI will not be able to replace the spark and innovation of journalists as they work on ideas and hunches for creating content that will benefit the platform they are working for. All within the independent media have not forgotten what happened to Julian Assange, who exposed war atrocities committed by the US military, and the long suffering he endured. In 2023, 45 journalists were killed in the line of duty. Legal sanctions and lawfare are also being used to silence many within the independent media. Independent media is the last bastion of hopefully honest journalism that is capable of exposing the excesses of government and 'Deep States' in countries around the world. Independent media is now the legitimate 'Fourth Estate'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-1QJZwmBIV	2024-11-14T09:50:04-08:00	
Worldwide Trends In Diabetes Prevalence And Treatment From 1990 T...	There is the only disease that increases the risk of crippling complications such as amputation, vision loss, and kidney failure- Diabetes- It is also associated with cardiovascular disease, dementia, some cancers, and infections such as tuberculosis and severe COVID-19. Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).' The Global study published in The Lancet reveals ahead of World Diabetes Day . An Additional concern is that 445 million adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes (59%) did not receive treatment in 2022, three and a half times the number in 1990 The study conclusions: (verbatim) The global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7% to about 14% between 1990 to 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over the same period, rates of treatment for diabetes stagnated at low levels in many of the same LMICs where rates of the disease have drastically increased, resulting in almost 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59%) who did not receive treatment in 2022. Meanwhile, people living in North America, Australasia, central and western Europe, and parts of Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment. Authors say the study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs. Senior author Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, highlighted the widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing. 'This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications – including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss - or in some cases, premature death.' He warned A unique study This global study with global data conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) analyzes the trends in both diabetes rates and treatment which includes all countries; The researchers used the data from over 140 million people aged 18 years or older from more than 1,000 studies in populations of different countries. The authors used statistical tools to bring all the data across different years, ages and countries together, and estimate diabetes rates and treatment in a way that enables comparisons across countries. Researchers defined Diabetes as having a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, having a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.5% or higher (two commonly used diagnostic criteria options for diabetes according to modern guidelines) or taking medication for diabetes. They defined 'Treatment' as taking medication for diabetes. Global rates of diabetes doubled over the last three decades 'From 1990 to 2022, global diabetes rates doubled in both men (6.8% in 1990 to 14.3% in 2022) and women (6.9% to 13.9%). With the additional impact of population growth and ageing, this equates to an estimated 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, an increase of approximately 630 million people from 1990, when roughly 198 million adults were estimated to have the disease.' A press release from The Lancet noted 'The changes in diabetes rate from 1990 to 2022 varied drastically across different countries with mostly LMICs experiencing the largest increases (eg. the diabetes rate amongst women in Pakistan rose from 9.0% in 1990 to 30.9% in 2022, the largest increase across all countries). Whilst some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the last three decades.' The release added. Obesity and poor diets are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates, and its variation across countries, Diabetes rate was either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 to 2022, compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe , where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount. According to Dr Ranjit Mohan Anjana, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, India, the disabling and potentially fatal consequences of diabetes, preventing diabetes through healthy diet and exercise is essential for better health throughout the world. 'Our findings highlight the need to see more ambitious policies, especially in lower-income regions of the world, that restrict unhealthy foods, make healthy foods affordable and improve opportunities to exercise through measures such as subsidies for healthy foods and free healthy school meals as well as promoting safe places for walking and exercising including free entrance to public parks and fitness centres,' she clarified. Widening global inequalities in diabetes treatment: The grim reality What is worrying is the grim reality that three out of five (59%) of adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes, a total of 445 million, were not receiving medication for diabetes in 2022, three and half times the number in 1990 (129 million). Since 1990, some countries, including many in central and western Europe, Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific, as well as Canada and South Korea have seen vast improvements in treatment rates for diabetes resulting in more than 55% of people with diabetes in these countries receiving treatment in 2022. The most notable information is from Belgium where the highest treatment rates were estimated at 86% for women and 77% for men. For many LMICs diabetes treatment coverage has stayed low and changed little over the previous three decades, with over 90% of people with diabetes not receiving treatment in some countries in both 1990 and 2022. Sadly, because of these trends, the yawning gap between the countries with the highest and lowest treatment coverage for diabetes has widened since 1990 to 2022; from 56 to 78 percentage points in women and from 43 to 71 percentage points in men. 'Our findings suggest there is an increasing share of people with diabetes, especially with untreated diabetes, living in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, only 5-10% of adults with diabetes in some sub-Saharan Africa countries received treatment for diabetes, leaving a huge number at risk of the serious health complications.' said Professor Jean Claude Mbanya, University of Yaoundé 1, Cameroon. Status in India, China Pakistan, Indonesia and USA In 2022, almost one third (133 million, 30%) of the 445 million adults aged 30 years or older with untreated diabetes lived in India, more than 50% greater than the next largest number which was in China (78 million) because treatment coverage was higher in China (45% for women and 41% for men) than in India (28% for women and 29% for men). Similarly, Pakistan (24 million) and Indonesia (18 million), the next two countries with the largest number of untreated diabetes, surpassed the USA (13 million), which had higher treatment coverage (65% for women and 67% for men). The information provided in this unique study will be very useful for public health authorities, particularly in 'low and middle-income countries' (LMIC) in using their limited resources more effectively. Government must organize massive, well planned public education programmes, at all levels, with the support and cooperation of NGOs, religious groups and community leaders among others to arrest the Unbelievable Benefits of Eating Family Meals Together at Home Among the benefits of eating family meals together at home are Lower rates of obesity, overweight and eating disorders. Better nutrition and knowledge about a variety of healthy foods. Can we ignore the elephant in the room? Uncontrolled sugar intake Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its latest guidelines advise limiting added sugar to 25 g per day or even eliminating it from the diet as it adds no nutritive value to the food other than calories. The normal intake is higher. For children aged 2 to 19 years, the dietary guidelines for Americans for 2020-2025 prescribe 12 teaspoons (50g) of added sugar from both food and beverages. For kids and young adults (2–19 years old), the average daily consumption of added sugars was already 17 teaspoons in 2017–2018. Excess sugar intake at this age can have a profound adverse impact. As a first step, parents should read the labels on packed foodstuffs to estimate the amount of sugar their children consume daily. Family dinners taken together at home will help in reducing excess sugar intake. Family Dinnner Projects (FDP’s) constant advocacy of what is good will inspire the participants. They will not ignore this elephant (excess sugar intake) in the room	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-a1IJ0ETa2	2024-11-14T09:48:23-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory: A New Global Reality – Analysis	With a calm, exhausted tone and in words that, for the first time, lacked the harsh bitterness marking his speeches of the past four years, Donald Trump (R) addressed a small audience in Florida on the night of 5–6 November 2024. Announcing his victory in the U.S. election, he declared, 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened—is this crazy?' It appears he has indeed accomplished something remarkable. According to the final electoral vote results, Trump secured 312 votes, while Kamala Harris (D) received 226. From a former president pursued by numerous legal cases that could land him in prison, who survived two assassination attempts, and who faced a strong and highly organised Democratic opponent wielding considerable power and with a larger campaign budget, along with various polls predicting he would place second in the race, Trump emerged as the victor. Donald Trump defied television networks, newspapers, and polling institutions that forecasted a close presidential race, clinching a decisive victory for his second term as President of the United States. On 5 November, he ascended to the world’s most powerful position, becoming the next President of the United States. Trump’s victory was both decisive and impressive, with a lead of more than four million votes over his opponent, Kamala Harris. He won more than 74 million votes, compared to 70 million for his Democratic rival. The significance of Trump’s presidential victory was further amplified by the Republican Party’s success over the Democrats in the Senate, with a 53/46 margin, and in the House of Representatives, with a count of 212 to 200. This means that Republicans now have complete control over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, allowing them to implement their policies, particularly domestically. These include providing tax cuts to stimulate the economy, imposing high tariffs on imports—especially from China—and continuing construction of the wall on the southern border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration. The economy and immigration were the main pillars of the Republican presidential and congressional campaign, with much of Trump’s rhetoric centred on connecting the two, as the economy was seen as the primary factor behind his Democratic opponent’s failure in leadership, driving voters towards the Republicans. At 78, Trump has become the oldest candidate ever elected to the presidency, breaking the record previously held by Joseph Biden. Now the 47th U.S. president, Trump returns to office four years after serving as the 45th president, becoming only the second president in American history, after Grover Cleveland, to serve two non-consecutive terms[2] . While the Republican campaign centred heavily on domestic policy, offering extensive details and information, many unknowns remain regarding foreign policy issues. This topic was always addressed only in passing or with rhetorical statements, such as Trump’s frequent claim that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours and his recent pledge to Arab-American voters in Michigan, promising 'peace over there in the Middle East' but without clarifying how this would be achieved. Despite the scarcity of information and plans, some aspects of Trump’s foreign policy can be anticipated based on his previous term as president from 2016 to 2020. Why did Kamala Harris lose the U.S. election? The defeat of the sitting U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election is sure to be remembered and discussed for years to come. The topic is expected to generate numerous books, as well as a wealth of academic and expert discussions, with media analysts in particular examining data from various pre-election polls. Although Harris began her campaign on a strong note, she struggled to connect with voters through her speeches, much like Hillary Clinton (D) in 2016. She spent most of her time attempting to convince voters that Trump was unfit for office but struggled to clearly explain why she herself was the better choice. Jason Miller, Trump’s campaign manager and communications strategist, highlighted what he described as a turning point in the election race. This shift came after several weeks in which polls favoured Harris. Miller noted that Harris’s campaign truly started to unravel after her awkward response to a straightforward question from Sunny Hostin, host of 'The View,' on 8 October: 'Would you have done anything differently than Biden over the past four years?' Clearly flustered, Harris replied, 'Nothing comes to mind,' which sent her advisers into a panic and prompted a wave of online ridicule from Trump supporters. Harris faced an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to counter the steep decline in approval ratings and growing dissatisfaction with Biden, as roughly two-thirds of voters believed the country was heading in the wrong direction. Throughout 2024, Biden and prominent members of his party were convinced he merited a second term due to his impressive political career. Following the 2022 U.S. Midterm elections, in which the Democrats performed far better than expected—largely credited to an anti-Trump sentiment—Biden seemed overly self-assured. When journalists asked him the day after the election what he might do differently to address voter concerns about the economy and the prevailing sense that the country was on the wrong track, he simply replied, 'Nothing.' After Biden’s prolonged delay in withdrawing his candidacy, Harris was thrust from behind the scenes into the spotlight, with only three months to promote herself. By contrast, Trump had spent eight years shaping his public image, including his four years in office, followed by four years of relentless self-promotion. Amid rising inflation and two major wars—in Europe and the Middle East—many voters looked back nostalgically to the pre-pandemic period, which, under Trump, had experienced relative economic stability and growth. Following his decisive victory for the Republican Party’s nomination, even those who had previously opposed him resigned themselves to the reality and embraced his narrative. Meanwhile, the public and Trump’s supporters had become accustomed to a steady stream of negative news about him, blunting the impact of many of the allegations made against him. For many, it was of little consequence that he faced 91 criminal charges, with 34 convictions and a ruling holding him liable in a sexual assault case. Instead, his derogatory labels for Harris—like 'low IQ,', 'crazy Kamala,' and 'Comrade Kamala'—struck a chord and captured the attention of a large segment of voters. The political landscape in 2024 was primed for Trump’s return. Voter sentiment had shifted in ways that Harris’s campaign team didn’t fully grasp—for instance, cultural issues now held far greater importance than they had for decades, possibly even overshadowing economic concerns in their impact. In other words, the progressive issues that had permeated the Democratic Party, referred to as the 'woke era'[3], proved disastrous to Harris’s campaign, particularly as Trump and the Republicans managed to frame them as a far-left agenda, disconnected from the concerns of the average voter. As Harris lost support among certain social groups traditionally loyal to the Democrats, such as Arabs, Muslims, and young Black Americans, Trump played on exaggerated fears of migrants and focused on what he viewed as the average American’s main concern — the economy, in line with the catchphrase from President Bill Clinton’s era, 'It’s the economy, stupid!'[4]. High inflation rates (9.59% in 2022, 4.06% in 2023, and 3.1% in 2024)[5] eroded the real value of income for the vast majority of citizens, especially those in rural areas outside major urban centres. Trump’s approach was rooted in isolationism, flat tariffs and fiscal adjustments, promising to revive the economy through protectionist policies reminiscent of 19th-century practices. These policies would undermine the foundations of capitalism, which has long been a driving force of the United States. He also vowed to dismantle the structure of the current American system according to the conservative 'Project 2025' agenda. This message resonated with tens of millions of voters who have seen the 'American Dream' of prosperity collapse, while extreme wealth accumulates in the hands of the ruling class, the expert class, and elites who control the government for their own benefit. What will foreign policy look like in the Trump-2 era? Trump’s triumphant return appears to be reigniting a period of uncertainty, not only within a deeply divided American society but also on the global stage. During his first term (2016–2020), his actions were hard to anticipate due to his distinct personal style, unconventional proposals, and unusual relationships with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and other authoritarian figures worldwide. Today, despite having had four years of experience with him in power and another four watching him prepare for a comeback, uncertainty around his foreign policy prevails. There’s little doubt that many outside the United States—from Beijing and Moscow to Brussels (EU), Tehran, and Tel Aviv—are attempting to anticipate the shape of the new administration’s policies and the extent to which it might seek to change the rules of engagement between the United States and the rest of the world. What is clear is that Trump does not trust the current state administration managing U.S. interests and will appoint a cadre of loyal supporters to influential positions, individuals who will act on his whims without regard for the consequences. When American voters chose Trump for president in 2016, U.S. allies responded with various 'hedging strategies'[6] for self-protection. This time, however, it seems they are in a far weaker position than they were a decade ago. Allies are likely to try to curry favour with him, offering concessions as a means of survival much as they did during his first term. Trump is expected to continue and expand his strategy of leveraging pressure on U.S. allies through diplomacy—a strategy that, at best, will yield superficial cooperation while leaving structural issues unaddressed. EU braces for potential new U.S. tariffs and duties The European Union (EU) faces the possibility that Trump will impose a set of additional taxes and tariffs on European exports to the U.S., a campaign promise that could threaten the already fragile European economy, strained by recession and inflation. Rather than issuing threats of counter-tariffs, the EU is now attempting to appease Trump by proposing certain trade agreements that might dissuade him from introducing the anticipated duties. It is unclear how China might respond to such a policy, as Trump may opt for a combination of tariffs and military posturing rather than direct conflict, given the interdependence of the Chinese and American economies. On the other hand, Trump has publicly criticised President Joseph Biden’s administration’s policy on Ukraine, pledging to push for an end to the war there immediately following his election—even before taking office on 20 January of the coming year. The president has expressed doubts about the necessity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has provided security for America’s allies since the end of World War II, preferring instead that they pay for the costs of American protection. Policy toward China and Iran The return of former U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House could signal tougher enforcement of American oil sanctions against Iran, potentially reducing global supply and introducing geopolitical risks by challenging China, Iran’s largest oil importer. Tough sanctions on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), could drive up global oil prices. However, this situation might be mitigated by other Trump measures, such as promoting domestic oil production, imposing tariffs on China to curb its economic activities, or softening relations with Russia, potentially allowing for increased Russian crude oil shipments. A return to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran might cut Iranian crude oil exports by one million barrels a day. This could be implemented relatively quickly and without additional legislation, merely through the enforcement of existing sanctions. A tougher stance on Iran also translates to indirect but strict measures aimed at China, which does not recognise U.S. sanctions and remains the largest importer of Iranian oil. Trump has threatened to act on his campaign promises by imposing sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to shield American industry, with rates as high as 60%. In response, China might deepen its engagement with the BRICS bloc, which aims to become an Eastern alternative to the Western G7. China may also begin reducing its reliance on the dollar in oil and other commodity transactions. Trump is aware that such an aggressive sanctions policy poses a serious risk to the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency. On 5 September 2024, at the Economic Club of New York, Trump discussed the potential risks that sanctions pose to the dominance of the U.S. dollar. He stated, 'So I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off. Because look, you’re losing Iran, you’re losing Russia.' He further elaborated, 'I was a user of sanctions, but I put them on and take them off as quickly as possible because, ultimately, it kills your dollar and it kills everything the dollar represents.'[7] China and Iran have created a trading system that relies mostly on the Chinese yuan and a network of intermediaries to bypass the dollar and American regulators, complicating the enforcement of sanctions. Trump may also ease sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, which Western nations imposed in response to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. He is expected to gradually lift all sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. Policy on the Middle East During his election campaign, Trump took a calmer and more pragmatic tone when discussing the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and the broader Middle East situation, in contrast to the Democratic camp, whose positions on various issues appeared vague or confusing, especially regarding the Palestinian question, pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as relations with Afghanistan. Judging by his first term in office, it is expected that President Trump will likely prioritise the Middle East once again. In his first term, Trump made history by choosing Saudi Arabia as his first foreign visit and recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. On the Palestinian issue, he sought to mediate the 'deal of the century'[8] between Israelis and Palestinians and reinforced Israel’s regional ties with some Arab nations, such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, where diplomatic relations were established. Is Trump planning to unseat Netanyahu? Regarding his stance toward the current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prominent Israeli economist and political advisor Eran Yashiv believes that Trump will aim to remove Netanyahu from power at the first opportunity, despite their prior friendship. According to Yashiv, Trump is likely to work toward Netanyahu’s ouster sooner or later. According to this Israeli researcher, Trump’s stance is driven by two economic motives. First, he feels that Netanyahu’s policies come at a high price. Israel received roughly $18 billion in U.S. military aid last year, and Trump has expressed his reluctance to spend American funds either on Ukraine or Israel, stating that continued financial commitments in the Middle East are not on the agenda. The second reason is his desire for Israel to reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia under the 2020 Abraham Accords[9], with Saudi Arabia’s prerequisite for such a deal being the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu and his right-wing allies oppose this, which would prompt the Saudis to demand Netanyahu’s removal. Some analysts describe Netanyahu’s relationship with Trump as complicated. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat in New York and writer, believes that Netanyahu is somewhat wary of Trump, 'He thinks he can manipulate him, but is afraid that if Trump realises this, he could get very angry—unlike Biden, who, for some reason, never pressured him or resisted his manipulations.' There is no doubt that the Middle East will be a focal point for the new U.S. administration. The rest of the world awaits in apprehension, anticipation, and patience Donald Trump’s electoral victory heralds a wave of sudden shifts in U.S. foreign policy. The newly elected president is expected to bring back the defining features of his first term: a trade war with China, deep scepticism—bordering on hostility—toward multilateralism, an affinity for powerful leaders, a style that defies diplomatic norms and standards, and an inclination for improvisational posts on his Truth Social platform. Trump’s advisors say, 'His ‘peace through strength’ approach is exactly what the country needs in this critical moment.' Trump has been given a mandate by the American people to change the course of U.S. foreign policy, and there is little doubt that this time he feels more assured in pursuing his bold and sometimes volatile ambitions. With his unique vision and unconventional style, Trump may well achieve a great deal. However, if he succeeds in restoring the United States to 'greatness,' true to his slogan 'Make America Great Again,' this greatness will inevitably come at a high cost to international relations. Until he officially takes the keys to the White House early next year, the rest of the world can only wait in apprehension, anticipation, and patience.

Maldives’ Suggests New Financial And Trade Instruments To Help SI...	At COP29, President Mohamed Muizzu spoke as a representative of a country most threatened by climate change At the COP29 summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 13, a grim picture of the effects of climate change emerged. As the delegates shared their thoughts, scientists said that despite all the talk about mitigating climate change, another bump upward had occurred in greenhouse gas emissions. Euro News said that in 2024, the world is on track to put 37.4 billion metric tonnes of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It's a 0.8% increase from 2023. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant and prevalent 'greenhouse gas' emitted by human activity. While carbon dioxide is essential for keeping the Earth's surface temperature above freezing, more of it intensifies the 'greenhouse effect' which is a rise in global temperatures. Once emitted, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years, with 40% remaining after 100 years. Methane is another powerful but shorter-lasting greenhouse gas. Methane is the main component of natural gas. In the first two decades after it's released, methane is more than 80 times more effective at warming the climate system than carbon dioxide. In 2023, both carbon dioxide and methane levels in the atmosphere reached record highs. The global concentration of carbon dioxide rose to an average of 419 parts per million in the atmosphere and Methane rose to an average of 1922 parts per billion. UN reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to be in with a chance of limiting warming to the internationally agreed-upon threshold of 1.5 Celsius or the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris. Marginal Gains This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the UN climate talks in Azerbaijan (COP29). There is still no sign that the world has reached a peak in fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The world still has six years before passing 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius, according a United Nations study. Therefore, countries are clearly not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions, said Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. 'We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests,' he urged. Biggest Carbon Emitters According to the Global Carbon Project team, the four biggest carbon emitters are China, the United States, India and Europe. China is the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions. India accounts for 7%. India's carbon pollution jumped by 4.6% in 2024. The US was responsible for 13% globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Europe accounted for 7% of the world's carbon pollution However, China's emission could drop to zero in the next two months and is 'basically flat,' O'Sullivan said. Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the US mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. . Europe saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year - driven by a big cut in coal emissions. Urgency in Maldives One of the most threatened by climate change is Maldives. It is also the world's lowest lying country. The highest natural point is just 2.4 meters above sea level. Today, one of the main problems for Maldivians is water. And it is likely to get worse with climate change. While the Northern islands face drinking water shortages during the dry season, from April to May, most Southern islands face a different problem: flooding. The UNDP is supporting Maldives, to ensure that most vulnerable islands have year-round access to potable water and that they can cope with floods on their own. Nearly half of its population lives in Male, the capital, which is less than 1.4 sq,km. The rest is spread over 186 small, scattered islands. There are no rivers or streams on any of the islands. Except for Malé and a handful of other islands, most islands rely on rain for drinking water. Islands affected by floods and shortages of potable water receive relief from the capital island Malé. Transportation costs are high with the Maldives scattered geography. This makes emergency relief very expensive for a government already struggling economically. The danger is that climate change is expected to bring stronger storms, and longer periods without rainfall. A rise in the ocean's temperature and acidification has had devastating effects on coral reefs, affecting tourism and fisheries, both critical to the livelihoods of most Maldivians. Damaged reefs also function less effectively as a first line of defence against sea swells and flooding. Until the 1990s, Maldivians used groundwater for drinking. But over the past decade, the groundwater of most islands got contaminated. The freshwater lenses of most islands was badly affected by the Tsunami of 2004 and poorly planned urbanization. As a result, today, rainwater, together with water produced using desalination and expensive bottled water are the only potable water options. In the past ten years, the National Disasters Management Center in Malé had to send emergency shipments of water to about half of the 186 inhabited islands during the dry season. An expensive solution that sometimes can take up to two weeks to arrive. Most households have one tank of 2500L and fill it by collecting rain from their roofs. Bigger families might even have 2 or 3 tanks, since one is not enough for them to make it through the dry season. Biosphere Reserve UNESCO has designated certain areas as biosphere reserves. This designation sets up a 'learning place for sustainable development,' a site for testing approaches on how to sustainably manage natural systems that conserve biodiversity and manage and mitigate climate change impacts on local economies. In 2011, UNESCO designated Baa Atoll, in central-western Maldives, as a biosphere reserve. Comprising 75 islands inhabited by 12,000 people dependent on tourism and fisheries, it supports one of the largest groups of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, which act as a conduit for the transport of 'plankton' necessary for biodiversity to thrive and to reduce the effect of waves and storm surges. Plankton are tiny organisms that float in water and are carried by tides and currents. Plankton are important for the health of the ocean and play a big role in the marine food chain. Since this designation as biosphere, Baa Atoll's sustainable ecotourism tourism industry has bloomed, hosting more than 350,000 tourists annually pre-COVID. USAID helped assess ecologically sensitive areas and the recovery potential of coral reef ecosystems. To improve climate resilience, USAID supported government efforts to develop a management plan for one of the largest and biologically diverse marine-protected areas in Maldives. Maldives' Suggestions at COP29 At the Leaders' Summit of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on Climate Change, held at Baku in Azerbaijan on November 13, the Maldivian President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu emphasized that the current financial system does not provide SIDS with the necessary resources to address climate impacts, rendering their ambitious climate goals difficult to achieve. He outlined three major issues for action to reshape the global financial architecture to better support SIDS. Addressing climate change requires a coordinated support from various key players—including the UN, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and the private sector. The Maldivian President said that traditional lending and debt models need rethinking. He proposed the concept of linking 'debt forgiveness to the achievement of specific climate resilience milestones.' For example, a SIDS might see a portion of its debt forgiven if it reaches certain adaptation or emissions-reduction targets. This approach could provide immediate financial relief and an incentive for SIDS to pursue climate goals, especially since high debt levels often prevent these nations from making necessary investments in resilience, Dr. Muizzu said. He also called for a redefinition of creditworthiness, where a nation's climate resilience efforts factor positively into its ability to secure funding, rather than relying solely on traditional economic indicators. Dr. Muizzu urged COP29 to establish a new, more realistic climate finance goal that reflects the actual needs of SIDS. Current climate finance mechanisms often fall short in addressing the scale of funding required by SIDS to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, he pointed out. He sought discussions on establishing a 'comprehensive international carbon market mechanism', a platform that could allow countries to trade emissions reductions or offsets. 'Such a system, if well designed, could generate additional financial resources for SIDS and provide a new revenue stream for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts,' Dr. Muizzu said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRYtT_UQUxJ59	2024-11-14T09:44:44-08:00	
Shaping Outcomes: How Perspective Drives Decision-Making In Negot...	In negotiation and diplomacy, perspective is a defining factor that shapes how decisions are made, options are evaluated, and outcomes are reached. Perspective—the unique lens through which individuals and nations view their interests, intentions, and interactions—plays a crucial role in influencing the positions diplomats take, the strategies they adopt, and the compromises they are willing to make. In an interconnected world where power dynamics and cultural diversity are key elements, understanding perspective is essential for navigating complex diplomatic landscapes and reaching durable agreements. This article explores how perspective shapes decision-making in negotiation and diplomacy, affecting everything from goal-setting to conflict resolution. The Nature of Perspective in Diplomacy and Negotiation 1. Defining Perspective in Diplomacy Perspective in diplomacy refers to the subjective outlook that countries and their representatives hold toward international issues, shaped by national interests, historical experiences, cultural values, and geopolitical priorities. Each nation approaches diplomacy with its own 'worldview,' influencing not only what it aims to achieve but also how it interprets the motivations and actions of other countries. Perspective determines what each party values and fears, often revealing as much about a country's underlying priorities as about the immediate stakes of a negotiation. 2. Perspective as a Framework for Decision-Making Perspective offers a cognitive framework for understanding the negotiation process. It allows diplomats and negotiators to classify issues as more or less important, identify allies or adversaries, and distinguish between acceptable compromises and unacceptable risks. This framework serves as a guide, steering decision-making in ways that reflect a nation's overarching goals and limiting the possibilities for alternative interpretations or concessions. Influence of Perspective on Goal-Setting and Strategic Priorities 1. National Interests and Diplomatic Goals The priorities of a nation are largely influenced by perspective, which defines what it considers to be its national interests. For example, a realist perspective, which views power and security as paramount, might lead a country to prioritize military alliances and security commitments in negotiations. In contrast, a liberal perspective, which values cooperation and interdependence, might encourage a nation to seek multilateral agreements and partnerships that promote collective welfare. These differing perspectives shape the diplomatic goals that nations set for themselves, ultimately guiding the overall direction of negotiations. 2. Shaping Strategic Priorities Perspective affects how countries rank issues, determining which elements of a negotiation are viewed as 'core interests' and which are secondary. During trade negotiations, for instance, a country whose perspective emphasizes economic independence may resist agreements that reduce tariffs on certain sectors, while a nation with a more globalist perspective may prioritize access to foreign markets over domestic protections. In setting these priorities, nations often reinforce their perspective on a larger scale, emphasizing their long-term interests and establishing their values as a key component of their negotiation stance. The Role of Perspective in Defining Negotiation Tactics 1. Formulating Negotiation Positions Perspective influences the stances that diplomats take in negotiations, determining how strongly they push for certain terms and where they might be willing to compromise. A nation that views itself as a regional power, for instance, may adopt a more assertive negotiation style, seeking terms that affirm its influence. Conversely, a country with a perspective that emphasizes diplomatic cooperation may be more inclined to adopt conciliatory tactics. Perspective-driven negotiation positions can either facilitate agreement or create impasses, depending on how compatible they are with the perspectives of other parties. 2. Determining Bargaining Behavior Perspective also influences bargaining behavior, including how diplomats communicate their positions, the concessions they are willing to make, and the red lines they refuse to cross. For instance, nations with a zero-sum perspective on resources may employ hardline tactics, viewing any concession as a potential loss. In contrast, countries that prioritize long-term diplomatic relations might adopt a 'win-win' approach, using collaborative tactics and emphasizing mutual benefits. The chosen bargaining behavior, shaped by perspective, impacts not only the tone of negotiations but also the likelihood of reaching a consensus. Perspective as a Tool for Conflict Resolution 1. Understanding Opponents' Perspectives Conflict resolution in diplomacy often depends on the ability to understand the perspective of opposing parties. By recognizing the values, motivations, and fears that drive the other side, diplomats can craft solutions that address these concerns, even if they do not fully align with their own perspective. This empathetic approach can reduce misunderstandings, ease tensions, and lead to compromises that satisfy all parties' core interests. For example, in peace negotiations, understanding each faction's perspective on sovereignty, autonomy, or security can facilitate agreements that recognize these interests without violating fundamental values. 2. Reframing Issues to Align Perspectives In some cases, conflict resolution requires reframing issues so that they align more closely with each party's perspective. During the Paris Climate Agreement negotiations, for instance, developed and developing nations held different perspectives on responsibility and burden-sharing. By framing the agreement as a global effort where all parties contributed according to their capacity, negotiators were able to accommodate these varying perspectives and reach a landmark accord. Such reframing helps bridge divides, creating common ground even when initial perspectives are divergent. Challenges of Perspective in International Negotiations 1. Perspective as a Barrier to Consensus While perspective is crucial for understanding, it can also become a barrier when parties hold rigid, incompatible views. For example, in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations, countries like the United States and North Korea often adopt opposing perspectives on security and sovereignty. These clashing perspectives make consensus challenging, as each side interprets the other's actions through a distrustful lens, leading to a stalemate. Overcoming such barriers requires a willingness to shift perspectives, which is difficult in high-stakes issues with deep-rooted distrust. 2. Risk of Misinterpretation Perspectives can lead to misunderstandings when parties misinterpret each other's intentions or actions. Cultural perspectives, in particular, shape how communication styles, gestures, and negotiation tactics are perceived. For instance, in East Asian diplomacy, indirect communication is often valued, while Western negotiators may interpret such behavior as evasive or noncommittal. Misinterpretations rooted in perspective differences can derail negotiations, prompting parties to adopt positions based on assumptions rather than facts. 3. Balancing National and Global Perspectives Global challenges like climate change and pandemics demand a shared perspective, yet national perspectives can lead to conflicting priorities. In the case of global climate agreements, countries have struggled to balance their perspective on economic development with the need for environmental sustainability. Nations like India and China, whose perspectives prioritize economic growth to alleviate poverty, often find it challenging to commit to the same emissions targets as developed nations. Balancing these perspectives to reach a common goal remains one of the greatest challenges in multilateral diplomacy. Perspective and the Evolution of Diplomatic Strategies 1. Adaptive Diplomacy and Shifting Perspectives In a world where international issues are increasingly complex, adaptive diplomacy—shifting perspectives based on changing circumstances—has become essential. Nations that adapt their perspectives, such as those that integrate economic growth with environmental responsibility, are better positioned to address evolving global issues. By broadening their perspective, countries can engage in more flexible negotiations, allowing them to work with diverse partners and tackle multifaceted problems effectively. 2. Perspective as a Means of Building Trust Trust-building often depends on the ability to demonstrate an understanding and respect for other parties' perspectives. In negotiations involving historical tensions, showing empathy for an adversary's viewpoint can build rapport and lay the groundwork for future cooperation. For example, U.S. negotiations with former adversaries like Vietnam have evolved from contentious to cooperative, in part due to a shift in perspective that acknowledges past grievances and focuses on common interests. By aligning perspectives, diplomats can strengthen relationships and facilitate sustainable partnerships. 3. Developing a Global Perspective for Sustainable Outcomes As global challenges demand greater cooperation, developing a 'global perspective' that transcends national boundaries is increasingly vital. This perspective emphasizes collective responsibility, long-term vision, and the interconnectedness of nations. In negotiations on climate policy, pandemic preparedness, and human rights, a global perspective encourages countries to consider how their actions affect the international community. Adopting such a perspective allows for solutions that benefit all parties and reinforce the stability of the global system. Conclusion Perspective is more than a mere lens in negotiation and diplomacy—it is an active, influential force that drives decision-making, defines priorities, and shapes diplomatic outcomes. Nations approach international negotiations with perspectives rooted in their cultural, historical, and strategic values, guiding their goals and tactics. However, the dominance of particular perspectives can create barriers and conflicts that complicate consensus. As diplomacy becomes increasingly complex in a multipolar world, adaptive and empathetic approaches to perspective are essential for reaching enduring solutions. Developing a more global perspective that values shared interests and cooperation will be key to addressing the pressing challenges of our interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-14T09:42:59-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Attends Exercise Resolute Warrior In Latvi...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Latvia on Thursday (14 November 2024) to observe Exercise Resolute Warrior 24, and to meet with President Edgars Rinkēvičs and Prime Minister ​Evika Silina. Involving more than 3,500 Allied troops, Resolute Warrior 24 marks the first major field war-fighting exercise for the NATO Multinational Brigade in Latvia. The Canadian-led brigade includes personnel from twelve other Allies and is part of NATO’s strengthened defence posture on the eastern flank. During his visit to Ādaži Military Base, the Secretary General said that exercises such as Resolute Warrior, 'give our forces experience of working together.' He added that such intense training, 'will make us more prepared to deter any aggression, and demonstrate our ability to defend all Allies.' During a press conference alongside President Rinkēvičs, Mr Rutte highlighted that Latvia spends more than 3% of its GDP on defence and supports Ukraine 'with military equipment, ammunition and training'. He called for more Allied support for Ukraine, including air and missile defence, to protect critical infrastructure during the winter season. Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups and exercises like Resolute Warrior serve as critical elements of NATO’s reinforced deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-14T09:40:31-08:00	
The Role Of Psychology And Psychoanalysis In Diplomacy And Negoti...	In diplomacy and negotiation, where power dynamics, cultural sensitivities, and high-stakes decision-making converge, psychological insights can be transformative. Diplomats and negotiators engage in complex interactions that require not only a strategic understanding of objectives but also a deep comprehension of human emotions, motivations, and cognitive patterns. Over recent decades, the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have contributed substantially to diplomacy, shedding light on how psychological factors such as empathy, unconscious biases, defense mechanisms, and emotional regulation can influence negotiation outcomes. These insights enable diplomats to navigate more effectively through conflicts, bridge divides, and foster cooperation. This feature article explores how psychology and psychoanalysis enhance diplomacy and negotiation. It covers various dimensions, from understanding cognitive biases to managing emotions, building trust, and employing psychoanalytic tools to interpret deeper motivations. By integrating these approaches, diplomats and negotiators can achieve more constructive and enduring results in their engagements. 1. The Intersection of Psychology and Diplomacy Historically, diplomacy has often been analyzed from a political or strategic perspective, focusing on national interests, alliances, and power balances. Yet, human factors are at the heart of all diplomatic efforts. Diplomacy involves communication, persuasion, and compromise—tasks inherently influenced by psychological factors. Psychology offers insights into how individual personalities, emotional reactions, and social dynamics shape diplomatic interactions. Psychoanalysis, with its focus on unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms, goes a step further by exploring the hidden aspects of human behavior that impact decision-making. Understanding unconscious influences, such as projection, denial, or displacement, can provide diplomats with a more profound understanding of how unresolved personal or historical traumas might be affecting negotiations. By recognizing and managing these factors, diplomats can better anticipate potential roadblocks and tailor their strategies to foster cooperation. 2. Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on Diplomacy Cognitive biases—systematic patterns of deviation from rationality—play a crucial role in diplomacy and negotiation, often leading to misunderstandings or suboptimal decisions. Psychologists have identified various biases that can affect diplomats, including the following. Confirmation Bias Diplomats, like all people, may interpret information in ways that confirm their existing beliefs. This bias can lead negotiators to ignore important data that contradicts their assumptions. In high-stakes negotiations, confirmation bias may prevent diplomats from fully considering alternative viewpoints, thereby hampering compromise and conflict resolution. Attribution Bias Attribution bias can distort how diplomats interpret each other's actions. For example, they may attribute their adversary's behavior to inherent aggressiveness while viewing their own behavior as purely defensive. This mutual misperception can escalate tensions, making it difficult for diplomats to empathize with the other side and increasing the risk of conflict. Anchoring Bias Anchoring occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter. In diplomacy, anchoring can influence how initial offers or positions are perceived and lead to a narrow focus on early assumptions. Awareness of anchoring bias enables diplomats to remain open to alternative solutions rather than becoming rigidly fixed on initial terms.Understanding these biases helps diplomats recognize when they might be falling into psychological traps, allowing for more rational, open-minded, and flexible negotiations. This self-awareness can reduce misunderstandings and contribute to more balanced and fair agreements. 3. Empathy as a Diplomatic Tool Empathy—the ability to understand and share the feelings of others—is a cornerstone of effective diplomacy. By empathizing with counterparts, diplomats can better understand their motivations, fears, and priorities, which is essential for finding common ground. Building Trust and Rapport Empathy enables diplomats to build trust, which is often the foundation for successful negotiations. Trust is not only about transparency but also about genuinely acknowledging and addressing the concerns of the other party. Empathetic listening can validate the feelings of all parties involved, making them feel understood and reducing defensive reactions. Defusing Hostility Empathy can help de-escalate tension in contentious negotiations. When diplomats take the time to see an issue from their counterpart's perspective, they are more likely to frame their arguments in a way that reduces hostility. For example, instead of focusing on accusations, they may focus on shared concerns or mutual benefits. Humanizing Opponents In conflicts, opponents are often dehumanized or reduced to stereotypes, which can fuel aggression and inhibit peace efforts. Empathy allows diplomats to humanize their counterparts, understanding them as complex individuals with legitimate concerns. This can be particularly useful in post-conflict settings, where long-standing animosities may persist despite formal agreements.Incorporating empathy into diplomatic practices doesn't mean compromising one's position; instead, it enhances the ability to communicate persuasively and negotiate with greater awareness of psychological dynamics. 4. Emotional Regulation in High-Stakes Negotiations Negotiations can be emotionally intense, particularly when issues of national pride, security, or historical grievances are at stake. The ability to regulate one's emotions is critical for diplomats, who must maintain composure and think clearly, even in stressful situations. Psychological techniques can help diplomats manage their emotional responses, enabling them to stay focused and objective. Mindfulness and Stress Management Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing, visualization, or progressive relaxation, can help diplomats stay calm under pressure. These techniques allow diplomats to maintain a clear mind and prevent emotional reactions from overshadowing rational thinking. In recent years, some foreign ministries have incorporated mindfulness training to help diplomats cope with the emotional demands of their roles. Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence (EI)—the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and empathize with others—is a valuable skill in diplomacy. High EI allows diplomats to recognize and interpret emotional cues, which can help them adjust their strategies accordingly. For example, a diplomat with high EI might detect signs of frustration or impatience in their counterpart and adjust the pace of the negotiation to prevent escalation. Recognizing and Addressing Emotional Triggers Through psychological training, diplomats can identify their emotional triggers and learn to respond in measured ways. For instance, a diplomat who becomes easily frustrated by perceived disrespect might learn to reframe such interactions, focusing on the overall goal of the negotiation rather than reacting impulsively. Emotionally regulated diplomats are more effective in managing the challenges of negotiation, as they can keep their focus on long-term goals rather than short-term frustrations. 5. Psychoanalytic Approaches to Unconscious Motivations in Diplomacy Psychoanalysis brings a unique perspective to diplomacy by exploring the unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms that influence individual and collective behaviors. This approach can be particularly insightful when dealing with historical grievances, intergenerational traumas, or deeply rooted ideological conflicts. Projection and Scapegoating In some diplomatic conflicts, projection—a defense mechanism in which one attributes one's unwanted feelings or traits onto others—can lead to scapegoating. For example, a state may project its own internal problems onto an external enemy, escalating hostility and justifying aggressive policies. Psychoanalytic techniques can help diplomats recognize when projection is at play, making it possible to address underlying issues more constructively. Understanding Historical Traumas Nations, like individuals, can carry psychological scars from past traumas, such as colonialism, occupation, or genocide. These traumas can influence current diplomatic behavior, leading to hyper-sensitivity or hostility in certain contexts. By understanding how historical trauma shapes national identity and foreign policy, diplomats can avoid triggering emotional reactions and approach negotiations with greater sensitivity. Transference and Countertransference Transference occurs when individuals project feelings associated with past relationships onto current interactions. In diplomacy, this might manifest as a diplomat viewing a counterpart as an 'enemy' based on past conflicts, even if the situation has changed. Conversely, countertransference refers to the diplomat's own emotional reactions to the counterpart, which may influence their negotiation style. Recognizing these dynamics allows diplomats to separate past grievances from present realities, creating a more neutral space for dialogue. Psychoanalysis encourages diplomats to consider not only the visible aspects of negotiations but also the unseen psychological factors that shape diplomatic interactions. This deeper awareness can prevent misunderstandings and foster genuine resolutions. 6. Utilizing Psychological Insights in Cross-Cultural Diplomacy Diplomacy often involves navigating cultural differences that influence communication styles, attitudes toward authority, and concepts of honor. Psychological insights into cultural psychology and cross-cultural communication can enhance diplomats' effectiveness in diverse settings. Cultural Sensitivity and Adaptive Communication Psychology offers tools for understanding cultural dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism or high vs. low power distance, which affect diplomatic interactions. In some cultures, indirect communication and subtlety are valued, while others prioritize directness and clarity. A diplomat aware of these differences can tailor their communication to avoid unintentional offense and build rapport. Avoiding Stereotyping Cultural psychology helps diplomats avoid stereotypes, which can hinder meaningful interaction. Rather than assuming that all members of a culture behave in certain ways, culturally informed diplomats can appreciate the diversity within cultures and avoid making assumptions that may harm negotiations. Intercultural Empathy Understanding cultural values and social norms enables diplomats to empathize with foreign counterparts' perspectives, reducing misunderstandings and fostering cooperation. For example, a diplomat who understands the importance of 'saving face' in certain cultures may take extra care to avoid language or actions that could cause embarrassment, thus maintaining mutual respect and facilitating smoother negotiations. Cross-cultural psychology provides diplomats with the tools to approach international interactions with sensitivity, allowing them to bridge cultural divides and enhance diplomatic outcomes. The Future of Psychology and Psychoanalysis in Diplomacy As global challenges become increasingly complex and interconnected, psychology and psychoanalysis will likely play an even greater role in diplomacy and negotiation. By integrating these fields into diplomatic training and practice, diplomats can become more adept at understanding the human aspects of international relations. The next phase of psychology in diplomacy may involve even greater use of psychoanalytical and psychological techniques, such as scenario analysis, role-playing exercises, and emotional intelligence assessments. These methods can help diplomats refine their skills in managing emotions, interpreting unconscious motives, and fostering empathy. Additionally, advances in neuropsychology may provide new insights into how stress, fatigue, and decision fatigue impact diplomacy, leading to improved strategies for maintaining resilience in high-stakes negotiations. In an era marked by rapid technological change, cultural shifts, and unprecedented global challenges, psychology and psychoanalysis offer diplomats invaluable tools for achieving nuanced, sustainable, and empathetic solutions to complex issues. By embracing these perspectives, diplomats and negotiators can create more stable and harmonious international relationships, built on a foundation of deep human understanding.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRTI4q_bDTIiB	2024-11-14T09:38:26-08:00	
Remarks Of IMF Managing Director To 25th Jacques Polak Annual Res...	Good morning! Welcome to the 25th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference! Twenty-five years is a huge milestone. And I want to give my heartfelt congratulations and thanks to the Research Department and Pierre-Olivier for all you’ve achieved over the past quarter century. Over that time, we’ve had our ups and downs. Periods of high growth and low growth. Profound changes in the global economy, and crises. Through it all, the ARC has shed light on some of the most difficult questions facing our profession, helping policymakers navigate the most complex challenges. My task is to honor this incredibly distinguished history—in under 5 minutes. Impossible, but I will try! The first ARC was under Michael Mussa. It was the year 2000, when Maury Obstfeld laid out a new international macroeconomics research agenda looking beyond the Mundell-Fleming Model—at the Mundell-Fleming lecture, no less! That was 15 years before Maury became Chief Economist. After Michael came Ken Rogoff, whose accomplishments we celebrated here last year. Then, under Raghu Rajan's leadership, the ARC focused on fundamental issues that remain highly relevant today: from exchange rate regimes to capital flows and structural reforms. These insights were crucial in guiding policymakers' responses to mitigate the impact of the Global Financial Crisis. The next ARC explored the latest factors impacting exchange rates and examined their policy implications. It was led by Simon Johnson—who we're proud to say is now a Nobel laureate! Afterwards, Olivier Blanchard’s record-setting run of seven ARCs began, at the height of the Global Financial Crisis. And, in the years that followed, it was only natural that many of these ARCs allowed us to reflect on macroeconomic and financial policies in the shadow of the crisis. That work made us better prepared for the shocks of the past five years. Gita’s ARCs were shaped by the pandemic. They helped us better incorporate epidemiology into macroeconomic models early in the COVID crisis, and later gave insight into pandemic’s impact on capital flows. And with Pierre-Olivier’s stewardship, we have written a new playbook to help countries address the challenges of the post-pandemic, climate-impacted world, including inflation and elevated debt. This year will continue the ARC’s tradition of excellence, I am sure, as you Rethink the Policy Toolkit in a Turbulent Global Economy. The profound shocks of COVID and war have left us with inflation and fragmentation, even as we need economic growth to address challenges from poverty to climate change. Yet the growth outlook, while stabilizing, remains much lower than pre-pandemic. Inflation has declined, but not been fully defeated. And elevated debt levels constrain fiscal space, especially in countries that most need to spend to educate their young populations, build infrastructure, and increase their climate resilience. This conference will focus on how to address these and other challenges that central banks and fiscal authorities face—and what the international community can do together. With Gita, Pierre-Olivier, and the RES team in the lead, you are in great hands. I wish you the best for an illuminating, productive conference. Over to you, Gita.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRSfMM2zWgO-P	2024-11-14T09:36:57-08:00	
Prophet Abraham Started Three Unique Monotheistic Religions – OpE...	For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send hundreds of his prophets to this small tribe and worked continually for centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. God makes Prophet Abraham several promises that will be fulfilled if he heeds the comments he has been given: Genesis 12:2 states 'I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and it shall be a blessing. 12:3 I will bless those who bless you and curse him that curses you; and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you.' Most of these promises have already been fulfilled. Prophet Abraham was the first person to be called a 'Hebrew' in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 14:13). The term Hebrew probably comes from the verb to go over a boundary, like the Euphrates or Jordan river, or to be a migrant. Ten generations later the Philistines in Canaan used the term 'Hebrews' to refer to the 12 tribes of Israel: 'The Philistine commanders asked, 'What about these Hebrews?' (1 Samuel 29:3); and Prophet Jonah identified himself to non-Jewish sailors as 'a Hebrew' (Jonah 1:9). According to a new Pew Research Center study released on August 19 2024: 'Christians are about 30% of the world's population, the world's migrants are 47% Christian, according to the latest data collected in 2020. Muslims make up 29% of the migrant population and 25% of the world's population. Jews, who are only 0.2% of the world's population and 1% of migrants, are by far the most likely religious group to have migrated, with 20% of Jews worldwide living outside their country of birth compared to just 6% of Christians and 4% of Muslims. Prophet Abraham was the first Muslim Hebrew as Qur'an 3:67 states: 'He (Abraham) was not Yahuudiyyan, 'a Jew', nor Nasraaniyyan, 'a Christian', but rather a Haniifan', 'a monotheistic Hebrew believer submitting (Islam) to the one imageless God who created all space and time; and who made Prophet Abraham's descendants through Prophets Isaac and Jacob (Israel), into a great multitude of monotheists called the People of Israel-Banu Israel. The Prophet Isaiah said: 'Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he [Abraham] was only one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him. (Isaiah 51:1-2) and the Qur'an states: 'You have an excellent example to follow in Abraham.' (60:4) and 'Follow the way of Abraham as people of pure faith.' (3:95) And the Quran 2:130 states: And (everyone) who shuns the creed of Abraham (is) but a foolish soul. We chose him (Abraham the Hebrew Genesis 14:13) in the world and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous. 2:131 And when his Lord said unto him 'Submit!' (aslim) he said, 'I submit (aslamtu) to the Lord of the worlds.' Most people in the world have learned of Prophet Abraham, not by reading a book of Jewish history or religion, but by listening to and reading from the Christian Bible or the Muslim Qur'an. This unique and amazing situation is a reflection of a promise made to Prophet Abraham more than 36 centuries ago, and recorded in both the Torah and the Qur'an. 'I swear (says God) because you did this - not withholding your son, your favorite one, I will bestow My blessing on you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.' (Genesis 22:16-18) and 'Indeed, We chose him (Abraham) as one pure and most distinguished in the world, and he is surely among the righteous in the Hereafter'. (Qur'an 2:130) Prophet Isaiah also said: But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, are the offspring of Abraham, my friend;' (Isaiah 41:8) So the biological offspring of Prophet Abraham (the Banu Israel) became the first ongoing monotheistic community when God rescued them from Egyptian oppression; and made an ongoing covenant with them at Mount Sinai. Prophet Abraham was not born a Jew, but his descendants from his grandson Jacob/Israel became the Banu Israel—Jewish People. For 1200+ years after Prophet Moses, the Banu Israel was the only ongoing monotheistic community in the world. 'Similarly, no Messenger came to the People before them, but they said (of him) 'A sorcerer, or one possessed''! (51:52) And as the Qur'an informed us: 'The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamūd; and ʿAad and Pharaoh and the brothers [neighbors] of Lot; and the companions of the forest, and the people of Tubbaʿ. All denied the messengers [Allah sent to them] so My threat was justly fulfilled.' [50:12-14] And those monotheistic communities that did last for a few generations, always fell away during subsequent centuries; while most, but not all, of Banu Israel remained loyal to the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai: 'Before (Messengers Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus) We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts become hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them. (Qur'an 6:42-43) But as the centuries passed the ongoing need to protect the Jewish way of life became increasingly the focus of their efforts; and after the deaths of Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, Banu Israel became more and more inclined to building a fence around the Torah, and making the rules more numerous and restrictive. In 1065 Pope Alexander called for a Crusade against the Moors in Spain. Then in 1073, Pope Gregory issued official proclamations urging Christian princes to recover lands occupied by Muslims in Spain, over which he claimed papal sovereignty on the basis of previous Christian rule and right. These decrees were really the beginning of the Christian Crusades against Islam. For example, in 1209, Pope Innocent III urged a band of northern French nobles to rally an army that swept into southern France, where they unleashed a crusade so bloody it included the sacking of Beziers by an army under papal authority. Just before the attack, which would kill 15-20,000 men, women and children, the pope's man on the scene, Arnaud Amalric, is reported to have uttered one of history's most famous orders: 'Kill them all. God will know his own.' The next 4-5 centuries of religious military war in Europe and the MiddleEast was the result of the previous 2-3 centuries of all-out polemic verbal war between Christianity and Islam. Religious truth became a zero sum game: anything positive said about another religion was seen as a weakening of your own side. The goal was not to modestly try to harmonize various religious perspectives of the one and only God; but to self-righteously exaggerate religious differences, well beyond any reasonable understanding of the two sides. In the Greek world, the Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) was well known, while the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca was not known by name at all. The first Roman reference to the Baitullah is from Diodorus Siculus, a first century BCE Roman historian who wrote that in Arabia there was a temple greatly revered by the Arabs. According to G. E. Von Grunebaum, who I studied with at the University of California Los Angeles in 1959, Mecca was also mentioned by Ptolemy, a second century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who wrote, 'The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary.' (G. E. Von Grunebaum, Classical Islam: A History 600–1258, p. 19) Yet just seven centuries later both of these cities and sanctuaries, one almost unknown by the Romans and the other totally destroyed by the Romans, were destined, throughout the Middle Ages in both Europe and west Asia, to be viewed as the heart, lungs or navel of the world. Jerusalem and Mecca were frequently portrayed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the center of their maps. God willing, someday everyone may see both cities and their sanctuaries as central to our monotheistic connections to the One God of Prophets Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. If we can live up to the ideal that religious pluralism is the will of God, we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) So God's promise to Prophet Abraham, that the other families of humankind will ultimately bless themselves, and one another, thus aspiring to be like Abraham's descendants (Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14), and will have fulfilled the three Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. As a Hadith states: 'Abu Dharr narrated that one day he asked the Messenger of Allah (Prophet Muhammad): How many prophets are there in all? He replied: 124.000. Abu Dharr then asked: How many of them were messengers (bring a sacred scripture) prophets? He replied: 313 from the above group. He asked: Who was the first of them (the oral only prophets)? He replied: Adam...The first prophet among Bani Israel was Musa and the last of them (the Jewish prophets) was Isa (Jesus), and they (the Jewish prophets) were in all 600.' (Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11, Pg. 32.) This is why the 600 Jewish prophets who were the descendants of Prophet Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) were and still are to this very day the smallest and oldest base of an unbroken, ongoing, monotheistic nation of survivors. Prophet Abraham, like his early descendant prophets until Messenger Moses, the covenant with the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, and the Torah; was a muslim and not a member of the Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community at that time; because there was no Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community then. 'Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.' (Qur'an 3:67) Thus the Qur'an instructs members of the Islamic community when others say to them: 'Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided...' Muslims should reply: 'Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth [imageless monotheism], and he was not of the polytheists.' (2:135)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfQnvdSqZX8l	2024-11-14T09:34:53-08:00	
Inconvenient Question: Science Is Gifting Us New HIV Prevention T...	Any new HIV prevention method is not meant to sit on the shelf but to be used by the people who need it to protect themselves from HIV. We have to ensure that new HIV prevention technologies that are coming out of the scientific research pipelines, are accessible to people everywhere - especially those who are more at risk of HIV acquisition. Jim Pickett has passionately called for translating scientific gains into public health outcomes - not with delay, but with equity and justice. Currently Jim Pickett serves as a Senior Advisor for AVAC and directs their Choice Agenda programme focussed on HIV prevention research and its implementation. Inconvenient truth When asked what has changed between 2018 and now, he said: 'COVID-19 reshaped our entire world. Traumatizing as it was, it also changed some things for the better, I think, globally. We got better at finding new ways to deliver healthcare. We also learned that we could develop a vaccine quickly and that was a win. But we failed to deliver it equitably in many parts of the world.' Jim was speaking with CNS at the 5th HIV Research for Prevention Conference of the International AIDS Society (IAS) in Lima, Peru. Sadly, equity and justice are not driving our health responses. 'We have had some exciting scientific developments in the HIV prevention space. We have cabotegravir- a once-in-two months injection that can prevent HIV. But accessibility is a different issue. It is available in our country, but it is extremely expensive. It is also complex to deliver. So the number of users is very low. It is available, but not accessible for many,' he said. 'We now have another long-acting injectable lenacapavir- two shots a year- that is on its way to being approved. And people are calling it game-changing and transformative in terms of HIV prevention. But it remains to be seen what access will look like. Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries that have been left out (from the 120 countries list) by Gilead (makers of lenacapavir) to provide it at reduced costs, despite these 4 countries being part of the clinical study of the drug,' he added. Imagine the injustice: people of countries which participated in the clinical study of lenacapavir for a greater common good, will not be able to get the best of benefits when it comes to its rollout, as of now. 'I am also excited about the tenofovir-medicated rectal douche as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men- a douche that provides hygiene before anal sex, and then leaves the drug behind that provides protection against HIV. In an early Phase-1 study examining its safety and acceptability, majority of the participants stated that they would prefer the douche over daily oral PrEP,' said Jim. 'If PrEP douche passes through phase-2 and phase-3 studies, and then move to regulatory approvals and get into the market, it would be our first-ever behaviourally congruent intervention, which means harnessing a behaviour that people already do,' he said. PrEP is a medication for HIV negative people to protect them from getting infected with HIV. A choice should be accessible Science finds new tools to create new HIV prevention options for people, but then to have success in terms of making it accessible to all so that we can reduce new HIV infection rate, continues to remain a struggle. 'It is like science gets you to the top of one Mount Everest and then we find that there is a second Mount Everest of 'access' to climb. And that might even be a taller version of the first Mount Everest,' rightly said Jim. 'While I am really excited for these new choices that we will have, I am also frustrated that they will not be real choices, unless people can truly access them. There is no change in the game if you cannot get on the field, and there is no 'transforming' anything if that drug looks really good on paper, and then it sits on a shelf, and the people, who really need it, do not have access to it. It needs to be cheap, affordable, and accessible to everyone anywhere in the world. We definitely need to have some strategy for this,' he added. We cannot put profit above people's health 'The focus of pharmaceutical companies is on their shareholders and on making money. But public health is not about profit; it is not about money; it is about rights-based access - for everyone, regardless of their means. So there is a conflict of interest in that relationship. We need people at the negotiating table who want to fix this. So, community involvement from the very beginning is very important. It is about having all hands on deck, I think everyone who is involved- from every community person, organisations, governments, policy makers, funders, pharmaceutical companies, we have to hold them accountable,' rightly said Jim. Take the example of Lencapavir. 'It does not need to be priced over US$ 40,000 per person per year to be profitable. We are not asking pharmaceutical companies to do this for free, but do they deserve rewards that are exponentially beyond profit and just so high that it can bankrupt health systems? Or make health systems say that it is beyond their financial capacity to pay that kind of money? We cannot bankrupt our health system for one innovation when we have multiple health needs for the community. We cannot subsidise products that are so grossly expensive. We do not know how much the price of lencapavir will be decreased through voluntary licensing by the generic manufacturers who are also for-profit companies. So there is a lot to do to make sure that when it moves forward and it gets produced, it is priced in a way that is affordable for the people,' he said. PrEP approved in 2012 but many high burden nations yet to roll it out in public programmes There are countries like India where even the oral daily PrEP is not in the government programme even 12 years after it was approved in 2012, forget about the long-acting new PrEP products. It is ironical that HIV treatment is free in India, but HIV prevention options like PrEP are not. 'So, in a way you are putting people at risk of getting infected with the virus and then offer them lifelong treatment, but not giving them prevention medication for free. What sort of economy is this? If you have HIV, you get those very drugs (that could have been given to prevent HIV infection in the 1st place),' he said. Even in richer nations like USA problems and disparities plague the development response. 'There are many HIV programmes for people living with HIV around housing, food security and transportation vouchers. And I am happy for that. I am a person living with HIV, and I am happy to see other programmes that help people who need support. But then there are many people who are HIV negative, and who still are struggling- they do not have good housing, do not have a decent job, and are struggling to find their next meal. If we can get someone safely housed, make sure they have a full meal, it would help a lot in HIV prevention too all on its own,' rightly remarks Jim Pickett. 'People who have HIV prevention as their concern have many other concerns as well, and many times those other concerns are more pressing problems for them- like where am I going to sleep tonight? Am I going to get a meal today? When will I get a job? How am I going to continue my education? These are their priorities, which make them more vulnerable to HIV infection,' he added. Reducing vulnerability of people to HIV requires society-wide structural interventions and political commitment backed with resources. 'We are one whole person, and not separated in compartments,' says Jim. He is right. All health and development enshrined in promises our governments have made are also contributing towards HIV prevention, support and care. We, the people need to connect the dots and call for integrated development responses that are socially just.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRUGye4ZrM_du	2024-11-14T09:33:05-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Pivot: A New Path In Regional Diplomacy – OpEd	In a remarkable departure from the recent past, Bangladesh is charting a new course in its foreign policy, distancing itself from India's sphere of influence and seeking to strengthen ties with Pakistan while reinvigorating regional cooperation within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This shift, while strategic in its diplomatic ambitions, is also driven by deep domestic dissatisfaction with the previous government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid, whose long tenure came to an abrupt end amid growing allegations of human rights violations and corruption. For over a decade, under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership, Bangladesh's foreign policy was largely aligned with India, shaped by shared historical ties, economic cooperation, and geopolitical concerns. But the years of close ties with New Delhi have come under scrutiny. Many in Bangladesh now view this alignment as compromising the country's sovereignty, and public discontent has reached a tipping point. Accusations of widespread human rights abuses and political repression under Hasina’s rule have fueled a rethinking of the nation’s diplomatic and internal policies. The interim government, which replaced Hasina's administration, has moved decisively to shift the country’s diplomatic focus. In the wake of mounting allegations, including accusations of genocide and political persecution, the interim government’s actions signal a deliberate attempt to break free from India’s embrace. Notably, the decision to freeze the financial accounts of Hasina’s family — long a symbol of political power and influence — underscores the growing public anger over perceived corruption and authoritarianism. The country’s pivot is further evidenced by its bold moves within the defense sector. A key moment in this recalibration occurred on October 6, 2024, when Chief Advisor Yunus inaugurated the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters. The event marked a significant step in fortifying the autonomy of Bangladesh's military, which had, in the past, been seen as closely aligned with India’s security concerns. This newfound emphasis on national pride, paired with the rollback of laws protecting the Mujib family, signals an effort to reclaim political independence and lessen the influence of external powers. Another critical step in this pivot came when the interim government invited the UN Commission for Human Rights to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during Hasina's tenure. This move — widely seen as an attempt to expose abuses tolerated under the previous administration — has further strained relations with India, which had historically lent tacit support to Hasina's government. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in this diplomatic realignment has been the rupture in Bangladesh’s relations with India. At the 79th United Nations General Assembly, Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Yunus was met with Indian reluctance, further highlighting the growing discontent with Indian influence in Bangladesh's domestic affairs. India’s behind-the-scenes efforts to bolster the Awami League — the political party led by Hasina — were seen by many in Bangladesh as an attempt to meddle in its internal politics, exacerbating the rift between the two nations. In response, Bangladesh recalled its envoy from New Delhi, signaling a clear intent to distance itself from India’s regional dominance. As Bangladesh seeks to recalibrate its foreign relations, it has begun to turn its attention toward Pakistan, a country with which it shares a complex history. A recent diplomatic meeting between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary and the Pakistani High Commissioner marked the beginning of what could be a thaw in bilateral relations. The two countries, which have long been estranged due to the lingering wounds of the 1971 independence war, are now looking to strengthen trade ties, as evidenced by Bangladesh’s decision to remove the 100% physical inspection requirement for Pakistani goods. This move is seen as a step toward re-establishing a cooperative economic relationship. More importantly, Bangladesh has expressed strong support for reviving SAARC, the regional organization that has long been sidelined due to political tensions, particularly between India and Pakistan. In collaboration with Nepal, Bangladesh is promoting a regional agenda focused on economic integration and collaborative growth, presenting SAARC as a platform for cooperation unencumbered by the bilateral issues that have historically divided the region. Bangladesh’s efforts to encourage educational exchanges with Pakistan further reflect a growing desire for people-to-people connections, signaling a shift toward fostering regional unity rather than perpetuating divisions. This pivot is not just a reaction to domestic unrest or external pressures; it also reflects broader regional dynamics. India’s assertive foreign policy in South Asia, particularly its growing influence in Bangladesh, is facing increasing pushback from its neighbors. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are keen to carve out independent spaces in the region, free from the shadow of any single dominant power. By revitalizing SAARC, Bangladesh and its regional partners may have an opportunity to build a cooperative framework that prioritizes mutual economic development over narrow geopolitical rivalries. For Bangladesh, the road ahead is one of balancing regional cooperation with the assertion of national sovereignty. Whether the country can successfully navigate this complex diplomatic landscape remains to be seen. But the clear shift away from India, combined with efforts to reintegrate Pakistan into the fold of regional cooperation, represents a pivotal moment in Bangladesh’s foreign policy — one that will shape its future trajectory and its place within South Asia’s evolving geopolitical order. The hope is that, in the coming years, Bangladesh can emerge as a more independent actor in South Asia, advocating for a vision of regional cooperation that transcends the dominance of any single power. Whether it will succeed in this endeavor depends on its ability to balance the aspirations of its people with the demands of its regional partners. For now, Bangladesh’s pivot toward Pakistan and SAARC is a powerful statement that its future lies in the hands of its own people — not in the spheres of influence of its larger neighbors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdrjSC3Zu_vb	2024-11-14T09:31:14-08:00	
The US Presidency: A Challenging Role And Trump’s Management Stra...	The U.S. presidency is a demanding and exhausting role. To succeed, it requires a skilled and experienced team. However, the new cabinet members and senior management chosen so far by Donald Trump have raised some questions regarding their qualifications. Particularly, the choices for Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State are considered controversial in terms of their experience. Additionally, no announcements have yet been made for critical positions like Treasury and Energy. Trump's selections appear to favor loyalty and discretion, often choosing individuals unlikely to overshadow him and willing to carry out directives without hesitation. This dynamic is expected to require the U.S. deep state and bureaucratic structures to closely monitor and potentially restrain Trump's decisions. While Trump's policies are widely debated, some see potential positives. His plans include deporting undocumented immigrants, reducing government expenditures, and ending conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. He also aims to cut defense spending and address unemployment and inflation by raising tariffs to boost domestic production. Throughout this process, Trump's blunt rhetoric, criticisms of opposition journalists, and participation in summits like G7 and G20 will likely attract attention. Though he is expected to keep dialogue channels open with Turkey, a positive approach is not anticipated. At 78, Trump's health may provide a slight advantage in handling the physical toll of office. Despite his age, he avoids smoking and drinking, stays active by playing golf, and leads a relatively healthy lifestyle. By the end of his term, he may not appear as worn out as Joe Biden did. Whether Turkey will choose to mirror certain Trump policies remains to be seen. It is uncertain if a similar cabinet structure might emerge in Turkey, but this will likely become clearer in the coming period.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-14T09:29:26-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Turkey Page (Part III) – OpEd	The economic history of Africa is as old as the first people of mankind. The economy of the continent moved from hunter gathering to agriculture (farming and livestock rearing), fishing, manufacturing, trade, and international trade. Major trading states grew up in many parts of the continent but the most known were those of the Sahel belt, the East and Southern Africa regions, the first across the Sahara desert to north Africa and further to Europe and the others to Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. But the regions of the central and equatorial Africa had their own economic activities which were mostly involved in agriculture and hunter-gathering. The Northeast Africa region of the continent gave rise to the ancient Egyptian and Nubian civilizations which preceded the Greek city states and the Mediterranean island states of Minoa, Crete, and Rhodes. They traded with the East Africa States starting from present day Horn of Africa States all the way to Mozambique and southern Africa. The trading nations on the east of the continent from Egypt to southern Africa traded in animal products (Rhino horns, ivory, hides and skins), gold, iron ore, agricultural produce and implements such as endemic cereals. Most of these states became eventually part of the immense Muslim world and were connected to Arabia, Persia, and Asia, all the way to China. The monsoon winds which blow towards India and Asia during the months of April to October and towards Africa during the months of November to March played pivotal roles in the trade with Asia. The natural growth of the economy of the continent was disrupted by the European colonialism of the eighteenth to mid-twentieth century and its, sometimes, sub-human treatment of the populations of the continent. There was not much of an African economy for some two hundred years other than those connected with Europe and treated as part of the European economy. Some countries were doing well during this period while others dipped deeply into oblivion. Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa were prominent economies during this period, as were the economies of East Africa. The Sahel belt dipped, and the large empires and states of that region were slowly dismantled. Today they appear to be shadows of their great past. No wonder there are coups and counter coups in that region. The article is not designed to address African economic history but the above was a brief introduction to the story of the African economies to enable us to address the Türkiye-Africa growing relationship, which mostly revolves around the economies of the two parties. This itself is a subject which can pose its own controversies such as the incomparability of a continent with a population of some 1.5 billion and an area of some 30.3 million sq. km., surrounded by two oceans and two seas to a single country of some 90 million people and an area of 784,000 sq, km. But one must address the subject though, since there is a growing relationship between Africa and Türkiye, as the recent regular meetings between the two parties indicate. These are mostly related to economic partnering between the two parties over the past two decades through summits and forums and even visiting by one party or the other, to regions of the other. The first Türkiye-Africa Summit was organized in Istanbul in 2008 and was attended by 50 African states. The Summit ended with two documents, namely the 'Istanbul Declaration on the Africa-Turkey Partnership' and the 'Cooperation Framework for the Africa-Turkey Partnership,' which laid down the basis of the cooperation between Türkiye and Africa. Three years later, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with all his family members became the first foreign leader to visit Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, which was then undergoing one of its worst moments of its over two-thousand-year-old history. It faced then, a severe food shortage through one of the recurrent droughts of the region and volatile armed groups. It was a gesture most Somalis were grateful for and would never forget. The Türkiye economic partnering with Africa and the growing diplomatic relations between the two parties was further complimented by security assistance from Türkiye to some of the countries of continent. These security issues include among others the construction of its first military base in the continent in Mogadishu, Somalia in 2017 to train and support Somali security forces who are constantly battling imported foreign terrorism in the country. Türkiye also supplied its advanced military technologies to Ethiopia (the drones) to fight off the difficult Tigray region and other rebellions. It also works with the Libyan government in Tripoli to support it through military training, intelligence and other activities in the defense realm. It is, indeed, a large supplier of arms to the continent. The third Türkiye-Africa Summit was held again in Istanbul in December 2021, where it was declared that the two parties would cooperate in the areas of a) Peace, Security and Governance, b) Trade, Investment and Industry, c) Education, STI skills, Youth and Women Development, d) Infrastructure Development and Agriculture, and e) Promoting Resilient Health Systems. Türkiye was granted observer status at the African Union in 2005 and ever since, its trade with Africa has surged from some US$ 5.4 billion to over US$41 billion as of end 2022. In the fourth Türkiye-African Summit in October 2023, it was noted that the diplomatic presence of Türkiye in Africa has increased to forty-four countries, while some 38 African missions were open in Ankara. The success of Türkiye in Africa is based on a win-win formula, which apparently the foreign policy of Türkiye, follows. It also supports Africa’s push to become a permanent member of the G20 through the AU or African Union and a reform of the United Nations Security Council. The attempt to mediate between Ethiopia and Somalia, which has not come to fruition as yet is again another manifestation of Türkiye’s interest in settling issues in the continent peacefully and maintaining peace and sustainable development processes in the continent instead of conflicts and wars. The footprints of Türkiye in Africa has so far been successful and welcomed in the continent. Every nation has its motivations and Türkiye’s growing relationship with Africa cannot be said to be devoid of Turkish interests and the same goes for the African partner countries and the continent as well. The relationship thus involves not only humanitarian aspects but also diplomacy, economic partnerships benefiting both parties and indeed, security issues involving not only arms supplies but also training and other technological supports. It works for both parties and should continue on the same rising gradient. The Horn of Africa States region is one of the main footprints of Türkiye in Africa. The region is a major geostrategic location, which attracts different powers. The governments of the region and particularly Somalia, with the weakest governance infrastructure, was confused with the powers that be in the world, be they from the West or the East and was looking for a helping hand with a different approach, which Türkiye fulfilled with ease. A new ten-year agreement between Somalia and Turkey on protecting Somalia’s waters and signed on February 8th, 2024, complimented by another agreement on a joint hydrocarbon exploration both offshore and onshore in the country, and other contracts involving the management of the airport and seaport of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia have been major features in Türkiye’s presence in the region. The bilateral approach of Türkiye has given it more freedom to make its presence felt not only in the region but further afield in the continent. They are now present in the Sahel belt and have helped the Ethiopian government fight off rebellions in the country through its supply of advanced drone technologies to Ethiopia. There are regional rivals as well as major power competitions in the region, noting that the region is not only a geostrategic location but is also a resource rich region. The United Arab Emirates is one such regional rival, which has had a long presence in the region since the collapse of the previous regimes of both Ethiopia and Somalia. The UAE had its own difficulties in both Eritrea and Djibouti which did not appreciate the way the small emirate was handling itself in the region. The UAE is now in Somalia’s Berbera and Bossaso ports which it manages through some agreements with both the regional authorities and the federal Government of Somalia. It is also reported that they have expressed interest in the port of Kismayo. Note that the region owns several deep ports unlike West Africa where deep ports are a rarity. The main successes of Türkiye in the region and Africa is related to its emphasis on development diplomacy unlike other powers whose main goals appear to be related to security and denying others of footholds. This has been received well not only in the Horn of Africa States but also in the rest of the continent, as far west as Senegal. The Türkiye approach involves an integrated approach to development and business, and peacebuilding and peace maintenance. This has worked well so far and contrasts with others who are more involved in security and fake humanitarianism through aid agencies (NGOs), which are more of a scourge on the region than help. Many fail to observe the changing continent and continue the old approaches which have failed both the continent and others. Africa’s population is growing, youthful and more educated and have access to as much information as is possible in the google world of today. The emerging young leaderships of West Africa in the Sahel belt and even southern Africa (Botswana) are but examples of what to expect in the future. They seem to be bent on taking control of the wealth of their nations and ready to deal with those who accept the new realities in good faith. Türkiye seems to be of this last category and uninterested in a new 'scramble for the continent' as many of the new Africa forums and summits are described.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-14T09:27:49-08:00	
Turkmenistan Celebrates Its 29th Anniversary Of Neutrality: A Mod...	Understanding the Underlying Factors of State Neutrality On December 12, 1995, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality. This status was officially recognized and marked a significant milestone in the country’s modern history. Next year, Turkmenistan will celebrate the 29th anniversary of its neutrality. This day holds tremendous importance nationally, both for the Turkmen people and for international diplomacy. It is enshrined in the country’s constitution, for example in Article 2, where it states: 'The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan shall be the basis of its national and foreign policy.' And in Article 68, where it says: 'The president of Turkmenistan shall be the head of the state and executive power, the highest official of Turkmenistan, acting as guarantor of…state independence and the status of permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan…' (UN). Understanding State Neutrality This unique status aims to keep the country out of conflicts while promoting peace and international cooperation. The policy of neutrality is the set of political decisions and measures a neutral state freely takes in peace times with the aim of securing the credibility and efficiency of its legally binding neutrality. The policy of neutrality differs in neutral states and depends on their situation. Currently, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Ghana, and many other states are designated as neutral. However, all of them attained the status of neutrality to preserve themselves from the devastating effects of wars. Moreover, many states adopted neutrality policies during the Cold War era to avoid the political climate of the bipolar world. Turkmenistan chose neutrality after the Cold War ended, and it is the only state to adopt neutrality in peacetime, according to Kuru (2002). Historical Context of Turkmenistan’s Neutrality The origin of Turkmenistan’s neutrality dates back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Turkmenistan gained its independence and quickly adopted a neutrality policy to avoid regional conflicts and external influences. This neutrality policy reflects a deep value of the Turkmen people: preserving and promoting their cultural identity while maintaining peaceful relations with other countries. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan began its political transition process. This process swiftly integrated the political culture of neutrality into the de-Russification process and as a strategy for building a post-Soviet state. From the moment of independence, the concept of neutrality. Initially, the concept of neutrality is more related to wars, where sovereign states adopt neutrality to avoid involvement in armed conflict between states. Neutrality was a response to the geopolitical instability in Central Asia. Indeed, the status of neutrality allowed Turkmenistan to remain outside military alliances and conflicts while conducting active diplomacy. According to Article 1 of the Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality: 'Within the scope of realizing the integral rights of the sovereign state, Turkmenistan declares voluntarily about its permanent neutrality and will support it and put into practice consistently. The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan is the basis of its foreign and domestic policy aimed at strengthening the stability and consent in society, developing friendly and mutually beneficial relations with the states of the region and the whole world.' (Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality, 1995) In July 1992, the former president of Turkmenistan, during the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, illustrated the strategy of positive neutrality. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov defined the key characteristics of neutrality as follows: • No interference in the internal affairs of other states. • The use of force should be avoided in interstate conflicts. • The role of the United Nations in maintaining global peace should be recognized. • Promoting cooperation in various sectors. • Alliances should be avoided, whether military or political. • Develop relations to maintain good relations, etc. (Ahmed, R-Q and al., 2018). There are also obligations under its neutrality status such as • Turkmenistan will not join any political, economic, or military alliance. • Military power will be limited to safeguarding freedom and stability. • Good relations with all states, regardless of their size, will be maintained. • The neutrality policy emphasizes friendship, mutual respect, equality, justice, mutual benefit, and the loyal fulfillment of all responsibilities and wishes. Turkmen Neutrality in Service of Diplomatic Relations 'The status of neutrality is a key factor for the development of Turkmenistan’s mutually advantageous and constructive international partnership that meets national interests as well as the goals to ensure peace, prosperity, and sustainable development in the region and throughout the world,' noted former President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. Therefore, Turkmenistan has established balanced diplomatic relations with major powers such as Russia, China, and the United States, while preserving its independence. Neutrality has allowed Turkmenistan to maintain good international relations with major powers. This neutrality has provided economic and diplomatic opportunities for Turkmenistan. It has enabled the country to develop economic relations with different partners while avoiding alignment with any military or economic bloc. The country has established bilateral relations with the United States, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, China, India, Pakistan, and many others. Turkmen Neutrality: An Asset on the International Stage In 2002, Mr. Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, served from 1997 to 2006, congratulated Turkmenistan for its support of the treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. Moreover, neutrality plays a crucial role in international organizations. Turkmenistan is a member of many international organizations, such as the UN, and advocates for peace and stability in the region. This is why UN Secretary-General António Guterres told journalists that 'Turkmenistan is playing a very important role in international relations,' particularly in cooperation with the UN. He was encouraged by the improved relations between Central Asian countries in the face of these challenges, and regional cooperation has deepened, once again highlighting the important role played by Turkmenistan. Conclusion In conclusion, Turkmenistan’s neutrality remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy, allowing it to navigate a complex international environment with a certain degree of independence. Over the past 29 years, this position has reinforced its role as a mediator and promoter of peace in the region. Next year, on December 12, 2025, Turkmenistan, the land of Ahal Teke horses, will celebrate its 30th anniversary of neutrality. Turkmenistan’s neutrality is a remarkable example of peace. Undoubtedly, Turkmenistan refuses to harbor or produce weapons of mass destruction, to be part of military pacts, to provoke conflicts, or to take sides in conflicts. This message of neutrality and peace is gaining increasing relevance in our decade, which faces the growing escalation of global conflicts. Bibliography Ahmed, R-Q and al., (2018).

In A Trumpian World – OpEd	Trump won but did America lose? Harris lost but did America win? What is being seen in America, and in many parts of the world, is a reconfiguration and reconstitution of many social beliefs. These had catalysed human progress but now in a Trumpian World are being turned on their heads. Therefore, today in this brave new world - Women's rights conflict with her identity – Both Trump and Harris focused on womanhood. Harris focussed on reproductive rights while Trump focussed on the transgendering of the identity of womanhood. Harris pointed to the threat of regressiveness, Trump discussed the dangers of progressiveness. That 3% fewer women voters voted for Harris in 2024 as compared to Biden in 2020 suggests that reproductive rights was not as important in this election as the threat to their identity based wellbeing. Majority Is the new minority – The phenomenon of the majority claiming to be a minority is growing across the world. This is communicated in many ways - 'way of life is threatened', 'demography is changing', 'jobs are being taken away'. There is a desire to maintain status-quo, which could be a response to the hyped-up socio-economic insecurities. That is the reason for Muslims being targeted in India; Roma's, Jews and LGBTQI being targeted in Hungary and, American's opposition to migrants and minorities. The rise of the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Germany, and anti-migrant political parties in other parts of Europe is a consequence of these beliefs. Liberalism has become its own worst enemy – Many Rightwing issues are reactions to progressive endeavours and diktats. Unfortunately, equality, equity and rights for one group can cause uncertainty for another group. For example, many feminists oppose Transgender rights as they believe it goes against women's rights, socio-economic schemes for migrants reduces opportunities for natives and it goes on. Liberals wish to make society sustainable, inclusive, respectful, equitable, just and so on. They do so by focussing on the marginalised and historically disenfranchised. The Liberal idea includes giving a platform to the voiceless and holding truth to power. Undeniably, the scope of progressivism is extensive. Given this broad swathe that is focussed on, there is a possibility the liberal attention span is transient as they are forced to move from issue to issue – reproductive rights, migrant rights, welfarism, hate speech, peace, equal pay, and so on. For the lay person there is no common thread underlying these myriad issues thus making these efforts whimsical and disjointed. There seems to be an underlying liberal assumption that the process of changing the status quo will also educate people on the subject. The issue becomes the hot-topic and not the underlying beliefs that fuel the desire to shift the needle. Consequently, there is no effort to change the minds of the dis-interested and conservative. It is almost as if Liberals assume that everyone will come to terms with, and accept, changes instigated by them. Understandably, the response to these progressive endeavours is antagonism, distancing and disrespect. Liberals fight each other as there is no limit and definition of progressive and liberal values. The liberal ethos is individualistic - transgender versus feminism is an example. Lack of frameworks also results in shocking hypocrisy as seen in the Palestinian-Israeli, and Ukrainian-Russia conflicts. This is nutrition for the Right. Importantly, the Rightwing is attractive because it has a low threshold for their idea of victimhood and discontent. Let's not forget, Liberal work can result in 'othering' something Liberals rail against. Democrats looked down on Trump supporters, calling them members of a cult did nothing to help their cause. This mix of self-righteous outrage and snootiness further increases the divide and repels potential converts. Secularism has a Rightwing Version - Trump's victory indicates a coalescing of disparate Rightwing agendas and cabals. Here are a few - the Christian evangelists; the Hindu Right; Republican Jews, Hispanics and African-Americans; the Constitutionalists; the white-supremacists; the socio-economic Conservatives; the America-Firsters, the conspiracy theorists and Q-anon followers; the small-government and pro-business group; climate change deniers; crypto-promoters; the pro-life coalition; the anti-woke brigade; the 'save-masculinity' caucus; the second Amendmenters; the traditionalists; the anti-immigration bloc; free-speech preservers; the book banners brigade; fascists and so on. Trump has been able to get them to forget their inherent differences and opposing stances, and coalesce. However, the question remains about the duration that these natural enemies will peacefully live in Trump's Ark. Just as there is a Liberal Tower of Babel, a Tower of Babel of the Right is emerging. Courage is being redefined – The Indian businessman and one of the world's richest - Gautam Adani- congratulated Trump with 'If there is one person on Earth who stands as the embodiment of unbreakable tenacity......courage to stay true to his beliefs it is Donald Trump....'. He is not the only person to appreciate Trump's bigotry, sexism, childish prattle, petulance, criminality, lies, and view it as a virtue that is commendable, courageous and possibly emulatable. Trump's victory suggests a majority of Americans think so too, as do other rightwing world leaders. There is a difference between speaking one's mind whilst knowing and accepting the consequences, and speaking one's mind knowing there are no consequences. The latter is the version celebrated today. Many question whether Trump's victory is a defeat of morality. Maybe, like the stock-market undergoing a correction, Trump rising victorious from his morass is a correction of what humanity has held dear.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdp5VRQTAb3v	2024-11-14T09:24:19-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Unraveling The Complex Web Of Militancy In South As...	Since the Taliban take over, the Afghanistan land has become a most volatile as many terrorists group have regained their strength under the patronage of Taliban regime. United States withdrawal from Afghanistan certainly have severe repercussions for the region. Since then, Afghanistan has faced a multifaceted security challenges and increased terrorist activities. The Taliban's return to power has created a power vacuum, reshaping security dynamics and impacting terrorism concerns on both regional and global levels. A major concern is the presence and activities of groups like ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan Province), which has taken advantage of the instability to expand its influence. ISIS-K has carried out numerous attacks targeting civilians, the Taliban, and neighboring countries, aiming to undermine Taliban control and promote its extremist agenda. Al-Qaeda, though weakened, also remains active in Afghanistan but has maintained a relatively lower profile. Meanwhile, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has found safe haven in Afghanistan, operating freely from the region to challenge the authority of the Pakistani state. The volatile security situation in Afghanistan affects neighboring countries like Pakistan, Iran, and the Central Asian states, heightening their concerns over potential cross-border terrorist threats. Additionally, the Taliban's limited governance experience and scarce resources have raised doubts about their ability to effectively curb terrorist groups and maintain control over the country. Globally, there is also fear that Afghanistan could once again become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations with transnational agendas, posing risks beyond its borders. Pakistan has repeatedly urged the Taliban government to take action against the TTP within Afghan territory, but significant cooperation has yet to materialize over the past three years. Pakistani authorities are deeply concerned about the TTP's operations from Afghanistan, emphasizing the threat it poses to Pakistan’s national security. Most terrorist incidents in Pakistan are attributed to the TTP, which maintains sanctuaries within Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly shared intelligence with the Afghan government, providing specific details on TTP members’ locations and activities in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the TTP operates under the patronage of the Interim Afghan Government (IAG) due to its ideological and wartime linkages with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA). Having supported the TTA during the war, the TTP now receives reciprocal support from the IAG. However, it is time for the Taliban government to understand that the continued presence of the TTP in their territory could strain bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is believed that the Afghan government is using the TTP as leverage against Pakistan. This approach allows the TTP to operate from within Afghan territory to exert pressure on Pakistan for political or strategic gains. The deaths of many TTP leaders and fighters in Afghanistan, along with their use of US weapons, confirm the TTP's presence there. International intelligence reports also verify these deaths and the use of US weapons, refuting Kabul's claims that the TTP is not operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan. The international community, including Chinese intelligence, acknowledges the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan and their role in the Bisham attack on May 27, 2024. Despite the Supreme Afghan leader's decree against jihad outside Afghanistan, the TTP's non-compliance demonstrates their defiance of the Taliban government. The TTP has links with ISKP and other terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan. Moreover, Pakistan has been facing and fighting 'Khawariji terrorists' for the past two decades. These terrorists, while claiming allegiance to different groups, are essentially the same due to their Khawariji ideology of killing and destruction, which religious scholars have declared un-Islamic and haram. Although Khawariji groups like the TTP and ISKP appear to be at odds with each other, they are fundamentally alike, as both share a Khawariji ideology rooted in un-Islamic, inhuman, immoral, and barbaric practices based on a misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. ISKP consists of former commanders and militants of the TTP (the first Ameer of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed, was a well-known TTP commander from the Orakzai agency). Therefore, in addition to their shared ideology, their human resources, terrorist tactics, and targets overlap, confirming that these banned outfits are covertly connected. ISKP has demonstrated the capability to conduct attacks both within and outside Afghanistan, highlighting a strong operational network and recruitment strategy. The Taliban's insufficient counterterrorism efforts raise concerns about the potential for terrorist groups to plan and execute operations against U.S. interests and allies, suggesting that the threats emanating from Afghanistan have increased rather than diminished since the U.S. withdrawal. Both groups are foreign proxies and puppets of Pakistan’s enemies, used against Pakistan to serve the interests of their foreign masters. ISKP abhors the Afghan Taliban, engaging in physical confrontations with them and condemning them in propaganda campaigns. Strangely, however, it takes a softer approach toward the TTP, reinforcing the perception that they are collaborating at some level. No clashes between the TTP and ISKP have ever occurred, and both enjoy safe havens in Afghanistan without conflict or friction, supporting the notion that the TTP is using ISKP for deception. The Khawariji TTP perpetrates heinous terrorist attacks on civilian targets through ISKP to manage public backlash. While ISKP launches suicide bombers against religious scholars, mosques, religious gatherings, and groups, the TTP only claims responsibility for attacks on security forces. Both the Khawariji TTP and ISKP radicalize youth and coerce teenagers into committing 'haram' acts like suicide attacks; meanwhile, not a single terrorist leader has shown the courage to blow himself up with a suicide vest. The presence of the Khawariji TTP and ISKP in Afghanistan is well-documented, substantiated by various reports from security organizations and media outlets, including UNSC reports, U.S. and Western think tanks, among others. Pakistani religious scholars have unanimously declared these terrorist groups and their activities haram through the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, categorizing armed struggle within Pakistan as un-Islamic. Rather than remaining in denial, the Taliban government must collaborate with neighboring states to jointly combat and weaken the presence of the TTP and similar groups in Afghanistan. The prosperity and security of both Pakistan and Afghanistan are mutually dependent; thus, an insecure Pakistan means an insecure Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmReWeFEuPCrFf	2024-11-14T09:22:04-08:00	
Pakistan’s Strategic Reset With The US – OpEd	As the world braces for Donald Trump's second term as president, Pakistan finds itself at a critical juncture in its foreign policy and economic trajectory. While the return of a familiar face to the White House stirs its own brand of global anticipation, Pakistan sees this moment as an opportunity to reset, rebuild, and reassert itself on the international stage, particularly with respect to its relationship with the United States. The stakes are high, both for Pakistan’s domestic stability and its global positioning, especially given the turbulent history of US-Pakistan relations and the political challenges at home. The re-election of Donald Trump is notable not only for the political polarization it signifies in the US but also for the profound implications it holds for Pakistan, which continues to grapple with the legacy of past administrations’ foreign and domestic policies. While the Trump administration’s initial term was marked by sharp rhetoric and transactional diplomacy, Pakistan, like many others, hopes for a more constructive engagement in the years ahead. In this moment of global uncertainty, we are prepared to engage with the US in a manner that respects Pakistan’s sovereignty, acknowledges our efforts to combat terrorism, and supports regional stability. Pakistan has long played a pivotal role in the geopolitical dynamics of South Asia, particularly in the US-led war in Afghanistan. During Trump’s first tenure, despite the often contentious relationship, Pakistan proved to be a crucial partner in facilitating critical operations, particularly those related to the safe extrication of Afghans who had supported US forces. The role Pakistan played in facilitating peace talks, providing logistical support, and managing the delicate relationship with the Taliban was an essential component of the broader strategy that aimed to stabilize Afghanistan and secure US interests. Pakistan has also made significant contributions in the fight against terrorism, often at great cost to our own national security. Our army and intelligence agencies have been engaged in counterterrorism operations for over a decade, combating insurgents and militants that threaten both regional and global stability. As Pakistan continues its battle against extremism, we hope the new US administration recognizes and values the sacrifices Pakistan has made, especially in curbing terrorist networks operating across our borders. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has always been a balancing act—at times cooperative, at times fraught with tension. But the hope is that under Trump’s second term, this partnership can evolve into one of mutual respect, where both countries acknowledge each other’s interests and priorities, particularly with regard to Afghanistan, counterterrorism, and the broader quest for peace and security in the region. While Pakistan’s foreign policy challenges are significant, the internal political landscape is equally complicated. We face significant economic hurdles, a direct consequence of policy missteps by previous administrations. Over the last decade, Pakistan has struggled with fiscal instability, mounting debt, and a declining international reputation. These challenges were compounded by the policies of previous governments, which left the country isolated and burdened with unsustainable economic decisions. The current government recognizes that rebuilding Pakistan’s economy requires more than just fiscal adjustments—it demands strategic reforms, international cooperation, and a long-term vision for economic resilience. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, we are actively working to stabilize the economy, attract foreign investment, and restore Pakistan’s reputation as a reliable partner on the global stage. We are prioritizing infrastructure development, expanding our digital economy, and fostering an environment conducive to business growth. Our commitment to fiscal responsibility is underscored by ongoing efforts to meet the requirements set by international financial institutions, while also focusing on policies that will create sustainable jobs and improve the quality of life for our citizens. The government's focus on ensuring that economic policies serve the broader interests of the people, rather than narrow political agendas, will be crucial in navigating the current economic climate. As we move forward, Pakistan is keen to re-engage with the US administration on issues of mutual interest. Trade and economic collaboration should be at the center of this renewed relationship. For years, Pakistan’s economic potential has been stifled by a combination of internal mismanagement and external isolation. But as the world’s 25th-largest economy, Pakistan holds immense potential in sectors like agriculture, technology, energy, and services. With strategic international partnerships, we can unlock these opportunities and provide economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. At the same time, we must continue to assert our independence in decision-making. Pakistan is committed to engaging with the US and other global powers in a way that respects our sovereignty and prioritizes our national interests. This does not mean rejecting cooperation—it means approaching it with a sense of balance, ensuring that Pakistan’s priorities, particularly in terms of security and regional stability, are always at the forefront of any engagement. Pakistan is a country determined to move beyond the mistakes of the past. We are not blind to the flaws in our past policies, particularly those that exacerbated tensions with neighboring countries and the international community. However, Pakistan’s resilience is one of its defining features. Despite the economic setbacks and political challenges, our nation has weathered many storms, and we remain hopeful that with the right strategic guidance, we can overcome our current difficulties and emerge stronger. As we enter a new phase of engagement with the US, Pakistan must also look inward, working toward building a more transparent, inclusive, and accountable system of governance. This is not only critical for domestic stability but also essential in restoring international confidence in Pakistan as a reliable partner. The people of Pakistan, though weary from years of political instability and economic hardship, remain resilient and hopeful. They continue to believe in the potential of their country—a potential that has been stifled but is not yet extinguished. With the right international support, especially from strategic partners like the US, and a renewed commitment to internal reforms, Pakistan can return to the path of sustainable growth and development. In this new chapter, we call on the US administration, under President Trump, to engage with Pakistan as a partner in building a more stable, prosperous, and secure region. By doing so, we can turn the page on past grievances and focus on a future defined by collaboration, mutual respect, and shared goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRaH8jslmgCru	2024-11-14T09:20:11-08:00	
Northeast India: Obligatory 6 Assembly Seats Conduct By-Polls – O...	As the voting for by-polls in six assembly constituencies of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, obliged to fill up the vacant seats after all the legislators shifted their focus to the national politics, concluded peacefully on 13 November evening, the debates surfaced if the electoral exercises could have been prevented. The legislators, representing different political parties, participated and won in the recently conducted Lok Sabha polls and hence they had to resign from their respective assembly seats. The question definitely arises, why their party leaders selected them even though they were serving as legislators and whether it was not possible for them to break the cycle of repeated (often unwanted) elections for the sack of Indian tax payers' money! All the six seats (Assam-5 and Meghalaya-1) witnessed brisk voting by the electorates and the initial report suggests a voters' turn out of above 73 percent (out of cumulative 10 lakhs electorates). The fate of around 40 candidates (most of them are reportedly debutants) is now stored in the electronic voting machines, which will be opened on 23 November next. Along with these seats, by-polls for over 40 assembly constituencies (along with two Lok Sabha seats) in other parts of India are on the card along with the State assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand before the counting and result day. Assam's Samaguri assembly constituency remained in the media headlines for wrong reasons since the poll date was announced by the Election Commission of India. Frequent tussles between the supporters of various political parties were reported from the constituency in central Assam. Political violence even claimed the precious life of a BJP supporter and left many others injured. An incident of firing was also reported from Mari Puthikhaiti village targeting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Jitu Goswami. Three journalists were also allegedly intimidated by the Congress supporters. No doubt, a number of claims and counter-claims were raised by both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress leaders. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also in charge of the State home portfolio, criticized the opposition Congress for resorting to violence under cover of darkness to frighten the BJP workers. The saffron leader however asserted that no one will be allowed to sabotage or undermine the democratic process in the State. It was responded to by the Congress leaders alleging that the BJP workers were creating troubles to garner support for their candidate in the by-polls. Samaguri assembly seat, represented by Congress veteran Rakibul Hussain for five consecutive terms, was vacated after he won Dhubri LS constituency (defeating AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal by over 10 lakh votes). Now Hussain wants to hand over the Muslim majority Samaguri constituency to his young son Tanzil Hussain. The ruling BJP also fielded a young leader and incidentally Diplu Ranjan Sarma was the only non-Muslim candidate in Samaguri as other parties (including Aam Aadmi Party) batted for minority leaders for the by-polls. As the Muslim-centric AIUDF avoided the electoral race in Samaguri, it's expected to be a frontal battle between the Congress and BJP candidates there. Dholai (SC) and Behali seats continue to be favourable for the ruling party, where the first one was vacated by Parimal Suklabaidya to fight successfully in LS polls from Silchar Parliamentary constituency and the second one was left by Ranjit Dutta to fight for Sonitpur LS seat fruitfully. The BJP has fielded Nihar Ranjan Das in Dholai (contested by Congress candidate Dhrubajyoti Purkayastha and others) and Diganta Ghatowal in Behali assembly constituency (electorally challenged by former saffron leader Jayanta Bora, Asom Sanmilita Morcha supported CPI(ML) candidate Lakhikanta Kurmi and others). Sidli (ST) assembly seat was vacated by Jayanta Basumatary (United Peoples' Party-Liberal) to get elected from Kokrajhar LS seat. Now Nirmal Kumar Brahma is fighting to retain the seat for the BJP ally against the challenges primarily from Congress nominee Sanjib Warle and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) candidate Suddha Kr Basumatary. Another important ally to the ruling BJP alliance Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) put Diptimoyee Choudhury for Bongaigaon seat against Brajenjeet Sinha of the Congress. A recent talk show, telecast by a Guwahati-based satellite news channel DY365, discussed various electoral issues reflecting in Assam ahead of the by-polls in five constituencies. Anchored by senior television journalist Snigdha Sikha, the show highlighted different perspectives of elections in the State with a serious observation that the electoral system in India needs an urgent reform. Joining the discussion, aired live and repeated telecast next day, this writer argued that all five assembly constituencies needed the polls as the legislators participated in the last general elections successfully and shifted their focus to the Parliament. It could have been evaded if the political parties prevented these legislators from fighting in the national polls till term is over. Senior media personality Adip Phukan expressed serious concern over the incidents of pre-poll violence in the State, which was otherwise unheard of across the region. He also remained critical to AGP leader Phani Bhusan Choudhury who had recently won from the Barpeta LS seat and thus a by-election was necessitated in his assembly constituency Bongaigaon. But surprisingly, the AGP put Choudhury's wife as the party nominee in the by-polls. Phukan lamented that Choudhury represented Bongaigaon assembly constituency for four decades together and when it was time to hand over the responsibility to another party leader he (also the leaders of AGP) could repose faith on a house wife only. Not only Choudhury, the same tendency was shown by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma also, as he put his wife Mehtab Chandee Agitok Sangma in the by-polls for Gambegre assembly seat. The ruling National People's Party (NPP) nominee Mehtab Chandee has been challenged in the electoral battle by the Congress candidate Jingjang Marak, BJP nominee Bernard Marak, Trinamool Congress candidate Sadiyarani M Sangma, etc. The by-election became necessary as the influential legislator Saleng A Sangma of the Congress joined the Lok Sabha as its member from Tura Parliamentary constituency (defeating CM Sangma's sister Agatha in the last general elections). The constituency in Garo hills locality recorded as high as over 90 % poll-turnout. The ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) won both the seats scheduled for by-polls in the tiny State as the opposition candidates withdrew their nominations. State chief minister Prem Singh Golay's son Aditya (Tamang) Golay won from Soreng-Chakung assembly seat as his lone opponent Prem Bahadur Bhandari of Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF, led by former CM Pawan Kumar Chamling) preferred not to contest. Similarly, Namchi-Singhithang seat went to Satish Chandra Rai as lone opposition candidate Danial Rai of SDF left the race. The 32-member Sikkim legislative assembly now slips to the complete domination of SKM with no space for the opposition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRXVFsszcuGR2	2024-11-14T09:18:10-08:00	
Glimpses Of Everyday Imperialism At Work In The China-USA Trade D...	The U.S.-China Business Council report on 'U.S. Exports to China 2023' reveals that $151.3 billion worth of American goods were exported to China, supporting over one million U.S. jobs. According to the American Bureau of Economic Analysis, an official U.S. government agency, 'In 2023, U.S. exports of goods and services to China were $195.5 billion, down 0.9% from 2022, while imports from China were $447.7 billion, down 20.6% from 2022. As a result, the trade deficit with China declined to $252.1 billion'. However, these economic facts and figures do not determine U.S. policy toward China. Instead, the neo-colonial and imperialist strategies led by the U.S. and Europe shape the nature of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The imperialist, colonial, and capitalist core finds an alternative model of development and economic growth neither acceptable nor tolerable. In the name of trade disputes, U.S. President Donald Trump has consolidated and further reinforced the anti-Chinese policies and sentiments shaped by American business elites and their think tanks, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the American Enterprise Institute, the Atlantic Council, and others. These institutes, under the guise of research, often serve as the propaganda arm of the American ruling elites, represented by the U.S. government. Trump's second term is expected to be even more aggressively anti-China, particularly in terms of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and services. Trump has stated that 'tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,' Tariffs as an economic weapon used by imperialist countries like the U.S. and Western European nations to undermine and dismantle trading abilities of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Tariffs are the foundations of unfair trade practices led by the imperialist countries in the name of protecting domestic industries, innovation and intellectual properties. American and European consumers suffer the most because of anti-Chinese trade practices. However, these anti-Chinese tariffs are not intended to benefit American, European consumers or global economy. Instead, they aim to protect corporate profits by undermining high-quality, yet more affordable Chinese goods and services. The trade dispute is often framed as a trade war between the U.S. and China, a conflict that was both intensified and accelerated under Trump. According to Josh Lipsky, the ripple effects of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018 could have cost the global economy $700 billion. It is going to grow in the second term of Trump presidency. Who paid this huge cost? The simple answer is consumers—the working masses. The trade dispute between China and America led to rising consumer prices on goods and services provided by China. As a result, working people bore the brunt of the increased cost of living, paying more for everyday products that are essential to their lives. In a capitalist market society dominated by imperialists, both at home and abroad, who truly cares for the masses? The policies that shape this system often prioritise corporate profits over the well-being of ordinary people. American imperialism, along with its Western European allies, views the world primarily in terms of trade surpluses and deficits. These powers often use military conflicts to ensure the smooth flow of trade, free from any barriers imposed by governments in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These imperialist powers provoke anti-China sentiments in the China’s neighbourhoods by forming military, strategic and economic alliances. President Trump, as a businessman, aligned himself with this imperialist market trajectory in world politics, seeking to undermine and dismantle any successful models of state-led economic development, such as China's. There is little distinction between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to containing China's growth and development. Both parties compete to be more anti-China, striving to outdo one another in their approach to the issue. The Biden administration, for instance, continued Trump's policies on China, even increasing tariffs and levies on Chinese products and services. The recently concluded election campaign further revealed that there was little difference between President-elect Biden and his opponent, Kamala Harris, in their stance on undermining China's alternative development model. Both Republicans and Democrats share a common approach when it comes to China, united in their efforts to curtail its rise. American and European consumers are the beneficiaries of Chinese trade but these countries frequently accuse China of unfair trade practices, aiming to undermine its competitive advantage and progressive subsidy policies. They also accuse the Chinese state of engaging in business espionage and technology theft, alleging violations of international trade agreements. However, there is no truth to these accusations. In reality, China has reformed its Foreign Investment Law to encourage technological cooperation based on voluntary, mutually agreed-upon rules that govern business investments. The law not only bans forced technology transfers but also protects the trade secrets and intellectual property of foreign investors. These false allegations are part of a broader strategy to undermine China and its creative, technological, and scientific capabilities, as well as the productive potential of its skilled workforce. American imperialism and its European allies have failed to acknowledge the failures of their capitalist models of development, which has led to a declining ability to meet their consumption needs through domestic production. Capitalism, driven by the pursuit of profit and mass consumerism, has undermined domestic industries, contributing to deindustrialisation in both Europe and America. The trade deficit is a direct result of this imbalance between production and consumption. In contrast, China's trade surplus is driven by its technologically advanced workforce, which produces more than it consumes. As a result, China exports more and imports less, leading to a trade surplus. Meanwhile, capitalist countries like the United States and those in Western Europe consume more than they produce, which causes their imports to exceed exports and results in trade deficits. In this context, imperialist nations are engaged in an economic war with China over trade surplus. However, this trade dispute does not serve the interests of people worldwide. The imperialist powers are deflecting attention from their own capitalist failures by unjustly blaming China for its development, which is fundamentally centered around the well-being of its people and people across the world. China should reconsider its approach to retaliating against imperialist market logic. Moving away from a corporate-driven market strategy based on tariffs and levies is crucial. Increasing tariffs on American and European goods does not benefit consumers in China, Europe, America, or anywhere else in the global market. Instead, China should focus on promoting worker-led cooperative business models and investment strategies, both domestically and internationally. By prioritizing these models, China can foster more equitable and sustainable economic relationships that serve the interests of workers and consumers worldwide, rather than continuing to rely on punitive trade measures designed by the neocolonial imperialist and their crony capitalists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfedSx_iNpPQ	2024-11-14T09:16:40-08:00

Moscow Hopes Bishkek Can Help Control Kyrgyz Migrant Workers In R...	Popular militias made up of immigrants have been forming across the Russian Federation in cities with significant diaspora populations. These militias are composed of both citizen and non-citizen migrants. Ostensibly, these militias are meant to work with police to enforce laws and keep the peace between these communities and the Russian majority. These groups, however, also defend these immigrant communities against Russian police and Russian nationalist groups such as the Russian Community (see EDM, October 15). These immigrant militias are becoming models for indigenous and Roma populations, groups that the Russian police have not always been able to control (Window on Eurasia, October 31). As a result, over the last several weeks, Moscow has quietly entered into agreements with Kyrgyzstan and possibly other countries to have officers come to the Russian Federation to work with these immigrant groups, an action Bishkek has acknowledged openly but Moscow has sought to downplay (T.me/mvd_official_kg, November 5; T.me/mediamvd, November 7). Amid the escalating tensions regarding immigrants, the Russian media’s approach to downplay the issue is understandable but no longer sustainable. After an article by Russian journalist Vladislav Maltsev appeared in Zavtra on November 10 entitled '’Kyrgyz Policemen’ and ‘National Militias’ are Already in Our Cities,' the Russian journalist pointedly asked whether the state was losing control of order (Zavtra, November 10). Maltsev’s article is sure to trigger a flood of commentaries in the coming days and may even put pressure on Moscow to change course, and thus making the issue worthy of close attention. According to Maltsev, 'migrant ghettos that have formed in many Russian cities and are already acquiring their own official security forces either in the form of militias created by the immigrants themselves or by foreign interior ministry offices who [with Moscow’s permission] have come to Russia in uniform.' (See Zavtra, April 14, 2021; EDM, October 22 for more on migrant ghettos in Russian cities.) Maltsev suggests that many Russians will be concerned about how these foreign officers are not being subordinated to Russian police, but have diplomatic immunity and can thus interact with migrants with little regard for Moscow. Specifically, he notes that Bishkek officials intend these representatives to work in an 'independent' and 'extraterritorial' fashion, much like European officials did in China in the 19th century, which will alarm a large swath of Russians. Such terms are alarmist and are intended to be. Maltsev says what is occurring in Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities such as Bratsk and Tyumen are far more disturbing and concrete. There, he reports, citing statements by local branches of the Russian interior ministry, ever more migrants, confronted by anti-immigrant moves from the Russian authorities and population, have sought to form ethnic militias. Adding that, to a lesser extent, similar trends are taking place in European Russia. The Russian authorities have told them that only citizens of the Russian Federation have the right to form militias, but that is less of an obstacle than many may think, Maltsev continues. Many migrants have now taken Russian citizenship, and Moscow has encouraged them to do so. Over the last two months, these migrants with Russian citizenship have been forming ethnic militias in cities east of the Urals. They now are going to be assisted by officers from Kyrgyzstan, raising the likelihood of new and larger clashes between these migrant groups and Russian nationalists, such as the Russian Community (Window on Eurasia, October 23; see EDM, October 15, 29). The danger of such clashes was highlighted last month in a suburb of Chelyabinsk, where Russian nationalist groups fought with Roma, who had taken control of local administrative bodies. This tension is increasingly found across Russia, where non-ethnic Russians, immigrant or indigenous communities, have assumed sufficient control over local institutions and feel free to ignore Russian laws and practices. This problem is only going to get worse, Russian journalist Kirill Shulika says. 'It is not surprising that already various groups such as ‘the Russian Community’ have emerged to assume the role of militias' and that these will grow as veterans of the war in Ukraine return home. (On that prospect more generally, see Window on Eurasia, September 15, 2023.) Moscow has been searching for some solution but has remained uncertain, although the agreement with the Kyrgyzstan interior ministry suggests it may now act on that more generally. Those who assume that the local police can handle this spreading problem are profoundly wrong. Instead, the fighting is likely to be not between the police and the closed diasporas but between the closed diasporas and militias that neither Moscow nor the regional governments will be able to control. If Moscow cannot come up with a more effective strategy, Shulika suggests, these trends will open the way to a war that will shake the Russian Federation to its foundations (Rosbalt, October 29). Moscow’s decision to allow interior ministry officers from foreign countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, to try to take control of this situation is an effort in that direction. Both that the Kremlin is feeding demands among immigrants for the formation of their own militias and that Russian officials are playing all this down suggest that such Russian invitations to foreign police forces are an act of desperation. Moscow will either have to reverse course or face even more problems ahead. Despite all the Putin regime’s coercive resources, it is unavoidable that Moscow is losing control of the streets and districts of Russian cities to militias, both Russian and non-Russian.

Japan: Shigeru Ishiba Reconfirmed As Prime Minister Amid Politica...	By Pratnashree Basu Japan’s domestic politics are experiencing a turbulent phase with a loss of public support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been in power since the Second World War. This loss of support can be attributed to ongoing inflation and rising costs of living, political corruption, an ageing society and a shrinking workforce. The results of the recent elections in late October reflect public frustration, with the LDP losing a majority vote share for the first time in a decade, prompting a special National Diet session on 11 November to elect the country’s Prime Minister. The LDP’s support rating dropped significantly, with Shigeru Ishiba’s cabinet’s approval falling as low as 34 percent in recent polls, prompting the LDP to court the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) for parliamentary support ahead of the prime ministerial vote on 11 November. Though the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner Komeito retained the largest bloc in Japan’s recent election, they lost their lower house majority held since 2012, leaving Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reliant on smaller opposition parties to advance his policies. This fragility was highlighted when Ishiba’s confirmation vote went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, reflecting tenuous support within the National Diet. Nonetheless, as the party with the most votes, Japanese lawmakers reconfirmed Shigeru Ishiba as Prime Minister in the special Diet session. Why Ishiba called for snap elections Ishiba’s decision to hold snap elections on 27 October 2024 was driven by the ongoing party finance scandal, involving unreported political funds, that had already weakened support for the LDP. To avoid further erosion of confidence, Ishiba aimed to dissolve the Diet immediately after fulfilling formal obligations, including his administration policy speech and responding to party representatives' questions. The quick election was intended to secure public confidence before the administration’s image deteriorated further, as it was crucial for the LDP not only to retain a majority but also to avoid losing seats, as the prolonged debate over the scandal could lead to more losses. The LDP, which has governed Japan for a decade despite frequent leadership changes, was poised to winagain due to low voter turnout and a divided opposition. This, along with support from its coalition partner, Komeito, made their victory highly likely. Relying on Komeito to secure a majority gives the party more influence over the LDP’s policies. Komeito has historically resisted some of the LDP's hawkish security measures, such as acquiring longer-range missiles and lifting restrictions on weapons exports, which have prevented Japan from sending arms to Ukraine or Southeast Asian nations opposing China's claims in the South China Sea. The general election was thus a critical test for PM Ishiba. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), had just chosen Yoshihiko Noda as its leader and was believed to be ill-prepared for the election, especially with the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) contesting over a hundred constituencies. This split the opposition vote, potentially reducing seat losses for the LDP. A majority win would have strengthened Ishiba’s position within the LDP and could have boosted public support, helping to mitigate the fallout from the party finance scandal. Many LDP members of parliament (MP), therefore, backed the early election to swiftly stabilize the political landscape. The road ahead However, the general election left the country in political uncertainty, primarily due to unexpected losses for the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Ishiba. The failure to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament marked a significant shift in Japan's political landscape. This election, triggered by Ishiba’s attempt to consolidate power amid scandals surrounding political funds, resulted in gains for opposition parties such as the CDP and the DPP. While the LDP and Komeito won the most seats in the election, they must now rely on smaller opposition parties to pass legislation, signalling a tenuous and complicated road that the administration must now navigate. This new dynamic has a range of implications. For one, it could stymie the legislative progress, impacting policy continuity on key issues like economic recovery, security, and defence reforms—particularly as Japan seeks to bolster its defence capabilities in light of regional tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The election also raises uncertainties about the Bank of Japan’s ongoing monetary tightening, as any political reshuffling can interfere with planned financial policies aimed at tackling Japan’s economic challenges like inflation. Additionally, the political instability may strain Japan’s external relations and its commitments to regional security cooperation, especially with allies like the United States. These developments come at a time when Japan faces critical security challenges related to China's assertive posture in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific​. Ishiba is expected to introduce a new cabinet soon with Keisuke Suzuki likely to be the justice minister, Taku Eto as agriculture minister, and Komeito’s Hiromasa Nakano as land minister. Other posts will likely be retained by members from Ishiba’s previous cabinet. Ishiba’s immediate challenges include finalising a supplementary budget to address rising costs of living, likely needing backing from the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) whose leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, is also facing personal scandals. While the disunity among opposition parties, which are divided on major issues and failed to rally around an alternative candidate for prime minister, may prove to serve as an advantage for him, Ishiba certainly has a difficult road ahead. Party lawmakers are also reportedly pressuring Prime Minister Ishiba to consider resigning after next spring’s budget clears. With Upper House elections scheduled for next year, the ruling coalition's slim majority may further weaken unless Ishiba can rebuild public trust, which the finance scandal has shaken. LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama addressed criticism regarding the party’s response to the political funds scandal, emphasizing that it was managed rigorously. He noted, however, that the LDP has struggled to convey this to the public, who perceive the issue as involving 'slush funds' and 'tax evasion.' With Ishiba set to continue as the Prime Minister, Japan’s previous foreign and security policies are likely to continue. However, domestically, Japan’s political future will depend significantly on the ability of the ruling coalition or any new alliances to stabilize the government, navigate internal divisions, and build a coherent policy framework in a politically fragmented Diet.

Transatlantic Energy Security From A Baltic Perspective – Analysi...	By Justina Budginaite-Froehly (FPRI) -- Years before Russia started its full-scale war against Ukraine, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, correctly assessing the Russian threat, implemented far-reaching reforms to end their energy dependence on Russia. Successful implementation of multiple infrastructural projects and energy market liberalization significantly improved Baltic energy security. It made the region a role model for the rest of Europe. Further energy security upgrades are planned in the coming months when the Baltic states will desynchronize their electricity grids from the Russia-controlled IPS/UPS electricity system in February 2025. While celebrating these noteworthy achievements, the Baltic states and their NATO allies should be aware of the potential increase in Russian gray zone activities that could be directed against further consolidation of the European energy security stronghold in the Baltics. Baltic Energy Security Upgrades In terms of energy security, the Baltic states were an isolated energy island until 2014. Having no access to European electricity and gas networks and being heavily dependent on energy imports from Russia, they were exposed to Russia’s political blackmailing and interference in domestic politics. The game-changer was Lithuania’s decision to install an LNG terminal on its Baltic coast. Despite active pressure from Russia, Lithuania successfully implemented the project and at the same time carried out far-reaching reforms to liberalize its gas market, forcing Russia’s Gazprom out of the Lithuanian energy sector. Similar, albeit less principled, measures were also taken in Latvia and Estonia. While being quite an unusual project at a time when most of the European countries were still comfortable with fostering and even deepening their energy 'partnerships' with Russia (Germany’s decision to install the Nord Stream 2 pipeline serves as the best example), the Lithuanian LNG terminal brought the full spectrum of positive effects from short-term gas price reductions to the long-term ability to serve regional and broader European energy security interests. The Baltic states’ geo-economic shift in terms of energy supplies was remarkable. Having covered all its natural gas needs with imports from Russia back in 2013, Lithuania, followed by Latvia and Estonia, became the first European country to ban all Russian gas imports, including its LNG, in April 2022 as a reaction to the invasion of Ukraine. Other European countries, despite Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, remain eager consumers of Russian gas and have even increased the import volumes of Russian LNG by 11% year over year in the first half of 2024. The fully operational LNG infrastructure in the Lithuanian seaport Klaipėda and well-established partnerships with LNG suppliers, mostly from the US and Norway, enabled Lithuania’s, and the wider Baltic region’s, principled energy policy and their smooth transition from Russia to other gas suppliers. Having become one of the first European importers of US LNG in 2017, Lithuania’s LNG imports from the US peaked in 2022, making the US the leading LNG supplier for Lithuania and setting a clear sign that increased transatlantic cooperation was the right answer to Russia’s aggression and destabilization attempts. In the first six months of 2024, Lithuania’s LNG imports were almost equally split between the US and Norway as the two main suppliers. In addition to the Lithuanian LNG terminal that symbolically holds the name 'Independence,' further infrastructural upgrades in the Baltics followed, strengthening the region’s leading role in European energy security efforts even further. The recent completion of the Enhancement of Latvia-Lithuania interconnection project (ELLI) provided Lithuania with better access to the Inčukalns underground gas storage (UGS) in Latvia, which is unique in the region, serving the function of a crucial gas backup facility. The Baltic countries fill the storage in summer when gas prices are low to avoid gas shortages in winter when both gas consumption and its prices increase significantly. At the same time, the bidirectional ELLI pipeline allows increasing gas flows from the Lithuanian LNG terminal to Latvia and Estonia. The importance of the Gas Interconnection Poland–Lithuania (GIPL), which has been operational since May 2022, cannot be overstated. The bidirectional pipeline serves as the key element of the European North-South gas corridor connecting the Baltic region and Finland with Continental Europe. It further diversifies the Baltic countries’ gas import routes and opens new possibilities for exploiting Lithuania’s LNG terminal as an entry point for LNG to the European gas market. A recent agreement between Slovakia and Poland to bring LNG originating from the US through the Klaipėda LNG terminal, where Poland’s oil and gas company Orlen has secured long-term capacity, and further onwards through GIPL and the Vyrava interconnector between Poland and Slovakia from January 2025, marks the changing geo-economic realities in the region. Instead of using the traditional East-West interconnection originating in Russia and going through Ukraine, Slovakia will be supplied with natural gas from the North for the first time by using this new route. This is a crucial step forward for the country as its traditional gas supply route originating in Russia and passing Ukraine in transit counts its last days as the gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine comes to an end on January 1, 2025. Beyond dismantling dependencies on Russian gas, the Baltic states are about to get rid of remaining links with Russia in the electricity sector, too. Currently, the Baltic countries are connected to Russia on the power system level, but in February 2025, they will disconnect their grids from the so-called BRELL electricity ring, which has provided unified terms for grid operation in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia within the Russia-controlled centralized dispatch of Integrated Power System/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS). After a decade-long preparation, the Baltic states will finally synchronize their electricity grids with the Continental European Network (CEN). To achieve this goal, multiple power interconnectors with Finland (Estlink 1 and 2), Sweden (NordBalt), and Poland (LitPol Link) have been installed on- and offshore, allowing the Baltic states to halt electricity trade with Russia and Belarus. All of these changes in the Baltic energy landscape have significantly increased regional and European energy security. But exactly because of their central role in consolidating the North-South energy corridor that will contribute to eliminating Russia’s role as an energy supplier to Europe, the new infrastructural installations — Klaipeda LNG terminal, gas pipelines, and power cables — risk becoming a target of Russian gray zone activities. Russia and its allies China and Belarus already have a long list of hybrid involvement in the Baltic states and Poland that ranges from damaging Balticconnector, an underwater gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia, to orchestrating a migrant crisis in the border region between Belarus, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, among multiple other hostile actions. Kaliningrad as a Security Factor for the Baltics In light of current energy security upgrades in the Baltic states, Russia can be expected to try to exploit any opportunity to harm their progress in advancing the consolidation of the North-South energy corridor. The fact that the last ties of the Baltic states to Russia are cut might provide additional motivation for Russia to increase its hybrid activities in the region. The Kaliningrad exclave, with its geography and high militarization level constituting a permanent security threat to the Baltic states, might become an important focal point in this respect. With the Baltic states’ energy supply routes switching from the East-West to North-South, the Kaliningrad exclave is becoming an isolated energy island. Situated on the Baltic coast between Lithuania and Poland and separated from mainland Russia by the territories of Lithuania and Belarus, Kaliningrad is traditionally supplied with energy through the Lithuanian territory. It is also (still) an integral part of the BRELL electricity ring via the Baltic states’ grids, but with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia leaving the BRELL agreement in February 2025, Kaliningrad will be left to operate in an isolated regime. In preparation for desynchronization by the Baltic states, isolated operation tests have been carried out annually in the Kaliningrad power grid since 2019. Even though the official Russian position states that the exclave is ready for the upcoming changes, the fact that the power system stability in Russia and Kaliningrad will not be tied to the situation in the Baltics anymore might encourage Russia to increase its pressure on the Baltics through provocations and sabotage. One of the most likely Russian hostile measures is expected to be oriented toward testing the Baltic states’ and NATO’s resilience to increased levels of propaganda, accentuating the need to defend the economic and security interests of Kaliningrad amid the shifting geo-economic realities in the region. Similar claims concerning the enforcement of EU sanctions on the supply of certain goods to Kaliningrad via Lithuania by rail have already caused unrest in the EU. Increased attempts to sabotage Baltic energy infrastructure can be expected a year later when Lithuania’s long-term gas transit contract with Gazprom will run out in December 2025. After losing its stable pipeline gas supply through the Lithuanian territory, Kaliningrad will be exclusively supplied by Russian LNG through the Kaliningrad LNG terminal and supported by an underground gas storage facility. This will increase the presence of Russian LNG vessels in the Baltic Sea, leading to the growing risk of targeted damage to the Baltic states’ offshore energy infrastructure. Given the exclave’s proximity to the NATO members Lithuania and Poland, other security risks, such as increased spying attempts as witnessed in the case of the Russian shadow oil fleet off the coast of Gotland, should also be taken into consideration. Conclusion Two main conclusions can be drawn from the Baltic success story in transforming the region into a European energy security stronghold. First, the transatlantic partnership in the energy domain is crucial for Europe in changing its gas trade patterns. With stable imports of US LNG, the North-South energy corridor has emerged as a strategically important solution for energy security issues in Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. It is, therefore, fatally wrong to halt new gas export permits for US LNG exporting companies in such a crucial stage of geo-economic re-orientation in Europe. Second, energy security strategies are only semi-mature if they are not backed with appropriate measures of energy infrastructure protection. Although NATO is moving in the right direction strengthening its role in this area, there is still much room left for Russia’s malign strategies, especially in the contested Baltic Sea, where Russia’s concerns over the energy security of Kaliningrad might soon emerge as a new justification for its increased presence along the Baltic shores. It is clear that for the Baltic energy security stronghold to withhold the pressures from Russia and expand toward consolidating the North-South energy corridor in Europe, the transatlantic commitment to shared political, economic, and security goals must adapt to a new security environment while pro-actively pursuing its strategically important geo-economic agenda.

Sri Lanka’s Political Elite Fails To Gatekeep Change – Analysis	By Roshni Kapur The victory of Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Sri Lanka’s 21 September 2024 presidential elections signals more than a domestic shift towards anti-incumbency and popular discontent with mainstream politics. It also reflects a global trend where non-elite actors are disrupting established institutions by assuming power and promising to bring deep structural change. In Sri Lanka’s case, traditional political gatekeepers were unable to prevent the National People’s Power (NPP) party’s rise to power. Dissanayake’s victory marks a fundamental shift in Sri Lankan politics. In an unprecedented move, neither of the two main parties — the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, or their alliances or political offshoots — managed to regain power. Previously on the fringes of mainstream politics, the NPP has promised to change the political culture by ending patronage, corruption, authoritarianism, public sector waste and poor decision-making. Dissanayake is the leader of both the NPP and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a former insurgent group that attempted to capture state power through rebellion in the 1970s and 1980s. The JVP transformed into a mainstream political party under new leadership in the 1990s and its decision to establish the NPP in 2019 represents a strategic rebranding to distance itself from its turbulent past. As head of the party, Dissanayake exemplifies this new generation of reformist young leaders committed to democratic processes, with his assumption of power marking the start of a new political culture that promises to be inclusive, representative and democratic. The NPP’s electoral transformation is noteworthy. After securing little more than three per cent of votes in the 2019 presidential elections, Dissanayake won the competitive contest of the 2024 elections. This turnaround stems from several factors. Although democratic backsliding has been taking place for years in Sri Lanka, the militarisation and further centralisation of power during COVID-19 has greatly eroded civil liberties and democratic freedoms, leading to further deterioration of social, political and economic crises. The Aragalaya protest movement in 2022 triggered a fundamental shift, managing to compel former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. But it lacked the political power to bring institutionalised change and enabled Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to use repressive measures and revive the old order. Yet the movement’s momentum continued, enabling the NPP to advance demands for political change through democratic processes. Repeated postponements of local government polls gave the NPP time to strengthen its presidential campaign and ascend as a formidable electoral contender. The NPP’s strong anti-corruption campaign also allowed the party to effectively position itself as the champion of a principled political order. Leveraging strong anti-incumbency sentiment and public mistrust of the dominant elite and state institutions that are seen as corrupt, self-serving and deeply politicised, the NPP promised to transform state institutions and reverse decades of institutional decay. The rise of a political contender from a non-traditional party is not unique to Sri Lanka but part of a wider pattern occurring in many democratic states which has seen power shifting from mainstream actors to newcomers outside of elite politics. These newcomers challenge the legitimacy of traditional elites by accusing them of corruption, nepotism and patronage, convincing their support base that the current order lacks democratic and inclusive values. Political elites usually employ two strategies to prevent a loss of power and relevance. They might attempt to harness the newcomer’s potential and outmanoeuvre political rivals through co-option, though this type of devil’s bargain usually benefits the outsider by providing them with sufficient support to become legitimate actors in a bid to govern. Alternatively, political elites gatekeep by spreading false or exaggerated narratives to marginalise a political outsider, including by forging alliances with rivals to prevent the novice from entering mainstream politics. This tactic was used in Sri Lanka — false narratives were spread that the NPP had instigated violence during the Aragalaya and that it intends to monopolise all sectors. But these propaganda tools were unsuccessful in socially and politically marginalising the NPP. The JVP’s transformation from an insurgent group into a political party and the subsequent formation of the NPP not only showcases its resilience to survive as a social entity but also its ability to adapt to changing domestic and global shifts. The NPP understands that it needs to go beyond its core voter base to gain broader support, including by adopting a more inclusive approach to overcome decades of deep mistrust within minority groups. Despite the inter-ethnic and inter-religious solidarity during the 2022 protest movement, the country continues to be divided along ethnic and linguistic lines. Dissanayake’s government is currently enjoying a honeymoon period that could bring a marginal victory at the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for 14 November 2024. But there are doubts on whether the NPP can secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority and more broadly, whether the government will continue the path of constitutional and political reforms or lose momentum as elite actors seek to delegitimise it. These actors will likely stress the NPP’s lack of political experience and the JVP’s violent past as the party attempts to lead the country to full economic recovery, navigate great power relations and strengthen engagement with minority groups.

Biden’s Economic Time Bomb: A Warning To Trump – OpEd	By Daniel Lacalle The insane neo-Keynesian policies implemented by the Biden-Harris administration have created persistent inflation and record levels of debt with two objectives: to bloat Gross Domestic Product and jobs with public spending and government jobs. The United States’ insane inflation is solely due to out-of-control spending and currency printing. Corporations, wars, or supply chains cannot cause aggregate prices to rise, nor can they consolidate the increase even at a slower pace. Although this can have an impact on individual prices, the only factor that causes aggregate prices to rise year after year is the decline in the value of the US dollar that the government issues. Over 20.5% accumulated inflation over the past four years, government deficit spending has reached nearly $2 trillion annually despite record tax receipts and a growing economy, public debt has reached almost $36 trillion, and the monthly job figure includes an astonishing 43,000 new government jobs each month. In 2023, nearly 25% of all job gains were government ones, and the entirety of the growth of the labor force in the past four years came from foreign workers. The latest jobs figure is so poor it seems disingenuous to blame it on hurricanes and strikes, as if economists and forecasters had not considered those two factors in their estimates. Furthermore, the only factor that continued to increase uncontrollably was the number of government jobs, adding 40,000 new positions to an overall total of just 12,000 jobs. No wonder the labor participation rate and employment-to-population ratios remain below 2019 levels. Furthermore, in the latest GDP figure, government spending accounted for 30% of the annualized growth, while investment was basically stagnant. In the past nine quarters, government spending has been one of the top drivers of GDP growth, and its contribution to GDP in the third quarter of 2024 was the largest in a year. This is upside-down economics in full swing. Private sector investment weakness, higher taxes for the productive economy and government spending and debt driving the economy. Of course, this never ends well. The Harris-Biden administration arrived in January 2021, when the economy was bouncing back strongly. Instead of allowing the private sector to thrive, it embarked on a strategy of out-of-control spending and tax increases with two objectives: increase the size of government in the economy so much that the next administration would be unable to reduce it enough in four years. The second objective was to bloat growth and job figures so aggressively that the next administration will see a recession if it reduces public sector growth. You may ask yourself why they would do it if Harris intended to win the elections. If Kamala Harris wins, she will continue to expand the size of government, inflate prices through spending and printing, and blame companies and stores for these actions. The Biden-Harris administration has left a massive time bomb for Trump and Elon Musk’s government efficiency office if they win. It will be almost impossible to avoid a recession if they cut discretionary spending and eliminate duplicate jobs. It is the same strategy that the socialists followed in Greece, Spain, and France, by the way. However, the socialist strategy may backfire. The evidence is that citizens do not value Biden’s policies and the state of the economy. The approval rate regarding the economy is atrociously low, 39.8%, according to RCP. United States citizens do not believe that they are better off than in January 2021. Inflation, immigration, and rising taxes have crippled small businesses and families. Furthermore, a strong pro-growth strategy and lower taxes will likely boost the dormant investment figure, create jobs in the private sector, and help small businesses achieve critical mass and grow. In Argentina, Milei recognized the necessary actions and cautioned the citizens about the inevitable reduction of the bloated state. The Kirchner socialists left a more significant time bomb legacy than what Trump might inherit. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Lower inflation led to lower taxation, an eight-month budget surplus, and rapidly improving public finances. The biggest risk for the United States economy and the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency is out-of-control public spending and constant currency printing added to tax hikes. Healing public finances and reducing government jobs may have a temporary negative impact on GDP, but higher exports, investment, and private sector jobs will likely compensate for it, and the result will be better for the US dollar and American citizens. More government is always poorer citizens. The potential of the United States economy’s private sector is much greater than the short-term negative impact of efficiency and budget control on headline GDP.

Malaysia Energy Profile: Second-Highest Producer Of Petroleum And...	Malaysia is the second-highest producer of petroleum and other liquids in Southeast Asia and the fifth-highest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) globally in 2023. Malaysia is strategically located in the South China Sea and borders the Malacca Strait, both of which are important maritime routes for energy trade.1 Malaysia’s oil and natural gas production is expected to peak at 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2024, according to national oil company Petronas.2 This would be an increase of just over 200,000 BOE/d from the 1.79 million BOE/d produced in 2023.3 Malaysia’s national oil company Pertonas, with Enilive and Euglena, will build Petronas’s first biorefinery. The biorefinery, which will be located at the Pengerang Integrated Complex, will produce 12,500 barrels per day (b/d) of sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Construction will begin at the end of 2024, and commercial operation is slated to start in 2028.4 According to Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, Malaysia plans to achieve a 70% share of installed electricity generation capacity for renewable energy by 2050. The government estimates it will need $143 billion in investments to meet its target. To help develop its renewable sector, Malaysia lifted its ban on renewable energy exports that it initiated in 2021.5 The increase in demand for renewable energy from foreign markets will prompt development of domestic renewable generation capacity on a larger scale to meet the higher demand. Petroleum and other liquids In 2023, Malaysia had proved oil reserves of 2.7 billion barrels—the second-largest oil reserve in the Southeast Asia. Although reserves have declined since 2022, there were 19 new discoveries in 2023, which could add over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to Petronas. Of these discoveries, 16 are located in the Sarawak state, and 3 are in the Sabah state.7 Following the Malaysia Bid Round 2023 (MBR 2023), six production sharing contracts and one discovered resource opportunity (DRO) were awarded. A DRO is an opportunity where a company can obtain the rights to an undeveloped discovery from a government to invest in its development. All offshore blocks for MBR 2023 in Sarawak and Northwest Sabah Basins are now licensed as a result of this bid round.8 In the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021–2025), the government outlined its plan to reduce carbon intensity economy-wide by 45% from 2005 levels against gross domestic product (GDP) and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To support these goals, Petronas plans to cap operational emissions at 49.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its Malaysian operations by the end of 2024. Petronas and its subsidies has also targeted a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in methane emissions from its natural gas value chain by 2025.9 Block nameCompanyBlock PM342Petronas; E&P Malaysia VentureBlock PM428Jadestone Energy; PetronasBlock SK330Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SK510Petronas; INPEX Malaysia E&P; Pertamina; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock 5EShell; Petronas; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SB403Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; SMJ EnergyBamabazon ClusterE&P O&M ServicesData source: World Oil From 2024 through 2026, Petronas expects more than 25 wells (oil and natural gas) to be drilled per year. The Penisular Malaysia and Sarawak will be the focus of shallow water wells, and deepwater wells will be in Sabah.10 Malaysia’s petroleum and other liquids production declined from 2017 to 2023—to 597,000 barrels per day (b/d)—due to maturing fields.11 After a dip in 2020, Malaysia’s petroleum and other liquids consumption returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, driven mainly by a rebound increased gasoline demand.12 Malaysia had a refining capacity of 997,000 b/d in 2023.14 By 2034, proposed projects could add an additional 181,000 b/d of capacity.15 Name of siteCompanyCrude oil refining capacity(thousand barrels per day) KemamanKemaman Bitumen30Port DicksonHengyuan Refining Company156KertehPetronas121Melaka (PSR-1)Petronas100Melaka (PSR-2)Petronas170PengerangPetronas300Port DicksonSan Miguel/Petron85Total 997Data source: FACTS Global Energy, Asia Pacific Databook 2: Refinery Configuration, Spring 2024 Natural gas At the end of 2023, Malaysia had proved natural gas reserves of 32 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).16 Although lower than the 2014 peak of 101 Tcf, reserves have increased since 2018 as a result of new discoveries.17 Malaysia’s natural gas production increased in 2022 to an all-time high of 2.7 Tcf,18 which was the result of developing both brownfield and greenfield projects.19 The Jerun gas field, located off the shore of Sarawak, northwest of Bintulu, was brought online by SapuraOMV in 2024. According to SampuraOMV, the project will reach peak production in 2030 at 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 15,000 b/d of condensate. The project will supply the Petronas LNG complex in Bintulu via a 50-mile pipeline.20 The complex consists of MLNG Satu, MLNG Dua, MLNG Tiga, and MLNG T9. Shell operates the Timi natural gas project, which is located in Sarawak. Shell expects the project to produce 300 MMcf/d at peak production. The natural gas will support a production hub, located off the shore of Sarawak, via a 50-mile pipeline. Commercial production is slated to start in 2025.21 The Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area is located in the Gulf of Thailand and overseen by the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority; each country has 50% ownership of the area’s resources. The area produced natural gas for both Malaysia and Thailand and is linked to Malaysia via the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network.22 The industrial sector’s natural gas consumption share surpassed the power sector’s share in 2017 and has remained the top natural gas-consuming sector since that year. The Malaysia natural gas pipeline network, which has helped the manufacturing sector grow, is a major supplier for industrial natural gas consumption. Residential, commercial, and transportation sectors together have accounted for less than 1.5% of natural gas consumption per year from 2013 to 2022.23 Malaysia has one of the most extensive natural gas pipeline networks in Asia. Much of the natural gas pipeline network is located in Peninsular Malaysia and is known as the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network. The PGU is 1,630 miles long and can transport 3,500 MMcf/d. The network transports processed natural gas to the power sector and to non-power end-use sectors and exports natural gas to Singapore. The four entry points into the PGU are in Kertih, Pengerang, Sungai Udang, and Thailand.24 A floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel called ZFLNG is under development off the shore of Sabah. The facility’s liquefaction capacity is 2 million metric tons per year, and its completion is set for 2027.25 Petronas and MISC Group signed an agreement in October 2023 that will convert a 4.9-million-cubic-foot LNG shipping vessel into floating storage for the Pengerang LNG terminal. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by 2025.26 Malaysia has limited coal resources. Its reserves were 249 million short tons in 2022.27 Nearly 99% of the reserves are located in Sarawak, and the remainder is in Sabah.28 In 2022, coal made up 21% of Malaysia’s primary energy consumption.29 Under the National Energy Policy 2022–2040, Malaysia’s goal is to reduce coal’s share of primary energy supply to 17% by 2040.30 Malaysia’s coal production decreased 4% in 2023. This came after an increase of almost 20% the previous year, from 3.4 million short tons in 2021 to a record 4 million short tons in 2022.31 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity generation increased 8% from 2021 to 194 terawatthours in 2022. Fossil fuels made up 81% of all electricity generated in 2022, and non-hydroelectric renewables made up less than 2%. Although total generation increased in 2022, the increase was dispersed evenly across most generation sources.32 In 2022, Malaysia pledged not to build any new coal power plants after 2040. In 2021, they created a phase-out plan to reduce existing coal capacity by 50% by 2035 and completely by 2044.33 Currently, 5 coal-fired power plant projects are under development, which are slated to come online by 2031 and will add 11.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.34 In April 2024, Malaysia’s government announced its intention to create the Energy Exchange Malaysia (ENEGEM) to export electricity from renewable sources to other Southeast Asian countries. ENEGEM aligns with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) goals of an integrated power grid among Southeast Asian countries.35 Malaysia’s installed electricity capacity remained relatively flat in 2022; it increased less than 1% from 2021 levels. All added capacity came from growth in solar installations.36 Energy Trade Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports decreased by 14% in 2023 from 2022. The largest declines by importing countries were China and India, which represent a combined decrease of 29,000 b/d.37 Virtually all of Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports in 2023 went to the Asia Pacific region. Southeast Asia was responsible for 52% of imports.38 Malaysia imported almost 1.2 million b/d of petroleum product imports in 2023, a 3% increase from the previous year. Asia was the source for 58% of all petroleum product imports.39 Fuel oil (28%) accounted for the largest share of petroleum product imports in 2023, followed by diesel (25%) and gasoline (20%).40 Malaysia also exported 1.3 million b/d of petroleum products in 2023, a 7% increase from the previous year. The Asia Pacific region was the destination for 79% of all petroleum product exports.41 Diesel (24%) accounted for the largest share of exports in 2023, followed by fuel oil (20%) and biodiesel (19%).42 Natural Gas In 2023, Malaysia exported 85 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas to Singapore via pipeline.43 Malaysia’s LNG exports declined 7% from 2022 to 1.3 Tcf in 2023. Although Japan still receives the largest share of Malaysia LNG exports, in 2023, Japan imported approximately 90 Bcf less than in 2022.44 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity exports significantly increased after 2016. The increase was driven by a power trading project established in 2016, between Sarawak Energy Berhad and Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The power is exported through the 275 kV Sarawak-West Kalimatan Interconnection. In October 2021, Malaysia banned the export of renewable energy which may account for some of the decrease in exports in 2021 and 2022. The ban was lifted in May 2023 to attract more development in its renewable sector.45 Coal In 2023, Malaysia’s coal imports increased almost 10% from 2022 to 42 million short tons. Most imports came from the Asia Pacific region (91%). Malaysia increased its imports of Indonesia’s coal to 31 million short ton in 2023, up approximately 3 million short tons from 2022.46 Source: This article was published by EIA Endnotes: U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics; International Gas Union, 2024 World LNG Report, page 24.

More Countries Sign Declaration To Triple Nuclear Capacity	At the COP29 UN climate change conference taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, six more countries - El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Nigeria and Turkey - have added their support for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. During COP28 - held in Dubai, UAE, in December last year - 25 countries backed a Ministerial Declaration calling for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The heads of state, or senior officials, from Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ghana, Hungary, Jamaica, Japan, South Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, the UAE, the UK and the USA signed the declaration on 2 December, with Armenia and Croatia also signing up during the summit. The declaration says the countries recognise the need for a tripling of nuclear energy capacity to achieve 'global net-zero greenhouse gas/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century and in keeping a 1.5°C limit on temperature rise within reach'. It also recognises that 'new nuclear technologies could occupy a small land footprint and can be sited where needed, partner well with renewable energy sources and have additional flexibilities that support decarbonisation beyond the power sector, including hard-to-abate industrial sectors'. On Wednesday, in an event co-organised by the COP29 Presidency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the USA and World Nuclear Association, a further six countries signed the declaration. This brings the total number of countries endorsing the declaration to triple to 31. Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy said the country's signing of the declaration 'demonstrates its commitment to sustainable development goals and its desire to make a significant contribution to combating climate change. Nuclear energy is considered one of the key components of Kazakhstan's energy balance, which will allow the country to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, increase the share of clean energy sources and ensure reliable energy supply.' 'We warmly welcome these six new countries to the Coalition of the Ambitious,' said World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León. 'Today's announcement highlights the essential role of nuclear energy in meeting the Paris Agreement goals in a cost-effective and equitable manner. 'Leadership requires a clear-eyed assessment of the here and now, but also the foresight to prepare for what the world will need not only in 2050, but in the decades after. The signatories to this declaration are making a long-term commitment. But it is a long-term commitment with a long-term pay off, providing energy certainty and reliability in an uncertain world.' World Nuclear Association noted the announcement 'is the latest moment of recognition for the essential role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions'. On Tuesday at COP, the US Administration issued a roadmap outlining plans for the deployment of 200 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Other recent developments have included the recognition of nuclear energy - for the first time in a major COP decision - among the solutions needed to keep the 1.5-degree goal within reach, as part of last year's Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. In March, the IAEA and Belgium co-chaired the first Nuclear Energy Summit, in which countries highlighted the role of nuclear energy in reducing the use of fossil fuels, enhancing energy security, and boosting economic development. In September, at New York Climate Week, 14 of the world's largest banks and financial institutions from five countries signalled their support for tripling global nuclear capacity. 'Nuclear can now count on the world's biggest banks to back the growth of the nuclear industry,' Bilbao y León said. 'Nuclear has attracted the interest and investment of the world's largest and most advanced technology companies. And nuclear has ever-increasing support from the public, who recognise that in nuclear they have an answer to their demands for energy security, reliable supply and prices, and a response to climate change. This is truly a global coalition of the ambitious. And thank you all for being part of it.' World Nuclear Association and the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, with support from the IAEA's Atoms4NetZero and the UK government, launched the Net Zero Nuclear initiative in September 2023 seeking 'unprecedented collaboration between government, industry leaders and civil society' ahead of COP28. The Net Zero Nuclear Industry Pledge, has been endorsed by more than 130 companies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRccCom8yuDXlD	2024-11-13T16:06:26-08:00	
What Do We Know About The Mufti Bill 2024? – Analysis	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Minderjeet Kaur A bill introduced in Malaysia’s parliament earlier this year to expand the powers of the muftis – Muslim legal experts – in the federal territories (FT) of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya is expected to be tabled for debate and possible passage within a month. Traditionally, muftis are appointed by state rulers in Malaysia, giving religious authorities significant autonomy. Critics argue the bill could expand to the states in Malaysia, potentially infringing on individual freedoms and intellectual diversity. What is the Mufti Bill 2024? The bill outlines the specific duties and powers of the Department of the Mufti for the Federal Territory. It specifies the mufti’s role in advising the King on Islamic affairs, according to Sirajuddin Suhaimee, Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim) director-general. Currently, Muslim fatwas serve as advisory opinions rather than enforceable law except in cases where they become part of the Sharia Law. However, under the bill’s Article 10, the fatwas could become law without needing parliament’s approval once they are published in the Official Gazette. Sirajuddin told BenarNews that no official date has been set, adding the bill is expected to be tabled before the parliament session ends on Dec. 12. Why are some opposed? While proponents argue the bill would improve the consistency of Islamic rulings throughout Malaysia, critics including northern-state Perlis Mufti Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, called it a move toward unchecked religious authority and a threat to intellectual autonomy. One contentious aspect of the bill is its restriction of Islamic interpretations to only four Sunni schools of thought – Shafi’i, Hanbali, Maliki, and Hanafi – which has drawn particular criticism. Non-Sunni interpretations include Shia and Ahmadi views, which are often seen as deviant in Malaysia. Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of the Islamic Renaissance Front, a progressive Islamic think-tank, argued that the bill enforces a narrow theological stance, leaving no room for alternative streams of thought. 'There will be no more freedom of conscience in this country. All Muslims [in the country] must adhere to this theology of the state,' he told BenarNews. 'I thought that the government celebrates diversity. But in actual fact, we are killing that diversity with the bill.' Meanwhile, Sisters in Islam (SIS), a women’s rights group, warned that legally binding fatwas could result in punishments for actions not criminalized under secular law. 'Fatwas are traditionally advisory, meant to guide Muslims on religious matters – not to be enforced as law,' the group said in a statement. What are implications for states’ rights? The constitution divides religious jurisdiction between federal and state authorities, with the country’s nine sultans overseeing Islamic matters within their states. The federal territories fall under the purview of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Malaysia’s king, who acts as head of Islam in these regions. One constitutional analyst argued the bill does not infringe on states’ rights, as it pertains solely to the federal territories. 'The autonomy of the religious authorities of other states are not affected because they are protected under their respective state constitutions,' Wan Ahmad Fauzi, a constitutional law analyst at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told BenarNews. Does it impact non-Muslims? Although the bill applies only to Muslims, critics argue that an increase in unchecked authority for a religious official could potentially strain interfaith relations. As of mid-2023, Malaysia’s population of 34.2 million was predominantly Muslim (63.5%), with significant Buddhist (18.7%), Christian (9.1%), and Hindu (6.1%) communities. 'The bill’s implications on race relations need careful consideration, given the high percentage of non-Muslims in the FT,' think tank founder Farouk Musa said. Could bill influence political power? Some observers see the bill as a strategy to win over conservative Malay voters who make up over 70% of the population by showing the government’s commitment to the traditional Sunni doctrine, Sunnah Wal Jamaah. 'The government may view passing this bill as a way to gain Malay support, as it reinforces Malaysia’s orthodox Sunni values,' Azmil Mohd Tayeb, a political analyst at Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Analyst Tunku Mohar Mokhtar of the International Islamic University Malaysia had a different take, telling BenarNews the strategy could be seen as overreaching. 'If the bill is designed to gain votes, it may backfire,' he said, pointing out that much of the opposition comes from those aligned with Pakatan Harapan, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s multiethnic coalition. 'It also cannot get votes from [Islamist party] PAS supporters who aren’t into much theological debates.' Is it necessary? Even as government officials defend the bill as an essential update to streamline Islamic governance, many critics remain unconvinced over concerns it risks intensifying bureaucratic control over religious life. 'Yes, we need this bill for better administration of Islamic matters in the federal territories,' analyst Ahmad Fauzi said. In contrast, Farouk Musa sees the bill as 'sectarian and divisive,' adding it is unnecessary and could hinder inclusivity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcbzdeg1qAiu3	2024-11-13T16:04:51-08:00	
Medicare ‘Advantage’ By The Numbers – Analysis	By Emma Curchin, Brandon Novick, and Peter Hart The quasi-privatized system called 'Medicare Advantage,' otherwise known as Part C, was created in 2003 as a means of expanding the role of private sector corporations in the publicly-funded Medicare system. Proponents claimed it would lower costs and improve health care for seniors. It has achieved neither of those goals; instead, MA has become a wildly profitable scheme for private insurance giants, who have become adept at taking advantage of Medicare's billing model to claim exorbitant profits. At this point, MA is more profitable for many companies than their conventional insurance businesses. And the program continues to grow. MA now has more enrollees than traditional Medicare, thanks in no small part to aggressive public relations campaigns that sell seniors on the idea that the plans cut costs and increase choice. Congress has simultaneously failed to plug the holes in traditional Medicare, pushing seniors towards MA to avoid high out-of-pocket costs. Policymakers can fill these gaps and guarantee true comprehensive coverage simply by redirecting the overpayments to MA insurers into Medicare. Numerous studies and media investigations have documented the problems with Medicare Advantage. What follows is a collection of some of the most notable figures documenting the high costs of this failed experiment in privatizing Medicare. $88-$140 billionThe amount that the federal government overpaid private insurers under Medicare Advantage in 2022, according to the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). $612 billionThe amount that Medicare Advantage plans overcharged the federal government due to upcoding and favorable selection between 2007 and 2023, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent congressional agency established to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. $600 billionAccording to one study, this is the projected excess spending between 2023 to 2031 due to the ways that Medicare Advantage plans use 'upcoding,' the process of classifying beneficiaries as being sicker than they really are in order to increase payments. $35 billionThe amount that MedPAC estimates taxpayers will overpay MA insurers this year through 'favorable selection,' the practice of targeting healthy seniors for their plans. $4.2 billionThe amount that MA insurers received for questionable home visit health risk assessments (and related chart reviews) in 2023, according to an October 2024 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. 80 percentThe percentage of mental health providers in a sample of MA plans that were determined to be 'ghosts' (meaning they were unreachable, not accepting new patients, or not in-network), according to a recent Senate investigation. 1.8 millionEstimated number of Medicare Advantage customers whose health plans will be canceled in 2025. 167 percentThe amount that drug deductibles will increase for roughly two-thirds of all Medicare Advantage enrollees next year. 55.7 percentThe increase in MA care denials from 2022 to 2023, according to research from the American Hospital Association. 54 percentThe increase in the denial rate for long-term acute care hospitals in Humana's Medicare Advantage plans from 2020 to 2022 (Senate Majority Staff Report, 10/17/24). $660 millionThe amount of taxpayer money that CVS/Aetna stashed away in 2018 by denying Medicare Advantage patients' claims for treatment at inpatient facilities (Senate Majority Staff Report). 78 percentThe percentage of physicians in a 2023 American Medical Association survey who said that Medicare Advantage's prior authorization processes caused a recommended treatment for a patient to be abandoned. $6 billionOne estimate of the amount spent in 2022 on the marketing companies that work to attract new subscribers in Medicare Advantage plans. 556,068The number of English-language TV commercials touting Medicare Advantage that aired during the seven-week open enrollment period in 2022. $50 billionThe amount that the Wall Street Journal estimates private insurers received between 2018 and 2021 for 'hundreds of thousands of questionable diagnoses that triggered extra taxpayer-funded payments.' $2,329The amount that MA insurers receive per beneficiary above the estimated costs of Medicare. $1,730The gross profit margin posted by MA companies in 2021 – more than double their profit margin on the individual market. $172 millionThe amount that Cigna agreed to pay in 2023 to 'resolve allegations that it knowingly submitted and failed to withdraw inaccurate and untruthful diagnosis codes for its Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees to increase its payments from Medicare.' The Justice Department continues to investigate similar allegations involving other MA providers.

Conflict In Amhara Region Threatens To Ignite Another Ethiopian W...	Gun battles in late October shattered the typical tranquility of Debark town, nestled in the foothills of the Semien mountains in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. Months of intense fighting in Ethiopia’s second-largest region have dislodged any sense of peace in the war-torn country, as the federal government struggles with what potentially could be another civil war. While the Pretoria Agreement was intended to end Ethiopia’s conflict in the Tigray region in November 2022, it left unresolved many issues such as decades-old territorial disputes between Amhara and Tigrayan people. 'The peace deal two years ago was supposed to ensure that Ethiopia’s warring parties could mend such rifts through further negotiations rather than violence. But no such talks have materialized,' The Economist magazine wrote in an October 27 article. 'For now, it is no more than a ceasefire — and one that could easily collapse.' After fighting alongside federal forces against the Tigrayans, ethnic Amhara militias known as Fano were told in April 2023 to disarm and integrate with the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF). Rather than comply, Fano unleashed an insurgency by seizing towns and roadways. In late September 2024, federal forces launched an offensive against Fano, ominously declaring it the 'final operation.' The ENDF attacked the militias and briefly entered several towns, including Gondar and Metema. Fighting has escalated since the end of the rainy season, as drier conditions have allowed troops to move more easily, and clearer skies make way for military drones. There were 43 drone attacks and airstrikes in 22 districts across the Amhara region between September 25 and October 24, killing 196 including civilians and injuring 77, according to the Amhara Association of America. The ENDF reportedly has poured tens of thousands of troops into the Amhara region. 'Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous reinforcements (of the federal army) and many arrests of officials suspected of collusion with the Fano,' a security source told Agence France-Presse on the condition of anonymity in early October. While the ENDF has wrestled back control of several towns, it continues to face a resilient foe that enjoys popular support from the Amhara. Fano is less an organized group than it is a fragmented coalition of autonomous militias. The ENDF’s gains have forced Fano fighters to retreat into the mountains and wage guerilla warfare. 'Fano’s decentralized structure makes it hard for it to leverage its strength into political power,' analyst Liam Carr concluded in a September intelligence assessment for the Critical Threats Project. 'A strengthened Fano insurgency increases the risk of ethnic conflict with neighboring regions in Ethiopia, such as Tigray and Oromia, and would affect transnational issues involving Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan that could further destabilize Ethiopia or other areas in the Horn of Africa.' A contingent of the ENDF on October 26 met with members of the Debark community to discuss a path to sustainable peace. The military’s representative, however, blamed Fano for the violence. 'The extremist group that is full of hatred and blind thinking, has brought the people into conflict, robbed their own people and put government development institutions in danger,' Maj. Gen. Amare Gebru, head of Debark command post, said during the gathering, according to the ENDF. Peace talks are unlikely and neither side appears capable of a military victory, according to Adem Abebe, senior advisor on peacebuilding for the Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. 'The Fano are not ready for peace negotiations,' he told The Africa Report for an October 10 article. 'The government may try and talk to some leaders here and there, but until there is some coordination among Fano, it is going to be very difficult for any individual Fano leader to commit to a peace process publicly. 'I don’t think much will change on the battlefield, but the situation will continue bringing terrible suffering for the people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcTcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-13T15:58:42-08:00	
Liberal Arrogance And Hatred On Display After Trump Victory – OpE...	While Donald Trump is frequently called a fascist and is even compared to Adolph Hitler, some angry democrats are engaging in their own racist and eliminationist rhetoric in the wake of his impending return to the presidency. Their reaction to Trump’s victory reveals that intolerance and bigotry are not unique to Trump and his followers. 'F*** ‘em. I hope they are all deported. And I can’t wait until Netanyahu gets the green light to turn Gaza into a parking lot.' 'Can’t wait for the next Muslim ban. F*** them. They get the president they deserve.' 'I hope every woman who voted for Trump and lives in a no abortion state gets what they wanted. To bleed out in a parking lot due to a miscarriage and no doctor will help you because THAT’S what you voted for. Y’all deserve it.''To the black men in Georgia that voted for Trump next time a cop has their knee on yall necks PLEASE LEAVE US BLACK WOMEN OUT OF IT!' 'Good morning to all my Arab Americans, dearborn Michigan, Palestinian supporters and Gaza pearl clutchers! Black Americans, Black Women & Black Men are done! We won’t donate to your causes or feel sorry about any bombings! We had your back but you turned your back on us!' These are just a few of the missives that angry democrats posted on social media after Kamala Harris was defeated in her campaign against Donald Trump. While every Trump utterance is examined for proof of racism and other forms of bigotry, liberals suddenly became very illiberal after the campaign ended. Many of them literally wished death upon Black men, Latino men, Arabs and anyone they hold responsible for Trump’s return to the white house. The white people who still form the base of his support are somehow exempt from these attacks. While disturbing, these behaviors are not entirely unexpected. Instead of telling their voters how a Harris administration would benefit their lives, her campaign engaged in a propaganda effort, amplifying former Trump officials to attest to his fascist beliefs or resuscitating old stories about his alleged affinity for Hitler and Nazi ideology . If Trump and his supporters are in fact comparable to Nazis then no scorn or condemnation of them is too harsh. But these opinions did not indicate any level of political maturity or analysis. The tit for tat expressions which wished suffering upon others are akin to the worst sloganeering of the MAGA hat wearing Trump followers who are so despised, the 'deplorables' as it were. The people who think of themselves as being more enlightened actually took the time to consider and publicly share their violent sentiments as they wished bombings on civilians or death from abortion bans. Much of the blame falls on the Democratic Party itself which, absent any intention of legislating programs that would help their voters prosper in their material lives, has instead chosen to stoke hatred against republicans. Emotions are substitutes for policy, as the administration which billed itself as the 'most progressive since FDR' allowed covid era stimulus payments, expansions of unemployment insurance, freezes on student loan payments, eviction protection, and SNAP and Medicaid benefits to lapse. There was no action on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act or on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which would restore enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act. The federal minimum wage didn’t go up and, as Joe Biden promised, Medicare for All was never on the agenda. In the absence of tangible policies to run on, they had nothing but a bipartisan vote to make Juneteenth a national holiday and then tapped into fear mongering against republicans. The end result is not only anger and sadness that Trump will again be president but also a kind of mass psychosis that endlessly repeats that he is a liar who received five draft deferments for bone spurs while never mentioning that Biden also received five draft deferments as a student and a medical exemption for asthma. Trump’s lies are endlessly dissected but not Biden’s campaign promise that he would not permit oil drilling on federal land but did just that in 2023 when he approved the Willow Project in Alaska. Black democrats are particularly confused. Every four years they are barraged with appeals to vote for the 'Black party' and send the republicans, the 'white party' down to defeat. The Republican Party has received the majority of votes from white people in presidential elections since 1964. It is the home of open and unfettered white racist sentiment and action, so the feelings of doom are understandable. But the duopoly trap creates political passivity, encouraging voter participation only in presidential election years while giving a myriad of reasons for telling Black people not to demand anything other than a democrat sitting behind the big desk in the oval office while promising little else in return. In such a system, everyone becomes an enemy. If a democratic presidency is the one and only prize, then every issue that argues against support must be ignored or opposed and anyone raising issues such as the US-funded genocide in Gaza is also an enemy. Palestinians who refuse to support the genocidal Democratic Party which is killing their people are now called the enemies of Black people. Latino support for the democrats falls every election cycle but still, a majority of voters in that group voted for Harris, approximately 53% . No matter. If the media say that Latino men are voting for Trump then liberals conclude they must all be punished by the deportations they claimed to oppose before the election. Of course, only citizens can vote and by definition cannot be deported. The anger defies logic. It is noteworthy that there is a great deal of punching down, but very little punching up. The Democratic Party clearly failed its voters after raising more than $1 billion and still losing to the man they spent so many years vilifying as a liar, buffoon, criminal, and evil incarnate. The not-so-enlightened liberals rarely even questioned how the debacle came about, much less showed anger at the candidate, or the party, or the process by which an unpopular and frail president face planted in a debate before being taken out of the election by rich donors, and replaced by a Vice President without a vote – a Vice President who did not even earn one delegate in earlier primary elections. Liberals also did not challenge the questionable strategy of chasing a handful of 'never Trump' republican votes and spending millions of dollars on concerts with celebrities. One would think that the mental energy needed to conjure up a destroyed Gaza might also manage to ask hard questions of the woman at the top of the ticket. Apparently, Trump is not the only authoritarian in U.S. politics. Democratic voters also believe in a hierarchy that tells them to act like children abused by an unstable parent who demands their silence. Politics is now about feeling superior to others rather than being able to cogently argue against them or defend one’s own position. It is not about asking their betters anything, including why they lost. It seems that the U.S. is full of mean and angry people. Of course, their own government engages in austerity meant to grind them down economically and to deprive them of any political recourse. But the people don’t have to accept this treatment. They don’t have to become the angry mob. The truth is that people in this country have been dehumanized to the point where they lack empathy for others. They also have been kept uninformed and ignorant. Even the liberal professional class, which holds itself up as the best among the population, is just as indoctrinated as thousands of Trumpers on January 6th. Its members do not know how to activate themselves politically, how to struggle with like minded people, or how to make political demands. Seeing oneself as the good group is thought to be enough. Or perhaps these enraged liberals know what they are up against. Despite the celebrity endorsements and happy talk, maybe they know that their party is controlled by an oligarchy that will fight them tooth and nail. They only feel safe spewing vitriol on social media.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcYs8972QQGta	2024-11-13T15:55:53-08:00	
Stunning Defeat Should Prompt Soul-Searching Among Democrats – Op...	By Alon Ben-Meir The Democrats’ stunning electoral defeat will be debated for months if not years. Recrimination and finger-pointing will abound. The Democrats must search their souls, carefully study what went wrong, and develop a compelling new domestic and foreign policy agenda while cooperating with the Republicans on any issue that advances America’s well-being and global leadership Trump won the 2024 election fair and square. Certainly, the economy and immigration played a significant role, aided by gains among younger Black and Hispanic voters as well as inroads in traditionally Democratic urban and suburban areas in the swing states. And Trump’s uncanny skill in portraying himself as the victim of the leftist elite became the mantra of his MAGA followers and the whole Republican party. However, instead of emphasizing the bread-and-butter issues from which the public at large is suffering, the Democrats’ obsession with Trump and their depiction of him as the greatest menace to democracy, an authoritarian who is unfit to serve, did not resonate with the majority of the public. But regardless of the reasons behind the Democratic party’s defeat, what should matter is how the party moves forward, reorients itself, and is responsive to the disenchanted public looking for change. Reflect, Not Recriminate The Democrats need to prioritize self-examination and rebuilding rather than blame. As one Democratic operative stated, 'It’s not a pointing fingers day. It’s a reflection day.' This approach allows the party to constructively analyze its shortcomings and develop strategies for future success. Recrimination distracts from addressing the fundamental problems that led to the defeat. The party needs to focus on reconnecting with working-class voters and addressing economic concerns that resonate with the electorate. Internal finger-pointing could exacerbate existing divisions within the party. Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) noted, 'Finger-pointing is not worth it at all. This was a message. The voters were speaking to us. It would be to our detriment to not hear it.' Continued attacks on Trump may backfire. Multiple impeachments and legal proceedings against Trump made him appear as a victim, energizing his base. Excessive recrimination could further damage the party’s credibility with voters who felt disconnected from Democratic messaging. Focusing on recrimination could prevent the necessary 'comprehensive reassessment' called for by many Democrats. By avoiding recrimination and concentrating on constructive analysis and forward-thinking strategies, the Democratic Party can better position itself to address voters’ concerns and rebuild its coalition for future electoral success. The Democrats Need Soul-Searching The Democrats should engage in soul-searching and introspection and reflect on several critical points. Many Democrats believe the party lost touch with working-class voters, including Latino and Black workers. There’s a call to refocus on economic issues and address the everyday concerns of voters rather than primarily focusing on Trump’s character or threats to democracy. There are calls for fresh leadership and new strategies. Harris’s campaign focused too much on moderate Republicans at the expense of the party’s working-class base, and its warnings about Trump’s threat to democracy as a campaign strategy were not effective. Analyzing why Trump gained ground with younger voters, African Americans, and Hispanics, and examining the party’s weakening relationship with working-class voters across racial lines, are needed. Debating the party’s stance on critical issues like immigration, calling to address economic concerns, and reflecting on whether the Democratic Party has become too associated with elites and lost its connection to working-class Americans is necessary. Additionally, it is critical to increase diversity among party decision-makers and reassess the party’s infrastructure and fundraising methods. There should also be a discussion on how to work with Trump’s administration. Finally, the party must craft more effective messaging strategies and communication with the electorates for future elections, which was missing. Developing a Positive Agenda The Democrats must focus on crafting a compelling vision for the future rather than dwelling on past grievances. As Filippo Trevisan, Associate Professor of Public Communication at American University stated, 'You can’t just be a ‘No’-party, you need to come up with proposals.' With midterms in 2026 and the presidential election in 2028, the party needs to focus on developing new strategies and cultivating new leadership. The defeat highlighted deeper problems within the party structure and strategy. It’s important to note that there’s significant debate about the best path forward. Some argue for a more populist economic approach, while others caution against abandoning the party’s current coalition. Additionally, the effectiveness of policy-based appeals versus cultural messaging is fiercely contested. Others suggest that Democrats need to focus on enacting policies that produce clear, immediate benefits for working families. In that vein, there are several vital points to consider regarding how Democrats could potentially reconnect with this crucial demographic: Refocus on economic issues Many analysts argue that Democrats ought to prioritize kitchen-table economic concerns that directly impact working families’ lives. This includes addressing issues like wage stagnation, job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living. Incremental changes are not enough; the Democrats must propose bold, ambitious economic and political reforms to convince voters that they can deliver real change. Improving messaging and communication: Even when Democrats have enacted pro-worker policies, they’ve sometimes struggled to effectively convey the benefits to voters. There’s a need to better articulate and communicate how Democratic initiatives tangibly improve working people’s lives. Recruiting more working-class candidates: Fielding candidates who personally understand the challenges faced by working-class communities could help Democrats rebuild trust and credibility with these voters. Furthermore, Democrats must find ways to bridge the growing cultural gap between the party’s leadership and working-class voters, particularly on social issues. Focusing on corporate accountability Challenging corporate power and economic inequality could resonate with workers who feel the system is rigged against them. At the same time, strengthening ties with unions and the labor movement could help Democrats reconnect with their working-class roots. Addressing regional economic disparities Democrats must dive deeper into economic issues and pay more attention to the economic challenges facing working-class communities in areas that have experienced industrial decline or economic stagnation. They must rethink trade and globalization while developing a more worker-focused approach to trade policy and addressing the negative impacts of globalization on specific communities. Ultimately, rebuilding trust with working-class voters will likely require a multi-layered approach that combines policy initiatives, effective communication, and a demonstrated commitment to addressing the economic and social challenges facing these communities. Cooperating with the New Trump Administration In the current political atmosphere, the Democratic Party should cooperate with the new Trump administration while positioning itself as constructive rather than obstructive. America is stuck with Trump for the next four years, and instead of opposing every move he makes, they should find a way to cooperate, especially where it is in the national interest to do so and use cooperation to mitigate the harm that may otherwise result from his actions. Domestic policy Even in a polarized environment, Democrats could offer alternative solutions rather than simply opposing Trump’s policies. While methods may differ, both parties often share common objectives like improving the economy, enhancing national security, addressing healthcare costs, reforming immigration, and securing borders. Additionally, some policy areas still have bipartisan support, which the Democrats could prioritize, including cybersecurity, improving national defense capabilities, specific economic policies aimed at supporting working-class Americans, infrastructure development, and reforming government processes and ethics rules. The renewable energy industry is another path for cooperation, as the Republicans will continue clean energy projects already in place, and see that as a path for job creation and economic growth as these industries advance. Democrats should be willing to engage in constructive discussions and negotiations, even on contentious issues, to demonstrate their commitment to finding common ground. To be sure, the Democrats could frame their collaboration regarding these shared goals by voting for legislation that benefits the country, even if proposed by Republicans, to show their commitment to governance over partisanship. Foreign policy Foreign policy is an area where there’s often more bipartisan consensus. Democrats could support efforts to counter China’s influence while advocating for a balanced approach. They could also work on strengthening alliances and international partnerships and collaborate on addressing global challenges like climate change while framing it in terms of economics and job creation. In addition, both sides could find common ground to end the war in Ukraine and Gaza and establish a path that would lead to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, which both Republican and Democratic administrations have been advocating for decades. By taking these approaches in domestic and foreign policy, the Democratic Party could cooperate on many critical issues while maintaining its fundamental values and positioning itself anew as a constructive force in American politics. This strategy could help bridge some of the partisan divide and potentially lead to more effective governance. The Democratic Party needs to heal itself while also healing a dangerously polarized nation by building bridges rather than deepening the divide and, in so doing, rising and answering the call of the American people, who deserve and expect better governance.

A Year After Offensive, Rebels Control Most Of Myanmar’s Rakhine ...	One year after renewed fighting in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, the rebel Arakan Army controls some 80 percent of the state while the military junta’s airstrikes and its blockade of trade routes have left residents worried about their safety and food shortages. The ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, began its offensive on Nov. 13, 2023, and has since captured 10 out of the state’s 17 townships, as well as one township in neighboring Chin state. The group is battling for self-determination for the mostly Buddhist Rakhine people. It would be the first Myanmar rebel group to take over a state if it seizes – as it has vowed to do – all territory under military control in Rakhine state. Myanmar’s military, which took control of the country in a 2021 coup, has been battling various rebel armies and militias across the country, and has faced some of its biggest setbacks in Rakhine. The AA’s battlefield successes over the last year has been unprecedented since the fall of the Arakan Kingdom to the Burmese in 1784, according to Pe Than, a former member of parliament from Rakhine state. 'Our Arakan people lost our sovereignty about 240 years ago,' he told Radio Free Asia. 'Throughout this period, the successive generations in Rakhine have engaged in revolutionary efforts, yet we did not achieve victory. 'Now, during the era of the AA, we have found success,' he said. 'It is believed that the national dignity of the Rakhine people can be restored along with that of the AA, as it has been a great achievement.' The AA has repeatedly vowed to capture Sittwe, the state capital and one of the last important military holdings in Rakhine. Last month, AA fighters advanced on the junta’s Western Command headquarters in Ann township, about 120 km (75 miles) southwest of Sittwe. Additionally, there have been heated battles for control of Maungdaw township near the Bangladesh border since July. Junta air attacks In the townships where it has won control, the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan, have been operating civilian administration, judicial and development sectors, AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha said during an online news conference on June 8. 'We will diligently follow our roadmap to build a society prevailed with justice, peace and human dignity for the Arakan people,' he said. 'We are also committed to establishing a future that guarantees equality and rights for all communities residing in Arakan state.' But the threat of junta airstrikes remains a significant concern for locals, and many towns and homes have yet to be rebuilt because of financial constraints and difficulties obtaining supplies, he said. Additionally, the fighting has severely hindered children’s ability to get an education, he said. The junta had already closed many of Rakhine state’s schools, and in some areas children aren’t allowed to walk to school that remain open because of the threat of air strikes, which often target civilian buildings. 'Parents are hiring private teachers for their children,' Khaing Thu Kha said. 'It has been a form of self-reliant education.' Junta air attacks and artillery targeted at Rakhine state’s civilian populations have left 486 people dead and 1,043 injured over the last year, according to the records of the AA and the statements from residents. 'Over the past year, the military junta has carried out excessive airstrikes, destroying religious buildings, hospitals, clinics, residential areas, villages and refugee camps,' said Wai Hin Aung, a volunteer helping war displaced persons in Rakhine. Rakhine civil society organizations have estimated that more than 600,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to the fierce fighting between the junta and the AA. RFA was unable to reach junta spokesperson Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun on Wednesday to ask about the current situation in Rakhine state. Refugees eye return Across the border in Bangladesh, where some 1 million stateless Rohingya refugees live in tightly packed border camps – including more than 50,000 who have fled the fighting in Rakhine this year – there is some hope that refugees can return once the AA gains full control of Rakhine. 'The AA has a visionary approach, and I believe their governance would not mirror the harsh policies of the military council,' one refugee who has been living in Bangladesh since 2017 told RFA. 'If the AA succeeds in capturing Maungdaw and gains international recognition, I believe they would engage in dialogue with the Rohingya,' he said. Another refugee who identified himself as Kairo thought that international recognition of the AA as a legitimate government was unlikely. 'I believe our chance of returning to Rakhine state will be very slim if the AA takes control now,' Kairo said. 'I don’t think UNHCR will hand us over to an unrecognized organization,' referring to the U.N refugee agency. 'Even if they gain control of 17 townships, it could take at least two to three years for them to achieve international recognition.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcVykU-QRFq_o	2024-11-13T15:50:47-08:00	
Robert Reich: What Will You Do? – OpEd	Many of you are still in shock about what happened a week ago today. Some of you don’t even want to read a newspaper or hear the news. I get it. A few of you are coping with the catastrophe by minimizing or denying it. Several friends assure me that a second Trump term won’t be much different from the first and that the checks and balances in our system will continue to constrain him. This is wishful and dangerous thinking. Trump and his Republican lapdogs will almost certainly win the House, which means that starting January 20, they will take full control of the federal government — both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency. The Republicans soon to be in control of Congress are more MAGA, less principled, and more intimidated by Trump than the Republicans who had control when Trump took office in 2017. There are no Liz Cheneys in the House, no Mitt Romneys in the Senate. Republican senators seeking to become the majority leader are already competing to please Trump, promising immediate confirmation of his appointments. The Republican Party as a whole has now been effectively purged of people willing to stand up to Trump. Trump already has effective control of the Supreme Court, a majority of whom have ruled that he (or any president) is presumptively immune from criminal liability for whatever he chooses to do. This time, moreover, there won’t be people in the administration to stop him. Trump learned from his first term about the importance of surrounding himself with lackeys who will do whatever he wishes. His early picks (Susie Wiles as chief of staff, Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff, Thomas Homan as border czar, Lee Zeldin as EPA administrator, Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the U.N., and Michael Walz as national security advisor) have only one thing in common and it’s not their expertise. It’s their unblinking loyalty to Trump. Don’t get me started about Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, who has turned his X platform into a swamp of Trump lies and propaganda, and now seems joined at the hip to Trump — appearing wherever Trump is. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a nut job. And unlike Trump’s first term, the president-elect is now backed by a network of dangerous extremists — including those who have been imprisoned for their part in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, whom Trump has suggested he’ll pardon. They will feel emboldened to carry out what they understand to be Trump’s wishes. Finally, also unlike before his first term, Trump has explicitly told us what he plans to do and already has people working on getting it done starting January 20: mass deportations, prosecution of his political enemies, the use of the military against U.S. citizens, the purging of the civil service across the government and substitution of Trump loyalists, and a promise to play politics with disasters. Project 2025, which was written by more than 140 people who served under Trump the first time around, including several of his former Cabinet secretaries, explicitly calls for 'abortion surveillance' and the stripping from Americans of reproductive freedom (page 455). It also calls for jailing teachers and librarians over banned books (page 5), gutting of overtime pay rules (pages 587 and 592), and prioritizing 'married men and women' over other types of families (page 489). To enforce these attacks on our rights, Project 2025 would use the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoke the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilize red-state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda. In sum, my friends, we are facing a catastrophe far worse than what occurred in Trump’s first term of office. The meager guardrails that existed then will be gone. We must not avert our eyes from this calamity, or minimize it, or throw up our hands in despair or retreat. We must prepare to fight it. But how? Let me ask you: If this were Germany in 1933, what actions would you take? How different will this be from Germany in 1933? I put this question to some of you last Wednesday during my weekly Office Hours. Forty percent said your most important goal will be to protect those in harm’s way, and 34 percent said it will be to organize and mobilize politically. Of the remainder, 9 percent said it will be to resist with civil disobedience. (Others had additional or different ideas.) Obviously, none of these alternatives is exclusive. We must consider all, and many others. Protecting the vulnerable and preserving our rights and liberties will require a great deal of hard work by people who believe in our Constitution, democracy, and the rule of law. The work includes: Monitoring Trump and his government — despite the disinformation, propaganda, and lies we’ll be receiving — and disseminating the truth. Maintaining a watch over the people and institutions we value. Being ready to sound the alarm in our communities and networks when those people and institutions are under assault. Organizing and mobilizing nonviolent resistance to such assaults. Using civil disobedience wherever possible. Litigating through state and federal courts where possible. Speaking out against malicious lies like those that spread during the election by Elon Musk on his propaganda machine X and against vicious lies amplified on other MAGA mouthpieces. Using our economic muscle to boycott corporations that support Trump, Musk, and other centers of MAGA power. And much more. It will be up to us — the American people who still cherish democracy — to protect and preserve our system of self-government. As difficult as it is to fully accept what we are up against, the first step is to acknowledge it.

Arab Americans Have A Second Chance To Influence Trump – OpEd	After Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 45th president in 2017, the Arab American community made the mistake of joining the Democrats’ attacks on him, refusing to meet him or engage with him on policies. This was despite the fact that one of Trump’s closest business friends on his hit TV shows 'The Apprentice' and 'The Celebrity Apprentice' was a Palestinian, Farouk Shami. Many Arab Americans incredulously expected Trump to do what their own Democratic allies refused to do: undermine the extremist government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and elevate the interests of Palestinian rights. Instead of engaging with Trump, they joined in the personal attacks and confrontation orchestrated by Democrats, including defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was responsible for many failures in the Middle East when she was secretary of state. One of the consequences was that Palestinians boycotted the 2019 'Peace to Prosperity' conference organized in Bahrain by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew with strong ties to Israel. With no Palestinians present to push back, the conference strengthened the agenda of Israel and Netanyahu with Trump and the White House. As a result, Trump pursued policies that gave a clear signal of marginalizing Palestinian needs. Eight years later, Trump today not only has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law who has his ear, but also an Arab American son-in-law, Michael Boulos, the husband of Tiffany Trump, and his influential father, Dr. Massad Boulos, who both also have the new president-elect’s ear. More importantly, Trump and pro-Arab Jewish American candidate Jill Stein took a great deal of Arab American votes away from Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. For example, in Dearborn, Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, Trump won nearly 42 percent of the vote, beating Harris’ 40 percent, with Stein third with 15 percent. Arab Americans are on a precipice. They can again turn away from Trump, angered by his statements of support for Israel, or they can engage with him and attempt to influence his policies. Politics is a game of diplomacy and competition, much like a football match. Arab Americans can either be on the field and compete with Israel, or they can walk off the field in protest and leave the entire diplomatic arena to Israel’s control. They do not have the luxury of taking umbrage or showing their anger at Trump’s past and the current Israeli genocide in Gaza and violence in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon. They need to set aside their personal feelings and emotions, step up to the political plate and play ball. That is their responsibility. Politics may be like a football game that two sides are striving to win, but Arab Americans do not have to win. All they have to do is turn up and play to minimize what Trump will do in the Middle East if the only people speaking to him are Israelis. There is a great imbalance in America when it comes to the truth on Middle East issues, mainly because Israel has dominated the playing field for more than 75 years. They are better at media manipulation and spin, as we saw with the distorted coverage of last week’s violence in Amsterdam, in which Israeli football fans went on the rampage and clashed with locals. However, the media described the incidents as 'antisemitic' and highlighted claims of a new 'pogrom' against Jews in Europe. Despite the spin, and their support for Trump, Arab Americans were not the factor that gave Trump his election victory. Although they played an important role, Trump won because he was able to cut into the Democratic base at every level, including among Hispanics and African Americans. Trump succeeded in not only winning the Electoral College, which determines who becomes president, but he is also poised to win the popular vote. Arab Americans need to recognize the political reality and adapt to it. They need to set aside their emotions, no matter how grievous the pain coming from Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon, and engage Trump fully and strategically. They have often been reduced to playing the victim card, attempting to push back against political and media bias and the false narratives spun by Israel’s public relations mastery. However, it is easier to be the victim and be angry than to work hard to change the dynamics of the forces driving that suffering. To change that dynamic, Arab Americans need to be better not just at organizing among themselves, but also at engaging the mainstream news media using professional public relations and communications strategies rather than street protests or angry confrontations. Can Arab Americans set aside the pain of Gaza, Lebanon and historic discrimination in America to replace their emotions with a strategic plan to change America’s foreign policy the right way? We have yet to see that happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcWSGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-13T15:48:27-08:00	
Trump’s Influence Looms Large Over The World – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro As the world digests the result of last week’s momentous US presidential election and prepares itself for a Trump 2.0 presidency, it is not difficult to imagine how the world might look according to the new president. The Palestinians could lose Gaza for good and possibly the West Bank too, as settlers exacerbate the plight of the Palestinians unhindered and unsanctioned by the new US administration, while Lebanon’s destruction continues, with the country teetering on the brink of implosion. Ukraine’s fate will be to prepare to capitulate, according to a peace plan hastily drafted in Washington but guided by the Kremlin. The prospect of electing a Black woman maybe did not cut it for the heavily polarized Americans, despite Kamala Harris’ offer of hope and message of a sunnier future, preferring instead a twice-impeached convicted felon. Maybe this was due to an innate prejudice against women, the travails of dark forces, foreign interference or the tech realm and its manipulation of public opinion. Trump in power, I am led to believe, is likely to magnify and further inflame the stark divide between two Americas. On top of this, he will have full control of Congress, a blank check from the Supreme Court and a renewed faith in his supremacy and in his ability to pander to his supporters’ most basic instincts and prejudices. His first victim is likely to be Ukraine, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky rushing to send his carefully crafted best wishes, in which he praised the president-elect for his 'peace through strength' approach. This is despite knowing all too well that Ukraine is likely to be left in the cold, before the Trump administration forces on Kyiv a peace plan tabled by Washington but penned in the Kremlin that will be just short of total capitulation. Biden and his Western allies’ support for Ukraine initially stemmed from the need to defend the post-Second World War order, but Trump has disregarded that all along, expressing unhidden admiration for President Vladimir Putin and having a long-held belief that 'Ukraine must be part of Russia,' according to one former aide. During his campaign, he often boasted how he could end the Ukraine war 'in a day' and blamed Zelensky for the conflict. Here, I do not need to remind everyone how, over the past two years, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has spared no efforts to vote down and interrupt crucial US government deliveries of weapons and aid to Ukraine. As for the Palestinian question, Arab and Muslim Americans were maybe right to mobilize against the Democrats over the Biden-Harris administration’s inability to find a way to preserve Palestinian lives in Gaza and to hold it responsible for the continued Israeli onslaught. But through backing Trump, the best friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they have helped sow the seeds of a potential total loss of any faint hope for a just solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Netanyahu, who many believe has blocked all efforts that could have led to a cessation of the violence in Gaza over the past few months, was maybe part of a strategy to embarrass the Biden administration and expose its international weakness. Netanyahu, who sacked his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant while the counting of votes was underway in the US, has shifted his war Cabinet further right, expecting the new president to free him from any restraints. And he continues his scorched-earth policies in Gaza and elsewhere that could send the Palestinians further into despair and the political wilderness for at least the next generation or two. Lebanon is unlikely to fare any better, despite Trump’s so-called promises to end the war between Hezbollah and Israel. Trump’s old rhetoric about his previous record of squeezing Iran with sanctions, while deterring war, is set to be tested, as Tehran claims that it is readying another list of Israeli targets to strike after Tel Aviv’s attack on its air defenses and missile plants last month. Trump’s reelection was the result of a complex web of dark forces and the culmination of events that were built on exploiting fears. He has convinced people that his power will earn them salvation, meaning they endorsed his unique approach that could hurt democracy gradually or even sooner come Jan. 20, 2025. Mohamed Chebaro is a British Lebanese journalist with more than 25 years of experience covering war, terrorism, defense, current affairs and diplomacy. He is also a media consultant and trainer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcZSc96iO33yr	2024-11-13T15:44:26-08:00	
Blinken: Israel Has Met Its Goals In Gaza, Time To End The War	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel has achieved its objectives in Gaza and that it is now time to pursue an end to the ongoing war. Blinken said that ending the conflict would be the most effective means of addressing the urgent needs of Gaza’s civilian population. He called for 'real and extended pauses' in fighting to allow essential humanitarian aid to reach those affected by the hostilities and said that Israel holds an ongoing responsibility to facilitate this assistance, urging sustained efforts to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. Blinken also called for increased international pressure on Hamas, seeking 'genuine, sustained, and effective pressure' to cease hostilities. He said that achieving peace requires cooperation from all parties involved, with humanitarian access as a central priority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcai6pnQp13G1	2024-11-13T15:41:29-08:00	
FBI Arrests Alleged Leaker Of US Intelligence Related To Israel’s...	The U.S. Justice Department has charged a man for allegedly leaking highly classified U.S. intelligence about Israel's plans for retaliation against Iran, according to U.S. media reports on November 13. The reports said that Asif W. Rahman was indicted earlier this month for willfully transmitting national defense information. He was arrested on November 12 in Cambodia by the FBI and was to appear in court in Guam. Court documents indicate that he was employed by the U.S. government. According to a person familiar with his employment, he was employed by the CIA. This employment gave him a top-secret security clearance and allowed him to access sensitive information. The New York Times, which first reported the story, said that Rahman was indicted on a charge related to the posting of the intelligence on Telegram in mid-October. The documents posted included Israeli plans for moving munitions and Israeli Air Force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcci6QlmHplcK	2024-11-13T15:39:21-08:00	
Biden, Trump Pledge Peaceful Transfer Of Power In January	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned triumphantly to Washington on Wednesday, pledging a smooth transition of power in January as he met for two hours at the White House with his longtime political rival, President Joe Biden. 'It was a substantive meeting,' White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'They discussed important national security and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world.' Biden invited Trump for the traditional visit — a show of the coming Jan. 20 peaceful transfer of power in American democracy between the current U.S. leader and the incoming chief executive. It was Trump’s first visit to the White House since his first presidential term ended in January 2021. The two men sat in front of a roaring fireplace in the Oval Office ahead of their private talks and traded niceties in a peaceful tableau. 'I'm looking forward to having a smooth transition and we're looking forward to talking about some of that today,' Biden said. 'Thank you very much,' Trump replied. 'Politics is tough and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition so smooth — it will be as smooth as it can get — and I very much appreciate that, Joe. Thank you.' 'You're welcome,' Biden responded. First lady Jill Biden joined her husband in greeting the president-elect upon his arrival at the White House. The White House said she gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition. The former first lady, who lived in the White House from 2017 to 2021 during her husband’s first presidency, did not accompany him to Washington and has not indicated whether she plans to move into the White House again when he takes office. Biden, a Democrat, had sought to defeat Trump, a Republican, for a second time in the Nov. 5 election, but ended his campaign in July after faltering badly in a debate against Trump. Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him, but Trump swept through seven political battleground states in the election and easily defeated her. When Biden defeated Trump in 2020, Trump offered no White House invitation to meet him ahead of the inauguration and left Washington two hours before Biden’s swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump, who to this day claims falsely that he was cheated out of winning the 2020 election by vote fraud, was the first president to not witness his successor’s inauguration since Andrew Johnson skipped the swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Biden has said he plans to attend Trump’s inauguration. Trump also met with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber in the current Congress and are nearing a slight majority control in the Congress set to be sworn in Jan. 3, but the outcome of more than a dozen House elections remains uncertain. Trump has moved quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he has been out of office. In his latest announcements Wednesday, Trump named Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat; Florida Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general, the top law enforcement position in the government, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Hawaii Democratic congresswoman turned Republican advocate for the president-elect, as director of national intelligence. On Tuesday, Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his next defense secretary. The choice of Hegseth was outside the norm of those usually named as the Pentagon leader. But he was a vocal supporter of Trump during his first term, embracing his 'America First' agenda of trying to withdraw U.S. troops from abroad and often taking up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes. Trump has also announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his choice for Homeland Security chief and picked John Ratcliffe as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he won the election. Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth director of national intelligence, serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a rocky confirmation process. Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what Trump called the Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance to 'drive large-scale structural reform' of the federal government. The acronym for the new agency, DOGE, is a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Other notable picks by Trump include William McGinley as White House counsel, Florida congressman Michael Waltz as national security adviser and Thomas Homan, Trump’s former acting immigration chief, to be 'border czar' to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants, possibly millions of them, who are living in the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcW02XAMeMq0t	2024-11-13T15:37:37-08:00	
Iran’s FM Says That Contact Channels With US Exist	There are still means of contact between Iran and the US despite the fundamental differences, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet session on Wednesday, Araqchi said a series of disagreements between Iran and the US are so foundational that may not be resolved forever. 'However, we need to manage them to reduce the costs and tensions,' he added. The foreign minister noted that the contact channels between Iran and the US are still in place. Asked about Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi’s upcoming visit to Iran, Araqchi said Iran and the UN nuclear agency are involved in extensive and age-old cooperation despite a series of problems and differing views on interaction. Expressing hope that Iran and the IAEA would reach an agreement on a number of differences during Grossi’s visit, Araqchi said the UN nuclear chief has reportedly 'positive morale'. Grossi is scheduled to hold formal meetings with Iranian officials on Thursday, November 14. In an interview with Al Arabiya television channel in September, Grossi expressed the UN nuclear agency’s desire to visit Tehran and hold talks with the administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IAEA director general also said he had received a response from Pezeshkian on assurances about Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcR-205OfcDJ2	2024-11-13T15:35:36-08:00	
Trumpnomics: Why Is India Resilient To Tariff Wars And America Fi...	Donald Trump’s thumping victory for a return and second term as president has unleashed a mixed bag of signals for India-USA relations. Unlike the first term, rising global political tension due to the Russia-Ukraine war and Russian sanctions have led India’s situation to now be different than when Trump was previously in office. India threw a big challenge to the USA while thwarting Russian sanctions and shifting its oil import dependency to Russia. This led to a new era of India–Russia economic relations, giving an edge for power balancing between the two super powers. Russia emerged as the 6th largest trading partner of India in 2023-24, up from 25th in 2021-22, while USA retained its spot as the top trading partner of India. The climax between India-USA and India-Russia trade relations unveils that oil and oil based products emerged as the major determinants. While oil based petroleum products are one of the major items of exports to the USA, Russian oil has become pivotal to manufacture oil based products, which are then exported to the USA. In 2023-24, Russia accounted for 34.4 percent of India’s total crude oil imports and oil based products accounted for 7.5 percent in total exports to the USA. Eventually, oil and oil based products will emerge as being crucial for India to engage both the USA and Russia as important economic partners during Trump's second period. Given oil is sensitive to inflation, high import tariffs by the Trump administration does not bode well for the USA. To this end, India’s relations with Russia will remain inextricable, notwithstanding the USA's pressure on India to abide by Russian sanctions. Donald Trump claimed in his election campaign that he would impose a 10 percent import tariff on all nations and 60 percent on China. He focused his America First policy, embarking on protectionism, with the end goal to benefit American workers and their families. Nevertheless, during his first term (2017-21), counter measures to restrict imports from India, such as the withdrawal of Special Status under GSP scheme (Generalized System of Preference) and imposition of high tariffs on steel and aluminium, could not instill weapons to dwarf exports from India. During this period, India’s exports to USA sustained unstoppable growth for the first 3 years. The growth trajectory continued during the successive period under the Presidenship of Biden, even though the Biden administration did not relax tariffs. Eventually, the USA continued undeterred to be the biggest export destination for India. How could India overcome Trump’s protectionism in his first term? It lies with the composition of India's export basket. Besides oil products, there are 3 other major products in the export basket. They are gems and jewelry (mainly diamonds), drugs and pharmaceuticals and readymade garments and textiles. Together with petroleum products, these four products accounted for 43 percent of India’s export to USA in 2023-24. One of the main reasons is that for most of these products the USA is import dependent, owing to lackluster domestic manufacturing due to cost effectiveness and skill. For example, India is currently the third biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products and fourth biggest exporter of readymade garments in the USA market. In 2022, it accounted for 5.5 percent of total imports of pharmaceutical products and in 2023, accounted for 7 percent in total imports of readymade garments in USA market. As regards drugs and pharmaceutical products, the USA largely manufactures branded products that are highly profitable. For generic drugs Americans rely on for standard prescriptions like antibiotics, which are predominantly sourced from developing nations where production costs are low, according to Coalition for a Prosperous America. Concerns are looming large in the pharmaceutical and readymade garments industries in India with the Trump’s assertion for imposing 10 percent import. Notwithstanding, there is a caveat. Given the fact that China is the biggest supplier of these two items in USA market and they will attract much higher import tariff sthan India, viz, 60 percent, this will give an edge to India to cut into the share of Chinese products in the USA market. To this end, higher import tariffs on China could give a lease of life to Indian exporters to counter-balance the impact of a 10 hike in import tariffs on Indian products. In addition, the collapse of the Bangladesh government will leverage more scope to Indian exporters for garment exports in the USA market. Bangladesh is the third biggest exporter of garments in the USA market, sharing about 11 percent of imports of garments. Protectionism with regard to immigration is another important threat of Trump’s America First policy. India is the biggest beneficiary of H1B visas. Annually, more than 70 percent of H1B visas is issued to Indians. In his first term, Trump immigration policy increased the denial rate for H1B visas to 24 percent in 2018 and 21 percent in 2019. Nevertheless, this inversely acted in a benign manner to benefit India. Negated by restrictions on immigrants, US IT firms, who were more dependent on India for cost effective employees, opened their branches in India for off-shore services. This led USA investment to soar in India during the Trump period. It made a big leap from US$2.2 billion in 2017 to US$14.3 billion in 2020. The big IT and financial services companies, such as Intel and Morgan Stanley, made bulk investments in India. Currently, nearly 44 percent of US investment in India embraces computer software and hardware (mainly software). In summing up, a new era is likely to emerge for India’s relations with the USA, which will likely mitigate the threat of Trump's protectionism. This should dilute fears for SMEs, who are the backbone of India’s exports of garments and gems and jewelry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8DHWCY69-HV2	2024-11-13T08:57:21-08:00	
Introduction Of Psychology In Economics: The Emergence Of Behavio...	Economics, traditionally a field focused on mathematical models and rationality, experienced a major shift in the late 20th century with the introduction of psychology into its frameworks. This shift marked the birth of behavioral economics—a discipline that blends economic and psychological insights to better understand human decision-making. Unlike classical and neoclassical economics, which assume people make rational, utility-maximizing choices, behavioral economics considers cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences that often lead to irrational or inconsistent behaviors. The integration of psychology into economics has revolutionized our understanding of consumer behavior, public policy, and financial markets, making it one of the most exciting developments in the field. 1. Traditional Economic Models and Their Limitations For much of its history, economics relied on models that depicted individuals as 'homo economicus'—rational agents who always act in their own best interest and consistently make logical choices to maximize their utility. This model offered a simplified, orderly view of human behavior that allowed economists to create mathematical predictions about markets, prices, and consumer choices. However, as economists examined real-world data, they began to notice systematic discrepancies between these theoretical models and actual human behavior. People often made choices that seemed irrational or against their self-interest, defying predictions of classical economic models. For example, people would save less than they knew they should, gamble with risky investments, or prefer immediate rewards over future gains, despite knowing the potential costs. These 'anomalies' suggested that economic models based solely on rationality were incomplete and that human behavior could not be fully understood without accounting for psychological factors. 2. The Birth of Behavioral Economics The integration of psychology into economics began to take shape in the 1970s, led by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Their groundbreaking research on cognitive biases challenged the traditional view of rationality in economic decision-making. In a series of experiments, Kahneman and Tversky identified patterns of 'irrational' behavior that they termed cognitive biases—systematic errors in thinking that affect how people perceive risk, make judgments, and evaluate probabilities. One of their most notable contributions was prospect theory, which demonstrated that people do not evaluate potential losses and gains in a strictly rational way. Instead, they tend to exhibit 'loss aversion,' meaning they feel the pain of losing something more acutely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. This insight helped explain why people might hold onto losing investments for too long or avoid taking risks, even when potential gains outweigh potential losses.Behavioral economics, as this new field came to be known, quickly gained traction. It expanded to explore a range of cognitive biases, such as anchoring (relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered), confirmation bias (seeking information that supports one's beliefs), and overconfidence bias (overestimating one's own abilities or knowledge). These insights began reshaping economic thought, challenging the view that individuals act purely out of rational self-interest. 3. The Impact of Psychology on Economic Policy The integration of psychology into economics has had profound implications for public policy. Traditional economic policies often relied on incentives, such as tax breaks or penalties, to influence behavior, assuming people would respond in rational ways. But behavioral economics has shown that people's responses to incentives are often shaped by biases, framing, and social influences. One of the most influential concepts from behavioral economics is nudging—a technique popularized by economist Richard Thaler, who won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field. Nudges are subtle interventions that guide people toward making better choices without restricting their freedom. For instance, placing healthier foods at eye level in a cafeteria can encourage healthier eating choices, while automatically enrolling employees in retirement savings plans can help increase savings rates. By understanding the psychological factors behind decision-making, policymakers can design interventions that lead to better outcomes for individuals and society. 4. Behavioral Finance: Psychology in Financial Markets Psychology's influence on economics has also reshaped how we understand financial markets. Behavioral finance, a subfield of behavioral economics, examines how psychological factors influence investment behavior and market outcomes. Researchers have identified cognitive biases that often lead investors to make poor financial decisions, such as the herding effect (following the actions of others) or the endowment effect (overvaluing owned assets). These insights challenge the 'efficient market hypothesis,' which claims that markets are always rational and efficient. Instead, behavioral finance reveals that markets can be irrational and prone to bubbles or crashes fueled by collective biases and emotions. This understanding has influenced asset management, investment strategies, and financial regulations, as well as helped investors avoid common pitfalls. The Future of Economics with Psychological Insights As behavioral economics continues to grow, its influence has broadened beyond academic theory, impacting fields as diverse as marketing, healthcare, education, and environmental policy. The blending of psychology with economics has not only provided a more accurate view of human behavior but also sparked innovations in how we approach social issues and design economic systems. In the coming years, behavioral economics is likely to become even more integral to economics as a whole, integrating insights from neuroscience, sociology, and artificial intelligence. By embracing the complexity of human psychology, economics is evolving into a discipline that is not only more realistic but also more attuned to the diverse factors shaping human decisions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8OMa83tGKrNn	2024-11-13T08:55:07-08:00	
The Introduction Of Psychology In International Relations: A New ...	For much of its history, international relations (IR) was shaped by political theories that emphasized power, state interests, and strategic decision-making. Traditional schools of thought, such as realism and liberalism, have largely assumed that states act as rational, unitary actors pursuing clear national interests. However, this perspective often overlooks the complexities of human psychology, including emotions, cognitive biases, and social identities, all of which profoundly shape the behavior of leaders, policymakers, and citizens. In recent decades, the introduction of psychology into IR has provided valuable insights, highlighting how mental processes influence foreign policy decisions, shape conflicts, and determine the outcomes of diplomatic efforts. This article explores the role of psychology in international relations, examining its impact on the understanding of leadership, group dynamics, conflict escalation, and peace negotiations. Through psychological theories, IR scholars gain a richer, more nuanced understanding of international events, moving beyond simplistic models of rationality to account for the complexities of human behavior in global politics. 1. The Traditional Theories of International Relations and Their Limitations International relations theories have historically focused on material factors, such as military capabilities, economic power, and geopolitical interests. Realism, for example, assumes that states act rationally to maximize their security and power, often operating in an anarchic international system. Liberalism, by contrast, emphasizes cooperation, democratic institutions, and the role of international organizations in promoting peace. While these theories provide valuable frameworks for understanding state behavior, they often neglect the human elements that shape decision-making. Traditional IR theories tend to treat states as 'black boxes,' analyzing interactions between them without delving into the internal processes that drive decisions. But as psychology has entered the field, scholars have started to investigate how cognitive biases, emotions, and individual leadership traits influence foreign policy. By incorporating psychological insights, researchers are uncovering the limitations of models based on purely rational decision-making and gaining a deeper appreciation of the complex dynamics at play in international relations. 2. Leadership Psychology: How Leaders Shape International Relations One of the most influential areas of psychological research in IR concerns the role of individual leaders. Leaders' personalities, values, and cognitive processes significantly influence their decisions, sometimes even shaping the course of entire nations. Psychological theories offer insights into how leaders' personalities affect their foreign policy choices, particularly in times of crisis.• Personality Traits and Decision-MakingStudies show that leaders' personalities can strongly influence their political choices. For instance, leaders with high levels of openness may be more inclined to seek diplomatic solutions, while those with high levels of aggression or narcissism might favor confrontational approaches. Psychological profiling of leaders can reveal tendencies toward risk-aversion, compromise, or assertiveness, helping IR scholars and diplomats anticipate possible policy shifts and reactions. Cognitive Biases and Misjudgments Leaders are subject to cognitive biases that impact their perception of international events. One notable example is confirmation bias, where leaders seek information that supports their preconceived beliefs, leading to flawed assessments and potential conflicts. During the Cold War, both U.S. and Soviet leaders often misinterpreted each other's actions due to deeply entrenched biases, escalating tensions that nearly resulted in nuclear conflict. Emotional Influences on Decision-Making Emotions play a significant role in international relations, especially in high-stakes situations. Fear, anger, and pride can drive leaders to make irrational choices that defy strategic logic. For example, fear of perceived threats can lead to preemptive strikes, while national pride can make it difficult for leaders to make compromises or concede territory. 3. Group Dynamics and the Psychology of Policymaking Teams Psychology has also illuminated the ways in which group dynamics within governments and advisory teams influence foreign policy decisions. Decisions are rarely made by a single leader; instead, they emerge from interactions among small groups of advisors, diplomats, and military officials, each with their own perspectives and motivations. Psychological insights into group behavior reveal how groupthink, social identity, and in-group biases shape policy outcomes. Groupthink and Foreign Policy Groupthink occurs when a cohesive group strives for consensus, leading members to suppress dissenting opinions. This phenomenon has been implicated in several foreign policy failures, such as the U.S. decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Groupthink can prevent policymakers from critically assessing the risks and consequences of their actions, leading to flawed decisions based on incomplete information. Social Identity and National Interests Social identity theory posits that individuals derive part of their self-concept from their group memberships, which can influence international relations. Leaders and policymakers may prioritize the interests of their 'in-group' (such as their nation or ethnic group) and perceive 'out-groups' (foreign nations or cultures) as threats. This tendency can lead to increased nationalism, stereotyping, and conflict escalation, making cooperation more challenging. Collective Emotions and Public Opinion National crises, wars, and diplomatic tensions often evoke strong emotions among the public. Leaders, in turn, may feel pressure to respond in ways that align with popular sentiment, even if those responses are not strategically sound. Collective emotions, such as outrage over an attack or empathy for allied nations, shape public opinion, which influences foreign policy decisions. Psychological studies on collective emotions provide valuable insights into how leaders might respond to crises under domestic pressure. 4. Conflict Escalation and Misperceptions: The Role of Cognitive Biases Cognitive biases often play a critical role in conflict escalation, as states misinterpret each other's intentions, misjudge threats, and overestimate their own abilities. A psychological approach to IR helps explain why conflicts sometimes escalate even when neither party initially desires war. The Attribution Bias Attribution bias occurs when states attribute hostile intentions to others' actions while viewing their own actions as defensive. For example, during the Cold War, both the U.S. and Soviet Union interpreted each other's military build-ups as aggressive, despite seeing their own actions as defensive. This mutual suspicion created a dangerous cycle of arms races and brinkmanship. The Overconfidence Effect Overconfidence bias leads leaders to overestimate their chances of success in conflict, underestimating risks and costs. This bias has been observed in numerous conflicts, where leaders pursue aggressive strategies without fully considering the consequences. For instance, studies suggest that overconfidence played a role in the decisions leading to the Vietnam War, as U.S. leaders underestimated the resilience and commitment of the North Vietnamese forces. The 'Mirror Image' Bias Mirror image bias causes states to view themselves as morally superior while perceiving their adversaries as fundamentally aggressive or dishonest. This bias reinforces hostile perceptions and impedes diplomatic solutions, as neither side is willing to concede or acknowledge the validity of the other's perspective. Recognizing this bias can be a first step toward reducing tensions and fostering dialogue. 5. Negotiation and Peace Processes: Psychological Insights for Conflict Resolution The psychology of negotiation and conflict resolution has made significant contributions to peace processes and diplomatic efforts. Psychological research offers insights into how negotiators can build trust, overcome biases, and foster cooperation. Building Empathy and Trust Research shows that empathy can be a powerful tool in negotiations, allowing parties to understand each other's perspectives and motivations. In peace negotiations, such as those in Northern Ireland, empathy-building exercises have helped negotiators overcome historical grievances, leading to more constructive dialogue. Overcoming Hostility Through Cognitive Reframing Cognitive reframing, or the process of changing how a situation is perceived, can be instrumental in peace negotiations. By reframing issues to focus on common interests rather than historical conflicts, negotiators can reduce hostility and encourage cooperation. This approach was used in the Camp David Accords, where Egypt and Israel were able to reframe their historical animosities to focus on mutual benefits of peace. Promoting Positive Intergroup Contact Psychological theories on intergroup contact suggest that positive interactions between rival groups can reduce prejudice and foster cooperation. In post-conflict settings, programs that bring together former adversaries—such as cultural exchanges, joint economic projects, and educational initiatives—have helped build social cohesion and reduce the risk of renewed conflict. The Future of Psychology in International Relations As global challenges like climate change, migration, and technological disruption reshape the international landscape, psychology will likely play an increasingly important role in IR. Understanding the psychological factors that drive leaders, shape public opinion, and influence intergroup dynamics is essential for developing effective, sustainable solutions to complex global issues. Integrating psychology into IR provides valuable tools for conflict resolution, humanitarian efforts, and diplomatic negotiations. By recognizing the role of human psychology, IR scholars and practitioners can move beyond traditional models to create more adaptive and resilient strategies. In an interconnected world, psychological insights offer a pathway toward more empathetic, cooperative, and stable international relations, helping leaders and nations navigate the complexities of global politics with a deeper understanding of the human mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8BnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-13T08:53:26-08:00	
Centcom Conducts Strikes In Yemen, Syria	By C. Todd Lopez Since Friday, U.S. Central Command has conducted strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen and against targets in Syria as part of the defeat-ISIS mission there. On Saturday and Sunday, Centcom forces executed airstrikes against multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder during a briefing Tuesday. 'These facilities housed a variety of advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target U.S. and international military and civilian vessels navigating international waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' Ryder said. Both Air Force and Navy assets, including F-35C fighter aircraft, were involved in the strikes, which were in response to Houthi attacks on commercial, U.S. and coalition vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden. 'As you've heard us say before, we will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' Ryder said. Yesterday, Ryder said, Centcom also conducted strikes against nine targets in two locations associated with Iranian groups in Syria. The strikes, he said, were in response to two attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria that happened Nov. 10 at Mission Support Site Green Village in northeast Syria. One of those attacks involved a UAV, while the second attack involved an indirect fire incident with two rockets. There were no U.S. injuries involved with either attack. Ryder said the U.S. strikes will degrade the ability of Iranian-backed groups to plan and launch future attacks on U.S and coalition forces who are in the region to conduct the defeat-ISIS operations. Centcom commander Army Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said the U.S. will do what's needed to defend its personnel in the Centcom area of responsibility. 'Our message is clear. Attacks against U.S. and coalition partners in the region will not be tolerated,' said Kurilla. 'We will continue to take every step necessary to protect our personnel and coalition partners and respond to reckless attacks.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8Luofv7p8eIb	2024-11-13T08:51:31-08:00	
American Interventionist Foreign Policy: One And A Quarter Centur...	When Theodore Roosevelt succeeded William McKinley as president in 1901, he realized the US was no longer just a continental republic; with the Spanish-American War of 1898, America now claimed Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines as territories, Cuba a protectorate and annexed Hawaii. Roosevelt 'believed it was the burden of ‘civilized’ nations to uplift ‘uncivilized’ nations,' says Michael Patrick Cullinane. He believed U.S. interests were global interests, and that it was actually good for 'civilized' nations to intervene in other countries’ affairs. Moreover, the 26th president made sure the U.S. played a larger role in international affairs by extending the Monroe doctrine through the Roosevelt Corollary – the United States, henceforth, would protect countries in the Americas from recolonization by European powers, and would intervene militarily if necessary to do so. It was a foreign policy he described as 'speak softly and carry a big stick.' US presidents since Roosevelt have pursued his 'big stick' foreign policy agenda. In the slightly less than a hundred years from 1898 to 1994, the U.S. government (directly or indirectly) has intervened successfully to change governments in Latin America, alone, at least 41 times. That amounts to once every 28 months for an entire century. Overall, while the United States engaged in 46 military interventions from 1948–1991, from 1992–2017 that number increased fourfold to 188. The 'first' Roosevelt era was the beginning of America's orientation towards interventionism – it would influence America’s interventionist policies for the next one and a quarter century. In more than 80 countries worldwide, the US manages over 750 military facilities. With such distribution of military capabilities, it has and continues to influence (if not actually intervene) in major and minor conflicts – most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In May of this year, the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal called for the US to assist the opposition in overthrowing the Iranian regime after the death in a helicopter crash of Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi. And in the 'breadbasket' of Europe, former Deputy Secretary of State (and 'war hawk') Victoria Nuland continued to agitate for greater belligerency – urging the White House to help Ukraine strike deep inside Russian territory. Given the recent incursion by Kiev into Russia’s Kursk region, Biden appears to have acquiesced to that view. The US has since the Second World War and especially after the fall of the Wall in ‘89, pursued foreign policy initiatives that foster calls for escalation, rather than diplomatic discourse, in potentially serious geopolitical situations. In the late 1970s and ’80s, the U.S. funneled billions of dollars to Islamist extremists, including the Mujahideen Muslim guerrilla fighters that resisted the Soviet’s 10-year invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. While those fighters eventually expelled Russian influence, they later fought each other for dominance. In the ensuing power struggle (using American weapons), a cadre of those rebels (including Osama Bin Laden) ultimately coalesced into the Taliban, al-Qaeda – and 911. Since 9/11, America has expended over $8 trillion on wars with 'enemies' and 'friends' in the Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen define the former – Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan the latter. And this while thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilians perish in America's foreign policy interventions to 'nation-build' and make the Middle East safe for democracy. Yet, irrespective of America’s decades-long failed foreign policy initiatives in the region, there are those who remain sanguine about further meddling in the Middle East. America's history in Iran is a prime example of what we should not have done in the past and should not do in the future. In 1953, the U.S. CIA along with Britain’s MI6 engineered the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The latter had nationalist leanings and opposed British petroleum companies’ exclusive oil rights in the country. The West further feared (without substantiation) that Mosaddegh had Communist sympathies that might push him to support the Soviets. Following the coup, the U.S. installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – a brutal dictator – loyal to the policies of the West. Decades of the Shah’s repressive rule inspired hatred toward America that culminated in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and the Iranian Revolution. The Shah was ousted and the government replaced with the theocratic Islamic Republic we have today. And as we saw earlier, some want the U.S. to (once more) overthrow an Iranian government we were instrumental in bringing to power. Former Congressman Ron Paul said it very well in 2008: Terrorists 'don’t come here and attack us because we’re rich and we’re free. They come and they attack us because we’re over there.' The wars in Iraq are quintessential examples of American foreign policy initiatives based on shortsighted aims of neoconservative ideology during the George W. Bush years. Personal enmity and faulty (or unpopular) intelligence resulted in thousands of Americans killed based on a false premise. There never were any weapons of mass destruction – just the hatred of an arrogant Iraqi leader and the questionable notion of nation-building in the Middle East. Today, the wars continue. The US played an integral role in the events that led to the devastating war between Russia and Ukraine. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union in ‘89, NATO remained intact and expanded eastward. Soviet expert George Kennan, a key architect of US Cold War policy, warned such action would be 'a tragic mistake' that would ultimately provoke 'a bad reaction from Russia.' For over a decade now, against the warnings of former ambassador to Russia and current CIA Director William Burns, the U.S. has openly advocated for Ukrainian entry into NATO, a hard 'red line' for Russia. Even though Western meddling in the affairs of Ukraine was anathema to the Russians, the U.S. helped engineer a coup to overthrow the democratically elected president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. The latter had announced that he would sign an economic agreement with Russia instead of the E.U. This would eventually lead to the Ukraine-Russia war currently in its second year of hostilities. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has disclosed that in 2021 (one year before the Ukraine-Russia conflict began) Russia sent NATO a draft treaty regarding Ukraine. The terms required NATO to abandon any future plans of expansion as a precondition for Russia not invading Ukraine. The West refused. Only then did Russia invade. The invasion, while reprehensible, certainly was telegraphed by Moscow and with no less than due warning. Recent research by Monica Duffy Toft, professor of international politics at Tufts, is instructive. The US she finds, is indeed engaging in military interventions more often than previously, and for different reasons. 'The rate of interventions has accelerated over time, and since the end of the Cold War, we’ve been pursuing fewer and lower national interests,' says Toft. Just since the year 2000, Toft's 5-year research project documents 72 interventions. And in one region of the world, the Middle East and North Africa, the U.S. has been involved in 77 military interventions, mostly since the 1940s. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of 'whack-a-mole,' in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has 'only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer' of military force. The professor is clear in her assessment: Overreliance on destabilizing sanctions and military force rather than diplomacy, intelligence gathering, economic statecraft, and the powers of persuasion harms America's reputation abroad, causing itself to be viewed as a threat – diminishing its influence in the process. America's current self-imposed role as the 'world's policeman' is a capitulation of US diplomatic leadership. But this is what happens when a great country like the United States allows decades of mediocre leadership to prevail. Political agendas produce foreign policy initiatives (Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine) inconsistent with what is in the best interest of America. US foreign policy should seek two objectives: Keeping America safe and fostering America’s economic and political hegemony through strategic leadership rather than jeopardizing both by trying to be the 'world's policeman.' Professor Toft declares against an isolationist position, but neither she says should America's foreign policy default position be one of military intervention first. A century of this has failed to produce a safer world for anyone – including America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8B8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-13T08:50:06-08:00	
Russian Experts Find Trump’s Ukraine Policy Fanciful – OpEd	Since Zelensky will not accept Trump's purported peace plan, he should be replaced by a more amenable Ukrainian leader, a Russian expert has said. Russian foreign policy experts are broadly appreciative of US President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy pronouncements. But they have grave doubts about his ability to get Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to sit across a table and thrash out a mutually acceptable way of ending the war. Russian experts writing in Russia Today website find Trump's approach to the Ukraine question to be based on simplistic notions and not on a good understanding of the deep-rooted sentiments among Ukrainians about independence from Russia. Also, Trump has not grasped the Russia's well-founded fears about Europe and NATO using Ukraine against it. In fact, one of the experts even hinted that the only way Trump can bring an end to the war is by bringing about a regime change in Ukraine to bring in a leader who is amenable to giving Russia the concessions it expects to ensure its security. Appreciating the general drift of Trump's foreign policy, Fyodor Lukyanov says: 'Trump stands for a change in positioning. Instead of global dominance, there will be a vigorous defence of specific American interests. Priority will be given to those that bring clear benefits, not in the long term, but now.' Lukyanov goes further and says that Trump's belief in the primacy of domestic over foreign policy, which has always characterized Trump's supporters and has now spread throughout the Republican Party, means that his choice of international issues is going to be selective and restricted. 'Preserving the moral and political hegemony of the US is not an end in itself, but a tool. In such a system of priorities, the Ukrainian project loses the destiny it has in the eyes of the adherents of the liberal order. It becomes a pawn in a larger game,' Lukyanov points out. Another peculiarity he sees in Trump, is that the President-elect doesn't see war as an acceptable tool. 'Yes, Trump will use hard bargaining, muscle-flexing and coercive pressure (as practiced in his usual business), but not destructive armed conflict, because that is irrational.' Lukyanov looks at Trump's previous term and notices his refreshing approach to regional conflicts. One was the 'Abraham Accords', an agreement that facilitated formal relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. The second was the meetings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, including a full-fledged summit in Hanoi. 'The first was the result of shuttle diplomacy by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The powerful financial interests of America, the Gulf monarchies and Israel led to a series of shady political deals. The current situation in the region is many times worse than it was then, but it cannot be said that the arrangements (the Abraham Accords) have collapsed. The framework is still in place,' Lukyanov asserts. However, that Middle Eastern settlement model may not be applicable to the situation in the Ukraine conflict, where the warring parties are fighting for their very existence and where room for manoeuvre is more limited. Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that Trump has thrown open a window of opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to explore solutions so that the extremely destructive war is brought to an end, Lukyanov says. But a leading Russian columnist on military affairs, Mikhail Khodarenok, is less sanguine. He is convinced that Trump's reported Ukraine peace plan is doomed to fail. Khodarenok quotes Wall Street Journal to say that Trump envisages a suspension of military operations along the front line, the creation of a demilitarized zone (DMZ), a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO for at least 20 years, and the West continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons. Wall Street Journal further says that Trump's promise to end the war by January's Inauguration Day puts him in the position of having to choose between competing proposals from his advisers, though all advisors are agreed on one basic point, that Joe Biden's plans to transfer arms and military equipment to Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' should be rejected outright. Khodarenok recalls that throughout his election campaign, Trump had sharply criticized Biden's handling of Ukraine, warning that it had brought the world closer to World War III, and that Ukraine had cheated the US out of billions of dollars in free weapons. According to Wall Street Journal Trump has not yet approved the final plan for resolving the conflict. He intends to continue discussing it with his closest advisers, the paper said. It is not clear what the de-militarized Zone (DMZ) would look like. Does it cover all the regions taken by Russia including the Crimean Peninsula? And if the classic definition of a DMZ is applied, military facilities on it must be removed, and the deployment of armed forces, the fortification of the terrain, and the conduct of combat and operational training activities on it are prohibited. According to the purported plan, the US will continue to supply Ukraine with arms and other military equipment. The US has promised this only to keep the Russians in check and prevent them from swiftly moving in and taking over all of Ukraine In all likelihood, Ukraine will reject this package, Khodarenok says. Maintaining the security regime in the DMZ will require, among other things, the presence of a contingent of peacekeepers (if only to separate the parties' forces). But since the US will not put its boots on the ground, its European allies may have to contribute units. Then, there is the question of Russia being allowed to keep (for ever), the territories it captured. Also, the role of NATO has to be restricted. According to Wall Street Journal, Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO for the next 20 years. Khodarenok wonders if such an assurance can be extracted from Ukraine when it is mortally afraid of Russia. And what is the sanctity of a 20-year bar on entering NATO, he asks. The Russian expert says the Ukrainian leadership will be the main stumbling block on the road to peace, as they completely and 'insanely' believe that there is only one way to keep the Russians away, and that is to defeat them militarily. But Ukraine lacks the means to do so. According to the expert, the only way in which Trump can move forward on Ukraine is to install in Kiev a new leadership capable of fulfilling his peace plan. The leadership should be reasonable, only then will negotiations be possible, Khodarenok says. In other words, Trump US must bring a regime change in Ukraine as part of the peace process.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0rjmhE2TKDTJ	2024-11-13T08:48:15-08:00	
Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition Among The United States...	The development of nuclear weapons by the erstwhile Soviet Union (USSR) in 1949 marked the beginning of nuclear polarisation between the USSR and the US, which became the major element of the Cold War. China joined the nuclear club when it crossed the nuclear threshold in 1964 and maintained a minimum deterrence policy with a No First Use (NFU) doctrine. However, recent developments in Taiwan Straits, South and East China Seas have transformed the strategic status quo compelling China to work towards achieving a more favorable nuclear equation vis-a-vis the US in terms of warheads and delivery systems, altering the strategic landscape in response to the changing global environment. In his book Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition among the United States, Russia and China, Robert Litwak explores the transition from a bipolar nuclear world to what Henry Kissinger called 'a new era' of tripolar nuclear security and rivalry between the US, Russia and China. The book comprises four chapters. First chapter addresses the destabilising shift from the two great powers (US and USSR) to an emergent tripolar nuclear order in which China seeks to maintain a balance of power with the US and Russia. Chapters two and three describe the strategic stability as an interaction between arms race stability and crisis stability. The final chapter assesses the risks and challenges to security in the event of a tripolar world phenomenon in which the rules-based system has been largely destroyed. The theme of the book revolves around the argument that the combination of emerging nuclear tripolarity and geostrategic tensions over Ukraine and Taiwan are recreating two interlocking Cold War risks. These factors threaten to undermine both arms race stability and crisis stability – the two elements that comprise strategic stability (p.6). Analysts have identified two major risks in the emergent tripolar nuclear order: (i) the stability-instability paradox; and (ii) balance of terror. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was a clear example of the potentially catastrophic consequences of 'unmanaged competition' between the US and the USSR. In its aftermath, a key factor in strategic stability has been the threat of retaliation, based on assured second-strike nuclear capability. From this perspective, China’s development of a larger survivable nuclear force may play a stabilising role (p.87) by deterring potential aggression from other nuclear powers and reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. Litwak, in describing the transition period of the post-Cold War era, argues that the triangular relationship among the three powers – US, Russia and China – has created new strategic challenges and complexities that are not adequately addressed by existing nuclear deterrence theories and arms control agreements. According to the author, each leg of the triangle is not equivalent because of the uneven distribution of their power (economic and military) and trilateral politics, which have evolved over the decades. (p.22) One of the book’s strengths lies in its thorough analysis of each country’s nuclear strategy and posture. Litwak delves into the doctrinal shifts, modernisation efforts, and strategic calculations that underpin the nuclear policies of the US, Russia and China. He provides a nuanced understanding of how these countries perceive each other’s capabilities and intentions, and how these perceptions shape their respective approaches to deterrence and arms control. For example, the US withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, had implications for the sufficiency of China’s minimum deterrent posture. Secondly, the termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, concluded with the Soviet Union in 1988, could now permit US deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Asia to counter China. (p.33) The author has also explored the implications of emerging technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, missile defense systems, cyber capabilities and artificial intelligence, on the strategic stability of the tripolar nuclear competition. The extension of strategic competition into the domains of cyberspace and outer space creates additional escalatory risks that undermine crisis stability. He raises important questions about the potential for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation in today’s more complex and less predictable environment. Beyond assessment, Litwak also offers thoughtful policy recommendations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with tripolar nuclear competition. He advocates renewed diplomatic engagement and avoiding the use of conventional military weapons to prevent inadvertent escalation among the three powers, emphasising the need for innovative arms control frameworks that account for the realities of the current strategic landscape. The author also underscores the importance of crisis communication mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of accidental or unintended conflict. (p.107) The book is well-researched and comprehensive in its contents. The issues discussed are complex and require close attention of the reader. However, for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of global security, Litwak’s analysis provides invaluable insights and a fresh perspective on the evolving dynamics of nuclear competition in the 21st century. The author’s work stands out for its depth of analysis and relevance to contemporary global security challenges. The book not only elucidates the dangers inherent in the current tripolar nuclear order but also offers a constructive path forward for reducing the risks associated with catastrophic conflicts. The book is a timely contribution to the discourse on global security, particularly in an era marked by growing geopolitical tensions and the erosion of established arms control frameworks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-13T08:46:07-08:00	
Will Artificial Intelligence Develop At The Expense Of Natural In...	Since time immemorial, humans have taken pride in the natural intelligence they possess, which helps them analyse information, process ideas, assess the pros and cons of various scenarios, and arrive at firm judgements. This is an essential human attribute that animals lack, as they are driven solely by survival instincts and do not possess the capacity to discern between good and bad. While this natural intelligence—featuring analytical ability, memory power, and the capability for quick thinking and logical conclusions—is inherent in every human being, it must be developed and fine-tuned through practice. If neglected, this ability will become dormant and may decline over time. Failure to nurture and apply our natural intelligence effectively amounts to disregarding this God-given capacity. At a recent consultative meeting, a school teacher from India shared an anecdote illustrating how the learning process is evolving among young students in line with technological advancements and the proliferation of electronic gadgets. The teacher recounted asking a student his age, to which he correctly responded, '12 years and 4 months.' When asked for his grandfather's age, the student also answered correctly, saying, '79 years and 3 months.' However, when asked to calculate the difference between the two ages within 20 seconds, the student initially tried to count on his fingers before starting to look around. Upon being asked what he was searching for, he replied, 'A calculator.' The teacher noted that, in earlier times, mental arithmetic exercises were common in schools. Teachers would give students timed sums to solve mentally, aiming to encourage quick and alert thinking among students in their formative years. Nowadays, however, this practice seems to be disappearing, with many young students relying on calculators for basic arithmetic. In the past, teachers also insisted that students memorise tables and poems, a practice intended to strengthen memory from an early age—an invaluable skill as they grew older. Similarly, précis writing was once considered an essential exercise for helping students distil the key points of a text, organise information, and convey it succinctly, aiding comprehension for the reader. Today, however, this practice appears to be fading, with many believing artificial intelligence can accomplish this task instead. With the growth of technology, even public speaking has transformed. Many speakers now rely on teleprompters, and the art of extemporaneous speaking, which requires a dynamic thought process tailored to the occasion, seems to be diminishing. In another instance, a college student studying world history was asked by his teacher to quickly outline the events leading to World War II. The student responded that he would need to open his laptop to retrieve the information. When the teacher stressed the importance of memory, the student replied that, in his view, it was unnecessary to retain such details when they are readily available online. He added that he didn't see the point in using his mental resources for information that could be accessed instantly on the internet. Taken aback, the teacher was left questioning whether the student's perspective might be valid. Noticing his teacher's confusion, the student politely suggested that he 'use artificial intelligence to find an answer'! Despite the rise of artificial intelligence, fostering and utilising natural intelligence remains crucial. Artificial intelligence itself must be guided and assessed by natural intelligence, given that it is a creation of human ingenuity. Therefore, excessive dependence on artificial intelligence for analysis, interpretation, and judgement may pose significant risks. While artificial intelligence offers an impressive array of tools, it should be seen as a limited aid, not a comprehensive solution. Artificial intelligence is still an evolving field, and policies regarding its use are yet to be fully developed or standardised globally. Currently, there is no international consensus on the strategies and frameworks for its implementation. For humanity to progress as a civilised society, natural intelligence, memory power, analytical ability, and the capacity to discern right from wrong based on ethical values are indispensable. In short, natural intelligence can be complemented but never wholly replaced by artificial intelligence. Let it not be a case of artificial intelligence versus human intelligence; rather, let artificial intelligence be scrutinised, evaluated, and deployed thoughtfully by natural intelligence at all times.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0iUZlNZE-2vR	2024-11-13T08:44:17-08:00	
Turkey Cannot Halt Oil Shipments From Azerbaijan To Israel Withou...	Turkey lacks the authority to halt oil shipments from Azerbaijan to Israel without a UN sanctions resolution. At most, Turkey can request or advise Azerbaijan on the matter. Ultimately, Azerbaijan has the sole right to decide who buys its oil. If Turkey were to block shipments through the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline because they are destined for Israel, it would be liable for compensating investors and producers for their financial losses. The agreements governing BTC, IGA, and HGA pipelines are structured to protect such investments; otherwise, investors would be unwilling to fund these major projects. The BTC pipeline and the broader East-West energy corridor were initially conceived with the goal of securing energy supplies for Israel. For instance, prior to the Blue Stream project, there was the Lassere Project, which aimed to transport natural gas to Israel. Gazprom, one of the Lassere Project partners, adapted the plan to cross the Black Sea, proposing three pipeline routes: two lines for Turkey and one for Israel, each with a capacity of 8 billion cubic meters. However, when Israel discovered its own offshore natural gas reserves, the Israeli pipeline portion of the project was abandoned. The United States places a high priority on ensuring Israel's energy security, given Israel's role as its most important ally in the region. From their perspective, this focus is understandable. We are not presenting these observations as a criticism but to illustrate that the realities we recognized in the past are now becoming more widely understood.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-13T08:40:21-08:00	
Ukraine ‘Outgunned And Outnumbered’: Desertions En Masse – OpEd	Early 2022 witnessed the high morale of the Ukrainian military and civilian population resulting in to be a force multiplier for the Ukrainian army’s defense power against the war with Russia. In comparison, the low morale of the Russian supported forces and military near neutralized Russia’s overwhelming military superiority over Ukraine in the early months of the war. The initial euphoria of February 2022 of joining the forces to protect their motherland has evaporated, owing to an astronomical number of deaths. Ukraine’s military is now ‘Outgunned and Outnumbered’, struggling with low morale and high rate of desertions. As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops have started to desert. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. This prolonged war nearing three years have near decimated many Ukrainian infantry battalions making the situation grim on the battle fronts. Reinforcements are few and difficult to be created, leaving soldiers exhausted, demoralized and desert. Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky determined to continue fighting the war, young Ukrainians are fiercely opposing conscription and refusing to go to the warfront to get killed. The escalating fighting along a more than 1,000-km front line is stretching Ukraine's already outnumbered troops. Ukraine said on Nov 11 that its hard-pressed military was battling 50,000 troops in Russia's Kursk region to its north, while also scrambling to reinforce two besieged fronts in the east and bracing to meet an infantry assault in the south. Crucially, soldiers say they are poorly armed and complain of having the enemy in sight, watching them advance, and being unable to fire because they have no ammunition, according to accounts from soldiers reported by CNN. The figures vary Truth is the first casualty in any war and so has been in this Ukraine- Russia War. True statistics are not available from both the nations and their militaries. The casualty figures and damage destruction estimates for both sides have been exaggerated for the opposing sides! Military War Casualties. Citing a confidential estimate from Ukraine earlier this year, the report suggested that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died, while 400,000 had been wounded. Meanwhile, Western intelligence estimates suggest Russian losses range from 200,000 dead to around 400,000 wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have kept their war casualties confidential. In February, Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that around 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. However, former political and security officials believe this figure underplays the true scale of losses in order to maintain public morale and continue recruitment efforts. Desertions. According to the Kyiv Post, it is believed that about 60,000 people have been facing criminal charges for fleeing their posts since the war started. However, British daily The Times also cited figures from the prosecutor general which, it said, showed some 51,000 criminal cases were initiated for desertion and abandonment of a military unit between January and September of this year. El Pais cited a closer figure of 45,543 desertions between January and August this year, which it said was data from the Prosecutor General’s Office which had been leaked to the Ukrainian press. Ukraine’s youth not willing to fight a war that’s not their own. Ukrainian army today faces a serious desertion crisis as 30,000-plus soldiers have already fled from their posts. Civilian Deaths. As of 31 August, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) had verified that conflict-related violence had killed 11,743 civilians and injured 24,614 in Ukraine since 24 February 2022.Independent assessments have put the civilian toll closer to 100,000. Migrants. Some 14 million Ukrainian Migrantshave fled their homes either to other countries or other parts of Ukraine. According to the UN refugee agency, Poland is sheltering more than 1.5 million people from Ukraine. Will the majority migrants ever come back. Russian leaflets calling for Ukrainian troops surrender Russian troops dropped leaflets using drones with special QR codes (23 September 2024) calling for the surrender of Ukrainian troops, who are still entrenched in Novoukrainka in the South Donetsk direction west of Ugledar. Each leaflet dropped contained a call to immediately abandon their weapons, giving the enemy the opportunity to surrender on the battlefield, and instructions on how to do so, before their positions are powerfully stormed! The two-year battle for Ugledar, is likely to end with a victory for the Russian troops! This situation was expected much earlier and truth had to prevail about the ground reality; 'They do not want to fight because they don’t see a clear cause worth fighting for: they are beginning to realize that they are not fighting for Ukraine; at best, they’re fighting for Zelensky and his circle, who are profiting tremendously from this Ukrainian tragedy. They realize that they are fighting for Europe and for the Americans, and that neither Zelensky, nor the Europeans, nor the Americans care about Ukrainian lives.' As part of the plan to boost morale of the front-line troops specially trained officers are posted to provide moral and psychological support. No one talks of Peace including the UN The US, NATO and the West wants the war to continue and escalate in order to weaken Russia. Zelensky has a so called ‘Victory Plan’ if adequately supported by the Western allies led by the US. From the heads of states of the stake holders to gun makers, traders, diplomats, the war is lucrative for everyone. Will the US President-elect Donald Trump having promised to bring an end to these ongoing wars of Ukraine and Gaza succeed? Both the wars have brought profit and prosperity to the US arms industry. Militarism is the US national religion 'We believe in wars. We may no longer believe in formal declarations of war…We believe in weaponry, the more expensive the better'. Will Donald Trump change this American belief in his second tenure as the US President? No one talks of Peace including the UN. The powerful players do not listen to the UN.

Pollsters Miss ‘Sleeper Issues’ – OpEd	Pollsters seeking to tap what is on the mind of voters are right to focus on the big issues: the economy, illegal immigration, crime, abortion, education, healthcare, foreign policy, and the like. But there are other matters that affect voters, though they are not front and center in most people’s minds. They are more like 'sleeper issues.' Lots of Americans these days, especially those in their middle years and older, are voicing a sense of uneasiness, even bewilderment, about the state of our society in general. Their apprehension is not necessarily rooted in something that Washington has done. It’s more a realization that things have gotten out of whack. Extremes dominate. In large part, the extremes are rooted in culture, not politics. We can tell from public opinion research that Americans are very concerned about the moral direction of the country. Selfishness, self-absorption, rudeness, and a complete disregard for the rights and sensibilities of others is evident in school and the workplace. Inappropriate use of cell phones—on trains and buses and in bars and restaurants—is commonplace. Those who sport vulgar lyrics and videos take no responsibility for how they corrupt young people. Car drivers are increasing distracted and unwilling to yield. Those on bicycles and scooters—the motorized ones are the worst—show no regard for public safety. All of these things feed the perception that America is becoming unhinged. The fact that few are held accountable for their transgressions makes things worse. There are also policy issues that matter in this regard. When school officials and politicians aid and abet mentally challenged young people who want to transition to the opposite sex—absent parental consent—they are contributing to our culture of opportunism. Ditto for hospitals that exploit these disturbed minors by fast-tracking the changes. It’s all about ideological extremism and greed. It could be argued that it would be illogical for voters to blame politicians for the cultural issues that are making people uneasy. Technically, that is true. But in the real world, we are all a blend of reason and emotion. In other words, those upset with extremism in the culture are likely to blame officials who harbor an extremist political agenda for cultural depravities. For example, politicians who believe that tampons should be put in boys’ bathrooms are clearly not responsible for those who talk loudly on their cell phones in public places, but because they promote extremist policies, voters may see them as emblematic of our overall condition. This is the kind of 'sleeper issue' that is in the back of people’s minds. Such issues are capable of exploding at election time—it’s like a frustration time bomb—yet they are not likely to be discerned by pollsters. In short, cultural issues are often treated as insignificant by pollsters during election season. This explains, in part, why they are so often wrong in their prognostications. What’s in the back of people’s minds has a way of leaping to the front, or at least becoming more important, when they cast their ballot. The price for extremism is costly in a democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0kx3cU0zDwjT	2024-11-13T08:34:43-08:00	
Karachi-Chittagong Ports Connectivity Between Pakistan And Bangla...	On November 13, a direct cargo ship from Karachi, Pakistan, arrived in the port of Chittagong, Bangladesh, establishing the first-ever direct maritime connection between the two nations. This was a huge step to strengthen the connections. The Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea bind Bangladesh and Pakistan, who are close neighbors. Both nations would gain from the growth of these marine linkages in terms of regional communications, trade, and investment. 2907 nautical miles separate the ports of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and Karachi, Pakistan. Trade was conducted through Singapore and other nearby ports due to the lack of marine connectivity between Chattogram Port and Pakistan's port in Karachi. Consequently, trading volumes have not yet reached a noteworthy level. However, Pakistan and Bangladesh are positioned well on a number of economic indices. Therefore, they wish to use this marine link to improve bilateral commerce. Although ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan remained chilly under Sheikh Hasina's 15-year administration, optimism about the possible normalization of comprehensive economic connections has been reignited by Bangladesh's recent political upheaval. Bangladesh is looking for additional overseas partners to help it overcome the present economic issues. Therefore, increasing trade and economic cooperation as well as looking into joint ventures and investment possibilities may be advantageous to both parties and promote regional development. The direct route promises to save travel times and greatly simplify supply networks. With an expected capacity of 2,300 TEUs and the ability to carry a wide range of cargo, the ship's journey demonstrates the rising need for direct trade between the two nations. In addition to creating a more integrated commerce network throughout the area, Syed Ahmed Maroof, Pakistan's High Commissioner to Bangladesh, described the direct shipping route as a significant step forward in strengthening corporate and bilateral trade connections between Pakistan and Bangladesh. According to him, the program would not only quicken current trade flows but also open up new business prospects for companies of all sizes, from tiny importers to major exporters. Cotton accounted for the majority of Pakistan's $839 million in exports to Bangladesh in 2022. Jute and other textile fibers were Bangladesh's top exports to Pakistan, which brought in $74 million. The majority of Bangladesh's imports from Pakistan include equipment, cotton, salt, and sulfur—raw materials used in the apparel sector. At least $2.95 billion worth of commodities, including textiles, agricultural products, food, chemicals, and more, might be exported from Pakistan to Bangladesh. Bangladesh might potentially be a major market for Pakistani exports like jute and medicinal items. Through organizations like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), both nations might investigate further regional economic integration.With increased commerce between the two nations, there has been a renewed push for the establishment of direct shipping services between the ports of Chittagong and Karachi. The primary seaport in Bangladesh is Chittagong. The Chattagram Port Terminal handles 90% of Bangladesh's commerce, with the remaining 80% going through the ports of Mangla and Payra. For the same reasons and with a notable increase in commerce, Bangladesh may likewise profit from using Pakistan's Gwadar port. commerce between Karachi and Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports will increase commerce and shorten the distance between the two nations. After that, this network may be expanded to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia, and Northeast China. Connectivity at sea is essential. To establish a trilateral access and distribution center, Sri Lanka's Colombo and Hambantota Ports can be used to link Pakistan's Gwadar ports, which include Karachi, Port Qasim, and Keti Bandar, with Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports. Products like cotton are imported by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka from Pakistan, Central Asian nations, Western and Central China, and even Russia. Bangladeshi clothing, pharmaceuticals, fruits, and vegetables, as well as its emerging IT services and electronic sectors, can be combined with Sri Lanka's traditional tea, clothing, rice, and agricultural businesses, as well as emerging mechanical and industrial manufacturing industries like car tires. Bangladesh is well situated to serve as a gateway between SAARC and ASEAN, giving each region's export-oriented businesses possible access to both. Whereas SAARC comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Between Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Northwest China, Pakistan serves as a gateway and a hub. As a result, supply chain value and regional commerce may be developed in a way never seen before. It is anticipated that direct maritime connectivity between Karachi and Chittagong will be crucial to the growth of trade and commerce between the two nations. They may significantly cut down on the time and expense of shipping products between them, and they will probably be crucial in forging connections with other Middle Eastern and Central Asian nations, such as China and Russia. Direct shipping between the two nations will incentivize traders to increase their regional investment and trade. It is anticipated that both countries would gain from the development of trade and commercial corridors that are coordinated between Bangladesh's Look West Policy and Pakistan's Dhaka rapprochement, as well as from the building of connection through coastal shipping.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0k3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-13T08:33:00-08:00	
Pakistan’s Potential Benefits From Effectiveness Of CSTO Proposal...	The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a regional security bloc led by Russia, has recently proposed enhancing security around Afghanistan through a comprehensive approach that includes counterterrorism efforts, border security, economic cooperation, and regional diplomatic engagement. This proposal primarily targets Afghanistan's unstable political and security situation and seeks to stabilize the broader Central Asian region. For Pakistan, a key neighboring country to Afghanistan and an important player in the region’s geopolitical dynamics, the success and effectiveness of CSTO’s security proposal could offer several potential benefits. While Pakistan is not a member of the CSTO, its interests align in several ways with the objectives of the organization, making it a key stakeholder in the success of these initiatives. One of the most immediate and significant benefits for Pakistan from the CSTO’s effectiveness would be enhanced regional stability. Afghanistan has long been a source of instability for Pakistan, with various terrorist groups operating along the porous border between the two countries. The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, along with the presence of extremist factions like ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K), has directly impacted Pakistan's security, particularly in the tribal areas and Balochistan province. The CSTO’s proposal to strengthen border security and deploy joint counterterrorism forces along Afghanistan’s borders could reduce the flow of militants into Pakistan. By improving border surveillance and creating stronger intelligence-sharing networks, the CSTO's efforts could help Pakistan better control cross-border insurgent movements, thus alleviating the strain on Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies. In addition, the proposal aims to address the drug trade that funds terrorism. Afghanistan has long been the world’s leading producer of opium, much of which is trafficked into Pakistan. By tackling the roots of this illicit trade, the CSTO’s initiatives could disrupt terrorist financing and reduce the overall level of violence and instability in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Economic development is another area where Pakistan could benefit from the effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal. The CSTO’s emphasis on regional economic cooperation, particularly in trade, infrastructure development, and job creation, aligns with Pakistan’s interests in expanding economic ties with its neighbors. As a country with a growing economy and a strategic location at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, Pakistan stands to gain from a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan. If the CSTO’s proposal succeeds in fostering regional economic integration, Pakistan could benefit from enhanced trade routes and more open access to Central Asian markets. Afghanistan, situated between Central Asia and Pakistan, is a natural trade corridor. The development of infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and energy pipelines, could improve connectivity between Pakistan’s ports (like Karachi) and Central Asia, offering Pakistan better access to regional markets. Moreover, the CSTO’s security framework could complement Pakistan’s own efforts to combat terrorism and extremism within its borders. By enhancing regional security cooperation, Pakistan would gain from coordinated efforts with Central Asian states, Russia, and other key players in addressing shared security concerns. The CSTO’s approach could open the door for more comprehensive regional security pacts and multilateral initiatives that could help Pakistan deal with its own security challenges, particularly in Balochistan and the tribal areas. While Pakistan’s relations with India are primarily characterized by rivalry, particularly over the disputed Kashmir region, the success of the CSTO’s initiatives could help Pakistan counterbalance India’s growing influence in the region. By engaging with the CSTO’s efforts, Pakistan could ensure that it plays a central role in shaping Afghanistan’s future, while simultaneously preventing India from exerting disproportionate influence in the region. If the CSTO succeeds in stabilizing Afghanistan and creating economic opportunities, the flow of refugees into Pakistan could decrease, alleviating the socio-economic burden on Pakistan’s border provinces. By supporting or engaging with the CSTO’s initiatives, Pakistan could not only secure its own national interests but also contribute to broader regional stability and prosperity. For Pakistan, the CSTO’s efforts represent an important opportunity for regional cooperation, but the country must carefully assess the geopolitical landscape and its own strategic priorities as it seeks to maximize the benefits from these initiatives. The effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal, coupled with Pakistan’s proactive engagement, could indeed play a significant role in fostering a more stable and prosperous South and Central Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0mR71TIEldhh	2024-11-13T08:31:44-08:00	
The Clock Is Ticking On Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation ...	As the rest of the world grapples with aging populations, Africa’s population is booming. By 2030, half of all new entrants into the global labor force will come from sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually. As the Chart of the Week shows, this challenge is particularly acute in fragile, conflict-affected, and low-income economies. They account for nearly 80 percent of the region’s annual job creation needs, but to date have struggled the most to create jobs. These economies have high fertility rates, with youth populations yet to peak. For example, Niger has a population of 26 million people and a youth population share that is not expected to peak until 2058—the country will need to create 650,000 new jobs annually for the next 30 years. In contrast, many middle-income countries like Botswana, Ghana, Namibia, and Mauritius have seen their youth shares of populations peak already and will face less severe job creation pressures. Harnessing Africa’s booming population growth potential requires generating vast numbers of productive, quality jobs that provide above-subsistence-level income, whether in formal roles or self-employment. There are three main challenges to creating enough good jobs, but policymakers have the tools at their disposal to make a difference. Shifting informal jobs from a trap to a stepping-stone. Targeted policies include boosting productivity in the informal sector through well matched skills training, better access to finance, and policies that encourage transitioning to formal employment. It is valuable to create labor market programs that help young people, especially women who face additional barriers, enter the workforce, ensuring they have the tools to succeed. Creating conditions that are conducive to jobs growth in high-productivity sectors like modern services and manufacturing. Given limited public finances, governments can prioritize measures that benefit multiple sectors, such as improving market competition and making value-for-money infrastructure investments. They should be cautious with industrial policies that target specific sectors, as they can be expensive, distortionary, and pose corruption risks. Breaking down barriers to private business growth. Prioritizing important infrastructure like electricity, internet, roads, and affordable public transport can ease the flow of goods and services. Cutting red tape and curbing corruption will also help companies grow. Attracting more foreign direct investment and developing local capital markets can make more financing available. And strengthening regional integration and trade can expand markets. The international community has much to gain from thriving employment in sub-Saharan Africa. Not only is robust jobs growth good for the countries and the people of the region, but it will also provide an engine of growth, consumption and investment for the global economy. Failure could exacerbate poverty, fuel instability and drive migration, while success can unlock prosperity for both Africa and the globe. Policymakers must strive for meaningful change that will create a path for millions of people toward a brighter jobs future. —This article is based on an analytical note included in the October 2024 Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, The Clock is Ticking on Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation Challenge, by Wenjie Chen, Khushboo Khandelwal, Athene Laws, Faten Saliba, Can Sever and Luc Tucker of the IMF’s African Department.

Intelligence Sharing As An Alternative To ‘Asian NATO’ – Analysis	By Asher Ellis Recent proposals for a military alliance in the Asia Pacific region risk escalating tensions and overlooking regional dynamics. A different approach — focused on intelligence sharing — offers a pragmatic way to enhance regional security while maintaining stability. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office in October 2024, drew international attention just weeks into his term by advocating for an ‘Asian version of NATO‘. His proposal has faced significant pushback from China, which accuses Japan of escalating tensions and promoting a ‘Cold War mentality‘, and from the United States and several Southeast Asian nations wary of increasing regional tensions. The US ambassador to Japan has echoed the need for enhanced regional cooperation, albeit advocating for a different approach. He proposed an economic trade–defence alliance aimed at countering China’s coercion rather than a traditional military pact. The need for enhanced cooperation in the Asia Pacific is clear. Chinese aggression against Taiwan, the militarisation of artificial islands in the South China Sea and North Korea’s ongoing missile testscontinue to exacerbate regional security concerns. But adopting a Cold War-era alliance model, designed for a different geopolitical context, is impractical. It overlooks the region’s complex geography, diverse political and economic systems and many Asian states’ significant economic ties with China. Instead, the United States and its Asian partners should focus on enhancing intelligence-sharing efforts. Existing frameworks — such as the Quad partnership between the United States, India, Japan and Australia — have made progress in maritime domain awareness and cybersecurity. The Quad’s Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness leverages advanced satellite-based radio frequency data to aid partner countries in monitoring their waters more effectively. Australia has engaged extensively in intelligence cooperation with its neighbours, both bilaterally and multilaterally, particularly in fields such as policing and counterterrorism. This cooperation dates back to responses to the Bali and Jakarta bombings in the early 2000s, efforts to combat piracy and smuggling in maritime Southeast Asia and support during events like the Marawi siegein the Philippines in 2017. Some Asian countries also engage in bilateral intelligence-sharing efforts. The General Security of Military Information Agreement between South Korea and Japan facilitates the exchange of sensitive military information. But it exists largely due to US mediation and pressure, underscoring the United States’ role in brokering and sustaining such frameworks. ASEAN’s ‘Our Eyes’ Initiative aims to facilitate intelligence exchange among Southeast Asian nations, focusing on counterterrorism and violent extremism. New efforts between the United States and the Philippines, as well as between the United States, Japan and Taiwan, seek to increase intelligence sharing in specific contexts, such as cyber threats and geospatial intelligence. Despite these initiatives, intelligence sharing in Asia remains sporadic and lacks integration into broader networks, leaving gaps that adversaries could exploit. To build a more cohesive regional security network, countries like the United States and Japan must broaden their efforts, starting with less sensitive but highly valuable domains to build trust and demonstrate the benefits of cooperation. Geospatial intelligence, derived from satellite imagery and remote sensors, is becoming less sensitive due to the growing availability of commercial satellite data, but is helpful for monitoring shipping lanes, detecting illegal activities and responding to natural disasters. The growth of open-source intelligence datasets from private companies can also enhance the capabilities of countries with limited traditional intelligence assets. Cyber threat intelligence is another area ripe for collaboration, as nations face common threats from cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and government networks. Collaboration in these domains would help establish a shared understanding of regional security challenges. To facilitate this cooperation, the United States and its Asian partners should develop standardised, secure protocols for sharing information, with tiered access levels allowing countries to participate based on their capabilities and trust levels. Building upon existing frameworks like the Quad to create a ‘Quad+’ network that includes key regional players such as South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia would enhance collaboration. Initial cooperation could focus on sharing maritime surveillance data and cyber threat intelligence, setting the foundation for expanding into more sensitive areas as trust builds. But significant obstacles remain. Many Asian countries lack adequate security infrastructure and the capacity for secure information handling, complicating the sharing of classified data. Indonesia suffered a major cybersecurity breach in May 2024 when hackers attacked its national data centre, disrupting critical public services and exposing vulnerabilities. Chinese hacking groups have targeted Southeast Asian government and military entities, seeking to steal intelligence related to South China Sea strategies. Taiwan faces extensive infiltration by Chinese intelligence, raising concerns about the security of shared information. The United States and its allies can provide technical support and training to enhance cybersecurity defences and information-handling protocols. This capacity-building approach not only facilitates intelligence sharing but also strengthens the overall security posture of partner nations. Enhancing intelligence-sharing frameworks rather than establishing a NATO-like military alliance represents a pragmatic path to regional security. By standardising protocols, expanding existing networks and building nations’ capacities to protect information, the Asia Pacific could bolster its security needs without exacerbating tensions or forcing countries to take sides. The future of Asia Pacific security depends not on adopting old structures, but on strategic cooperation that builds trust and tangibly enhances regional readiness and stability.

Malaysia Could Lose Western Investments Over Project With Chinese...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia could risk losing future investments in the technology sector if it aligns too closely with Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States and its allies have accused of espionage and intellectual property theft, analysts warn. Western firms could think Beijing has an unfair advantage in Kuala Lumpur’s growing tech market, said Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at regional consultant ADA Southeast Asia. Malaysia’s partnership with the U.S.-blacklisted Huawei to set up the country’s second 5G network 'could be perceived as favoring Chinese interests,' he said. 'The Malaysian government may consider Huawei’s partnership a pragmatic economic decision,' Asrul told BenarNews. 'However, Western investors might view this differently, especially since several countries, including the U.S., United Kingdom and Japan, have blacklisted the company and view it as a security threat.' In addition, the partnership with Huawei could trigger uncertainty among international investors, according to Farlina Said, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies Malaysia, a research think-tank. 'Considering Malaysia is in phases of strengthening the digital economy and some of the nation’s digital economy development plans come with international collaboration, [the project with Huawei] could create an environment of uncertainty,' she told BenarNews. Malaysia plays a significant role in the global technology and semiconductor supply chain, attracting more than U.S. $20 billion from tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and Infineon over the last two years. Chinese company ByteDance, TikTok’s parent, also committed U.S. $350 million to expand its data center operations in Malaysia into a regional AI hub. Kuala Lumpur hopes that the multi-billion dollars of investments in the technology sector will create thousands of jobs in the country by 2030, according to the government. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim views a second 5G network as essential to meet surging broadband demand and attract more global investments amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission conducted a technical and commercial evaluation to choose a mobile network operator for the project, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said last week. The decision to award U Mobile – Huawei’s local partner – complies with licensing conditions, he said. 'The factors for selection include contributions to projects [for rural telecommunication access], as well as performance on 4G upgrade initiatives.' The government also reviewed U Mobile’s business and technical plans, customer satisfaction record and prior performance on infrastructure projects, the minister said. U Mobile, backed by powerful stakeholders such as Malaysia’s king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, defended itself from criticisms by pointing to its 17-year history in the sector and promising a cost-effective 5G rollout. Huawei’s communications team did not immediately respond to a BenarNews request for comment. Malaysia-China relations Previously, Anwar said Malaysia was committed to using Chinese technology in its tech infrastructure. 'We have adopted the policy of getting the Chinese technology, 5G, involved in the development of our country,' Anwar told Chinese President Xi Jinping during his four-day working visit to China last week, his third trip to the Asian superpower since being named prime minister in 2022. China has been Malaysia’s biggest trading partner since 2009. Bilateral trade between the two countries surged to over $117.5 billion in the first seven months of 2024, state news agency Bernama quoted Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing as saying. During his Beijing trip, Anwar also met with Huawei executives, discussing the company’s '5.5G' tech, cloud and artificial intelligence applications. Espionage concerns In May 2023, the U.S. and European Union issued a rare joint letter to the Malaysian government cautioning against Huawei’s involvement. A Financial Times report cited a leaked letter from former U.S. Ambassador Brian McFeeters warning that 'allowing untrusted suppliers in any part of the network also subjects Malaysia’s infrastructure to national security risks.' The U.S. has banned Huawei from its 5G networks and European countries have followed suit because of espionage concerns. Investigators determined Huawei equipment installed near U.S. military bases can intercept and disrupt sensitive defense communications, including those related to the oversight of the country’s nuclear deterrent, Reuters news service reported in July 2022. Ong Kian Ming, former deputy minister for International Trade and Industry, said the Malaysian government should have been more transparent in awarding the 5G contract to U Mobile. 'I do not think that having Huawei as the vendor for the second network is necessarily damaging for investor confidence, provided that: (i) the award of that contract is open and transparent and (ii) the [government company Digital Nasional Berhad which oversees Malaysia’s 5G network initiative] remains in place and is performing well,' Ong told BenarNews in a message. Second Trump term Meanwhile, a foreign affairs analyst said a second term for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could mean stricter policies toward Chinese technology abroad. 'Trump will have greater flexibility and pragmatism in handling China, which might not always be transactional in nature and can also be more direct and forceful,' said University of Malaya’s Collins Chong Yew Keat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVqO8JswWMgxc	2024-11-12T16:36:36-08:00	
What Are Republics, Exactly? It’s A Good Time To Learn – Analysis	Republican ideals have evolved over millennia, shaping governance across the globe. Modern republics continue to adapt, but face challenges in upholding their foundational principles. The 2024 U.S. presidential election was framed as a crucial test for the nation's political system, with ongoing concerns over oligarchy, mob rule, a breakdown of equal protection under the law, and the ultimate power of citizens to determine the fate of the nation. Republics have suffered total collapses throughout history, and there's no reason why the United States should be immune. The fear of that often prompts a superficial reference to the final fall of the Roman Republic or the end of Greek democracy. But there's a deeper history: Republics came into being far earlier in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean civilizations. And we can draw from a much wider range of examples to learn from as we try to understand the challenges and the opportunities. A true republic is a political system without monarchy or concentrated political power in any office, branch, or individual. Elected officials represent citizens to make decisions on their behalf, with separate branches of government providing checks and balances. While many associate republics with direct democracy in our times, there's a much wider array of power structures that developed in the formative era of republics. The 20th century established republics as the global standard, with monarchies declining after World War I and most former European colonies declaring independence as republics following World War II. Fascist and communist countries, which centralized power in individuals or ruling parties, also reduced in number. Despite their concentration of power, however, many fascist and communist states claimed the title of republics, and while 149 countries out of 193identify as republics today, far less uphold republican principles and blend them effectively with democracy. Examining the historical evolution of republics highlights those best positioned to serve as the most resilient modern examples. Republics require regular gatherings and assemblies, making them difficult to establish in sparsely populated agrarian societies, while empires generally concentrate power too heavily for self-rule to gain traction. It was in smaller city-states, particularly trade-focused ones, where citizens could form factions, exchange ideas, and influence government decisions and rules for commerce. Some of the earliest experiments with republican governance appeared in ancient Sumerian city-states (4500–2000 BC), centered in modern-day Iraq. Kings acted more as neutral arbitrators rather than rulers, sharing power with aristocratic families and groups, as well as common citizens. In Kish, citizens could appoint a new king during crises, while in Uruk, assemblies of townsmen and elders had to ratify major military decisions. The Sumerian city-states fell to the Akkadian and Babylonian Empires by 1750 BC, but Phoenician city-states, emerging about 250 years later in what is now Lebanon, revived republican ideals. Here, monarchical power was often shared with a merchant class and citizen council. Egyptian records dating to the mid-14th century BC describe Phoenician cities sending delegates to represent citizens rather than monarchs, with mentions of alliances and aid requests by the 'men of Arwad' and 'elders of Irqata.' By the 6th century BC, the Phoenician city of Tyre had functioned for seven years without a monarch, governed instead under suffetes, or judges, elected for short terms. In Chios, a 'people's council' allowed citizens to debate laws and hold officials accountable. However, beginning in the 9th century BC and continuing over the next few centuries, Phoenician city-states were successively conquered or subjugated by the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Macedonian Empires. Like other civilizations, Phoenicians established colonies and trading posts. Carthage, founded by Tyre in 814 BC in modern Tunisia, grew into a powerful city-state with its own republican features. By the early 7th century BC, two elected suffetes from aristocratic families replaced the monarchy. They governed alongside an aristocratic Senate, while newer merchants could gain influence and a popular assembly allowed citizens input on major decisions. Military and religious leaders also held considerable power. Republican ideals weren't confined to Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. Buddhist texts like the Maha Parinibbana Sutta mention Indian republics called Gana-Sanghas in the 6th century BC. Some adopted republican styles of government, while others formed republican confederations, like Sumerian and Phoenician city-states, to make decisions collectively and protect against larger threats. The Indian republics were gradually absorbed by the Maurya Empire (321–185 BC) and other entities. Ancient Greek city-states also developed republican ideals. Sparta was governed by a constitution and popular assembly as early as 600 BC, though it remained largely monarchical. Athens established a direct democracy in 507 BC, known as demokratia, meaning 'people' and 'rule.' Greece's slave-based economy allowed some citizens time to participate in politics, though this limited political fairness. In 431 BC, Attica, the region surrounding Athens, had an estimated population of 315,000, of which only 172,000 were citizens, and just 40,000 male citizens could vote. Still, Athens's democratic system allowed these citizens to frequently debate, deliberate, and vote. They were overseen by the Council of Five Hundred, which was chosen annually by lot to draft laws and manage administration. However, following Athens's Golden Age, 4th century BC Greek critics likePlato and Aristotle, and later historians like Polybius in the 2nd century BC, criticized the system for inefficiency and vulnerability to charismatic leaders to sway public opinion, leading to volatile policy shifts. They emphasized balancing public, aristocracy, and monarchical roles to avoid the typical political cycle of chaos and order: first, a strong leader unites a restive society under a monarchy, which evolves into tyranny. It is overthrown and replaced by an aristocracy, which reduces into oligarchy. Democracy eventually replaces it but deteriorates into mob rule, restarting the cycle. Invasions further weakened Greece's republican and democratic systems, including in 338 BC, when Greece fell under the control of the Macedonian Empire, ending the independence of many city-states. Despite this, Greek states formed republican confederations to protect against threats, including the neighboring Roman Republic. The term republic derives from the Roman res publica, meaning 'public affairs,' emphasizing shared governance, civic participation, and checks and balances. Since its founding in 509 BC, the Roman Republic's political structure had evolved considerably. Polybius expressed appreciation for Rome's system, where two tribunes were elected annually to represent the common citizens, while two consuls were elected and held executive power, checked by an aristocratic senate. Romans were skeptical of Greek democracy, especially in Athens, due to its instability, infighting, and mob rule. Carthage's republic seemed overly commercial and lacked the civic loyalty the Romans valued. This loyalty was central to Rome's military, staffed by a citizen army motivated by shared rewards. In contrast, Carthage's strong, citizen-led navy protected trade routes, but its reliance on mercenaries for land campaigns made them costly and unpredictable. These factors reduced the ability to push back against Roman rule. By 146 BC, Rome defeated both Greece and Carthage, cementing its dominance and expanding political system. Polybius suggests that Rome's success over Carthage was partially due to its powerful, aristocratic Senate, while Carthage's policies were increasingly shaped by popular influence. He believed that Rome's decisions were made by elites versus the influence of the masses in Carthage. Yet by this time, Rome was approaching its Late Republic phase. The scholar Harriet Flower's research argues that the Roman Republic wasn't a single entity but a series of six republics, each with unique political characteristics. Others have also challenged the notion of a single Roman Republic, placing Republican Rome into three main periods characterized by changing centers of power. The Early Republic (509–367 BC) was marked by tensions between patricians (aristocratic elites) and plebeians (common citizens). The struggle for plebeian rights led to significant reforms, including the establishment of tribunes, elected by the Concilium Plebis to represent common interests, and often from the plebeian class. During the Middle Republic (367–133 BC), the Licinian-Sextian laws of 367 BC were passed to again alleviate tensions between patricians and plebeians, limiting patrician land ownership, providing debt relief for plebeians, and ensuring that at least one of the two consuls was a plebeian. However, political power increasingly concentrated in the Senate, undermining these reforms. During the Late Republic (133–31 BC), Rome's military success over rivals coincided with the growing influence of ordinary citizens in the judicial system, especially as jurors. Yet the republic was plagued by social conflict, corruption, and civil unrest. Sulla's march on Rome in 88 BC and his curtailing of the tribunes' power exemplified rising instability. After, figures like Pompey in the '70s BC and Julius Caesar in 59 BC began consolidating power, further undermining republican values. In 27 BC, Augustus formally transitioned Rome into an empire, while maintaining the illusion of republican traditions. Roman orator Cicero, a prominent defender of the Republic, inadvertently accelerated its demise through his support for Augustus, endorsement of dictatorial powers, and willingness to suspend legal norms during crises, showing the dangers of sacrificing republican ideals to manage turmoil. For the next few centuries, republican ideals were largely sidelined. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD saw feudalism and monarchies spread across its former territories and peripheral regions. This instability nonetheless allowed new republics to emerge, such as Venice, founded in 697 AD. It maintained a 1,100-year run as a republic through a political system that encouraged merchant participation and representation, shrewd diplomacy, social mobility, community cohesion, and an extensive trade network. It was eventually conquered by France in 1797. During the Italian Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), urbanization, advancements in communication, and Enlightenment ideals enabled the rise of new city-states. Merchant classes and other groups established republican systems as alternatives to European monarchies elsewhere as well. However, they were ultimately absorbed by empires, partly due to their inability to exploit the expanding Atlantic trade routes that reduced the importance of the Mediterranean. Republics were not confined to Europe. The Kongsi Republics in modern-day Malaysia, particularly the Lanfang Republic declared in 1777, arose when Chinese settlers recruited by local sultans for mining formed companies to safeguard their interests. Over time, they evolved into self-governing territories with elected leaders and various levels of democratic governance. The Lanfang Republic was eventually defeated by Dutch colonial forces in 1884, with the rest absorbed through treaty or militarily defeated by the century's end. The establishment of the United States marked the reemergence of the large-scale republican state. In 1787, after the Revolutionary War, the U.S. formally became a constitutional republic, aiming to eliminate monarchy while avoiding a chaotic direct democracy. The Founding Fathers created a mixed system, balancing public participation with safeguards against aristocracy and emphasizing consent of the governed (though limited to white male landowners). The debates over constitutional amendments and expanding democracy continued for decades, paralleling similar discussions in post-Revolutionary France after 1789. Today, many republics exist, but their authenticity and stability can be compromised. Being conquered imposes outside authority, while others pursue foreign expansion themselves, centralizing control and subjugating other territories. Republics such as those in 16th century Netherlands, 17th century England, and 18th century U.S. and France grew into empires or reverted to monarchies, adapting in ways whose lessons are still relevant today. These expansionist policies, often justified as essential for wealth and security, led to the abandonment of certain republican and democratic principles. Republics can also shift toward authoritarianism, with modern policymakers perceiving more open democratic systems as unstable and vulnerable to manipulation. In recent years, China and Russia have seen reductions in public accountability, civil liberties, meaningful political participation, and concentrations of power behind Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. In North Korea, power has been concentrated in the leader's office since its founding, with leadership passed within the Kim family. Similarly, a dynasty has developed under the Aliyev family in Azerbaijan since the 1990s, with concerns that Turkmenistan may follow. Countries with strong presidential systems, common in the Americas, risk concentrating power in the executive branch. Fixed terms limit the removal of unpopular leaders, since, unlike in parliamentary democracies, no 'confidence vote' mechanism exists for crisis situations. Partisan loyalty can also weaken checks and balances, and coups can be common. Alliances and federations of Greek city-states like the Achaean and Lycian Leagues, as well as the Native American Iroquois Confederacy, formed assemblies and councils for representation and collective decision-making, influencing models like the U.S. Constitution and European Union (EU). The statement that the U.S. is 'a republic, not a democracy' reflects the original aim to keep political power within the states rather than the federal government. However, authority has increasingly centralized in Washington, D.C., reducing state sovereignty, tensions mirrored in the EU between individual states and Brussels. Political apathy and extremism can also stem from the influence of billionaires and corporations over the political process, government corruption, and the erosion of social mobility. Social media platforms offer the chance for heightened political participation, but are increasingly vulnerable to disinformation spread by big tech and political actors, revealing new ways in which democracies can veer toward mob rule. The diversity of republics today reflects their historical variety, with countries still navigating the governance structures in their own contexts. Kazakhstan, initially authoritarian, has seen some shift toward a more balanced systemwith a more powerful parliament following popular protests in 2022, though it remains less democratic. Similarly, Singapore, often described as authoritarian, is still considered a republic due to some checks and balances, maintaining a blend of controlled leadership and political structure. An informed and engaged citizenry, supported by a strong economic base, is essential for a successful republic. Citizens must feel the benefits of their system, and these must endure through fair elections, the rule of law, and due process. Effective foreign policy also relies on wide-ranging trade networks and adaptable alliances, while maintaining a strong military and avoiding military overreach or falling into the trap of foreign conquest. Historically, empire and monarchy have been more common than republics, shaping world order through hierarchical and anarchic systems. Within the global UN framework, which is designed to support the sovereignty and equality of nations (a principle rooted in republican ideals), republics can govern more democratically by collaborating in a way similar to ancient confederations. The Achaean League and Lycian League consisted of states with varying political systems cooperating within a loose, republican-style confederation. Modern blocs like the EU, ASEAN, and African Union allow countries to work together under common principles and boost their voice in the international system. Changes in domestic politics have meanwhile seen the growth of direct democracy in the 2010s, as more referendums and popular votes of legislative and constitutional issues emerged globally, but especially in Europe. While larger republics like the U.S., Germany, and India still avoid national-level votes on major issues, direct democracy is increasingly apparent at regional and local levels. Challenges remain in terms of deliberation and integration, as states like California and Arizona have seen ballot initiatives often rushed, leaving limited time for meaningful debate. Modern citizens' assemblies, based on those originating thousands of years ago, have also elevated these referendums in recent years and provided an alternative to traditional political processes. They have influenced major policy changes, such as climate policies in France to abortion laws in Ireland, with assemblies, typically convened by legislative bodies in partnership with nonprofits, designed to reflect demographics. While they have led to concrete policy shifts, some recommendations have not been adopted, with lawmakers citing the importance of expert-led decision-making. With the U.S. election behind us, reassessing republican ideals, both domestically and globally, is crucial. As the GOP potentially gains control over all three branches of government in a divided nation, how it implements policies will either ease concerns or amplify them. The future of republicanism depends on the U.S. shaping its domestic agenda for the common good and using its influence on the global stage in line with democratic principles.

Prabowo’s US-China Balancing Act – OpEd	Indonesia is on the rise. As ASEAN’s largest country and economy, with a growing domestic consumer market and a large supply of natural resources, its economic potential is clear. Sitting in the South China Sea surrounded by its fellow ASEAN nations and encircled by India, China, Japan, and Australia, it also commands great geopolitical importance. It is no wonder that over 30 ministers and world leaders attended President Prabowo Subianto’s recent inauguration. An ex-military general and oligarch, Prabowo is taking the reins on foreign policy, appointing his long-time follower Sugiono as foreign minister. This is not surprising. With his foreign education at The American School in London and knowledge of several languages, Prabowo is a natural statesman. As president-elect, he has already made visits to China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Middle East, Europe and Australia, displaying a more active, centralized and personalized approach to foreign policy than his predecessor, Joko Widodo. But the difference in personality has not meant a difference in policy. Prabowo has reaffirmed Indonesia’s non-alignment stance and has committed himself to the same 'good-neighbour foreign policy' as Widodo did. However, Indonesia’s neutrality is under pressure as the competition between the United States and China intensifies and the world becomes more fragmented. The United States and its allies in Asia, notably the Philippines and Japan, expect Prabowo’s support in resisting China’s aggression in the South China Sea, where China continues incursions into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. Global conflicts are also testing Indonesia’s non-alignment. The wedge between the pro-Palestinian Indonesia and the pro-Israeli United States over the war in Gaza has grown. There is clear cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea in opposing the United States and NATO in Ukraine. Prabowo personally felt this divide when his plan for ending the war in Ukraine was denounced as 'Russian-made' by Ukrainian and European officials. Although he will not formally end the policy of non-alignment, Prabowo is aware that his ability to simultaneously maintain ties with the United States, China and their respective allies is at risk. If push comes to shove, which way will he lean? A Fragile Friendship: Prabowo and the U.S. Prabowo has a strained relationship with the United States. Despite studying there in his youth, he was banned from entering the United States until he became defense minister over his role in the invasion and occupation of East Timor during the Suharto regime. As dictator Suharto’s son-in-law, he ran the Kopassus, Indonesia’s special forces, which allegedly committed human rights abuses against activists in East Timor and Papua. Furthermore, Prabowo’s election represents a trend towards authoritarian nationalist populism after decades of democratic regression under Widodo and Bambang. His ex-military strongman persona and ties to Suharto lead scholars to believe that Prabowo represents a challenge to Indonesian democracy. Although the United States wants to increase collaboration with Indonesia to counteract China’s aggression in the South China Sea, Prabowo is a partner who may not represent basic U.S. values and principles—and Prabowo knows this. U.S.-Indonesia defense ties, however, have flourished. Indonesia and the United States announced a new defense cooperation agreement in 2023 and hold over 220 defense engagements annually, including Exercise Super Garuda Shield, which builds U.S.-Indonesia military interoperability and jungle warfare capabilities. To modernize the Indonesian military, Prabowo is looking to the United States for fighter aircraft upgrades and sales, such as the $14 billion sale of 36 advanced fighter jets in 2022 (although the United States may limit these, given Prabowo’s human rights record). There are other restrictions to the relationship. It is built around the joint rejection of China’s aggression in the South China Sea, which Indonesia has back-pedaled on following criticism from China. Being economically reliant on your biggest security threat is a tightrope to walk. An Increasing Dependency: Prabowo and China China has no qualms about Prabowo’s past or leadership. China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $128 billion in 2023, over double that of the United States. China funded the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway through the Belt and Road Initiative and pledged a further $67 billion of investment in 2023. These investments are a combination of loans and exports rather than traditional foreign direct investment (FDI). Prabowo, given his pragmatism and bullish attitude to taking on debt, is looking to China for further investment. Indonesia pitched three major railway projects during a rail expo in Shanghai this June. Chinese businesses are making crucial FDI into Indonesia’s most forward-looking industries, with BYD planning a $1.3 billion plant to grow the Indonesia EV market and Xinyi Glass Holdings building a $11.5 billion quartz sand processing plant necessary for solar panel production. These deals, along with those from Chinese mining firms like Tsingshan, are crucial to Prabowo’s aim of increasing downstreaming projects in Indonesia’s lucrative commodities sector, especially in nickel mining where Indonesia has gained 40 percent of the global market share. China’s grip on Indonesian growth is tightening and Prabowo will look to China, not the United States, to reach his ambitious target of 8 percent annual GDP growth. Although it announced an economic partnership with Indonesia in 2023, the United States has fallen behind China on Indonesian economic ties.But Japan, too, is also competing with China in Indonesia. Japan is Indonesia’s second largest trading partner with a similar value of trade as the United States. After losing out on the Jakarta-Bandung railway project to China, Japan has leveraged its historical and cultural ties to Indonesia to increase its investment into rail modernization projects in Jakarta, Bogor,and Depok. In a 2023 economic agreement, Japan agreed to consider investment in geothermal and waste management plants in Muara Laboh and West Java. China is ahead of both the United States and Japan, but together they represent an economic alternative for Prabowo to consider. Prabowo’s Tough Choices China represents Indonesia’s largest security threat. Indonesia maintains it has 'no territorial dispute with China' in the South China Sea. However, China’s 'nine-dash line,' which denotes its territorial claim, overlaps with Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone near the Natuna Islands. China continues to send coast guard and fishing ships to patrol the area, in particular to the Tuna block where Indonesia is exploring an offshore natural gas opportunity. As recently as October 2024, the Indonesian navy had to turn away another Chinese coast guard ship. As defense minister, Prabowo had been building up new air and naval bases in the Natuna Islands, which host three Indonesianfrigates and corvettes. It is clear that Prabowo expects friction with China. Given his reputation for being tough on national security and his history of modernizing the military, any engagement with China will weaken his position. It is therefore confusing that Prabowo is also expanding Indonesia-China defense ties, with reports that Indonesia is looking to buy, of all things, coastal defense missiles from Beijing. However, this defense partnership remains underwhelming in the face of tensions in the South China Sea and Jakarta’s reliance on Western military training and education. Given these increasing security tensions with Beijing, Prabowo might consider reducing Indonesia’s economic dependency on China in favor of strengthened relations with the United States and Japan. But in the current environment, given Prabowo’s strongman personality and his ambitious economic targets, China is the closer and more valuable partner. Prabowo thinks that he can deter China in the Natuna Islands by building up military capabilities. The Indonesian public seems to agree, with surveys showing in the absence of neutrality they would lean towards China over the United States. Prabowo’s push to join the BRICS bloc also supports this. But if China were to step up its aggression, there is little doubt that Indonesia would choose security over economic ties and look toward the United States and its allies for support. If the U.S.-China rift enlarges, Prabowo may have to make that shift sooner than he thinks.

Russia, India Are Early Birds As Pax Americana Is Ending – OpEd	The working visit of Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov to Mumbai and Delhi on November 11-12 has been in the cards for sometime. It assumes added interest today as, in a delightful coincidence, it overlaps with the beginning of the end of Pax Americana in international politics. Manturov, 55, is one of the brightest stars of the new generation of leaders in the Russian political firmament with a brilliant record as an economist and technocrat in the energy and military-industrial complex, two key sectors of the economy. President Vladimir Putin has entrusted him with responsibilities that go far beyond the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Industry, a position he held for 12 years until May 2024 when he was elevated as First Deputy Prime Minister. Manturov is now a familiar face at the high table when Putin takes meetings on Ukraine war, which shows he wears many hats. Manturov is the co-chairman of Russian-Indian joint commission, alongside External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. To be sure, Jaishankar will have wide-ranging discussions with Manturov. Who else Manturov is meeting in Delhi will be an indication of the stirrings in the air in the Russian-Indian cooperation. The timing of the visit is notable since the neoconservatives who dominated the Biden administration — Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA director William Burns, et al — are on their way out and a brave new world is taking shape in Washington, DC. The influential CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, who was the US ambassador to Nato, succinctly captured the imminent power shift in DC when he wrote in Politico in the weekend, 'Trump won in a landslide. He helped Republicans take control of the Senate and may well help them keep the House (by the way, Republicans have flipped the House as well) — ensuring single-party control across all three branches of government. He can rightly claim a mandate to implement all the policies he touted… All the while, he’ll be shielded by a Supreme Court.' Of course, Ambassador Daalder is an acolyte of the 'rules-based order' and a firm believer in America’s manifest destiny to lead the world. He wrote in his column titled The end of Pax Americana: 'I also worry about what this means for the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump made clear he doesn’t buy into Washington’s global leadership role as his predecessors have done. He doesn’t believe in leading — he believes in winning… 'Moscow and Beijing have long chafed at Washington’s leadership, and for the past decade, they’ve sought to counter and undermine it. They may now get their wish. Trump isn’t interested in sustaining the Pax Americana in the ways his 14 predecessors were… The end of the Pax Americana will have profound consequences…The Pax Americana will officially end on Jan. 20, 2025, when the US inaugurates Donald J. Trump as its 47th president. The country and world will be very different because of it.' Suffice to say, we are getting a preview of this historic juncture. Although taking place in the conditions under sanctions, Manturov’s agenda of discussions in Delhi will have a futuristic dimension. The point is, while the sanctions against Russia may take some time to be scrapped, their cutting edge — the fanaticism and the sound and fury with which Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen applied that intrusive diplomatic tool to dictate other countries’ economic and military relations with Russia — may now become blunt, what with all signs already pointing toward a Russian-American engagement. The Indian side should be mindful of this transition in the power dynamic to accelerate the economic and military-technical cooperation with Russia with a medium and long-term perspective. This is one thing. Second, we are edging toward a conversation between Trump and Putin. Do not be surprised if they decide to meet at an early date. Historically speaking, there is nothing like summitry to energise political systems with top-down culture such as the US and Russia have. Suffice to say, we are nearing a point when the International Criminal Court which has an arrest warrant against Putin, won’t know where to hide itself. From our perspective, that opens the door leading to the rose garden for a state visit by Putin to India — perhaps, as the chief guest at the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic on January 26, 2025. Putin is a great friend of India’s. Only two days ago, he described India as unparalleled in the global arena and went on to say Russia is strengthening its relationship with India on multiple fronts, with a high level of trust underpinning their bilateral ties. Putin paid fulsome praise to India’s rise saying, 'India should undoubtedly be added to the list of superpowers, with its billion-and-a-half population, the fastest growth among all economies in the world, ancient culture, and very good prospects for further growth.' To be sure, India finds itself in a truly privileged position in the international political arena with the consolidation of the Indian-Russian partnership, with prospects opening up for a spurt to take the US-Indian ties to new heights taking advantage of Trump’s goodwill, and, indeed, with the nascent signs of a thaw appearing in the troubled Sino-Indian relationship — and, of course, as the fastest growing major economy in the world. India’s optimal aim should be to create synergy out of all three relationships running on parallel tracks — with Russia, US and China respectively. No matter the complexities of their mutual relationships, India should aspire for a confluence of the three streams for advancing its comprehensive national development. There is a whiff of hope in the air for a warming of bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington under Trump, which have been in a free fall. But Russophobia is deeply entrenched in the American elites and Russia will remain a toxic issue. Yet, Trump has repeatedly stressed good relations with Putin, as well as mutual respect. And Putin is a very talented politician who understands Trump. As for Russia-China relationship, Moscow and Beijing are at a high noon of partnership unparalleled in their history. That relationship is anchored in the great camaraderie between Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping, is rock solid and will remain so despite the fluidity in the international environment. Of course, there are misgivings about the trajectory of the US-China relationship going forward. But, here again, the crux of the matter is the US’ economic rivalry with China in the American mindset. Per se, China does not hold any threat to the US. Nor is China an expansionist power. Certainly, it is a stakeholder in a stable, predictable global environment where the all-important mission of creating wealth becomes sustainable uninterruptedly. And China, unlike Russia, does not even challenge American power, influence and interests directly or by design. This is the plain truth cutting through the shibboleths of self-serving narratives by China’s detractors. The point is, a military confrontation between the US and China will not happen under Trump’s watch. Neither side is interested in waging wars. Trump pledged this as a solemn promise in his victory speech on Wednesday. Besides, the Indo-Pacific strategy itself is floundering. The latest sign of it is that Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, is turning its back on US-led alliance systems. and seeks BRICS membership following the footfalls of Malaysia, another important ASEAN country. The presence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Trump’s inner circle can be seen as a stabilising factor for US-China relations. Above all, only China can be a meaningful interlocutor to help Trump realise the ambitious MAGA project.

Will Spain’s New European Commissioner Be Telefonica’s Woman? – O...	By Natalia Hidalgo Martínez (EurActiv) -- Spain's Commissioner-designate for a Clean, Just, and Competitive Transition, Teresa Riberá, will be grilled by MEPs on Tuesday (12 November), and her views on telecoms market consolidation, in light of Telefonicá's influence on Spanish politics, could be a key issue. Many expect her to please her home country’s national champion, Telefonica. Spain does not have a digital policy; the charge goes; it has a Telefonica policy. And Telefonica’s interests are clear: as one of Europe’s three largest telecom companies, it will lead any consolidation. How to fix Europe’s struggling telecom companies has become one of Europe’s most vexing policy tussles. Many struggle to make money and invest in upgrading the continent’s digital infrastructure. They blame market fragmentation and rigid competition laws. The EU counts 34 mobile operators – compared to just four in China and three in the United States. If confirmed, Ribera faces this and other hefty challenges.She will have to decide whether to soften antitrust rules to allow for the creation of European champions while enforcing a crackdown on Big Tech. In addition to her new job policing tech competition, she is tasked with completing Europe’s Green Deal, an area she knows fairly well as Spain’s ecological transition minister and as an international climate negotiator. Born in 1969, Ribera grew up as the eldest of five children in a family of academics in a comfortable Madrid neighbourhood. Her mother was a philosophy professor and expert inKrausism, named after the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who advocates tolerance and academic freedom from dogma. Her father, a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine, was a promoter of modern geriatrics in Spain. A lover of hiking and reading, she earned her bachelor’s degree in constitutional law and political science from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. She became an associate professor at the department of public law and philosophy of law at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Mother of three daughters, she lives in the Spanish capital with her husband, Mariano Bacigalupo, an Argentine lawyer and board member of the Spanish national securities market commission. Ribera’s political rise began in 2005 when she became director of Spain’s climate change office, following different positions in the ministries of public work, transportation, and environment. In 2008, she was appointed secretary of state for climate change. 'She is a person of dialogue, who listens and knows how to be open to certain proposals,' praised the director of Greenpeace Spain, Eva Saldana. This year, Ribera was awarded the Progressive Person of the Year by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies. She participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement while directing the Paris-based think tank, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. Ribera has also been a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Advisory Council on Climate and Sustainable Development Solution Networks’ Global Leadership Council. 'She is really knowledgeable about all the questions surrounding sustainable development,' says Nicolas Berghmans, director of IDDRI’s new industrial policies program. 'I was always impressed by her ability to read the political landscape and find alliances.' As Spain’s Ecological Transition Minister for the past six years, Ribera oversaw the shutdown of Spain’s coal industry, negotiated a nuclear phase-out, and secured an exemption from EU electricity market rules for Spain and Portugal during the 2022 gas crisis. Spain pioneered setting a legal target to reach climate neutrality by 2050 – a goal the EU later adopted for the entire Union. In Brussels, she will be tasked with overcoming a backlash from farmers, consumers, and businesses fearful of high prices, and the impact on competitiveness. Navigating the job The role will require ideological flexibility. She already has been forced to make a U-turn on nuclear energy. The socialist Ribera once described the EU's decision to label it a sustainable investment as 'a huge mistake.' Nuclear-friendly countries led by France raised alarms. She now assures that she will not oppose nuclear power expansion in Europe. Ribera declined an interview request for this article. Ribera also will oversee EU antitrust enforcement. That is a powerful position, and her nomination generated strong opposition from the European People’s Party (EPP), which was reluctant to see a choice they described as 'too radical, too green.' The Spaniard replaces Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, who ordered Apple to repay €13 billion in underreported taxes and earned Donald Trump’s epithet as a US-hating 'tax lady.' Vestager has warned that a sweeping overhaul of competition policy and merger rules to create European industrial champions could open a 'Pandora’s box.' Ribera has acknowledged Vestager’s contributions but suggested that change may be necessary, stating, 'Margarethe has done a great job, and we need to see to what extent this great job needs to evolve.' Ribera could renew the push for additional 'fair share' payments from US tech companies who account for much of the telcos' traffic. And she could allow the telephone companies to consolidate, despite the risk of higher prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVpBRA-3kjB8m	2024-11-12T16:31:05-08:00	
The Corrupt Nature Of DEI – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya Once it is averred that inequality is wrong and the government ought to do 'something' to make people more equal, tyranny is always around the corner. Equalization methods and strategies may vary, but some degree of coercion is guaranteed once it is decided to equalize human beings. The philosopher Antony Flew characterized egalitarianism as a procrustean ideal—some must be stretched to breaking point, while others must be cut down to size, in order to ensure that all are enjoying equal life opportunities. As David Gordon often reminds us, this is why Murray Rothbard regarded 'equality of opportunity' as an absurd and anti-human ideal. Egalitarian ideology currently marches under the banner of 'diversity, equity and inclusiveness.' Jordan Peterson refers to DEI as 'the great ideological lie,' and pointedly reverses the acronym from DEI to DIE to emphasize the inevitable outcome of diversity enforcement. Commenting on diversity policies in Canadian higher education, Peterson wrote: All my craven colleagues must craft DIE statements to obtain a research grant. They all lie (excepting the minority of true believers) and they teach their students to do the same. And they do it constantly, with various rationalizations and justifications, further corrupting what is already a stunningly corrupt enterprise. Some of my colleagues even allow themselves to undergo so-called anti-bias training, conducted by supremely unqualified Human Resources personnel, lecturing inanely and blithely and in an accusatory manner about theoretically all-pervasive racist/sexist/heterosexist attitudes. In the United States, Christopher Caldwell traces diversity policies to the Supreme Court interpretation of the Civil Rights Act 1964 in the case of Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). In his book Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties, he describes affirmative action as 'the main avenue through which civil rights law was changing the country’s public and private institutions.' Describing university programs that reserved a number of places for African Americans, Caldwell explains: 'That such programs discriminated, by reallocating opportunities from whites to blacks and other minorities, was obvious. It was their whole point.' It was not disputed at the time that these programs were discriminatory; the question was not whether they were discriminatory, but whether they were justified as a means of correcting inequality. Caldwell adds that, 'The justices were concerned with how the programs discriminated, and on what grounds.' Caldwell explains that the 'new definition of 'diversity' provided a rationale for four judges in Bakke who approved of this pro-black discrimination. These judges 'accepted Lyndon Johnson’s description of American society as a footrace to which one runner had arrived shackled—on that basis, they could countenance some infringement on whites’ individual rights in order to fix a society-deforming wrong.' Following from Bakke, diversity was thereafter depicted as the overarching goal of equal opportunities. Discrimination against white people was seen as nothing more than promoting diversity, and endorsed by the courts as a 'justified' means of achieving what many egalitarians describe as 'true equality.' Caldwell points out that although Bakke purported to distinguish between quotas (illegal) and 'diversity' (legal), the end result of diversity is precisely the same as using quotas: '[Justice Lewis] Powell’s opinion, in short, did not eliminate quotas. It just dressed them up as something else. It required all schools that used racial preferences to recast them as programs to promote their interest in the diversity of their student bodies.' Thus arose the hegemony of diversity, which was later reinforced by the concepts of inclusiveness and equity. Diversity as a legal obligation Caldwell further explains how the notion of 'diversity' upheld in Bakke not only justified discrimination against whites and in favor of minorities, but also came to be regarded by many institutions as an implicit legal obligation—in the sense that failing to promote diversity came to be seen as a breach of the equal opportunities obligations of the Civil Rights Act. Paradoxically, the use of critical race theory 'divisive concepts' and anti-white racism, both of which many people regard as a violation of the equal protection clause of the US constitution, came to be regarded as a positive legal obligation under civil rights law. This explains the shouting matches often observed between traditional supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment – those who believe in 'colorblind equality' and supporters of the Civil Rights Act who believe in DEI. The colorblind egalitarians insist that DEI is racially discriminatory against whites and therefore illegal, while the DEI egalitarians retort that banning DEI violates the Civil Rights Act by ignoring discrimination against blacks, and is therefore illegal. Both sides also invoke the First Amendment free speech protection to defend their position. From a Rothbardian perspective, both protagonists that are yelling 'that’s illegal!' at each other are lost (though arguably the DEI egalitarians are more woefully lost than the colorblind egalitarians) and the only workable solution would be to repeal both the Civil Rights Act, as Lew Rockwell has argued, and the FourteenthAmendment. This is the dispute currently unfolding in several states that have banned DEI in public schools and universities. In Alabama, for example, the University of Alabama guidance states: 'Following the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, and sex. On June 29, 2023, the Court ruled race conscious admissions programs used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina were not legal in the cases Students for Fair Admissions (SSFA) v. Harvard and Fair Admissions v. North Carolina. In addition, the Alabama State Legislature passed, and Governor Kay Ivey signed into law, Senate Bill 129 (SB129),2 which defines and imposes limitations related to 'divisive concepts' as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs.' The guidance goes on to define the meaning of DEI programs, emphasizing that programs deemed to be 'necessary to comply' with other legal obligations are not DEI programs: 'Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs are defined as '[a]ny program, class, training, seminar, or other event where attendance is based on an individual’s race, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, or sexual orientation, or that otherwise violates [the law].' Under the law, programs, classes, trainings, seminars, or other events that are necessary to comply with applicable state law, federal law, court order, or accreditation requirements are NOT considered DEI programs.' The reference to 'other legal obligations' with which it is still necessary to comply includes things like civil rights obligations and Department of Education mandates. For example, the National Center for Education Statistics requires 'maintaining, collecting, and reporting racial and ethnic data to the U.S. Department of Education.' DEI bans do not affect these reporting obligations and it is likely that through statistical reporting on diversity the corrupt enterprise of DIE referred to by Jordan will continue its hegemony. Another reason why it may be premature to celebrate the end of DEI is that DEI bans are under attack from Democrat politicians who claim that banning DEI is a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their argument is that providing equal protection to minority groups requires DEI programs, therefore banning DEI programs strips minorities of the equal protection encompassed in DEI. Hence institutions closing down their DEI offices are remaining cautious, aiming 'to review their workplace policies and training programs with respect to existing obligations under federal, state, and local laws, such as the anti discrimination requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and other civil rights statutes.' Some have also argued that banning DEI is potentially a breach of free speech, an interpretation upheld by courts in Florida in striking down parts of Florida’s 'Stop WOKE' law. Florida’s experience illustrates the cost hazards for states fighting against DEI. 'Florida could face paying nearly $750,000 in legal fees for businesses that successfully challenged part of a 2022 law that Gov. Ron DeSantis dubbed the 'Stop WOKE Act.' Citing what they called a 'resounding victory,' attorneys for the businesses filed a motion Friday seeking $749,642 in fees. Also, they sought $41,144 in additional costs related to the lengthy legal battle.' In addition to this unfolding lawfare, it should be noted that the Supreme Court in SFFA stated that 'nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.' Many academics committed to DEI have seized on this enthusiastically as a potentially rich vein to exploit in advancing their diversity ambitions. It is therefore clear that the fight against DEI is by no means over. In many ways, it is only just beginning. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

Missed The Mark: Why Pollsters Misjudged The 2024 Election – OpEd	Most political pollsters were wrong about how close the 2024 U.S. presidential election would be, especially in so-called battleground states, which were expected to be toss-ups just days before November 5. Why did the polls underestimate Donald Trump’s popular vote margin wildly and, by extension, his dominance of the Electoral College? One answer is that public opinion polls, and surveys in general, are seriously flawed. Respondents to questions about their preferences for political candidates or policy outcomes are not asked to make real choices over real options. The cost of stating that candidate A hypothetically is preferred to candidate B essentially is zero. Nothing is sacrificed when the respondent opines one way rather than another or says that he or she is undecided. We also know that survey results depend on the precise wording of questions. Some are 'leading,' biased, or vague. Questioners’ body language, facial expressions, or vocal tones may influence respondents’ beliefs about acceptable answers during in-person or telephone surveys. Opinion surveys administered online raise challenges relating to sample sizes and participant self-selection. Polling failed miserably in the run-up to Election Day 2024. Pollsters and political pundits consistently misjudged the 'red wave' that swept the nation on November 5, missing the mark in the opposite direction from 2022’s midterm elections when broad Republican gains had been anticipated. Although political candidates and parties closely monitor pre-election polls, they are misleading at best and useless in practice. They are no more informative than the 'focus groups' and marketing surveys that produced commercial flops like the Edsel or New Coke. Even with sample sizes in the thousands rather than the millions, no one response to a survey determines a poll’s overall results. Error rates in most opinion polls typically amount to three percentage points in either direction. A vote cast in a mass democratic election also is unlikely to be decisive. As of this writing, more than 140 million voters turned out for 2024’s presidential race. Donald Trump outpolled Kamala Harris nationally by about four million popular votes. It is impossible to say which of those four million voters put Trump 'over the top.' The probability of one vote being decisive or pivotal in 2024 was vanishingly small (roughly one in 140 million). The late public-choice economist Gordon Tullock relied on such evidence to conclude that voting in mass democratic elections is irrational because the costs of voting (becoming informed about the candidates and issues on the ballot, traveling to and from the polls, or filling out and mailing a ballot) exceed the benefits of doing so for most voters, measured by the nearly zero chance of influencing the election’s outcome. For Tullock, the probability of one voter’s decisiveness on Election Day is smaller than the chance of being struck by lightning on the way to or from polling places or ballot drop boxes. However, Tullock also launched a research agenda concluding that voting is rational if seen as a low-cost way of expressing political preferences. Because one vote is not consequential, voters can support candidates or policies they would not support otherwise. Many voters would reject a policy that raises their annual tax bills by $10,000 if a single vote determined the outcome. But if the chance of being pivotal is one in 10,000 (0.0001)—much larger than one in 140 million—a vote in favor of the policy raises the voter’s expected tax bill by just $1 (= 0.0001 times $10,000). Even uncharitable people can afford to be charitable under such circumstances, supporting programs and policies they would reject if they faced the full cost of their choices. Close elections almost always trigger challenges by losers, ballot recounts, and other consequences that introduce uncertainty into voting processes. Such uncertainty makes it more difficult to conclude that one vote will 'matter' ahead of time. The point is that opinions expressed in response to political polls and decisions made in the voting booth differ substantially from ordinary market decisions, where costs and benefits are more closely aligned. Because they have skin in the game, people’s market choices do reveal their preferences. Thus, it should be no surprise that pollsters claiming to forecast hypothetical political preferences often get it wrong.

European Lackeys In Panic Mode As Trump Signals Detente With Russ...	It’s early days yet. However, there are signs that President-elect Trump is moving toward a detente with Russia over Ukraine. One good sign is that Trump will not invite Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley to join his cabinet when he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president on January 20. Both of these figures were rabid anti-Russia hawks during Trump’s previous administration. There were suggestions that Pompeo and Haley might return with senior posts in his second administration. But Trump has announced the pair will not be offered new positions. Another positive sign is from people close to Trump’s inner circle who are letting the Kiev regime know – rudely – that the U.S. military aid spigot is being turned off. Donald Trump has yet to hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Kremlin. But both leaders have already expressed a willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement over the Ukraine conflict. Another promising sign of potential detente between the United States and Russia is the sheer panic among European leaders. The news of Trump’s election last week has caused most European elites to scramble like scared children on hearing 'boo!'. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron are consoling themselves by urging Europe to 'come together' in the wake of Trump’s stunning election victory. The collapse of Germany’s coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is an early casualty of the Trump impact. European leaders fear that if Trump pulls the plug on military aid to the Kiev regime they will be left holding the can to fund the proxy war against Russia, which the weak European economies have no chance of sustaining. It’s no secret that the main European states were betting on Democrat candidate Kamala Harris winning the race to the White House. Harris would have ensured the continuation of NATO’s backing for the Kiev regime. With Trump becoming president, all bets are off. The political price will be ruinous for European leaders who have invested huge political capital in waging war to 'defend Ukraine from Russian aggression.' Trump has shown skepticism toward that false narrative. He has told Europe to go it alone if it wants to. And the European Russophobes know they can’t do that. If Trump follows through on his election promise to negotiate with Putin on a settlement in Ukraine, then the Europeans are going to be left with serious amounts of egg on their faces. One thing about Trump that is of concern to the Europeans is his frustration with them as being, in his view, freeloaders on American protection. Another is Trump’s vindictive streak. He’s not going to forget that most of the European leaders wanted him to lose the election. Take Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer. His Labour Party sent volunteers over to the U.S. to advise Harris on winning the election. The British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has also been reminded that he previously disparaged Trump as a racist 'sociopath.' Trump’s election is bad news for Britain and there is no doubt that Starmer is now trying to repair post-Brexit relations with Europe as a hedge against the expected chill from Washington during the next four years. When Britain pulled out of the European Union after its 2016 Brexit referendum, there were high hopes that it could negotiate a special trade deal with the U.S. That deal didn’t work out and looks even less likely now. Hence, Starmer has been busy since taking office in Downing Street trying to restore relations with the EU. This week, the British leader attended the Armistice ceremony in Paris to commemorate the end of the First World War. The last time a British leader honored that event in Paris was in 1944 when Winston Churchill visited the French capital following its liberation from Nazi occupation. Macon invited Starmer to lay wreaths in the Champs-Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe. The choreographed caper of European unity is a reflection of the panic gripping European leaders in the aftermath of Trump’s return to the White House. But everything is up in the air for the European politicians. Starmer was bending over backward to renew relations with Germany as a way to forge a warmer connection between London and the European Union after years of post-Brexit bitterness, only for that to be thrown into doubt. Last month saw a landmark security deal between Britain and Germany in which German arms maker Rheinmetall would open a new factory in Britain, and the German Luftwaffe would be able to fly warplanes from an RAF base in Scotland. The deal was touted as 'a sign of joint European security in the face of Russian threat.' With the collapse of the government in Berlin over the unbearable financial costs of the Ukraine war to the German economy, the British security treaty may not materialize. That means a big setback to Starmer’s reset plans with Europe. Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Slovakia’s Robert Fico are in the minority of European politicians who genuinely welcomed Trump’s election as an opportunity to wind down the NATO proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. On the other hand, the ardent NATO warmongers in Europe, including Britain, Germany, France, Poland and the Baltic states now face a desperate dilemma. Along with EU leaders like Von der Leyen and the Dutch NATO chief Mark Rutte, they have all nailed their colors to the mast for continuing the reckless proxy war against Russia. Trump seems to be showing good sense in calling off that proxy war and finding a way to negotiate sensibly with Russia on detente. Moscow wants its long-term security demands to be met. That means no NATO membership for Ukraine, an end to the NeoNazi regime in Kiev, and recognition of its historical lands in Crimea and the Donbass. This is all eminently negotiable, and Trump might just be ready to cut a deal to avoid World War Three, as he has repeatedly indicated he would do. That would mean Trump dumping the false narrative that Biden, Harris and the Democrats – and their European vassals – contrived about 'defending Ukraine'. That would leave the European lackeys in a disastrous lurch. How will they explain to their electorates the three-year slaughter in Ukraine? How will they justify the tens of billions of Euros and Sterling wasted on pushing a war that not only destroyed millions of lives but their economies as well? The stupid European leaders are in panic mode, and that’s a good thing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVtefpb4p6OU0	2024-11-12T16:19:25-08:00	
This Time, Trump’s Win Is Not An Oddity: It Is The American Reali...	By Yossi Mekelberg It is not only Donald Trump’s election victory that has sent shockwaves across the US and many parts of the world, but also its decisiveness, which defied all forecasts of a close race. If Trump’s first victory in 2016 felt like a fluke, benefiting from a combination of him being a political novice but with star qualities as a multimillionaire businessman and a well-known reality TV presenter, this time he was elected, and by a big margin, for who he is. Make no mistake, the margin of Trump’s victory and the Republicans’ control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate should not conceal the depth of the divisions within American society. This is a feature that will dominate the US for the foreseeable future. And for a stunned Democratic Party, there is an uphill battle, first to come to terms with defeat, but more significantly to reconnect with those who are its natural electorate yet have been swayed by Trump. A quick glimpse of the distribution of votes across the US shows that most of this vast territory has been painted red, emphasizing that the party representing leftist-liberal progressive ideas and values has lost the working class, who should be its backbone. These are mainly white men who are angry at seeing their jobs disappearing abroad and who feel marginalized. Trump is appealing to them. Trump is not a Republican in the traditional sense and not even strictly a politician. Democrats cannot exonerate themselves from having no answer to Trump. It became apparent that the economy played a significant role in voters’ preferences and the increase in the cost of living over the last four years has cost them dearly. Anyone who visits a grocery store in the US will be astonished by how expensive fresh produce is in comparison to most other countries of similar economic development. Raw figures about employment or economic growth matter very little in many parts of the country when earnings do not allow a decent standard of living and when the younger generations do not enjoy a similar degree of prosperity to that enjoyed by their parents. It was those who have a job — who are sometimes forced to take two or three jobs and who feel stuck in survival mode with no way out — that painted much of the US red last week. Whenever this mood prevails, it is usually those in power who are punished by the voters and Kamala Harris is the vice president. It was not only the economy that decided last week’s election, but immigration too. The debate over this divisive issue has been hijacked by the populist right and, interestingly, even Latinos voted for Trump in big numbers. There is an interesting phenomenon operating here: those who are legal migrants begrudge the undocumented ones, whom they perceive as skipping the hard work they had to do to earn their status. Moreover, they perceive illegal migration from Latin America as the main reason they are disparaged by others in US society and face a more difficult path to social acceptance. Yet the Biden administration and Harris in particular, who was in charge of securing the borders, did very little to stop illegal migration. Trump’s appeal to just over half of the American people is a mystery to the rest of the nation and to many around the world. However, he rides his status with pride and has appealed to enough voters. For the Democrats, this should be the beginning of a period of soul-searching: how do they reconnect with their electoral and ideological roots? If their position on the economy and migration put them in an inferior position, their inability to bring an end to the war in Gaza also cost them votes in certain parts of the country. However, it was their pushing too hard and too fast for some aspects of their progressive agenda that made some voters uncomfortable and left them feeling that an elite was trying to force upon them changes that clashed with their traditional values. This is not to suggest that these progressive ideas are wrong as such, the opposite is often the case, but they cannot be enforced from the top down and by patronizing those who object to them. Instead, they should engage with people and allay their fears. What’s more, it should not be forgotten that, while Trump won the Republican primaries easily and had months to build his campaign, Harris won her party’s nomination almost by default when it became apparent that President Joe Biden was not fit to run for another term. Going through the grinding process of the primaries gains the winner credibility, legitimacy, better engagement with the public and the momentum for a presidential campaign. But the result of last Tuesday’s election made it clear that Harris had too little time to lift the campaign and build trust, as well as being too closely associated with the Biden administration as his second in command. For the second time in eight years, we are once more entering the territory of the unknown and the unpredictable. Trump won this election fairly and squarely and there will not be a repeat of the ugly scenes of Jan. 6, 2021, but an orderly and civilized transition of power, as we should expect. Nevertheless, there will be many Americans, along with many in the international community, who will be deeply skeptical.

Trump Regime: Southeast Asia’s Options – OpEd	As Trump Returns to Power, Allies and Adversaries Expect a Wave of Revenge' -- New York Times Donald Trump's presidential victory has generated a frenzy of commentary on global geopolitics and geoeconomics unlike any previous election. For a start, leaders critical or contemptuous of Trump have had not only to swallow their pride. Many have now publicly retracted their earlier opinions and started to eat crow. Possibly the most striking example is Australia’s former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, currently Australia’s Ambassador to the United States. In 2020, Rudd condemned Trump as the 'most destructive president in history,' while in 2022 he denounced Trump as a 'traitor to the West' for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Immediately after Trump’s victory, Rudd purged his personal and social media accounts of his anti-Trump posts - an action which Peter Dutton, Australia’s opposition leader responded to by predicting that Rudd would follow up with further attempts to ingratiate himself with the new government. 'He’ll be down at the tie shop, he’d be buying up red ties, he’d be buying red hats, he’ll be ordering those MAGA hats. He will do everything he can to ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign. So he’s indefatigable, as we know.' None of the leaders in the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) are likely to engage in the brown nosing and submissive behaviour that we are seeing from allies of the US - including from the Asian Pacific region - in their efforts to apple-polish Trump and his incoming administration, and to curry favour. What Southeast Asians Really Think of the US Not only is there no need for ASEAN leaders to buy MAGA merchandise especially submarines and missile systems or to ingratiate themselves further with the new US president, there is every reason we can expect ASEAN member countries and leaders to uphold the organisation’s independent and non aligned principles in the tumultuous era that lies ahead. An important marker for ASEAN’s foreign policy stance for the next four years has already been established by Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim. While congratulating Trump on his remarkable comeback victory, Anwar expressed the hope that Trump’s victory would bring positive changes in geopolitics, particularly to end the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. 'We will welcome any positive stance by the United States towards peace, particularly efforts to halt Israel's violent attacks on Gaza and to acknowledge the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.' This call by Malaysia as the incoming chair of ASEAN in 2025 for the new US administration to change its war-oriented ideological position pursued by the Biden administration, and presently playing out in respect to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and elsewhere where earlier presidents have sought to reinforce American dominance, should not be regarded as unrealistic or futile. Although criticised by western liberal media and think-tanks for his unpredictable ways and combustible foreign policy, Trump previously undertook an unprecedented peace initiative in dealing with North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. During his recent campaign Trump repeatedly promised to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It is equally possible that he will do the same in Gaza if there is strong and sustained pressure from his western allies and the rest of the world. Standing up for ASEAN’s core principles means standing up for regional peace and security. This is a position which Trump, even if he disagrees with it, can and should be willing to live with. Despite his election rhetoric of making America great again, he is ultimately a businessman and realist with bigger concerns and issues to deal with in the United States, America, Europe, the Middle East and China. Draining the deep state and Capital Hill swamp may be his biggest challenge. This means that ASEAN will be relatively low and unimportant in his agenda. At the same time the reality for Trump’s hawkish foreign policy advisers is that ASEAN is a regional force that needs to be given due respect. With a larger population than North America’s, ASEAN is a middle level power in geopolitics but one of the world’s most diverse, fastest growing and competitive economic regions. The combined gross domestic product of US$3.8 trillion makes ASEAN the fifth largest economy in the world. During the period 2013-2022, ASEAN’s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2% and is expected to grow just as or more strongly in the coming decade. Should Trump want a stronger counterweight to China, his team will be out to solicit for ASEAN’s support. The reality is also that should Trump want to restore the US to a more respectable standing in this part of the world, he has to begin with the recognition that many in ASEAN - possibly the great majority of the population - do not see the US as a role model for democracy, freedom, human rights and a force for peace. This representation is regarded by most people - including Americans - as a hollow claim though ceaselessly propagandised by the military-industrial-media complex. The prevailing dark view of the US in Southeast Asia is not only because of the recent history of its military campaign in Vietnam which spilled over into Laos and Cambodia and killed more than a million of the Indochinese population. It is also due to the US’s war record in the Middle East and elsewhere and its support of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza which has adversely affected Muslim as well as other non-western opinions of the US. Alignment Preference of Southeast Asians With regard to China which the Biden administration assessed as America's greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic rival, a recent survey of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute found that over half of Southeast Asians preferred alignment with China over the US. Its polling sample included respondents from the public and private sector, and researchers and academics who are in a position to influence policy. If the poll numbers from the Philippines, the most pro-American among ASEAN nations because of its history and the large population of Filipinos with relatives in the US or dependent for their livelihood on US military bases in the Philippines, are discounted, the finding would be more lopsided in favour of China. Policy advisers of President Trump will do well to point out to him that more than 40% of the population of Southeast Asia is Muslim. The way for Trump to make America better - great is in many ways a hopeless ambition - is to focus on dealing with the domestic issues that divide US society. It is not to engage in efforts to enforce the primacy of a nation whose preeminent standing in the world has been irretrievably lost. Trump’s exclusion of Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo, well known war hawks, in his new administration is a hopeful sign that he may, against all expectations, help build a peace-oriented road for the US in its foreign policy to embellish his place in history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVuG26cpUQSMP	2024-11-12T16:10:56-08:00	
The Two-Trillion-Dollar Challenge – OpEd	There is an old proverb known as the 'law of holes.' It goes something like this: 'Let me tell you about the law of holes: If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.' This particular version of the proverb was coined by Bill Brock while serving as President Reagan’s Secretary of Labor. It matters today because it applies to the poor fiscal state in which the U.S. government finds itself. It’s no secret that the U.S. government’s fiscal situation has deteriorated since 2000. During the last four years, that fiscal deterioration sped up for the worse. U.S. politicians and bureaucrats have dug into a deep hole because of excessive spending. This spending directly contributed to 2021’s inflation surge, which subsequently led to 2024’s explosion in the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing. How to stop digging The outcome of the 2024 elections offers the potential to deliver a change in fiscal direction. Washington D.C.’s incoming leadership acknowledges the need to address the nation’s growing fiscal crisis. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s call for 'at least' $2 trillion in cuts to federal spending is drawing skepticism from experts as the billionaire tech magnate cements himself as one of former President Trump’s most prominent backers. 'How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted, $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?' Howard Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO and Trump’s transition team co-chair, asked Musk at the former president’s recent rally held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Without offering specifics, Musk said in response that he thinks 'at least $2 trillion' in a brief moment that has since gained widespread attention online and drawn mixed reactions from budget world. Although the size of the figure draws skepticism, Musk’s two-trillion-dollar spending reduction target is typical of his 'set a big goal then go after it' business philosophy. To be sure, it will be opposed by many Washington D.C. institutions that will work hard to make it impossible to achieve. That is not a bad thing because achieving any significant portion of the target against that self-serving opposition can deliver at least one positive outcome. Writing at Reason, Veronique de Rugy describes how U.S. politicians and bureaucrats can rediscover a key principle of good governance: The best way to cut $2 trillion out of the budget is to ax everything the federal government does that it shouldn’t be doing in the first place. It’s time we rediscovered the exercise of thinking critically about government and the role it should or shouldn’t play in our lives. Questions like, 'Is that the role of government?' or 'Should the federal government pay for that?' haven’t been seriously considered in years. The muscle of fighting for first principles has atrophied among Republicans as it’s no longer in style to call for small government…. Cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget should be easy. Of course, it will be anything but, given Congress’ continued lack of interest in discussing spending cuts and the president’s sorry track record. If anything, let’s hope this Musk-led effort to cut spending will hopefully reintroduce seemingly forgotten rationales for cutting the federal budget. There is a related proverb that applies here, called Stein’s Law: 'If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.' The deep fiscal hole Washington D.C.’s players have dug through their excessive spending cannot continue forever. Certainly not as has been allowed during the past four years. Setting a $2 trillion target for spending cuts and working to make them happen is a means to stop digging the nation’s fiscal hole deeper at the speed they have been. It is both common sense and long overdue. This article was published by The Beacon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVhuMFkiHKqM3	2024-11-12T16:08:05-08:00	
How Gov. Gavin Newsom And Jerry Brown Disenfranchised California ...	On election days, voters become public officials, and on November 5th Californians made the most of the opportunity by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5 and passing Proposition 36. While they celebrate those victories, the people might recall a greater loss. Proposition 5 was an attack on the 'People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation,' the famous Proposition 13 from 1978, when some Californians were literally being taxed out of their homes. Proposition 5 would have reduced the two-thirds vote to pass bonds to 55 percent, making property tax hikes more likely. Proposition 36 aimed to restore the damage from the 2014 Proposition 47, which reduced some felonies to misdemeanors. The 'Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,' so named by state attorney general Kamala Harris, looked the other way at theft of property valued at less than $950. The measure launched a wave of shoplifting and vandalism that continues to this day. As Katy Grimes of the California Globe notes, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats had 10 years to deal with escalating crime, but failed to do so until Proposition 36 qualified for the November ballot. Another key measure qualified for the same ballot, but voters did not get the chance to make the call. California’s Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act required voter approval for all new taxes passed by the legislature and two-thirds voter approval for all new special tax increases. The act required that before any tax or fee is enacted, politicians must clearly outline how revenues would be spent. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the November 5 ballot. That disturbed Gov. Gavin Newsom and former governor Jerry Brown. Gov. Newsom contended that the measure is a constitutional revision, rather than a constitutional amendment, and would 'effectively block the state’s ability to quickly respond to major challenges.' Proponents of the measure charged that Newsom was simply attempting to disenfranchise the voters. Brown’s amicus brief made the same argument as Gov. Newsom, that the measure was a constitutional 'revision' rather than an amendment, basically a distinction without a difference. The former governor mentions Proposition 13, which Brown loudly opposed until it passed in a landslide. The state supreme court ruled that Proposition 13 'was both modest and does not change our basic governmental plan.' According to Brown, a Yale law alum, the Taxpayer Protection and Accountability Act, 'turns our governmental plan inside out.' If taxpayers thought that was exactly what the state needs it would be hard to blame them. Consider the government’s ongoing plan to keep income and sales taxes among the highest in the nation. Unfortunately, the state’s high court sided with the ruling class, booting the Taxpayer Protection Act from the ballot. On the other hand, the people scored victories by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5, rejecting Proposition 33, (rent control), and passing Proposition 36.In Santa Ana, yet another victory escaped notice. By a 62-38 margin, voters rejected Measure DD, which would have allowed non-citizens to vote. Non-citizens voting is like an imposter replacing an elected official and, say, casting a vote to increase taxes. Those who support non-citizen voting, regardless of party affiliation, have no claim to support the rule of law. Proposition 13 made California a national leader but a reactionary ruling class now bars the people from curtailing tax and fee hikes. To restore national leadership and respect the rights of the people, the state should put the Taxpayer Protection Act on the next ballot, along with a measure to ban non-citizen voting statewide.

The Case For Stopping Russia Sanction-Busters – Analysis	By Stephen J. Blank and Mark Temnycky (FPRI) -- When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the international community quickly came together to condemn the aggressor. United Nations resolutions denounced the military incursion. Over 100 countries across the globe have consistently spoken out against the Russian war since it began, but many of them are violating the Western sanctions on the Kremlin, buying Russian energy resources, and selling goods and services. Still, the international community did not just talk—it imposed stiff penalties on Russia. The Russian Federation was expelled from the Council of Europe and suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. Furthermore, several Russian companies, government officials, and oligarchs were sanctioned. Several politicians and oligarchs also had their assets frozen or seized. Finally, numerous countries have banned exports to Russia, reduced Russian gas imports, and reduced or ended their business relationships with Russia. Numerous Russian banks were removed from SWIFT, the global monetary banking system. As a result, the Russian Federation has lost billions of dollars, and the Russian economy has been under significant strain. Yet, these losses were not enough to end the war. Russia can still sustain its war machine, even paying for North Korean troops to assist with the fighting. This is because multiple companies and banks are undermining the impact of international sanctions on Russia. The European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western actors maintain normal trade relations with most neutral countries across the globe. This has created an opening for Russia as some countries in South America, Africa, and Asia serve as third-party intermediaries, re-exporting Western goods and services to Russia. Many restricted goods, including dual-use items and other forms of equipment, are being sent to Russia from these countries, providing Russia with the material and equipment it needs to continue its invasion of Ukraine. To streamline this process, Russia uses intermediaries to sell its crude oil, which ends up in gas tanks everywhere including the United States. Countries like India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates purchase oil from the Russian Federation. This information is publicly available. Companies such as India’s Reliance Industries, Turkey’s STAR Refinery and Tupras Refinery, and the UAE’s Amur Trading FZCO import Russian crude that is then blended with other crudes at purchaser oil refineries. The mixed substance is refined into gasoline and sold worldwide, allowing Moscow to profit. All of this would be impossible without a sophisticated system of financial facilitation. Banks from former USSR countries—still heavily dependent on Russia in everything from energy supplies to security—are natural suspects. For example, when the full-scale invasion began, financial institutions such as Kazakhstan’s Kazpochta, Uzbekistan’s Kapital Bank, Kyrgyzstan’s Kompanyon Bank and MBank, and Armenia’s Ardshinbank continued doing business with Russia, primarily through the Russian money-transfer company Unistream. These financial institutions suspended their operations with Unistream after the United States imposed sanctions on the currency transfer company in July 2023. Not all have heeded warnings about sanctions. For example, banks in Kyrgyzstan, which is heavily dependent on Moscow, continued their business openly with the Russian Federation until this past summer when additional sanctions announced by the Biden administration persuaded a number of them to finally announce that they would be cutting ties with Russia. When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Kyrgyzstan mysteriously increased its trade relations with Western entities. At the same time, international financial transactions from Kyrgyzstan to Russia also increased. Current reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan may still be involved in sanctions evasion. This includes dual-use goods, vehicle parts, and other equipment from China used by the Russian military for its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, recent reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan continues to help keep Russia’s energy sector going. For example, reporting on September 30, 2024, Euronews quoted Irina Tsukerman, president of Scarab Rising, a security strategy advisory firm, 'Russia is managing its energy exports, primarily oil and gas in various forms, using Kyrgyzstan as an effective trade hub to circumvent sanctions and get the fossil fuels into Europe.' One of the banks suspected to be involved in facilitating business with Russia is Kyrgyz MBank, which reportedly belongs to the country’s former Prime Minister Ömürbek Babanov. This bank was reported as receiving payments from buyers of Russian oil and partnering with Russian banking organizations such as Sberbank, which has been sanctioned by the US and the EU. The bank has also been working with the Russian card processing center Kartstandard, part of the Center of Financial Technologies (CFT), which was sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August 2024. MBank finally announced that it had suspended direct transactions with Sberbank and other sanctioned Russian entities only in mid-August 2024. However, the flows of payments were fully restored in less than a week with the help of intermediaries. MBank is reportedly working with one of Sberbank’s trusted intermediaries, Bank 131. Sberbank advises its clients that it makes payments to MBank and brags on its official website that wires could be made to any bank in Kyrgyzstan. South Korean Kookmin Bank, one of the key correspondent banks for Central Asian financial institutions, has decided to cease dollar SWIFT transfers with MBank, along with 20 other regional banks suspected of facilitating Russia’s sanctions evasion. However, it is estimated that at least five other international correspondent banks, including Pasha Yatirim Bankasi in Turkey, Mashreqbank in the UAE, and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Germany, continue to work with Kyrgyzstan despite the reputational and legal risks. MBank and four of its corresponding international banks have been contacted to comment on this article but failed to respond at the time of the publication. Landesbank, in an emailed response, declined to comment citing 'banking secrecy' but insisted it 'consistently complies with all applicable regulations.' In the context of sanction-busting business schemes, Central Asian banks like MBank are obviously just small fry. Extending secondary sanctions to those working directly with Russia is essential but may prove insufficient. For Western sanctions to have a real impact, they will need to increase pressure on the larger international partners of these smaller banks and firms and take additional measures to prevent financial facilitation of Putin’s war machine. MBank is not the only institution undermining these sanctions. In fact, OFAC recently announced new sanctions on prominent organizations that are helping Russia undermine international sanctions. The listincludes companies from countries such as India, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey. Sanctioning these businesses will put additional pressure on their decision to aid Russia, and this will help bring a quicker end to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. In other words, Western collective action is the only way to impose real economic costs on Russia and, thereby, make progress toward ending the Russian invasion and restoring international order.

The Very Definition Of Tyranny: A Dictatorship Disguised As Democ...	Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Unadulterated power in any branch of government is a menace to freedom, but concentrated power across all three branches is the very definition of tyranny: a dictatorship disguised as democracy. When one party dominates all three branches of government—the executive, the legislative, and the judicial—there is even more reason to worry. There’s no point debating which political party would be more dangerous with these powers. This is true no matter which party is in power. This is particularly true in the wake of the 2024 election. Already, Donald Trump, who promised to be a dictator on 'day one,' is advancing plans to further undermine the nation’s already vulnerable system of checks and balances. To be fair, this is not a state of affairs that can be blamed exclusively on Trump. America’s founders intended our system of checks and balances to serve as a bulwark against centralized power being abused. As constitutional scholar Linda Monk explains, 'Within the separation of powers, each of the three branches of government has ‘checks and balances’ over the other two. For instance, Congress makes the laws, but the President can veto them, and the Supreme Court can declare them unconstitutional. The President enforces the law, but Congress must approve executive appointments and the Supreme Court rules whether executive action is constitutional. The Supreme Court can strike down actions by both the legislative and executive branches, but the President nominates Supreme Court justices, and the Senate confirms or denies their nominations.' Unfortunately, our system of checks and balances has been strained to the breaking point for years now, helped along by those across the political spectrum who, in marching in lockstep with the Deep State, have conspired to advance the government’s agenda at the expense of the citizenry’s constitutional rights. By 'government,' I’m not referring to the farce that is the highly partisan, two-party, bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. Rather, I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. This is exactly the kind of concentrated, absolute power the founders attempted to guard against by establishing a system of checks of balances that separate and shares power between three co-equal branches. Yet as law professor William P. Marshall concludes, 'The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned now lacks effective checks and is no longer in balance. The implications of this are serious. The Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence. They also believed that, in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure, such ills would inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however, power once taken is not easily surrendered.' The outcome of the 2024 elections is not a revolutionary bid to recalibrate a government run amok. Rather, this is a Deep State coup to stay in power, and Donald Trump is the vehicle by which it will do so. Watch and see. Remember, it was the Trump Administration that asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deemed it necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic and 'other' emergencies. In fact, during Trump’s first term, the Department of Justice quietly trotted out and tested a long laundry list of terrifying powers to override the Constitution. We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, 'stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,' reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die… Bear in mind, however, that these powers the Trump Administration, acting on orders from the police state, officially asked Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has unilaterally claimed for itself. Unofficially, the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts, the president, or the citizenry. This is why the Constitution’s system of checks and balances is so critical. Those who wrote our Constitution sought to ensure our freedoms by creating a document that protects our God-given rights at all times, even when we are engaged in war, whether that is a so-called war on terrorism, a so-called war on drugs, a so-called war on illegal immigration, or a so-called war on disease. The attempts by each successive presidential administration to rule by fiat merely plays into the hands of those who would distort the government’s system of checks and balances and its constitutional separation of powers beyond all recognition. In this way, we have arrived at the dystopian future depicted in the film V for Vendetta, which is no future at all. Set in the year 2020, V for Vendetta (written and produced by the Wachowskis) provides an eerie glimpse into a parallel universe in which a totalitarian government that knows all, sees all, controls everything, and promises safety and security above all comes to power by capitalizing on the people’s fear. Concentration camps (jails, private prisons and detention facilities) are established to house political prisoners and others deemed to be enemies of the state. Executions of undesirables (extremists, troublemakers and the like) are common, while other enemies of the state are made to 'disappear.' Populist uprisings and protests are met with extreme force. The television networks are controlled by the government with the purpose of perpetuating the regime. And most of the population is hooked into an entertainment mode and are clueless. In V for Vendetta, as in my novel The Erik Blair Diaries, the subtext is that authoritarian regimes—through a vicious cycle of manipulation, oppression and fear-mongering—foment violence, manufacture crises, and breed terrorists, thereby giving rise to a recurring cycle of blowback and violence. Only when the government itself becomes synonymous with the terrorism wreaking havoc in their lives do the people to finally mobilize and stand up to the government’s tyranny. V, a bold, charismatic freedom fighter, urges the British people to rise up and resist the government. In Vendetta, V the film’s masked crusader blows up the seat of government on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, ironically enough the same day that Trump won his landslide return to the White House. Yet there the comparison ends. So, while we are overdue for a systemic check on the government’s overreaches and power grabs, this year’s electoral victory for Republicans was no win for the Constitution. Rather, it was a win for the very entrenched, hawkish, establishment power structure that has exhibited no regard for the Constitution or the rights of the citizenry. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the Deep State works best through imperial presidents—empowered to indulge their authoritarian tendencies by legalistic courts, corrupt legislatures and a disinterested, distracted populace—who rule by fiat rather than by the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVvbeQt8OzNL8	2024-11-12T15:47:54-08:00	
North Korea Approves Deal With Moscow That Allows Troop Deploymen...	(RFE/RL) -- North Korea has ratified a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' agreement with Russia, cementing a deal that has paved the way for its soldiers to fight on Russian soil against Ukraine. North Korea's state-controlled news agency KCNA said on November 12 that the deal, which was agreed between Moscow and Pyongyang in June, will take full effect once both sides exchange ratified copies of the agreement. According to reports from South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin has already signed the documents.The deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which has been confirmed by U.S., NATO, South Korean, and Ukrainian intelligence, has raised concerns that it will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific region and broaden Moscow's war on Ukraine. South Korea has raised questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for supplying troops. 'Russia working together with North Korea, Iran, and China is not only threatening Europe, it's threatening peace and security, yes, here in Europe, but also in the Indo-Pacific and in North America,' NATO Chief Mark Rutte said in Paris on November 12 ahead of talks later in the day with French President Emmanuel Macron. Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to a Ukrainian incursion launched in August, and its forces have struggled to push back Ukrainian troops there. The United States has estimated about 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia now. Seoul and its allies assess that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000.Moscow and Pyongyang have trumpeted their increased defense cooperation since the launch of the invasion, but the Kremlin has neither denied nor directly confirmed the presence of North Korean troops on its soil. The bolstering of Russian forces comes at a time when it appears to be making advances in Ukraine despite incurring heavy casualties. NATO's Rutte, in the face of the battlefield gains by Russia and the election in the United States of Donald Trump, who has been critical of how much aid the West has given to Kyiv, called for continued support of Ukraine from allies. 'We must recommit to stay the course of the war and we must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight,' Rutte said.'We need to raise the cost for Putin and his enabling authoritarian threats by providing Ukraine with the support it needs to change the trajectory of the conflict.' Macron agreed, saying the 'only way toward negotiations' was to make sure that nothing is decided about 'Ukraine without the Ukrainians and on Europe without the Europeans.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVjliLstpT1dl	2024-11-12T15:46:12-08:00	
Patriarch Kirill Says He Doesn’t Oppose Restoration Of Death Pena...	In yet another example of Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill’s willingness to engage in mental gymnastics to come out in support of whatever he believes the Kremlin wants, he now says that the apostles didn’t object to the death penalty when the Romans applied it to Jesus so he won’t oppose its restoration in Russia. That creative interpretation of the Bible, Aleksandr Soldatov says, is just a small part of the neo-paganism which Kirill has long been associated with, a religion that has little to do with Christianity as it is typically understood but fits perfectly with Putin’s view (t.me/mozhemobyasnit/19287 reposted at poligonmedia.appspot.com/aleksandr-soldatov/ and summarized at charter97.org/ru/news/2024/11/7/617975/). According to the specialist on religious life in Russia, Kirill has led his church to completely substitute military patriotic views in place of Christian ones, with the center of his faith 'not the Gospels but with an ideology connected with the romanticism of military actions' taken by the Russian state. For Kirill and those who follow him, 'Jesus no is only one of the gods in the pantheon of the Russian Orthodox Church: on its icons appear the image of Stalin, and the main church of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation features amulets from the computer game Warhammer' rather than the Bible. Those who follow the current patriarch including both the priesthood and the laity are told that 'in war all means are good' and shown that the church is prepared to support 'any mechanism' to promote them 'including those which are purely occult' and have nothing to do with Christian traditions, according to the specialist on the Russian Orthodox Church today. The teachings of Christ are turned upside down, the researcher says, with Christ’s injunction not to kill being recast as an order to do just that, Soldatov concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVmgWWBmRxHQw	2024-11-12T15:44:54-08:00	
Biden Reiterates ‘Ironclad’ Commitment To Israel During Meeting W...	President Joe Biden reiterated his 'ironclad' defense of Israel during a Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Israel’s president – and he echoed the wish to see the return of the remaining hostages still held by militant group Hamas after more than a year of brutal conflict in Gaza. 'My commitment to Israel is ironclad,' Biden told President Isaac Herzog during their morning meeting in the White House. 'And we share a deep friendship.' Herzog underscored his government’s main objective: 'First and foremost, we have to get the hostages back.' 'It all starts in Tehran,' he said. 'It all starts in the empire of evil, where, in Tehran, with its proxies, they are doing whatever they can to derail stability and security and peace, calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons, Mr. President, this has to be a major objective all throughout your term and the next term of the next president, because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil intentions.' A day earlier in Washington, Herzog told a gathering of North American Jewish community groups that the Israeli administration considers incoming President Donald Trump 'a champion of peace and cooperation and a great friend of Israel.' Washington is Israel’s top military and diplomatic supporter, and these mannered talks are happening against a backdrop of violence. Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza, Palestinian authorities said Tuesday, and plumes of smoke were rising above the southern Beirut’s suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces told residents to evacuate. While fighting continues, international aid groups issued a report saying Israel has not met a Tuesday deadline set by the U.S. to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip. But the Israeli military said hundreds of packages of food and water have been brought to an area in northern Gaza where it has been focusing operations. Last month, the Biden administration told Israel to 'surge' more food and supplies into Gaza or risk a cut in military aid. The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer met in Washington on Monday and 'reviewed steps that Israel has taken to improve the dire humanitarian situation inside Gaza in a response to the letter sent by the secretary and Secretary of Defense [Lloyd] Austin on October 13.' 'The secretary emphasized the importance of ensuring those changes lead to an actual improvement in the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, including through the delivery of additional assistance to civilians throughout Gaza. The secretary further reiterated the importance that Israel take every possible step to minimize civilian harm,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a statement on Tuesday. On Tuesday, a group of eight international aid organizations said that of 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza were denied or impeded last month. The office made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter each day, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Airstrikes in Gaza, Beirut A late Monday strike killed at least 11 people in a cafeteria west of Khan Younis, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Early Tuesday, the Israeli army told residents in Beirut's southern suburbs to leave immediately, warning that it would strike Hezbollah targets there. 'You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the Israel Defense Forces will act in the near future,' military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map showing the buildings it would target in the Lebanese capital. Less than an hour later, according to Agence France-Presse, two strikes hit the area and plumes of gray smoke were rising. Witnesses told AFP gunfire could be heard in the area ahead of the strikes warning shots by residents for people to leave following the evacuation call. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said on X Tuesday that during a meeting with military officials, he reiterated that Israel will continue hitting Hezbollah with full force and that there will be no cease-fire. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVsi3VDybq_GJ	2024-11-12T15:41:31-08:00	
Humanitarian Chiefs Say Israel Failed To Meet US Deadline For All...	By Ephrem Kossaify Israel has failed to meet critical Gaza-related humanitarian demands set by the US government, according to a report published jointly by eight major humanitarian organizations. The failure comes 'at an enormous human cost for Palestinian civilians' in the enclave, where the humanitarian situation 'is now at its worst point' since the war began in October 2023, they said. Their assessment comes a month after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israeli officials demanding the implementation of concrete measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. This deadline passed on Tuesday with no significant signs of progress. Instead, Israeli forces have accelerated their efforts 'to bombard, depopulate, deprive and erase the Palestinian population of the North Gaza governorate,' said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America. 'We are witnessing a campaign of ethnic cleansing,' she added. 'Oxfam and partner organizations are unable to provide any support to the remaining civilians in the North Gaza governorate, where people are dying every day. 'Access to the rest of Gaza is also severely restricted, with civilians facing starvation and relentless violence. The US must finally make this overdue call to suspend deadly arms sales to Israel or be complicit in the horrific atrocities unfolding before our eyes.' The aid organizations that contributed to the report, which also include Refugees International, Save the Children and MedGlobal, called on Washington to make an 'immediate determination' that Israel is in violation of its assurances under US and international law, and to suspend arms sales and impose restrictions on security cooperation, as required by US law. The report also urges the American government to press for immediate humanitarian pauses in military operations, the opening of more routes for deliveries of aid, and efforts to ensure civilians and medical facilities are protected. 'With experts again projecting imminent famine in northern Gaza, there is no time to lose,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. The report 'clearly demonstrates that the Israeli government is violating its obligations (to) facilitate humanitarian relief for suffering Palestinians in Gaza,' he added. Zaher Sahloul, the president and co-founder of MedGlobal, said the organization’s local medical teams and international volunteers in Gaza have personally witnessed 'the complete failure by the Israeli authorities to ensure the delivery of critical supplies, including food, water and medicines, and to protect civilians and medical spaces.' He added: 'Our teams are living through the relentless bombing of hospitals, and our medics continue to treat wounded women and children every day. These are egregious violations of the cornerstone principle of international humanitarian law, which protects civilians in time of war.' Sahloul called on the Biden administration to 'do everything possible to push for the full provision of aid to Gaza’s desperate people.' In addition to the medical crisis, the blockade of Gaza has severely limited the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver aid. The report says convoys are still often blocked, delayed or looted, and access to key parts of the territory, especially in the north, remains severely restricted. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, while the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egelan, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza. The little that does get through is often looted, as the occupying power has obliterated the Palestinian police and refuses to secure, or provide secure access routes to, places where humanitarian organizations could distribute aid to a starving population.' Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, said the US government must do 'everything in its power to ensure the unfettered provision of essential aid to people in desperate need.' The report highlights the dire food insecurity among the population of Gaza. Janti Soeripto, the president of Save the Children, said: 'Systemic impediments to the humanitarian system are making a deadly conflict even deadlier. 'Enough is enough. The facts are there. Adults have been failing children for over a year. What more will it take?' With winter and famine looming, the organizations warned that children in particular are at imminent risk, with many of them already suffering the effects of malnutrition. Sean Carroll, the president and CEO of American Near East Refugee Aid, said the organization’s 'humanitarian workers in Gaza have spent the past year expending superhuman effort in subhuman conditions to provide assistance to civilians.' He added: 'In the past month, we’ve seen families throughout Gaza, and particularly in the north, subjected to increasingly horrific conditions. This is a damning indictment of Israel’s failure to follow international humanitarian law and to respond to the critical and reasonable demands of its greatest ally, the United States. The consequences will be more innocent lives ended and destroyed. 'They should also include restrictions on Israel’s ability to continue prosecution of this war in a manner that is increasingly being seen as consistent with ethnic cleansing.' The report warns that with more than 2 million civilians in Gaza facing starvation, daily bombardments and lack of access to the basic necessities of life, the humanitarian situation in the territory is on the brink of catastrophe. 'There is no time to lose,' it concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVr0AcgOF4eBb	2024-11-12T15:40:05-08:00	
Canvas Of Diplomacy: How Art And Culture Shape Global Relations –...	In a globalized world, art and culture serve as powerful forms of communication and soft power. Nations employ cultural diplomacy, harnessing art, music, literature, and film to foster goodwill, build alliances, and bridge ideological divides. Beyond official diplomacy, art and culture influence how societies perceive each other, shaping international relations through public opinion, mutual respect, and shared values. This article dives into the nuanced ways in which art and culture impact international relations, from facilitating cross-cultural understanding to acting as subtle tools of influence and soft power. Art and Culture as Tools of Soft Power Soft power, a term popularized by political scientist Joseph Nye, refers to the ability of a country to shape the preferences of others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion. Art and culture play a central role in this process, as they offer avenues for countries to express their identities and values. Through cultural products such as music, film, and literature, nations present an idealized version of themselves, building a global image that fosters affinity and cooperation. For example, American pop culture has been instrumental in shaping perceptions of the United States as a land of opportunity and freedom. Hollywood films, jazz music, and fashion trends project an image that appeals to youth and progressive thinkers worldwide. Similarly, Japan's post-World War II recovery saw the export of cultural phenomena such as manga, anime, and culinary traditions, contributing to Japan's modern image as a technologically advanced and culturally rich nation. Cultural Diplomacy: Bridging Divides and Building Alliances Governments increasingly recognize the value of cultural diplomacy in forging stronger international ties. Cultural exchanges, art exhibitions, language programs, and festivals promote cross-cultural understanding, fostering goodwill that can ease diplomatic tensions. For instance, the Goethe-Institut, Alliance Française, and the British Council are state-funded organizations that promote German, French, and British cultures, respectively, around the world. These organizations provide language classes, fund art exhibits, and organize cultural events to foster understanding and cooperation. During the Cold War, cultural diplomacy played a crucial role in U.S.-Soviet relations. The U.S. State Department funded jazz tours in Eastern Europe, using American music to counter Soviet propaganda and humanize Americans in the eyes of communist societies. Similarly, the Soviet Union promoted ballet, classical music, and literature as symbols of its cultural sophistication, hoping to win the hearts and minds of audiences in the West. By focusing on shared cultural values, these initiatives sought to lessen ideological divides, creating points of contact that would be difficult to establish through traditional diplomacy. Art and Culture in Public Diplomacy: Shaping National Image Public diplomacy uses art and culture to reach foreign populations, presenting a favorable image of a country to build mutual understanding and respect. This form of diplomacy is increasingly essential in a digital age, where information—and disinformation—spreads rapidly. For instance, South Korea's government actively supports the global spread of K-pop, fashion, and Korean drama, cultivating a positive international image known as the 'Korean Wave' or Hallyu. Through entertainment, South Korea has attracted millions of fans globally, fostering a youth-driven affinity for Korean culture that enhances its diplomatic relationships. China's Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture abroad, are another example. While some view these institutes with suspicion, seeing them as a tool for political influence, they offer many people around the world their first exposure to Chinese history, art, and philosophy. This mix of education and cultural immersion can soften perceptions of China, presenting it as a nation with a rich, centuries-old civilization and promoting cooperation on issues like trade and education. The Role of Art in Cross-Cultural Understanding Artistic exchanges and collaborations provide opportunities for countries to understand each other's perspectives and values. When people engage with foreign art, literature, or film, they gain insights into the cultural context and worldview of the artists, building empathy and reducing stereotypes. For instance, African art exhibitions in Europe and North America have exposed global audiences to diverse African cultural expressions, challenging reductive narratives of Africa as a monolithic entity. Literature, in particular, has been a powerful force in fostering cross-cultural understanding. Writers like Chinua Achebe, Haruki Murakami, and Gabriel García Márquez have captivated readers globally, offering perspectives on Nigerian, Japanese, and Latin American life, respectively. By reading stories that reflect the values, struggles, and triumphs of different societies, audiences around the world develop a more nuanced understanding of these cultures, which can influence how they view these nations on the world stage. Art as Protest and Political Commentary: A Double-Edged Sword While art and culture can promote understanding, they also serve as vehicles for political critique and resistance. Artists often address themes of oppression, human rights, and political freedom, challenging authoritarian governments and exposing social injustices. Art that critiques state policies or champions minority rights can resonate internationally, creating solidarity movements and putting pressure on governments to uphold democratic values. One example is the influence of Soviet dissident art during the Cold War. Writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and artists like Marc Chagall challenged Soviet repression, influencing international views of the USSR. In modern times, artists like Ai Weiwei have used their work to critique Chinese government policies, drawing attention to issues of censorship and human rights in China. Such art has become a diplomatic issue, as countries hosting dissident exhibitions can strain relations with the artist's home country. Music as a Unifying Force and Cultural Ambassador Music, as a universal language, has a unique ability to connect people across cultural divides. Jazz, rock, and hip-hop have become globally popular, bridging gaps and creating shared experiences. During the Cold War, jazz was used as a diplomatic tool, with musicians like Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie performing worldwide to embody American ideals of freedom and creativity. More recently, hip-hop has emerged as a voice for youth globally, with artists in countries like France, Brazil, and South Africa using the genre to address social and political issues. Cultural exchanges in music have also fostered collaborations between nations. In the Middle East, for example, programs that bring Western musicians together with local artists help to build mutual respect and understanding. Such musical diplomacy initiatives foster goodwill, allowing nations to connect on a human level, beyond politics. Cinema and Media: Shaping Global Perceptions Film and television have a far-reaching impact on international relations, as they reach global audiences and shape perceptions of foreign cultures. Hollywood, for example, has long played a role in portraying American society and values, sometimes reinforcing stereotypes but also celebrating the diversity and resilience of American life. Films like Schindler's List, The Kite Runner, and Slumdog Millionaire have raised awareness of historical events, cultural practices, and social issues, influencing how audiences perceive different nations and inspiring empathy. Non-Western cinema also shapes international perceptions. Indian Bollywood films, known for their vibrant storytelling, have gained popularity in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, building a cultural bridge between India and these regions. Iranian cinema, with directors like Abbas Kiarostami and Asghar Farhadi, has won international acclaim for its storytelling, offering viewers a glimpse into Iranian society and countering simplistic narratives about the country. Cultural Festivals and International Showcases Cultural festivals offer platforms for countries to showcase their art, music, food, and traditions, providing audiences a firsthand experience of diverse cultures. Events like the Edinburgh International Festival, Venice Biennale, and Cannes Film Festival serve as hubs for cultural exchange, where artists, critics, and audiences from around the world come together. These festivals foster dialogue and mutual understanding, allowing countries to celebrate their heritage while contributing to global cultural discourse. Sports events, such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, also play a significant role in cultural diplomacy. While primarily athletic competitions, these events allow nations to display their cultural heritage on a global stage, as seen in the elaborate opening ceremonies that showcase art, dance, and music. Hosting these events gives countries a chance to enhance their international image and foster pride and unity among their citizens. The Digital Age: Art, Culture, and the Internet's Role in Diplomacy In the digital age, social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok allow artists and cultural influencers to reach global audiences instantly. Cultural diplomacy has taken on new dimensions as individuals, rather than governments, become ambassadors of their culture, sharing their art, traditions, and perspectives with the world. For example, TikTok has popularized K-pop dance challenges, bringing Korean music to millions of people and furthering South Korea's cultural influence. Digital art exhibitions and virtual museums, which became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, allow people worldwide to access art and culture, democratizing cultural diplomacy. Online collaborations between artists from different countries also foster cross-cultural exchange, as creators share ideas, techniques, and themes that reflect their unique cultural contexts. Conclusion Art and culture profoundly impact international relations by shaping perceptions, building alliances, and fostering understanding. Whether through public diplomacy, cultural exchanges, or digital media, the power of art and culture extends beyond national borders, influencing how societies view each other and interact on the global stage. As technology advances, the reach of cultural diplomacy will only grow, offering new opportunities to connect across divides, promote mutual respect, and find common ground in a diverse and interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfrlHnSWGDEcJz-NZWV9yh7	2024-11-12T08:59:22-08:00	
Tajikistan’s High-Level Round Table At The European Parliament: U...	On November 19, 2024, the 'Tajikistan High-Level Round Table' will take place at the European Parliament. The Tajik government, highly concerned with the climate crisis, aims to engage Europeans in the fight against climate change and to address the melting glaciers in Tajikistan, which also affect neighboring countries. Tajikistan, a land of glaciers and mountains, is facing a climate crisis. Over the past 40 years, Tajikistan has lost more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers, with harmful consequences for the entire Central Asian region, as noted by Deputy Director of the Hydrometeorology Agency of Tajikistan, Karimjon Abduhalimov, at the 2019 Central Asia Climate Change Conference (CACCC-2019) in Uzbekistan. The Country Needs Help President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan proposes establishing an international fund for glacier protection and declaring 2025 the International Year of Glaciers. During his speech at the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2024, President Rahmon emphasized the importance of uniting the international community to ensure security, maintain stability, and achieve sustainable development. With the scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) affirming climate change, it is hopeful to see heads of state aware of this urgent global issue. In parallel, Rahmon emphasized his country’s unwavering support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tajikistan, a mountainous Central Asian country, is particularly sensitive to climate change and directly impacted by global warming. Research shows that both the Tajik population and government are highly aware of climate change issues. Tajikistan is a partner country of the EU, and aligns with the EU on several issues. Despite the crises and rising extremism across its border with Afghanistan, Tajikistan rejects extremism and refuses any engagement with the Taliban. Although the two countries share a similar language, related to Persian—one of the oldest Indo-European languages—Tajikistan remains hostile to the Taliban. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit held in Dushanbe on September 16-17, President Rahmon denounced the Taliban’s 'medieval Sharia' and expressed concern over the potential spread of their 'destructive ideas in the region.' This alignment with the EU is particularly beneficial for both sides, especially on environmental and climate issues. EU Interest in Climate Change Mitigation The EU is particularly attentive to climate change and aims to help developing and underdeveloped countries face climate risks. The EU intends to support the Tajik government’s efforts to address climate change. Tajikistan also faces other environmental challenges, such as land degradation, water shortages, and rising temperatures. The EU’s engagement with Tajikistan has grown significantly since the country’s independence in 1991. The foundation of EU-Tajikistan relations is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), effective since 2010. In early 2023, the EU and Tajikistan began negotiations on an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA). Regionally, At the regional level, the Republic of Tajikistan is a partner in the EU’s Central Asia Strategy, adopted in June 2019. This strategy outlines the overall cooperation objectives and priorities for EU engagement in the region, focusing on promoting resilience, prosperity, and regional cooperation in Central Asia. Enhancing resilience also means enabling the region to cope with climate change. The EU’s cooperation with Tajikistan for the 2021-2027 period will build on past achievements in key areas such as health, public financial management, water, energy, and agriculture, while expanding support for empowering SMEs, greening the economy, and reducing disaster risks. Water is a particularly critical issue for Tajikistan. The EU’s bilateral development assistance allocation for the 2021-2024 period amounts to €91 million. Three priority areas have been identified for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Indicative Programme: Inclusive Green and Digital Economy; Human Development; and Natural Resources Management, Efficiency, and Resilience. Many glaciers cover the high altitudes of the Pamirs, including the longest glacier outside the polar regions, the Fedchenko Glacier, which stretches over 70 km and has an estimated depth of 800 meters. The Tajik Pamirs thus contain a massive water reservoir for Central Asia, feeding the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers—key contributors to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. Eastern Pamir is dominated by a high, arid plateau with tall mountains at an average altitude of 4,420 meters (ranging from 2,970 to 7,130 meters), while Western Pamir features high, steep valleys with an average altitude of 4,060 meters (ranging from 900 to 7,490 meters). According to the World Bank, Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central Asia and Europe, with significant temperature variations between high and low altitudes. Six percent of Tajikistan’s territory is covered in glaciers. Located at the edge of the Pamir Mountains, the country has lost 'more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers [out of over 200,000 glaciers worldwide]' in the past 40 years, as lamented by the President. This glacier melt will impact all countries in Central Asia. In conclusion, The climate issues to be discussed with the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs will therefore be key points for both Central Asian countries and the rest of the world.

NATO Secretary General And President Macron Discuss Defence Produ...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and President Emmanuel Macron discussed on Tuesday (12 November) the need to step up support for Ukraine, ramp up defence production and boost transatlantic defence industrial cooperation. During his first official visit to Paris since taking office, the Secretary General highlighted the importance of France’s high-end military capabilities and skilled armed forces for the collective security of the Alliance. They discussed the need for increased defence investment and robust transatlantic cooperation to ensure the Alliance’s lasting security. 'The more we spend on defence, the more we reduce the risk of future conflict,' said Rutte. Mr. Rutte and President Macron also discussed the need for more support for Ukraine ahead of what could be its harshest winter, as Russia relentlessly targets its energy infrastructure. Mr Rutte commended France for training and equipping an entire Ukrainian brigade, the Anne of Kyiv Brigade, and for its pledge to send Mirage fighter jets early next year. 'France has delivered advanced artillery guns, air defence systems, cruise missiles, and armoured vehicles,' he said. The Secretary General also raised concerns about deepening military ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, which pose a threat to European security and global peace. Prior to his meeting with the French President, the Secretary General visited the factory floor of the French defence industry company Thales Group. During the visit, Mr Rutte met with young talents and engineers developing cutting-edge capabilities for NATO Allies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiVKazl6QtDd	2024-11-12T08:54:38-08:00	
How Political Psychology And Political Economy Shape Great Power ...	Great power politics has long been influenced by a complex interrelationship of psychological motivations and economic interests. Political psychology delves into how perceptions, biases, and ideologies drive the decisions of leaders and nations, while political economy analyzes how resources, trade dynamics, and economic policies define power relations and influence global strategies. Together, these disciplines illuminate the underlying forces shaping the ambitions, rivalries, and alliances that characterize great power politics, offering insights into the strategies employed by nations in pursuit of dominance and security. The Historical Roots of Power and Psychology Historically, great power dynamics have been influenced by both psychological and economic factors. The realpolitik approach, often attributed to Niccolò Machiavelli and Otto von Bismarck, emphasized power and pragmatism, grounded in a psychological understanding of self-interest and survival. Leaders like Bismarck strategically used economic power to consolidate alliances and counter rivals, illustrating how psychological acumen and economic prowess have been central to maintaining influence. The 20th-century Cold War era further underscores the impact of political psychology and economy on great power behavior. The ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union was driven by psychological elements, such as the fear of mutually assured destruction, as well as economic competition for influence through development aid and trade agreements with allied nations. This bipolar rivalry illustrates how deeply psychological and economic factors define not only bilateral relations but also the alignment of third-party states. Economic Power as a Tool of Influence In contemporary great power politics, economic influence has become a primary tool for projecting power and securing alliances. Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power' highlights how economic strategies—such as trade agreements, investment in infrastructure, and economic aid—allow nations to shape global politics without direct military intervention. For example, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not only an economic venture but a geopolitical strategy aimed at extending influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Through the BRI, China is both satisfying economic interests and shaping global political alignments, reflecting the dual role of political psychology and economy in its international strategy. Economic sanctions, as employed by the United States and European Union against rivals, further demonstrate how political economy intersects with psychological tactics. Sanctions leverage economic interdependence to coerce states into policy changes without armed conflict, capitalizing on the psychological pressures of financial distress and the fear of isolation. This tool exemplifies how economic measures can target the psychological resilience of a state, aiming to weaken morale and create internal political pressure. Psychological Drivers Behind Strategic Decision-Making The psychological dimension of great power politics often centers on national identity, prestige, and the perceived need for security. Leaders of great powers are often influenced by cognitive biases, such as prospect theory, which suggests that decision-makers prioritize avoiding losses over achieving equivalent gains. This loss aversion often drives states to maintain aggressive foreign policies and resist changes that could diminish their status, even if such strategies are costly. For example, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, despite economic sanctions, reflects a decision driven by national identity and loss aversion, prioritizing historical ties and strategic interests over economic concerns. National identity and status are also critical psychological drivers. Research on social identity theory, initially introduced by Henri Tajfel, reveals how groups define themselves by distinguishing from 'others.' In great power politics, this translates to a pursuit of status and recognition on the global stage. For instance, the United States and China often engage in psychological signaling, each promoting its system—democracy versus authoritarian capitalism—as superior, while vying for leadership in global organizations such as the United Nations and World Health Organization. Geopolitical Rivalries and Economic Competition Economic competition among great powers fuels rivalries, with political economy playing a significant role in shaping alliances, trade policies, and resource control. The competition for technological supremacy in fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing illustrates how economic power underpins geopolitical influence. Countries like the United States and China invest heavily in technology, viewing it as both an economic asset and a strategic advantage in intelligence, defense, and economic productivity. The rivalry over rare earth minerals—a key resource for advanced electronics and green technology—further highlights the strategic value of economic assets in great power competition. As China controls the majority of rare earth production, other powers like the United States, Japan, and the European Union are developing policies to diversify their supply chains. This competition reflects not only economic interests but also psychological dimensions of distrust, competition, and a desire for security against supply disruptions. The Role of Domestic Political Psychology in Shaping Foreign Policy Domestic public opinion and national sentiment significantly impact great power politics. Leaders often cater to domestic psychological pressures, such as nationalism, to gain public support for foreign policy initiatives. Graham Allison's concept of the 'Thucydides Trap' argues that rising powers (like China) and established powers (like the United States) are prone to conflict due to mutual distrust and competition. These psychological underpinnings shape how domestic politics influence foreign policy, as leaders seek to rally public support by framing rival states as threats to national security and identity. Elections and political cycles also affect great power behavior. Politicians often adopt aggressive foreign policies to appeal to nationalist sentiments during elections, creating short-term escalations in global politics. This tendency is evident in both democracies and authoritarian regimes, where leaders seek to unify public opinion through foreign policy stances that emphasize strength and resilience. Psychological Warfare and Strategic Communication Psychological operations and information warfare are increasingly central to great power conflicts. Disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage, and propaganda exploit cognitive biases, shaping public opinion and undermining adversaries' social cohesion. Russia's use of information warfare in the 2016 U.S. election demonstrates how psychological tactics can influence the political landscape of rival states, destabilizing them from within. China's media influence in Africa and Asia also exemplifies psychological tactics in geopolitical strategy. By controlling narratives through state-run media, China seeks to shape perceptions of its leadership model, challenging Western influence in developing regions. Such psychological strategies complement economic investments, aiming to foster positive public sentiment and political support in strategically valuable regions. Conclusion The relationship between political psychology and political economy is central to understanding the complexities of great power politics. Psychological factors such as identity, status, and perception of threats drive strategic decisions, while economic assets and policies provide the means to execute these strategies. As global power dynamics continue to shift, the convergence of political psychology and economy will remain essential in shaping the behavior and ambitions of great powers, underscoring the enduring connection between the human psyche, economic interests, and the pursuit of global influence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiYmEnCHkSAu	2024-11-12T08:53:22-08:00	
Oil Demand Forecasts And The Future Of The Middle East – OpEd	World oil consumption has increased by nearly 10 percent over the past decade, reaching 4.5 billion tons last year. (1) This performance was achieved despite a 9 percent drop in 2020 due to the pandemic. Considering that the growth rate in the preceding decade was roughly the same, it is hard to say that global consumption shows signs of slowing. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) disagrees. (2) According to its recently published World Energy Outlook 2024 report, (3) global oil consumption will peak in the next 10 years and then start to decline. Moreover, this is the agency’s most optimistic forecast. The report also includes two disaster scenarios for the oil industry: In the first scenario, if governments fulfill their climate commitments to the United Nations, oil consumption will fall by almost 50 percent in just 15 years. In the second, if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions target by 2050, then consumption 15 years from now will be less than half of today’s level. According to this Paris-based organization, the era of fossil fuels is nearing its end. The momentum behind the transition to clean energy is so strong that global demand for coal, oil, and natural gas has begun to fall rapidly. The agency bases its view on oil mainly on the slowdown in Chinese consumption and the acceleration of electric vehicle sales. However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecasts paint a completely different picture. OPEC insists that global oil demand will continue to grow at least until 2050 and that the peak is nowhere in sight. (4) Moreover, it regards the IEA’s forecasts as fantasies (5) that have no connection with reality and even considers them dangerous. (6) Consequently, it seems highly unlikely that these two organizations will be able to reach an agreement on the future of oil. However, the question of which side is right is of vital importance for oil-producing countries, especially for those in the Middle East, one of the hottest regions in the world today. Most countries in this region, which hosts the world's largest oil reserves, have economies heavily dependent on this fuel, with oil exports accounting for a significant portion of both their budgets and national income. For instance, oil revenues contribute around 40 percent to Iraq and Kuwait's GDP, over 20 percent for Saudi Arabia and Oman, and around 20 percent for Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. (7) Therefore, considering their high levels of dependence on oil, it would not be an exaggeration to say that these countries could face existential challenges if even the most optimistic forecasts of the IEA come true. Middle Eastern countries, aware of the risks posed to them by the transformation process from fossil fuels to cleaner sources, are taking measures to ease the transition and are making plans to survive in a low-carbon future. To this end, they are trying to take part in all kinds of projects aimed at restructuring supply chains and seeking strategic partnerships amid global power struggles. However, it is difficult to say that all countries in the region are successful in this regard, and they are the ones that should be most concerned about the approaching danger. It is clear that oil demand estimates are creating significant tension in the Middle East. Now the question is: Which of the two organizations will be proven right? Will it be the IEA, a creation of the Western bloc led by the US following the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, which is now accused of manipulating the process with analyses tailored to the bloc's interests? Or will it be the OPEC, an organization established to manage global oil supply and wholly dedicated to the interests of exporting nations? We can foresee that the increasingly visible energy transition will heighten tensions in the region and that much harder times are coming for the geography. Moreover, if the IEA proves to be right in the forecasting wars, it would not be a prophecy to say that the geopolitical balances in the Middle East will be turned upside down within a few years, leaving those relying on today’s status quo on the losing side.

Iran’s Military-Security Budget To Increase By 200 Percent – OpEd	In conjunction with the ratification of Iranian regime President Masoud Pezeshkian’s budget proposal in parliament, the spokesperson for the government announced that the country’s military budget would see a 200 percent increase. She stated, 'Every effort has been made to address the country’s defense needs, with special attention given to this matter; consequently, the military budget will experience a 200 percent increase.' This increase effectively triples the military budget of the clerical regime. Economist Ahmad Alavi views the 2025 budget as rooted in rent distribution among the nation’s political and economic players. One defining feature of Iran’s economy is the divide between inclusive organizations, which promote economic growth and development, and extractive institutions, which function to capture rents and serve the interests of a small elite, the oligarchy that holds power. A significant portion of the budget is allocated to institutions controlled by oligarchs, power factions, and groups close to the regime. These institutions include large foundations and economic enterprises such as the 'Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order' foundation, and Astan Quds Razavi, which are tax-exempt or evade taxes and operate under the direct supervision of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. These entities benefit from state funds, part of which they direct towards commercial, political, and religious activities without significant economic returns for society. Additionally, substantial budget allocations go to military and security entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), IRGC Basij forces, and affiliated propaganda, religious, and quasi-political organizations. Such allocations align with the theory of extractive institutions, where resources are used not for infrastructure or production, but to strengthen political control and influence. A Quarter of the Budget Directed Toward Military and Suppression Forces Research by Iran Open Data Center shows that this year, the direct budget for armed forces, including the Ministry of Defense, the Army, the IRGC, and the police, has reached at least 7.22 quadrillion rials. This amount is allocated not only within the main budget lines but also from crude oil revenue. In the 2023 budget, military appropriations totaled 5.25 quadrillion rials. Oil Sales to Fund Military-Security Expenditures According to Clause B of Exemption Four, 1.37 quadrillion rials’ worth of crude oil is allocated to the armed forces under the heading 'strengthening defense capability.' In addition, 1.8 billion euros in crude oil is earmarked for 'special projects' for the military, but due to its confidentiality, little information is available. Thus, as outlined in Budget Table 21 for 2024, the armed forces will receive over 2.53 quadrillion rials from oil quotas. In his continued pursuit of warmongering policies, Khamenei stated, 'The quality of expressing the nation’s power and will must be determined by the officials, and what is in the nations and country’s best interest must be done.' This anti-people policy is clearly reflected in Pezeshkian’s government military budget. On October 29, Euronews reported that the budget allocated to Iran’s military forces next year is expected to be around 2.17 quadrillion rials. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Iran’s regime spent $10.3 billion on military expenses in 2023. The IRGC’s share of total military expenditures in 2019 was about 27 percent, rising to 37 percent in 2023. According to Clause One, Exemption Three of the 2025 budget proposal of the 11.96 quadrillion rials in revenue from crude oil, gas, and condensate exports, 5.61 quadrillion rials will be allocated to the armed forces to 'strengthen defense capability.' This amount is four times the oil quota allocated to the armed forces in the 2024 budget. In addition, another 1.26 quadrillion rials is earmarked as 'other allocations for specific projects,' likely distributed among military and security institutions. In defense of the budget proposal, Pezeshkian said: 'We obtained permission from the supreme leader to use some foreign exchange, usually reserved mid-year to cover deficits and address social protests.' Despite severe concerns within the regime about uprisings by millions of impoverished citizens, budgetary imbalances and deficits have left no other options for the people than rising prices, inflation, and worsening poverty. Final uprisings soon are inevitable and unavoidable. Increased pressure on the suffering people will pave the way for the courageous and aware youth of Iran to rise until the flames of their struggle engulf the oppressors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTv9eaE-o_WFl	2024-11-12T08:48:36-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory And The Iranian Regime’s Concerns Over His...	Contrary to polls and predictions that anticipated a tight race between the Democratic and Republican candidates, Donald Trump made a historic return to the White House by defeating his opponent, Kamala Harris, Vice President under President Joe Biden. According to CNN’s exit polls, slightly over half of voters preferred Trump over Harris for economic management, with 31% of voters identifying it as their top issue. Following the announcement of Trump’s victory and his return to the White House, Iran’s currency, the Rial (Iran currency) hit a record low. Speculations about the impact of Trump’s second term on Iran largely stem from his policies during his previous presidency, which included 'maximum pressure' on Iran. These policies could mean additional sanctions and heightened military tensions. On Thursday evening, October 7, Brian Hook, former head of the 'Iran Action Group' in Trump’s previous administration, accused the Biden administration in a CNN interview of seeking 'compromise with the Iranian regime,' which he claimed has led to a 'failure of deterrence policy.' The former U.S. envoy on Iran emphasized that Trump understands that the primary source of instability in the Middle East today is the Iranian regime.' But 'Trump has no interest in regime change' in Tehran but is focused on isolating and weakening the Islamic Republic. He also stated that Trump’s 'Peace Plan' for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, known as the 'Deal of the Century,' is likely to return to the table. With Trump’s return, Iran’s state-controlled media have acknowledged that the various crises confronting the Iranian regime, including economic turmoil and social discontent, will intensify. This time, however, the situation is markedly different from Trump’s first term. The regime is grappling with a severe economic crisis, having withstood two nationwide uprisings demanding its overthrow, with no end to the economic crisis in sight. The escalating conflict with Israel, efforts to dismantle Iran’s regional proxies, and attempts to acquire nuclear weapons as a survival guarantee have raised global concern. On Thursday, November 7, the newspaper Ham-Mihan noted: 'Iran’s economy today in November 2024 is weaker than in 2018. The internal challenges and crises we have faced are now more extensive than ever. According to our foreign minister, international conditions are vastly different from the period when the JCPOA was signed and subsequently abandoned by Trump. We are dealing with the fallout from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and issues between Iran and the West have become more complicated over the past six years. There is no short- or medium-term solution in sight. Hardliners are trying to promote BRICS as a substitute for addressing Iran’s sanctions issues, but even the most optimistic experts believe it will take decades for BRICS to yield significant results. At least two of its most influential members, China and India, remain among the top ten U.S. trading partners.' Donald Trump's potential policies may follow the same path as his previous term but with greater intensity and a focus on threats beyond Iran’s nuclear program. Trump’s policies toward Iran were based on maximum pressure and targeting Iran's oil revenues, which in 2020 reduced Iran’s oil exports to an unprecedented level. These policies would likely be repeated in a new term with a stronger emphasis on economic pressure and limiting Iran’s regional influence and its support for proxy groups. Given that Trump and his team see the Iranian regime as the 'axis of evil' in the Middle East, the focus of their policies could be on Iran's nuclear threat and its regional policies and support for armed groups and militias. The goal of these actions could be an attempt to isolate the regime and weaken its bases of influence and survival in the region, which, according to some analysts, could lead to internal weakening of the regime and make it more vulnerable to domestic protests and organized resistance. Trump and his team would likely use stronger sanctions and a more extensive crackdown on Iran's oil trade and its supporters to push Iran into the most restricted economic and strategic position possible. These pressures, disregarding new regional conditions and developments, would pose a serious challenge for Iran and might lead to responses and decisions from Iran. In this regard The Wall Street Journal wrote: Donald Trump intends to significantly increase sanctions against Iran and reduce the country’s oil sales. His new team will quickly move to choke off Iran's oil revenue, including targeting ports and foreign traders handling Iranian oil.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXvSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-12T08:44:11-08:00	
COP29: Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter Publishes Its First Repo...	The Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) published on November 11, its Baseline Report, setting a foundation to help prioritize and track progress on emissions reductions made by the 54 oil and gas companies - representing almost 45% of the global oil production, that have signed up to the Charter’s ambitions. These ambitions include to work toward net-zero operations by 2050, near-zero upstream methane emissions and zero routine flaring by 2030 in addition to measuring and publicly reporting progress towards meeting OGDC’s goals. The publication of the Baseline Report is a key milestone for OGDC that sets out the work achieved in the first year since the initiative was launched at COP28. In the past 12 months, OGDC has established a governance framework and launched a survey to determine signatories’ emissions reduction ambitions and implementation plans to set a baseline to track future progress. OGDC has also implemented a Collaborate & Share program to disseminate solutions, promote peer-to-peer collaboration and encourage the adoption of best practices to reduce emissions. In a sign of a positive momentum, the initiative has also attracted three new members, with Oil India Limited, PetroChina and Vår Energi joining. 'We are proud of the 54 companies that have already signed up to the Charter and are encouraged by the extent of their engagement in this first major piece of work that helps to establish a base on which to build future success,' OGDC’s three CEO Champions and founding members – Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) CEO Sultan Al Jaber, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser and TotalEnergies Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné, said in a joint statement. 'Each company is at a different phase of the decarbonization journey. For some, the Charter reflects existing commitments and aligns with pledges already made via other initiatives. For others, it marks their first steps toward climate action.' 'The diverse nature of our signatories is an opportunity as well as a challenge. Each company brings different experiences, capabilities, stakeholders and national circumstances. Signatories will have the opportunity to learn from the best practices and insights of peers from a wide range of backgrounds and from across the globe,' the CEOs said. OGDC’s Charter Baselining Survey found that the majority of signatories are already consistent with the Charter’s ambitions for net zero operations by 2050, and goals to reduce methane emissions to near zero and eliminate flaring by 2030. Gaps identified in the survey will help prioritize support and knowledge transfer from companies with relevant experience. The survey also found that a majority of the signatories already report on their greenhouse gas emissions, though there is a need for common standards and methodologies to establish a robust reporting framework for the group. According to the survey, most of the signatories are already investing in the energy systems of the future, including renewable energy, energy storage, low-carbon fuels, hydrogen, methane abatement, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and carbon removals technologies, and plan to increase investments. Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, the head of the OGDC Secretariat said: 'A survey of oil and gas industry climate performance has never been attempted on this scale. Participants ranged from companies that pioneered decarbonization decades ago to those still in the early phases – all with different capabilities and reporting methods. The lessons learned will be used to improve reporting visibility and data quality and to create more targeted programs.' This baselining survey sets the foundation for the collective work ahead: over the next year, OGDC will focus on providing the resources and guidance the signatories need to reduce their GHG emissions, methane emissions and flaring. OGDC will also help signatories to shape their net-zero roadmaps and develop emissions reporting to ensure progress can be tracked and to demonstrate how collective action can deliver positive climate impact on a global scale.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsVKTEsRjnGi	2024-11-12T08:38:01-08:00	
Collective Actions On Climate Change Urgent Instead Of Empty Prom...	The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on climate change, was signed on January 11, 1997 in Kyoto, Japan to limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Although the protocol entered into force in 2005, its achievement remains questionable. Many countries may be complacent that they have reduced carbon emissions. But from the review of the data, it is not seen anywhere, instead, many people have opined that the situation is getting worse day by day. Bill Clinton was the US president when the treaty was executed. He hailed it as an 'environmentally and economically robust deal'. But ironically, US lawmakers rejected the deal in the Senate, and Bill Clinton's successor, President George W. Bush, withdrew America's support for the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration has criticized the Kyoto Protocol, saying that 80 percent of the world's countries have been exempted from emission standards in the agreement. Also, there is a danger of economic damage to the United States due to this. Russia is a major power. According to Andrey Illaryonov, a former adviser to the country's President Vladimir Putin, since human civilization is now based on the use of hydrocarbons, the adoption of the Kyoto agreement could have a negative impact on the Russian economy. Several developed and developing countries are major sources of carbon dioxide emissions and have not imposed any restrictions on themselves. So Illarionov's comment regarding the Kyoto agreement is discriminatory. James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and distinguished climate scientist, claimed that the United Nations Climate Change Conference (including the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change—Cop 15 and Kyoto) held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, 7–18 December 2009 included the Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol) a 'farce'. He planned to boycott it. According to him, it is essentially trading in the name of emissions cap, known as 'cap and trade'. Here 'cap' refers to limiting or capping the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions. This is accomplished by issuing emission credits or carbon credits, where a certain amount of carbon dioxide is allowed to be emitted. According to Hansen, through this 'they are selling luxury'. Through this, developed countries are trying to absolve themselves of their responsibilities in exchange for giving small financial assistance to developing countries without reducing their own country's emissions. The issue is very much like 'killing a cow and donating shoes'. Hansen prefers and emphasizes the imposition of a 'carbon tax' rather than the 'cap and trade' of the Kyoto Protocol. Under his proposal, the tax would start at the equivalent of about $1 per gallon of gasoline, and the revenue collected would be returned directly to the public as a dividend against the carbon footprint. States signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have committed to reducing emissions but do not appear to be keeping them. For example, Japan's fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions have increased despite their strong commitment to this. Their use of coal has increased and although they have used various pollution control materials (offsets) to meet their objectives, these do not significantly reduce pollution. Greenhouse gases are no longer confined to the region or country from which they are emitted; Rather, they circulate in the atmosphere and spread everywhere. Therefore, not only high-emitting countries, but all countries worldwide must work to reduce emissions. Otherwise, the desired result will not be possible. The agreement appears to be following a few charts like many other agreements without encouraging any innovation in greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming. While the Kyoto Protocol emphasized carbon emissions, it did not mention any action on other serious air pollutants such as oxides of sulfur or oxides of nitrogen. Methane as a greenhouse gas causes various damages to the atmosphere, but the Kyoto Protocol does not provide any guidelines for its control. That's right, world leaders can meet once a year on the occasion of this protocol, as is the Conference of the Parties (COP), the 29th session of which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, November 11-22. There will be discussions for a few days; There will be some agreements and disagreements. There will be politics of blaming each other; Airplanes used to transport participants to the conference will emit huge amounts of environmentally damaging nitrogen oxide gas. Finally, there will be a lot of talk in the media; However, there will be little effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing global warming. It is only possible to get good results for all if any protocol is signed considering the global interest and not just the national interest based on the consensus of the states. If not, the climate change situation will become more dire due to global warming. Collective climate actions are urgent instead of empty promises.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsBbxmj5gdmq	2024-11-12T08:36:08-08:00	
Believing Bald-Face Lies – OpEd	We just finished another presidential election year. Never have there been more lies told by so many candidates at the federal, state, and local levels. Not the usual lies—the ones that candidates tell about themselves and their opponent. There is nothing new about that. The bald-face lies, the kinds of falsehoods that every sentient person knows is an obvious lie. The most disturbing aspect of this phenomenon is that it works; importantly, it is not confined to the political world. How is it possible to believe something that is manifestly false? Similarly, what motivates inveterate liars? Recently, the Drudge Report, a once popular news aggregate website, ran a headline on the front page saying, 'Tucker Carlson Claims Abortion Causes Hurricanes?' After checking the story, which was published by Mediaite, a left-wing outlet that seeks to discredit conservative voices, and reading what Carlson actually said, it was clear as a bell that he was mocking those who say hurricanes are caused by global warming. He said, sarcastically, 'No, it’s probably abortion.' Anyone fair-minded person would conclude that what Carlson said was in jest, but that’s not what was reported. Throughout this past year, reporters, media commentators and politicians said over and over again that late-term abortions were not legal under Roe v. Wade, and that it was simply not true that in some states there is no legal requirement mandating that medical personnel attend to babies who survive a botched abortion. As we, and others, pointed out, this was utterly false. The pro-abortion side simply lied. In October, we had a chance to fact check a 'fact checker' at the New York Times and found that the reporter left out the second part of a sentence from a Minnesota bill that she quoted. She did so purposely so as to make her point. Had she included the entire sentence, her position would have been proven wrong. After we took Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the cleaners for mocking the Eucharist, her press secretary said that the woman who feigned taking Communion (a Dorito was placed on her tongue by Whitmer) was not kneeling. That was a lie. She was not sitting on a couch, as they contended—she was kneeling. The picture proves it. After President Biden called Trump supporters 'garbage,' White House staff tried to alter his words. When the truth came out, the White House press secretary still said he never said such a thing, even though he was captured on tape saying exactly that. Why do these people lie when it is 100 percent certain that they have? Because they can get away with it. To be sure, when presented with the evidence, most people are instantly persuaded. But not all. There are those who, upon hearing prominent persons deny that what they said is a lie, are puzzled. They are no longer sure. That plays to the advantage of the liar because doubt has been instilled in their mind. In short, liars count on uncertainty—it mitigates the damage done. Why do people not trust their senses? Why are they unsure even when the facts are stacked against the liars? There have been plenty of psychological studies done on groupthink. Solomon Asch learned in the 1950s that group size has a significant impact on our tendency to conform. His experiments showed that approximately a third of the people are inclined to doubt their own conclusions if surrounded mostly by people who have reached a different conclusion. Conformity triumphs over truth. Daniel Kahneman found that groupthink occurs when people are presented with a perspective that is contrary to theirs and they buckle. Why don’t they standfast? They want to avoid conflict. Their desire for harmony overrides their willingness to express an independent thought. This is the psychological variant of the political reality found in Washington D.C. 'If you want to get along, go along.' The price that people pay for suppressing their conscience is evidently worth it. They reason that when in doubt, go with the flow. Unfortunately, this plays into the hands of those who intentionally seek to distort the truth—their goal is to escape the consequences of their lies. Regrettably, having succeeded in blunting the worst outcome, they are inspired to continue lying. They can always count on the doubters. The Communists in the last century liked to hold elections—even though they meant nothing—because they wanted to forge a sense of unity. They believed that if the people went through the motions and voted, it would convince them that they have a say in government. For some, it worked. Elite decision-makers in the democracies also want to get the masses onboard, so when their lies are challenged, they double-down with more lies. By planting the seeds of doubt, they can’t be held accountable. To lie is not to make a mistake. We mistakenly say something when we don’t have all the facts. To lie presumes we know the truth and choose not to acknowledge it. It’s even more diabolical when it is done to manipulate the public for self-serving purposes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvZwYJfkpHXD_	2024-11-12T08:34:27-08:00	
Bangladesh’s New Path Toward Sovereignty – OpEd	In recent years, the political landscape of South Asia has been marked by significant changes, with Bangladesh emerging as a focal point of regional dynamics. The discontent within Bangladesh regarding its previous government's perceived alignment with Indian interests has catalyzed a shift in alliances, fostering a desire for greater autonomy and justice. Bangladesh's quest to redefine its regional standing and enhance cooperation with countries like Pakistan signifies a transformative period, where historical grievances and demands for political reform are coming to the forefront of national discourse. For over a decade, Sheikh Hasina Wajid's government maintained a close relationship with India, often criticized as compromising Bangladesh’s national sovereignty. Allegations of human rights violations, including accusations of genocide and extrajudicial killings, have plagued her administration. With around 170 FIRs filed against her, the legal challenges faced by Sheikh Hasina have become a symbol of the broader struggle for justice in Bangladesh. The arrest of several close associates, coupled with the freezing of her family's financial accounts by the interim government, highlights the growing public discontent over the extensive influence exerted by India during her tenure. Many Bangladeshis view these measures as necessary steps toward restoring national integrity and addressing corruption rooted in foreign manipulation. The invitation extended by the interim government of Bangladesh to a fact-finding team from the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (UNCHR) is a pivotal move, signaling a commitment to transparency and justice. The UNCHR's independent investigation into alleged human rights abuses under the Indian-backed regime of Sheikh Hasina has been widely welcomed by the Bangladeshi populace. For many citizens, this represents an opportunity to expose the authoritarian tendencies of the previous administration and to shed light on the extent of external influence that dictated domestic policies. The public’s endorsement of this investigation reflects a broader societal desire for justice and a clear departure from the previous government's oppressive tactics. In a bold legislative move, the interim government of Bangladesh has abolished laws that previously provided additional security to the Mujib family, a decision seen as a stride toward genuine political reform. These reforms have been applauded by the public, who criticize the prior administration’s reliance on Indian support to maintain power, often at the expense of addressing the real needs of the people. Additionally, calls for constitutional reforms, including a potential ban on political parties implicated in human rights violations, have gained traction, signaling a turning point in the country’s political landscape. A significant development in the quest for autonomy was marked by the inauguration of the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters on October 6, 2024. The event, led by Chief Advisor Yunus, emphasized the increasing cooperation between the military and the interim government. It underscored the military’s renewed commitment to asserting its independence and distancing itself from previous external influences, particularly those of India. This shift reflects a growing sense of national pride and a determination to prioritize Bangladesh’s interests above foreign pressures. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, has found himself embroiled in serious allegations, prompting him to seek the assistance of a U.S. lobbying firm, Stryk Global Diplomacy. His decision to engage such services indicates a strategic attempt to influence U.S. policymakers and mitigate the political fallout from his actions. This maneuver illustrates the lengths to which individuals from the former regime are willing to go to maintain a favorable image on the international stage, despite growing domestic discontent. The diplomatic strain between India and Bangladesh has become increasingly apparent. India’s unilateral approach was highlighted during the 79th United Nations General Assembly, where it expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between the Chief Advisor Yunus and Prime Minister Modi. This incident underscored India’s reluctance to engage collaboratively with its neighbors, raising concerns about the sustainability of its regional diplomacy. Bangladesh's decision to recall its envoy from New Delhi was a stark demonstration of its frustration with India’s perceived interference in its internal affairs, signifying a broader diplomatic rift. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), heavily influenced by its Hindutva ideology, has been accused of attempting to manipulate Bangladesh’s political dynamics in favor of the Awami League. Such actions have further strained relations between the two nations, with Bangladesh voicing strong protests against inflammatory comments made by Indian officials regarding Bangladeshi nationals. This reaction from Bangladesh signals a growing commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty and resisting external pressures. Amid these tensions, Bangladesh and Pakistan have taken steps to rebuild their bilateral relationship, moving beyond past conflicts. During the 79th United Nations General Assembly, a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Advisor Yunus highlighted the potential for renewed cooperation, particularly in the context of reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The mutual endorsement of SAARC’s revival by both nations, along with support from Nepal, reflects a shared vision for enhanced regional collaboration and economic integration. In a positive move to facilitate trade, Bangladesh’s National Board of Revenue has lifted the requirement for 100% physical inspection of goods imported from Pakistan. This decision is expected to streamline trade operations and strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Furthermore, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has actively encouraged its students to explore educational opportunities in Pakistan, reflecting a renewed emphasis on fostering people-to-people connections. Looking ahead, diplomatic engagements are set to continue, with a high-level visit by a Chinese delegate, WuZ, to Pakistan scheduled for the last week of November 2024. Additionally, a constructive meeting between the Pakistani High Commissioner and the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary has laid the groundwork for an early Foreign Secretary-level dialogue, anticipated to take place in late November. These efforts indicate a shared commitment to overcoming historical grievances and working toward a more cooperative future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvfLJPAPE1F9h	2024-11-12T08:32:54-08:00	
Rethinking Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution: A Threat To Unity – OpEd	The Constitution of 1973 was conceived as a symbol of optimism for Pakistan, with the objective of guaranteeing the fulfillment of every citizen's needs and ensuring the impeccable governance of the state. Nevertheless, over the years, what was designed to be a resilient framework for governance has, regrettably, established a foundation for the infringement of citizens' rights and ensuing political turmoil. Pakistan continues to be ensnared in a difficulty from which it has found it exceedingly challenging to extricate itself. Should one endeavour to identify the deficiencies, it would be hard to discover a starting point. Nonetheless, several of the most pivotal concerns that have undermined the state's foundation encompass the Senate’s impotence, the problematic integration of the legislative and executive branches, and the persistent ambiguity regarding whether Pakistan constitutes a theocratic or secular state. A prominent concern regarding the 1973 Constitution is the Senate's lack of authority. In a heterogeneous nation such as Pakistan, the Senate ought to function as a vital institution that safeguards minority rights and mitigates feelings of 'us versus them.' Regrettably, the Senate of Pakistan is incapacitated. The indirect election of its members results in the Senate failing to genuinely reflect the popular will. Instead, the political consensus among these members frequently serves the interests of a select few rather than the broader electorate. This situation has significant ramifications, especially when agreements established with other nations are not ratified by the Senate, thereby effectively muting minority voices within their own territories. Compounding this issue, the practice of joint sittings in Parliament constitutes an obvious transgression of the rights of smaller factions, thereby exacerbating the dynamics of 'in-groups and out-groups.' This political disarray is further exacerbated by the executive’s disregard for Senate ratification in critical organizational appointments, culminating in bias and controversy, exemplified by the recent contention surrounding the PML (N)’s rejection of Justice Umar Ata Bandial’s adjudication. Further complicating the situation is the amalgamation of the legislative and executive branches, which has derailed Pakistan’s political framework. Despite being a multiethnic state, Pakistan has adopted a parliamentary system of governance that is inadequately suited for such diversity. The 'Contempt of Parliament Bill 2023' and modifications to the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) powers serve as salient examples of legislation aimed at consolidating control. This centralization of power within a singular political party also diminishes patriotism among minorities, who increasingly perceive themselves as marginalized from the political arena. Another crucial concern arising from the 1973 Constitution is the ambiguity regarding Pakistan's classification as either a theocratic or a secular state. This ambiguity has engendered extensive repercussions, particularly in the process of selecting members for the Islamic Advisory Council. The appointment of these members is executed by the President upon the counsel of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The representation of all sectarian factions within this council is not guaranteed, resulting in the marginalization of specific communities. This situation exerts a considerable impact on the legislative process, effectively denying certain groups their religious or civil rights. The 1973 Constitution, transcending its mere status as a document, was intended to serve as the bedrock upon which the state of Pakistan could thrive and prosper. However, a fragile foundation is inherently incapable of sustaining itself over time. As time progresses, it becomes increasingly imperative for Pakistan to confront the deficiencies inherent in its Constitution. The Senate must be endowed with the authority to authentically reflect the populace's will, the merger of the legislative and executive branches necessitates re-evaluation, and the ambiguity surrounding Pakistan's identity as either a theocratic or secular state must be elucidated.

Pakistan: A Blueprint For Gilgit-Baltistan’s Untapped Potential –...	The rugged beauty of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), often called the 'Crown of Pakistan,' has long captivated those fortunate enough to glimpse its stunning landscapes. But for decades, this scenic region has languished on the margins of national development. Now, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership, a decisive shift is underway—one that could chart a course for Gilgit-Baltistan’s transformation into a regional powerhouse of infrastructure, energy, education, and economic opportunity. Prime Minister Sharif’s recent visit to the region was more than a ceremonial gesture. It marked the launch of a new era for GB, as the federal government sets its sights on addressing the region’s chronic underdevelopment. In a series of high-profile announcements, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stones for a raft of large-scale projects that promise to reshape GB’s economic future—from energy and infrastructure to tourism and education. These initiatives represent a long-overdue effort to harness the region's immense potential, not just for its residents, but for the country as a whole. At the core of PM Sharif’s vision for Gilgit-Baltistan is a fundamental belief: infrastructure and energy capacity are the key to unlocking its full potential. For too long, the region has been hobbled by a lack of modern infrastructure, energy shortfalls, and limited access to education. But the government’s ambitious new investments aim to change that. Roads, bridges, and digital connectivity are now at the heart of a national development agenda that could propel GB into a new era of prosperity. One of the most significant aspects of the Prime Minister’s visit was the announcement of two major hydropower projects. These initiatives will add critical capacity to the region’s power grid, addressing the perennial energy shortages that have plagued the area for years. Additionally, the Prime Minister revealed plans for a 100-megawatt solar project, set to be completed within the year. These steps are not just about meeting local energy demands—they are investments in the long-term sustainability of the region’s growth, creating a robust energy infrastructure capable of supporting industrial and economic expansion for decades to come. Equally vital to GB’s future is its road and transport infrastructure. In a region as geographically challenging as GB, effective roads and highways are essential to connect communities, facilitate trade, and unlock the area’s tourism potential. During his visit, Sharif highlighted the critical role tourism will play in GB’s development, stressing that the region’s unmatched natural beauty and cultural richness must be leveraged to attract both domestic and international visitors. A seamless transport network will not only make tourism more accessible but will also stimulate broader economic activity by facilitating the movement of goods and services. Perhaps the most transformative aspect of Sharif’s visit was the announcement of a new Technical University in GB, aimed at giving the region’s youth the tools to succeed in a rapidly changing world. Alongside this, a Rs 1 billion endowment fund for students at Baltistan University and Karakorum University underscores the government’s commitment to higher education in the region. With education, particularly in technical fields, becoming an essential component of the global economy, this initiative promises to equip young people in GB with the skills they need to thrive. Education, of course, is not limited to the classroom. The federal government’s efforts to bring GB into the digital age are equally noteworthy. The ongoing SFiber Project, which will lay 950 kilometers of optical fiber cable across the region, is a game-changing initiative that will bring high-speed internet to more than 15,000 customers. This connectivity is crucial for expanding educational opportunities, fostering innovation, and enabling young people to engage in the growing global digital economy. Further enhancing this digital push, the government is establishing Software Technology Parks and Freelancing Hubs to help local youth tap into the booming online freelancing market. Beyond these concrete projects, Sharif’s visit was also a gesture of solidarity with the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, who have long endured both natural and man-made hardships. In Ghizer, where devastating floods displaced thousands in 2022, the Prime Minister personally oversaw recovery efforts, highlighting the government’s commitment to disaster management and humanitarian support. His visit to the area underscored a compassionate, people-centered approach to governance, with survivors like young Qandeel receiving both practical and financial assistance as part of the ongoing rehabilitation efforts. The government’s investment in Gilgit-Baltistan is not limited to infrastructure and education. Healthcare, too, is a priority, with new projects such as the 50-bed cardiac hospital, a 250-bed facility in Skardu, and the 16 MW Naltar Power Project all set to address pressing needs in the region. The approval of Rs 56 billion in new projects by the Gilgit-Baltistan Development Working Party reflects the scale of the federal government’s commitment to the region’s long-term growth and well-being. Perhaps most promising, however, is the emphasis on local empowerment and participation. By investing in key sectors like energy, education, and infrastructure, the government is not only fostering self-sufficiency but also ensuring that Gilgit-Baltistan is integrated into Pakistan’s broader economic framework. Whether through tourism, IT, or renewable energy, the region’s economy is being woven into the national fabric in ways that will enable sustainable growth for generations to come. In a geopolitical context, PM Sharif’s visit was also a firm statement of national unity. By focusing on development in this strategically sensitive region, Islamabad is reinforcing its commitment to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. It sends a clear message to those seeking to destabilize the region that the federal government is invested in its future—and will not allow outside forces to dictate the trajectory of its development. For too long, Gilgit-Baltistan has been held back by political marginalization and underinvestment. But the federal government’s recent initiatives offer a hopeful glimpse into the future. As PM Sharif remarked during his visit, the people of Gilgit-Baltistan have long displayed resilience, strength, and patriotism in the face of adversity. Now, with the full backing of the federal government, the region has the opportunity to realize its dreams of economic growth and prosperity. Gilgit-Baltistan stands at the precipice of a new era. With sustained investment and commitment from Islamabad, it could soon serve as a model of regional development—a beacon of hope not only for Pakistan but for the broader South Asian region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvVSiVSsutqPh	2024-11-12T08:29:49-08:00	
Significance Of Mombasa Port For Chinese Outreach In Africa – Ana...	By Shreyansh Krishna and Sayantan Haldar Africa has emerged as a pivotal partner in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI), the maritime dimension of Beijing’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). One of the key footholds for Chinese inroads has been the Mombasa Port, located on Kenya’s south-eastern coast. Mombasa—the largest and busiest port in East Africa—serves as a gateway for landlocked countries in Africa and is central to regional trade. Thus, it is imperative to examine how the port serves as a crucial node in China’s engagement with Africa and reflect on China’s broader geopolitical ambitions in the Western Indian Ocean. Africa's strategic value to the Maritime Silk Road Initiative Africa’s strategic importance to the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) stems from its location along critical maritime routes and its wealth of resources. Ports on the Indian Ocean and East African coasts, such as those in Mombasa and Djibouti, provide China access to vital sea lanes, facilitating the movement of goods between Asia, Africa, and Europe. Africa's vast natural resources are crucial to China’s resource security, ensuring a stable supply of raw materials for its industries. Additionally, Africa’s growing consumer markets have emerged as critical for Chinese investment. According to estimates, African markets received 5.1 percent of China’s total exports in 2023. Geopolitically, China seeks to counterbalance Western influence by securing long-term infrastructure partnerships across Africa. These relationships strengthen the Chinese foothold in global trade while fostering economic dependencies that support its broader geopolitical ambitions. This ensures that China maintains its dominance in key supply chains and emerging markets across the continent​. Initially, China’s engagement in Africa was welcomed, symbolised by historic projects like the Tan-Zam Railway. However, modern relations have become more complicated. As Chinese companies expand their presence, friction has grown due to concerns about subpar projects, a lack of local economic benefits, and fears of neo-colonialism. This has resulted in rising anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly in democratic countries like Kenya and South Africa, where protests highlight dissatisfaction with Chinese labour practices and capital investment. Kenya-China relations: A strategic gateway to East Africa Kenya, a gateway to East Africa and one of the continent’s largest economies serves as an excellent platform for China to broaden its reach into the rest of Africa. The country’s engagement with China exemplifies Beijing's approach to economic diplomacy on the continent, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since 2005, Kenya’s foreign policy has shifted towards a 'Look East' framework, emphasising the expansion of Chinese loans and Chinese-operated infrastructure projects as alternatives to Western investments. China has become Kenya’s largest trading partner, and although Kenya’s exports of tea, coffee, herbs, and avocados have gained increasing traction among Chinese consumers, the trade deficit was at US$ 9.39 billion in 2023, more than half of which is due to the significant investment, trade deals, and developmental assistance it receives from China. A key example of China’s influence in Kenya is the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), a flagship BRI project aimed at addressing Kenya’s infrastructure needs by connecting Mombasa to Nairobi. The Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China financed 90 percent of the project, with the Kenyan Government contributing the remaining 10 percent, and the China Road and Bridge Corporation led the construction. The SGR created30,000 jobs for locals and transported 5.4 million passengers and 1.3 million TEUs of shipments in its first year. However, despite these accomplishments, the project has faced challenges, with many young Kenyans expressing dissatisfaction with low-paying, unskilled jobs. Moreover, the SGR has operated at a loss since its inception, accumulating over US$ 200 million in losses since May 2020. Mombasa port: A geopolitical anchor in East Africa Served by the naturally existing Kilindini Harbour, Mombasa is a vital gateway for trade in East Africa and the world at large, connecting landlocked nations in the region to international markets. It is a crucial driver of economic growth, revenue generation, and job creation. It fosters regional integration, promotes cooperation among neighbouring countries, and contributes to the stability of the region. As a result, Mombasa holds immense importance in the context of global power competition in Africa. Mombasa’s strategic location allows China to secure maritime routes and extend its naval reach, reinforcing its economic and military leverage in the region. The port enhances China’s influence in East Africa, enabling Beijing to strengthen its position in global maritime trade and logistics. China's heavy investment in the port, along with related infrastructure projects, like the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), ensures its long-term presence in the region. This presence helps solidify its geopolitical goals, including increasing its military access and economic leverage in the region, thus, positioning Mombasa as a cornerstone of China’s broader influence in Africa. Building multimodal connectivity across Africa The MSR is driving the development of multimodal connectivity across Africa, linking sea, rail, and road networks to create more efficient trade routes that connect African markets to global supply chains. A key example of this is the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor project, which aims to reduce the overdependence on Mombasa. Under this project, new infrastructure, like the Lamu Port, is being developed and linked to major East African nations. While an oil pipeline is planned, alternative routes through Tanzania or Ethiopia are considered more viable. These developments align with China’s goal of establishing efficient transport networks under the MSR to ensure a smoother movement of goods from African ports to inland markets. Figure 1: The Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport Corridor Project. Source: Wiley Online Library Security and strategy in China’s engagement with African ports China's engagement with African ports is strategically focused on key regions like East Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa, where ports such as Djibouti, Mombasa, and Dar es Salaam provide access to major maritime routes in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, vital for global trade and energy security. China's investments in African ports often have dual-use potential, serving both economic and military functions. While these ports are framed as commercial projects, many have additional functions, supporting not just economic activities but the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as well, enhancing China’s naval reach and allowing it to project military power to secure its maritime interests. This is especially seen in Djibouti, the location of China’s first overseas military base, strategically located in a country that has proximity to major shipping lanes. Additionally, China often employs a debt-for-infrastructure model, providing large loans for port development. This model raises concerns about the risks of 'debt-trap diplomacy' in Africa, similar to what was seen in Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port. Projects like the LAPSSET align with China’s goal of establishing efficient trade routes across Africa. However, any country should be cautious while navigating the balance between economic growth and safeguarding their financial sovereignty, drawing lessons from Sri Lanka’s experience.

How Property Taxes Can Help Low-Income Countries To Develop – Ana...	The world’s governments must raise an additional $3 trillion to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth goals this decade. The cost in emerging markets equals 4 percent of gross domestic product—and 16 percent for low-income countries. How can countries finance such staggering price tags? Large cities such as Delhi and Lagos show a way forward: Taxing property more efficiently can play a meaningful role in raising revenue at the local level, allowing countries to invest more in their people, new IMF analysis shows. Previous IMF research has shown that countries have ample potential to raise more domestic tax revenue if they need it—up to 5 percentage points of GDP over two decades. Of course, the political challenges of such reforms are far from trivial, as recent events in several countries suggest that raising taxes can create social unrest. More efficient real estate taxes have an advantage in this regard: by being locally collected and spent, they may be politically less challenging than increases in broad-base national taxes. Recurrent taxes on immovable property could help local governments capture the wealth generated through construction-intensive urbanization. Generating such revenue fairly is especially important given the difficulty in developing countries of taxing income and wealth, which can be highly mobile. The appeal of property taxes is clear when we look at revenue raised in advanced economies: more than 1 percent of GDP on average in OECD countries, and nearly 3 percent in some advanced economies. By contrast, they raise only around 0.1 percent of GDP in emerging Asia and Africa. Achieving such a large growth requires improving property-tax coverage and addressing the capacity challenges in valuing real estate as ways to reverse the current revenue underperformance. New property identification technologies and simplified valuation methods have become widely available. With policy reforms and better technology, recurrent property tax revenues in developing countries should be at least 10 times higher than current levels. Local revenue and spending When well designed, property taxes become a reliable and progressive form of municipal financing. They enhance the accountability of local governments, since proceeds can be used to fund better local public services, and taxes the increase in wealth of those who own real estate that has appreciated due to urbanization and associated public-infrastructure development. The tight link at the local level between revenue and spending shields property taxes from national politics and imposes higher accountability standards on local councils for the effective use of the resources. National legislation should regulate how much property taxes can differ across a country, limiting divergences in the level of local public services funded by this source. Municipalities should limit exemptions to a narrow range of public organizations, and forgone revenues should be regularly reported. The impact on 'asset-rich but cash-poor' households such as pensioners can be softened by deferring taxes until the property is sold, at which point full payment is due. Satellites and drones It’s best to take a gradual approach to property-tax reform, using modern technology to broaden the coverage of area-based taxes (expressed as a fixed rate per square meter). The goal should be to transition to full value-based property taxes in coming years as countries gain experience in implementation and market price information is meticulously recorded for periodic property valuation. Modern mapping technology, such as satellite imagery and aerial photography by drones, can be used to fast-track the expansion and coverage of property taxes to all parcels that ought to be included in the fiscal register. Indian officials in Delhi and the greater Bangalore metropolitan area have started using satellite imagery to map properties in a geographic information system. In Africa, several municipalities have made impressive strides. Lagos increased tax collection fivefold to more than $1 billion in 2011 by broadening the base of its property tax, coupled with better enforcement. The increased precision of satellite images enables the accurate measuring of surface areas and the development of fiscal-register maps that depict buildings and their alterations. This allows the fast roll-out of an area-based property tax until valuation capacity has advanced to migrate toward a market value-based property-tax system that can raise more revenue. Demand for capacity development from the IMF in this area indicates that many countries are seeing the benefits from this combination of the right policies and technology enablers. It makes property-tax reform effective and politically appealing, especially when its objectives are communicated properly to the public.

China Slides Open Economic And Diplomatic Doors With Visa-Free Tr...	By Songshan (Sam) Huang Since the introduction of visa exemptions in late 2023, foreign tourist arrivals in China have surged. China’s visa-free policies include mutual exemptions, unilateral waivers to select nations and a 144-hour visa-free transit policy. These policies not only reduce time and financial costs for travellers, but also enhance the perceived value of a stopover in China. In the first seven months of 2024, 17.254 million foreign tourists visited the country, marking a staggering 129.9 per cent increase compared to 2023. While these numbers are a positive indicator of China’s reopening and attractiveness as a destination, they also point to broader implications for China and the global community. The spike in inbound tourism could enhance diplomatic relations and foster mutual understanding in an increasingly polarised world. Increased inbound tourism is a boon for China’s slowing economy. With the World Bank projecting China’s GDP growth at a modest 4.8 per cent for 2024, the country faces the need for structural reforms to sustain its economic trajectory. Attracting international tourist spending on accommodations, dining, transportation and attractions provides a much-needed stimulus. This influx represents a net input into China’s economy, triggering a multiplier effect across the tourism supply chain while generating jobs, particularly for Chinese youth facing high unemployment. Beyond immediate revenue generation, foreign tourists’ spending can stimulate broader economic dynamism, helping to offset domestic demand shortfalls. But relying on tourism as an economic solution comes with risks. As the global economy remains unpredictable, fluctuations in international travel, geopolitical tensions and potential health crises could all undermine this source of growth. China must approach its tourism strategy with a broader long-term economic vision. China’s visa-free policies could also be interpreted as a strategic diplomatic tool — what some might call ‘soft power’ or ‘smart diplomacy’. By easing travel barriers, China encourages more visitors to experience the country firsthand, countering negative narratives shaped by Western media. The growing trend of international bloggers and social media influencers showcasing China is invaluable. These influencers, often regarded as more credible and relatable than official marketing campaigns, may have been reshaping global perceptions of China, particularly among younger Western audiences. Western media often emphasises isolated incidents involving foreign tourists’ safety, such as the stabbing of four US teachers in Northeast China. Social media influencers provide a more authentic view of China’s social realities, sharing firsthand experiences of the country’s cultural heritage, modern lifestyle, impressive transport infrastructure and urban development. In an era of heightened global polarisation, the role of tourism in fostering people-to-people exchanges cannot be understated. China’s reaffirmation of its open-door policy at the third plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th Central Committee in July 2024, highlights the country’s commitment to facilitating cultural diplomacy. Amid rising trade protectionism and geopolitical friction, visa-free travel becomes an extension of China’s broader foreign policy, aligning with initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative. The hope is that increased intercultural exposure will cultivate understanding, reduce misconceptions and ultimately contribute to global peace and cooperation. But the potential pitfalls of tourism must also be managed. Overtourism — when tourists overwhelm local infrastructure and resources — is a global concern, with cities like Barcelona offering cautionary tales. China could face similar issues, especially in popular tourist destinations where both inter-regional domestic and foreign tourists strain local resources. Some Chinese cities are already advising residents to stay home during peak tourism periods to accommodate the influx of visitors. In Chongqing, local residents are urged by the municipal tourism authority to avoid popular tourist attractions during public holidays. Such measures, though pragmatic, can foster resentment among locals who feel displaced in their own communities. Tourists also compete with residents for public services, transportation and access to amenities which may exacerbate social tensions if locals perceive their living standards are compromised. China must be proactive in balancing the needs of its residents with the benefits brought by foreign tourists. Failure to do so could lead to rising tensions and diminish the potential gains of its visa-free policies. Lessons from around the world indicate that careful urban planning, infrastructure development and equitable resource distribution are critical to avoiding the pitfalls of overtourism. China’s continuation of its visa-free policies is likely, given the economic and diplomatic advantages. But caution is essential. As the country navigates high unemployment and slower economic growth, the government must carefully manage the distribution of tourism benefits to ensure local communities are not left behind. Tourism should not exacerbate existing social inequalities but rather serve as a catalyst for mutual understanding and shared prosperity. To sustain the growth of inbound tourism, authorities and operators should continue enhancing travel convenience and quality for foreign tourists. It is also important to regularly review visa-free policies for certain countries, monitor visitor flows and make necessary adjustments. Overseas Chinese represent a significant market for China’s inbound tourism and policymakers could explore strategies beyond visa exemptions to encourage their visits. While China’s visa exemptions have undoubtedly spurred an influx of foreign tourists and bolstered its economic and diplomatic goals, managing this growth is essential to its sustainability. Balancing the benefits of tourism with the well-being of local residents will be key to maintaining both domestic harmony and China’s global image as a welcoming, open nation.

The Trump Tariff Fallacy: Bringing The Corporations Back To The U...	Donald Trump’s massive victory in the recent US presidential election has raised the possibility that tariffs will once again be used, only this time just not against goods from China. With trade deficits between many Asian countries and the United States, there are possibilities many countries may be targeted if Trump’s objectives are to reduce bilateral deficits. This could affect close allies of the US, including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Trumps plan during the campaign was to increase tariffs on goods coming into the US by 10-20 percent. China maybe hit with a 60 percent tariff. This could flow onto global supply chains as globalism has connected world economies. Such tariffs are potentially inflationary and recessionary Many of the goods imported into the US are made by US corporations in China. Of the USD 551 billion from China to the United States in 2022, a substantial portion is from US companies shipping inputs for assembly in China. Another 20 percent are OEM products produced for US corporations. The tariffs are not paid by China. They are either absorbed by US corporations, which reduces profits, or passed onto consumers who pay higher prices for goods, which adds to inflation. According to estimates made by JP Morgan Chase, the tariffs will cost the American family around USD 1,000 per year, and dampen demand after they are implemented. Share prices of other US retailers could fall, like they did back in 2019, when Trump imposed tariffs on China. The only thing that will hurt China is a reduction in demand for goods bound for the US, which would add to slowing economic activity, thus reducing some employment. Trump’s tariffs may put pressure on companies exporting to the US from China to return to the US, or relocate to third countries. This is something that has been already happening due to rising Chinese labor rates. The consequence of continuing this action is more retaliation from China, a drop in worldwide aggregate demand and a recession which will hurt the United States, corporations and everyone else. The real problem is decades old Between 1990 and 2017 US corporations invested more than US$250 billion into China. Initial investments didn’t go that smoothly. Chinese authorities later eased the processes required for foreign investors, opened special economic zones and partly opened the domestic market, bringing US corporations in droves. US corporations moved to China for lower labor and operational costs and manufacture under less stringent regulatory regimes, increasing corporate profits immensely. There was also the expectation that US companies would be able to enter the quickly-growing Chinese domestic market, as demand in the US has already matured. As a result, manufacturing jobs dried up in the US. The promise of better jobs didn’t materialize. Only low-paid menial service, warehouse and retail jobs became available, which had absolutely no career paths. Those jobs were for the lucky ones, as many became unemployed. The middle class began to shrink, as did purchasing power and the tax base. Eventually a trade imbalance between China and the US occurred, partly brought about by US products, which now became imports. Corporations made higher profits for their shareholders at the cost of a loyal workforce that became redundant. A generation of manufacturing skills was just discarded, along with cities and towns that once housed the manufacturing facilities of these corporations. Many of these factories became warehouses and condominiums, ironically bought up by Chinese, which inflated the housing market. After more than 35 years of capital and production capacity flight, China is now a manufacturing economy and the US is not. US manufacturing has declined to around 11.5 percent of GDP against 40 percent post WWII. The general economic lull in the United States that existed before the last election, which helped give Trump the support base he needed to win the presidency, maybe exacerbated by any tariff hikes. This will hurt the people who had hope in Trump and elected him. The problem isn’t China. Trump didn’t cause it either. He inherited the problem from successive presidential administrations. The problem was caused by the corporations which abandoned US production, and workers who were also their customers, lured by the promise of lower costs, higher profits and entry into the Chinese market. Trump was elected to save and create jobs. To his constituency, ‘make America great again’ is about reacquiring traditional manufacturing jobs. However, corporations are blocked from returning from manufacturing offshore because of the high profits they are making and higher production costs they would incur if the company returned to US production. The levels of profits the corporations now enjoy can’t be made manufacturing in the United States. Bringing back the corporations Trump is calling on US corporations to leave China and comeback to the United States. He does have executive powers to force them, but this would be politically untenable. Working through a multi-layered constitutional democracy such as the United States would almost be impossible to garner strong and committed bi-partisan support to bring the corporations back. Tariffs appear as the easy alternative. Even if US corporations returned, the financial costs would be high. Companies would have to rebuild manufacturing facilities, recreate supply networks where local suppliers may no longer exist, and regenerate the community environments to house their workforce. This would be one of the most ambitious projects the United States has engaged in, something along the mammoth scale of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Extensive city re-planning would be necessary. Infrastructure built. Communities re-nurtured. The US Government would most certainly have to adopt a regime of incentives something akin to what South East Asian Governments are giving investors, something unprecedented in the US. This would most likely need to be accompanied with a tax scheme where companies manufacturing in the US would pay a lower tax than companies importing their products to factor in differential labor costs. Has the horse already bolted? This is the reality the United States must now live with. Now the US must learn how to accommodate China diplomatically and economically, completely outside the military paradigm. Unlike the Cold War, which was about military supremacy, this one is about trade. China and the US, economic relations with China must be based on the reality of mutual co-existence and avenues of cooperation. This would be a complete reversal in US policy thinking. A so-called trade war with a nation that the US have heavy investments in is nonsensical. There is the potential that US firms could be hurt in China. The interdependency between the Chinese and US economies needs to be recognized and reflected in policy. US foreign policy over the first 12 months of the upcoming Trump presidency looks like being trade based. An American envoy may be calling of Asian states in the new year, looking for trade concessions to rebalance what Trump sees is a problem.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4rVeiPtDcMc_	2024-11-11T16:55:34-08:00	
Shift In Boko Haram Tactics Requires Security Forces To Adapt – A...	Months of battlefield losses and hundreds of defections appeared to weaken Boko Haram, but it has not stopped the extremists from continuing to terrorize the Lake Chad Basin. Experts say that because the group has shown an alarming ability to reorganize and adapt its tactics, security forces must be just as flexible and resilient. Encompassing parts of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, the Lake Chad Basin has proved to be a troublesome theater with its many swamps and islands. All four countries contribute troops to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) that recently concluded Operation Lake Sanity 2, which dismantled several terrorist hideouts. 'The [operation] resulted in the neutralization of numerous Boko Haram terrorist combatants, the successful rescue of several hostages, and the capture of arms and ammunition,' the MNJTF said in a statement on October 26, 2024. Remadji Hoinathy and Célestin Delanga, researchers with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies, said that security forces must anticipate the terrorist group’s next pivot. 'Operation Lake Sanity has had some success against Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, but the insurgents will soon adapt to the new military tactics,' they wrote in a September 16, 2024, article. 'To sustain the gains made, the Multinational Joint Task Force leading the operation must stay ahead of these dynamics.' After MNJTF operations, militants fled into peripheral areas, where they attacked civilians and increasingly used suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). 'The use of vehicle-borne IEDs and those buried in the ground poses a grave risk for security forces and calls for demining operations and technologies like mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles,' the researchers wrote. 'Boko Haram’s use of IEDs and suicide attacks propagates fear and disrupts both community cohesion and military efforts. These tactics must be tackled head-on to prevent a resurgence and return of the terrorist factions.' In its October 26, 2024, news release, the MNJTF said it 'is actively engaged in stabilizing the area, providing genuine protection to civilians, and creating conditions conducive to sustainable peace and development.' The next day, however, Boko Haram showed it still can muster the strength for large-scale attacks. On October 27, about 300 Boko Haram fighters stormed a Chadian military base on an island called Barkaram, 5 kilometers from the border with Nigeria. The militants killed at least 40 Soldiers and their commander, seized weapons, and burned vehicles equipped with heavy arms. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Déby somberly assessed the damage the day after the attack and promised retribution. 'I have decided to launch Operation Haskanite to avenge our [Soldiers],' he said in a government video. 'I would like to reassure the Chadian people that we will hunt down these lunatics. We will track them down to their last base.' Found in the Lake Chad area and in surrounding deserts, Haskanite is a local plant known for its strength and resiliency. With another large military operation imminent in the Lake Chad region, Hoinathy and Delanga said Chad’s neighbors and the MNJTF should focus on the ways in which Boko Haram militants adapt their tactics and break into smaller groups. While acknowledging that large, coordinated military efforts can achieve many objectives, the researchers also called for security forces to improve their capacity for monitoring peripheral areas. 'This should include regular operations by combined forces from Lake Chad Basin countries to prevent Boko Haram from redeploying its fighters to these areas. This strategy would preserve the stability achieved in certain localities and avoid pressure from new waves of people who have been forcibly displaced,' the researchers wrote. Providing more police and government presence in the areas surrounding Lake Chad also would help to counter security threats and build trust with communities. Nonkinetic approaches are needed as well, including humanitarian and economic assistance for those affected by violence. 'Engaging with local communities in these areas will enable intelligence gathering and create a united front against the insurgents,' they wrote. 'Existing community development efforts as part of the Lake Chad Basin Commission’s regional stabilization strategy should be ramped up, including civil-military actions by the MNJTF.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4soUOrk3WyH_	2024-11-11T16:53:50-08:00	
Ron Paul: Make Money Free Again – OpEd	Two days after Donald Trump became the first American since Grover Cleveland to win nonconsecutive presidential elections, the Federal Reserve announced a quarter percent cut in interest rates. Following this announcement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a press conference where he said that he would not comply with any presidential request that he step down before his term ends in May of 2026. Powell claimed that the president lacks the legal authority to fire the Fed chairman. So, if President Trump tells Chairman Powell 'you’re fired,' Powell could bring suit asking a court to review Trump’s action. President Trump and Chairman Powell are at odds over President Trump’s desire to require the Federal Reserve to consult with the president before changing interest rates or taking other significant actions. Powell is likely to do all he can to convince Congress to reject any legislation giving the president any type of official role in setting monetary policy. After all, Chairman Powell is so protective of Fed autonomy that he opposes auditing the Fed on the grounds that it could threaten the Fed’s independence, even though there is nothing in the Audit the Fed legislation giving the president or Congress any new authority over the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy. Requiring the Fed to consult with the president regarding monetary policy would likely increase price inflation and dollar devaluation. Politicians usually like low interest rates because they associate low rates with economic growth. Politicians also want the Fed to keep rates low so the federal government can keep racking up huge amounts of debt. Without a central bank that is ready, willing, and able to monetize the federal debt, the welfare-warfare state would not exist. Despite the claims of Chairman Powell and other central bank apologists, the Fed has never been free of political pressure. Presidents were trying to influence the Federal Reserve long before Donald Trump began posting 'mean tweets' about Jerome Powell. Requiring the Fed to consult with the president would at least make the president’s efforts to influence monetary policy open and transparent. President Trump and other Fed critics such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren think they are more capable of determining the 'correct' interest rate than the Fed. This ignores the fact that interest rates are the price of money and like all prices are shaped by a variety of constantly changing factors. When the Fed manipulates interest rates, it distorts the signals sent to investors. The result is the boom- bust business cycle. The fiat system is also responsible for rising income inequality and the decline of the dollar’s purchasing power, which has lowered most Americans’ standard of living. President Trump should work to eliminate the need for the Fed to keep interest rates low. He can do this by fighting for massive spending cuts, starting with the military-industrial complex. He should also push Congress to pass the Audit the Fed bill. Additionally, President Trump should support legalizing all competing currencies. The forthcoming tax bill should include a provision exempting precious metals and cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes. The key to making America great again is to make money free again.

Pakistan: BLA Blowback In Baluchistan – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On November 9, 2024, at least 31 persons, including 17 Security Forces (SFs) personnel, were killed and more than 60 persons, including 46 SF personnel sustained injuries, when a suicide bomber blew himself up near the ticket counter of the Quetta Railway Station in Balochistan. According to railway authorities, the Jaffar Express was scheduled to depart for Peshawar at 9 am. The train had not yet arrived at the platform when an explosion occurred near the station's ticket office. Balochistan Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mouzzam Jah Ansari, stated that the target was Army personnel from the Infantry School. The Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. 'This morning, a Fidayee attack was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta Railway Station as they were returning via Jaffar Express after completing a course at the Infantry School,' the BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch said. Later in the day, BLA released a detailed statement on its official media Hakkal, claiming it killed at least 31 non-commissioned officers of the Army and injured over 60 others. The BLA identified the suicide bomber as Muhammad Rafiq Bizenjo alias Washen alias Faheem. Bizenjo, a cadres of BLA's 'elite' Majeed Brigade, carried out the attack in response to what the BLA described as Pakistan's 'occupation' of Balochistan. According to the BLA, Bizenjo targeted Army personnel from multiple regiments, including the Punjab Regiment, Northern Light Infantry, Sindh Regiment, Frontier Force, Baloch Regiment, and Azad Kashmir Regiment. The soldiers had recently completed training at the School of Infantry and Tactics in Quetta, the BLA added. The BLA credited its intelligence wing, ZIRAB (Zephyr Intelligence Research and Analysis Bureau), with planning the attack. The group claimed ZIRAB monitored the Army's movements closely and decided to delay the attack on November 8 to avoid civilian casualties. According to the BLA, November 9 was chosen because over 200 Army personnel were present, with minimal risk to civilians. In its statement, the BLA warned that if Pakistan's military presence in Balochistan continues, future attacks will escalate and could extend to major cities in Pakistan. On November 6, 2024, the BLA conducted an operation in station area of Nushki District in Balochistan, killing two 'state-backed death squad' members, Israr Muhammad Hassani and Yasir Jamaldini. In a statement, BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch claimed that 'Israr, from Badalkarez, and Yasir, from Killi Jamaldini, were on the payroll of the occupying forces.' Jeeyand Baloch added that the two were allegedly involved in military operations that included raids and enforced disappearances of Baloch youth. The group stated that they had been under surveillance prior to the attack and warned that others engaged in similar activities would 'face similar consequences.' On November 4, 2024, at least 10 soldiers were killed and another four sustained injuries, while two BLA cadres were also killed during a clash, after BLA ambushed a military convoy near the Qadirabad area of Nushki District. BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch disclosed that two of the group's cadres, Adnan Baloch and Yasir Baloch, were killed in the prolonged confrontation. 'Despite his injuries, Martyr Adnan Baloch held his position for over an hour, covering his unit's retreat before sacrificing his life,' Jeeyand Baloch added. On October 28, 2024, the BLA killed five private security personnel deployed at a construction site in the Diz Paroom area of Panjgur District. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch released a statement, claiming that the attack was carried out by BLA's Fatah Squad, based on intelligence from BLA's intelligence wing, Zirab. The attack targeted members of 'death squads' allegedly supported by Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies, whom the BLA claims were engaged in counterinsurgency operations against the Baloch independence movement. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), in 59 BLA-linked incidents recorded in 2024, at least 254 persons, including 83 civilians, 122 SF personnel and 49 militants, have been killed (data till November 10, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 34 such incidents resulted in 69 fatalities, including 16 civilians, 45 SF personnel and eight militants. The whole of 2023 recorded 39 incidents in which 77 persons were killed, including 19 civilians, 50 SF personnel and eight militants. Since the Balochistan tryst with insurgency, year 2024 has so far been the most violent, with BLA leading from the front among all the Baloch insurgent groups, orchestrating most of the attacks. Since August 1, 2004, when the first BLA-linked incident, was recorded by SATP, at least 912 persons, including 277 civilians, 393 SF personnel, 222 militants, and 20 in the Not Specified category, have been killed (data till November 10, 2024). On August 1, 2004, five soldiers and a civilian were killed when BLA cadres targeted SF vehicles in the Khuzdar District. The long-term state policy of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings has led to a spiral of retaliatory attacks and violence by Baloch insurgents, targeting SFs and state establishments in the province. Civilians, especially members of state-backed 'death squad' have also been targeted. In this environment of chaos, Islamist terrorist groups have also thrived and even joined the Baloch groups. The major active Baloch insurgent groups include the Baloch National Army (BNA), BLA, Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), Balochistan Liberation Tigers (BLT) and United Baloch Army (UBA). Among all the Baloch groups, the BLA has proved the most lethal. Comprised mostly of Marri and Bugti tribe members, BLA was formed in response to the growing resentment in Balochistan over the continuous Government exploitation of the province's natural resources and the neglect of development and welfare in the province. The group has about 6,000 cadres spread across Balochistan and in the bordering areas of Afghanistan. Sardar Akbar Khan Bugti, former Chief Minister of Balochistan is considered one of the 'grandfathers' of the organization and was killed in an Army operation on August 26, 2006. After Akbar Khan Bugti's death, Balach Marri led the group, till his death in Afghanistan on 21 November 2007. After Balach's death, his brother, Hyrbyair Marri has led the group since 2007, from exile in London. Bashir Zeb Baloch is the 'commander-in-chief' of the outfit. Out of all Baloch insurgent groups, the BLA is the only one that has a dedicated suicide attack squad, the 'Majeed Brigade', named after two brothers, Majeed Langove Senior and Majeed Langove Junior, who carried out suicide attacks in August 1974 and March 2010, respectively. Majeed Senior tried to assassinate then Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto when he was on an official visit to Quetta. He wanted to kill the Prime Minister for his dismissal of the National Awami Party's government in Balochistan, but Majeed Senior lost his life during the operation. Majeed Junior 'sacrificed' himself to save his associates when SFs raided the house where they were staying in Quetta's Wahdat Colony. Majeed Junior held back the SF raiders to give his associates time to escape. Following Majeed Junior's death, a BLA leader, Aslam Achu, established the insurgent group's suicide squad, and named it the Majeed Brigade, currently led by Hammal Rehan Baloch. The Brigade carried out its first vehicle-borne suicide attack on December 30, 2011, when Baaz Khan Marri targeted tribal elder Shafiq Mengal, son of former acting Chief Minister and Federal Minister Naseer Mengal, on the Arbab Karam Khan Road in Quetta. Shafeeq, who had run a 'death squad' targeting Baloch insurgents in different parts of the province, escaped unhurt, but 14 persons, including women and children, were killed, and 35 were injured. Apart from Majeed Brigade, BLA have a has special forces, the Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS), under the command of Bashir Zeb Baloch, which has been monitoring and eliminating Army officers and their local 'death squad' collaborators. STOS' main function is the tracking of and intelligence gathering on targets. BLA formed a new elite group, the 'Fateh Squad', whose cadres are known for their specialised skills. The Fateh Squad was formed in May 2021 after one of BLA's 'martyrs', Fateh Qambrani, was killed during an operation to capture a Pakistani Army camp in the Meshdari area of Shahrag in Harnai District in September 2018. His action enabled the full capture of the Army camp. Fateh Qambrani also played a prominent role in various other operations. The cadres of the Fateh Squad are selected on the basis of their exceptional skills and face-to-face battle experience. They lead their fighters directly into Pakistani Army and paramilitary camps, paving the way for other fighters to enter the camps. The growing strength and lethality of the BLA can be assessed by the August 25-26, 2024, coordinated and simultaneous attacks across seven Districts, 'Operation Hereof' (Operation Dark Storm). This was the largest act of retribution by any Baloch insurgent group. In the early morning of August 26, 2024, BLA cadres offloaded passengers from trucks and buses in the Rarasham area of Musakhail District and shot them after checking their identities. At least 23 Punjabi travellers were killed. The armed men also set fire to 10 vehicles. As the day progressed, Balochistan recorded multiple attacks across the province, which left at least 38 people dead, including the 23 in Musakhail. In response, SFs neutralised 21 terrorists and injured several others. BLA cadres then targeted Levies Forces and Police Stations in Mastung, Kalat, Pasni, and Suntsar, resulting in numerous casualties. Explosions and grenade attacks were reported in Sibi, Panjgur, Mastung, Turbat, Bela, and Quetta, with militants blowing up a railway track near Mastung. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a statement later in the day, claiming that 21 terrorists had been killed, while 14 SF personnel, including four from law enforcement agencies, were killed during 'clearance operations'. However, in a statement released on its official media, Hakkal, BLA announced the successful completion of its Fidayeen Operation Hereof, claiming to have killed 130 military personnel during a series of coordinated attacks across Balochistan. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch claimed that the group's elite fidayeen unit, the Majeed Brigade, had 'maintained control over the Bela Camp for 20 hours,' during which '68 military personnel were killed and dozens more injured.' The BLA also reported that its Fateh Squad and Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS) had set up blockades on major highways across Balochistan, leading to the deaths of 62 military personnel. 'After achieving the objectives of Operation Herof, the roadblocks on all highways were lifted,' the statement read. Some of the other major attacks by the BLA in 2024 include: October 8: Eight soldiers were killed and three were injured in two consecutive attacks by BLA cadres in the Gonden Marao area of Ispelanji in Mastung District. In a statement to the media, BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch said the attack took place in the Gonden Marao area of Ispelanji, where BLA cadres ambushed a Security Force convoy using heavy and automatic weapons. June 24: At least 11 soldiers were killed and an unspecified number sustained injuries when BLA cadres attacked a military camp in the Iskalko area of Kalat District. April 29: At least ten soldiers were killed and their military vehicle was completely destroyed in an improvised explosive device (IED) attack by BLA cadres in the Peer Ismail Indus area of Bolan District. April 12: BLA cadres shot dead 11 passengers of Punjabi ethnicity on N-40 Regional Corporations Development (RCD) highway after checking their identities from a passenger bus in the Nushki. The victims were from Wazirabad, Mandi Bahauddin and Gujranwala Districts of Punjab. BLA claimed that they were Government employees. March 25: Majeed Brigade cadres attacked the PNS Siddique Naval Air Station in the Turbat town of Kech District and claimed that more than 30 soldiers were killed. The Army, however, stated it thwarted the attack and killed four BLA cadres, while one soldier was killed. March 20: Majeed Brigade cadres attacked the Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) Complex in Gwadar town (Gwadar District) and killed two soldiers. SFs, however, stated that they thwarted the attack and killed eight BLA cadres. January 29: Nine BLA cadres, four Railway Police personnel and two civilians were killed, while four others, including two SF personnel and one child, sustained injuries when the Majeed Brigade launched three coordinated attacks targeting the Frontier Corps Headquarters, the Railway Station and the District Jail in the Mach town of Kachhi District. BLA 'spokesperson', Jeeyand Baloch claimed the attack, stating that it was a joint attack in coordination with other factions, during which BLA insurgents controlled Mach city and surrounding areas for over 72 hours. Horrified with continuous and escalating BLA attacks, security personnel have started hesitating to serve in Balochistan. After the August 25-26 coordinated attacks, while chairing the Provincial Apex Committee in Quetta on August 30, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasized the need for the deployment of capable and talented officers in Balochistan, acknowledging that, due to security concerns, some officers hesitate to serve in the province. However, under a new policy regarding officer deployment, officers from the 48th Common Training Program will be posted in Balochistan for one year, while officers from the 49th Common Training Program will be posted for one and a half years, after completing one year. Prime Minister Sharif also announced that special incentives would be provided to officers deployed in Balochistan, including four air tickets for their families every three months. Heightening tensions, the Balochistan Police issued a notification on October 28, warning officers that the BLA was planning abductions of Government officials in Panjgur, Kech and Awaran Districts. 'High-ranking officials such as DPOs, DCs, or ACs could be targeted in retaliation for the recent disappearance of BLA leader Basheer Zeb's brother, Zaheer Baloch,' the Police notification stated. Zaheer Baloch went 'missing' on June 27 en route from his office on Quetta's Zarghoon Road to his home on Sariab Road. Instead of dealing with the Baloch insurgency through constructive measures such as peace-talks, negotiations or economic and relief measures to improve the abysmal developmental profile of the province, the Pakistan establishments has been following a ruthless approach of suppression of the Baloch people. On August 22, 2024, the Government approved PKR 60 billion to carry out Operation Azm-e-Istehkam (Commitment for Stability) to fight militancy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In response, the BLA-led Baloch Raj Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella organization of Baloch 'pro-independence' groups, issued a statement on July 8, 2024, against Pakistan's military campaign. In a media release, BRAS 'spokesperson' Baloch Khan condemned the operation as a blatant intensification of the ongoing 'genocide' against the Baloch people. He asserted that BRAS and its allied organizations were prepared to defend their land and people against any form of military action, promising to defeat the 'invading' forces. While the violence in the province has social and developmental grievances, the Federal Government's recent plan for the establishment of 'internment centres' for terrorism suspects in the province and the November 1 proposed amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act, granting the armed forces and paramilitary units the authority to detain individuals involved in serious crimes for up to three months, will further aggravate the issues of enforced disappearances in the province, likely provoking more BLA orchestrated attacks in the coming days.

Your Kids Are Already Communist, And College Will Make It Worse –...	By Mark Thorton Children in the US are raised to be communists. Most of the parents are too and don’t even know it. It doesn’t matter if you send them to public or private schools as all the education degree-granting schools bias the learning process against the competitive capitalist 'liberal' or open-minded society. Instead, the curriculum is less about learning about reality and is heavy on propagandizing children against capitalism and towards communism. American society teaches hatred and distrust of everything capitalist, even though its benefits are all around us—helping to feed, cloth, house, and protect us. In contrast, the government screws up virtually everything it lays its hands on and charges us double to do so. I remember when I was a child that my mother would retrieve the morning milk, just outside the back door, from the 'milk box.' I don’t remember how old I was when I finally asked how the milk got there, and my mother told me that the milkman put it there. I think I had previously chalked it up to something akin to Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, and when I realized how dark and cold—even snowy—it could be outside early in the morning, I was amazed! Today, on the drive to work, I heard an otherwise-intelligent retired athlete say the following: If you are a billionaire sports team owner you obviously have screwed a lot of people over, but in the case of building sports stadiums, taxpayer subsidies are needed because they create jobs. Everything about that statement is wrong and ignorant. People become billionaires because they serve their customers well. They outcompete others in serving customers. They normally create tons of high-paying jobs too, including for our retired athlete. The exception to this rule is when billions are made from special privileges from the government, like taxpayer subsidies! Taxpayer-funded stadiums are the classic case of a losing proposition for the local economy and taxpayers as study after study has demonstrated. Only a few benefit from the subsidies, including the billionaire team owners! With a brainwashed upbringing, is it any wonder then that more young adults have a positive view of socialism than have a positive view of capitalism? The positive beliefs in socialism only increase with more college education. Those beliefs should decline with more education if college was about learning, instead of indoctrination. The only silver lining—and I will link to my journal article on the subject in the show notes—is that the rise of socialist sympathies has driven many others to try and learn more about Austrian economics. One clear sign of socialist bias in higher education is that college professors that register Democrat outnumber those that register Republican 10-to-1. Of course, Democrat professors are much more likely to favor extreme forms of socialism than the average American Democrats and Republican professors are more likely to stay in the closet or face the mean and career-ending dangers from Marxist professors who often control the campus agenda. The Republicans are also much more likely to teach in good career departments, like engineering, where their views would not come into play in the classroom. Mitch Daniels was a pharmaceutical executive who came into the Bush administration to run the Office of Management and Budget. He went on to become a successful two-term governor of Indiana and then president of the prestigious Purdue University. At each stage, he tried and succeeded in trimming the worst excesses of public sector waste and abuse of the taxpayer. He has spoken favorably of both F.A. Hayek and limited government. At Purdue, the business school is now named the 'Mitch Daniels School of Business' and, at his beckoning, they have set up a mini curriculum called the 'Cornerstone for Business' that proposes to expose students to 'transformative texts with deep insights on the history, philosophy, and economic theory of market capitalism.' This is a well-intentioned attempt to 'offset the influence of a culture that increasingly doubts the value that profitable businesses offer society.' This effort should be commended. It recognizes the anti-capitalist influence in American culture and education, and it attempts to balance that by exposing the students to some 'transformative texts.' Of course, that is what a liberal education and a liberal arts degree should be—was meant to be—in the first place! Unfortunately, this is only an elective curriculum—students get a certificate for completing the three-course sequence: 1. 'Money, Trade, & Power: The History of Capitalism,' 2. 'History of Economic Thought,' and, 3. 'International Organization.' I was a little surprised it did not include a course in 'Comparative Economic Systems.' That was a standard course that was taught every semester, open to any student, when I was an undergraduate student. The course compared various versions of capitalism and socialism. My teacher tried to convince us that the Soviet Union would soon dominate the West. It’s not taught much anymore, anywhere. I don’t think it’s been taught at Auburn University for at least four decades, except when I volunteered to teach it, basically on a charitable basis. They haven’t even asked me to teach it in almost a decade. The titles of courses, however, are just a surface issue and are just subterfuge in the long run. The titles of professors also don’t matter. I’m afraid that if every economics, history, and philosophy department in the country had a Murray Rothbard named endowed professorship that it would not change a thing. The University of Missouri was given millions of dollars for six chaired professorships in Austrian economics, and they just handed them out to seemingly random business professors with no connection to Austrian economics. In an extremely unusual outcome, the University was successfully sued for their egregious actions against the donors’ wishes and had to return the money. Most donors are not so lucky. Here is the crux of the matter: Current professors don’t know what they are talking about concerning the relevant issues, they only mimic the political propaganda that their professor gave to them. The story suits the agenda, so it gets retold as if it is a real theory, or real history. In reality, these stories often simply fly in the face of logic, but because professors and students are not taught true critical thinking or exposed to competing approaches, they never think about questioning it. The only critical thinking in modern academia that stands out are criticisms of capitalism—real and imagined. Case in point: it is widely taught that unions caused wages to go up, improved working conditions, reduced hours of work, eliminated women and child labor, etc.; issues that are bound to come up in various history and economics classes. The problem with this story is that increased wages and benefits, etc., require free market capitalism and private property rights in the first place to generate the necessary savings and capital investment in worthwhile production. Capitalism and capitalist accumulation occurred prior to the labor guilds. The Industrial Revolution preceded labor unions. Capitalism proliferated the higher-skilled labor and higher-paying jobs on which unions are based! All the good benefits that labor enjoys first appeared in the marketplace without government or union intervention. Henry Ford started the $5 per workday because he wanted a dependable, highly-skilled workforce and workers loved it! Unions do benefit their members, but they hurt the employers and customers. They also can only sustain their higher pay by excluding others from skilled positions, so many people in the workforce are hurt by unionism. The net result is that 'labor' in general is not better off and unionized economies go into decline. The US is one of the least unionized and most dynamic advanced economies in the world. Listen to professors and their students and you would think only children would work in factories and that no one would ever have a day off from work if not for unions and the government. The capitalist process is responsible for higher wages and higher standards of living in society. As a system, governmental action and violent union activity can only drag down its beneficial social effects. This is just one example of what passes for higher education. Don’t expect government bureaucrats and politicians to solve this problem. They helped to create it.

The West’s Very Fundamental Accumulating Contradictions – OpEd	The election has occurred; Trump will take office in January; many of the existing Party Nomenklatura will be replaced; different policies will be announced – but actually taking power (rather than just sitting in the White House) will be more complex. The U.S. has devolved into many disparate fiefdoms – almost princedoms – from the CIA to the Justice Department. And regulatory ‘agencies’ too, have been implanted to preserve Nomenklatura hold on the System’s lifeblood. Pulling these ideological adversaries into new thinking will not proceed entirely smoothly. However, the U.S. election also, has been a referendum on the prevalent western intellectual mainstream. And that likely will be more decisive than the U.S. domestic vote – important though that is. The U.S. has shifted strategically away from the managerial techno-oligarchy that took its grip in the 1970s. Today’s shift is reflected across the U.S. Back in 1970, Zbig Brzezinski (who was to become National Security Adviser to President Carter) wrote a book foreseeing the new era: What he then called ‘The Technetronic Era’, 'involved the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society … dominated by an élite, unrestrained by traditional values … [and practicing] continuous surveillance over every citizen … [together with] manipulation of the behaviour and intellectual functioning of all people … [would become the new norm].' Elsewhere, Brzezinski argued that 'the nation-state … has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state'. Brzezinski was plain wrong about the benefits of tech cosmopolitan governance. And he was decisively, and disastrously, wrong in the policy prescriptions that he adduced from the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991 – that no country or group of countries would ever dare to stand up to U.S. power. Brzezinski argued in The Grand Chessboard that Russia would have no choice but to submit to the expansion of NATO, and to the geopolitical dictates of the U.S. But Russia did not succumb. And as a result of the élites’ 1991 ‘End of History’ euphoria, the West launched war in Ukraine to prove its point – that no single country could hope to stand against the combined weight of all NATO. They said that because they believed it. They believed in the western Manifest Destiny. They did not understand the other options Russia had. Today, the Ukraine war is lost. Hundreds of thousands have died unnecessarily – for a conceit. The ‘other war’ in the Middle East fares no differently. The Israeli-U.S. war on Iran will be lost, and tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese will have died pointlessly. And the ‘forever wars’ too, that were expected by the Supreme Commander of NATO in the wake of 9/11 to topple an array of states (first Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran), not only did they not result in consolidating U.S. hegemony, but they have led instead to Kazan and to BRICS, with its long tail of aspirant members, ready to face down foreign colonialism. The Kazan summit was cautious. It didn’t project a flush of solutions; some BRICS states were hesitant (the U.S. election was scheduled for the following week). Putin’s comments to these latter states were carefully calibrated: Look at what the U.S. can do to you, should you fall foul of it, at any point. Protect yourselves. All that the BRICS President (Putin) could say, at this juncture, was: Here are the problems that [we have to solve]. It is premature to set up a full alternative Bretton Woods structure at this time. But we can set up the core to a prudent alternative for working in the dollar sphere: a settlement and clearing system, BRICS Clear; a reference unit of account; a re-insurance structure and the BRICS Card – a retail payment card system similar to AliPay. Perhaps a Reserve Currency and the full Bretton Woods paraphernalia will prove unnecessary. Financial technology is evolving fast – and providing that the BRICS clearance system is functional, a multitude of fin-tech separate trade channels may ultimately be what results. But a ‘week is a long time in politics’. And one week later, the western intellectual paradigm was upended. The Shibboleths of the last fifty years were rejected across the board in the U.S. by voters. The ideology of ‘undoing’ the cultural past; the casting aside the lessons of history (for, it is claimed, ‘wrongful’ perspectives) and the rejection of systems of ethics reflected in the myths and stories of a community, have themselves been rejected! It is ok again to be a ‘civilisational state'. The radical doubting and cynicism of the Anglo-sphere is reduced to one perspective amongst many. And no longer can be the universal narrative. Well, post the U.S. election, BRICS sentiment must be turbo-charged. Notions that were not thinkable last week, just became possible and thinkable a week later. Historians may look back, and observe that the future architecture of modern global finance, modern global economy may have struggled to be born at Kazan, but is now a healthy infant. Will it all happen smoothly? Of course not. Differences between BRICS member and ‘partner’ states will remain, but this week a window has opened, fresh air has entered, and many will breathe more easily. If there is one thing that should be clear, a second Trump Administration is unlikely to feel the need to launch a ‘war on the world’ to maintain its global hegemony (as the 2022 National Defence Strategy insist it should). For the U.S. today faces its own internal structural contradictions to which Trump regularly alluded when he talked about the evaporated American real economy owing to the off-shored manufacturing base. A recent report by the RAND Organisation states starkly however, that the U.S. defence industrial base is unable to meet the equipment, technology, and munitions needs of the U.S. and its allies and partners. A protracted conflict, especially in multiple theatres, would require much greater capacity [– and a radically increased defence budget]. Trump’s industrial recuperation plan, however, of painfully high tariffs ringing American manufacturing; an end to Federal profligacy and lower taxes suggests however, a reversal into fiscal rectitude – after decades of fiscal laxity and uncontrolled borrowing. Not big military spending! (Defence spending, by the way, during the Cold War relied on top marginal income tax rates above 70 percent and corporate tax rates averaging 50 percent – which does not seem to accord with what Trump has in mind). Professor Richard Wolff comments in a recent interview that the West as a whole is in deep trouble financially, precisely as a result of such unrestrained government expenditures: 'For the first time, a couple of years ago, bondholders were unwilling to continue to fund the deficits of Great Britain, and [the UK government was thrown out]. Mr. Macron is now heading right down that same path. Bondholders have told the French that they are not going to continue to fund their national debt. Here’s how it works. Bondholders are telling the French, you have to rein in spending … The bondholders are saying, you have to stop running deficits. And, as every undergraduate knows, the way you would rein in deficits could be to cut spending. But there is an alternative: It’s called taxing. And it’s called taxing corporations and the rich because the others don’t have any more for you to tax – you’ve done all you can [do with taxes on ordinary French citizens]. [However] taxing corporations and the rich … somehow, is not only ‘not doable’, but not debatable. It can’t be put on the table: Nothing. (or, something so minuscule that will never deal with the deficit). We now have too much debt. And it turns out that the government, like the American government, is facing the next few years where it will have to spend as much on servicing its debt as it is on defence. And that doesn’t leave very much for everybody else. And everybody else is saying: no, no, no, no, no, no. And now the bondholder gets worried, because one way to resolve this would be to stop paying the bond holders and that, of course, must never be. So you’ve got two absurdities. You can’t stop paying the bondholders (when, of course, you can, but with dire consequences). And you can’t tax corporations and the rich. And, of course you can. I think we are reaching a point in which these contradictions have accumulated. You don’t have to be a Hegelian or a Marxist to understand that these accumulating contradictions are very profound, very large, and very fundamental'. They tell us that on the one hand that the world does not accept the western vision as being of universal application – and on the other hand, the West doesn’t have the financial clout to pursue global primacy – if it ever did: Zugzwang.

Trump’s Victory Has Sharpened Conflicts In Bangladesh – Analysis	The Muhammad Yunus regime in Bangladesh is unsettled by Trump's remarks on the communal situation in Bangladesh. But the ousted Awami League sees in them the seeds of covert American support for any effort it might make to come back to power with US and Indian support. It is generally accepted that the stunning victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election, will have a significant impact on various countries of the world. It is already having a significant impact on Bangladeshi politics at least. This is because the Trump, the President-elect, has spoken his mind on the troubled situation in Bangladesh, clearly indicating which side he is on in the fractious politics of that country. Trump's utterance on Bangladesh has deeply disturbed the Interim Government led by Dr.Muhammad Yunus. At the same time, it has kindled hopes of a return to power in the Awami League which was ousted from power by a mass movement in early August. And given the undisguised bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bangladeshis assume that any moves by Trump against Yunus in favour of Sheikh Hasina will have Modi's tacit support. This equation would make Trump a very formidable foe for Yunus and a very power ally for Hasina. What triggered the fear in the Yunus camp, was Trump's message on X to the Hindus in America on the occasion of Deepavali on October 31. 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,' he said. 'It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America,' he said. Supporting Hindutva, Trump added: 'We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi.' Trump's statement was a shot in the arm for the Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, who were already complaining of attacks on them during the student agitation against Sheikh Hasina's government. Hindus become Active On October 26, before Trump's Deepavali remarks, Hindus under the banner 'Sanatan Jagaran Manch' organised a massive rally in Chittagong, demanding protection. A meeting was held at the historic Lal Dighi Ground, where minority Hindus presented eight major demands. Some of the demands were: Establish a tribunal to prosecute individuals involved in crimes against the minorities; compensate victims and provide for their rehabilitation; legislate a Minority Protection Act immediately; form a Ministry of Minority Affairs; construct places of worship for minorities in every educational institution and allot prayer rooms in every hostel; upgrade Hindu, Buddhist and Christian Welfare Trusts to Hindu Foundations; and modernise Sanskrit and Pali education. More recently, following Trump's pro-Hindu speech, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was accused of indulging in attacks on the police and the army. Suspicions were sowed about ISKCON's motives and promoters, both domestically and internationally. Dhaka Tribune said that that ISKCON's behaviour was meant to provoke communal rioting in the country which would be an excuse for foreign intervention. The write-up added that ISKCON's rallies were attended by pro-Awami League Muslims also. In this way, the writer drew a link between Hindus, India and the Awami League, with Trump giving moral support. Dhaka Tribune pointed out that Bangladesh was desperately trying to restore order and peace and that it was inconsiderate on the part of Trump to say that there was 'barbaric violence' in Bangladesh, and that the nation was in 'a total state of chaos'. Not only was his statement not factual, but showed an utter disregard for niceties expected from a man about to be President of the United States. Dhaka Tribune said in an editorial: 'Indeed, at a time when the rest of the world is showing solidarity with the interim government under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus, Trump's unfortunate words are nothing but a disservice to the efforts being made to correct the wrongs that are undoubtedly present. While there is no denying that there remain untoward incidents of violence and lawlessness, something that this newspaper has reported on exhaustively and routinely editorializes on, to speak of these isolated incidents as the norm and condemning the entire nation as being gripped in chaos tells us that the former US president is either misinformed of the reality at present in Bangladesh, or worse.' In defence of the Interim Government, Chief Advisor, Yunus told the German TV Deutsche Welle that the attacks on the Hindus had taken place in the initial days of the violent mass movement when all suspected supporters of Sheikh Hasina were attacked. But these attacks stopped when police took action. He denied that his government was anti-Hindu. On Friday, the Army chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zaman attending a Buddhist function in Dhaka and assured the audience that Bangladesh was for all - Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians - and that Bangladesh had been the home of all these religions. He pointed out, that this year, the government saw to it that the Durga Puja went off 'beautifully'. Hasina's Message to Trump However, a more recent development caused great apprehension, if not consternation, in Bangladesh. It was Sheikh Hasina's message to Donal Trump congratulating him on his electoral victory. She had signed off her message designating herself as the 'Prime Minister of Bangladesh.' Having sent this message from exile in Delhi and to the pro-Modi Donald Trump, Hasina gave the impression in Bangladesh that she had done it with Delhi's nod. Hasina's being still 'Prime Minister of Bangladesh' was an issue earlier too. The President of Bangladesh, Mohammad Shahabuddin (her appointee), had told a Dhaka newspaper that Hasina had quit Bangladesh without submitting her resignation to him. This simple statement of fact was interpreted by student agitators as Shahabuddin's way of questioning the legitimacy of the Yunus government. Students stormed his residence and tried to force him to resign. But the Yunus government did not want a constitutional crisis as there would be no constitutional functionary left to maintain continuity if the President had resigned. Parliament had been dissolved earlier. Awami League Activated With Sheikh Hasina indicating that she is still Prime Minister, her party Awami League, got activated in Bangladesh. They tried to hold public meetings on November 10 to mark the death anniversary of Noor Hosain, a hero of the 1987 pro-democracy movement against President Gen.H.M. Ershad. It was stated that the Awami Leaguers were doing this at the instance of Sheikh Hasina who had also asked them to carry portraits of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Donald Trump. The anti-Awami League students and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters rushed to the venue of the Awami League meeting in Dhaka and beat up the Awami Leaguers. The police ended up arresting 50 Awami Leaguers. not the attackers. On November 11, students of Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organized a protest rally in Rangpur, demanding a ban on the Awami League. They also demanded that the accomplices of Hasina's authoritarianism hiding within the administration be identified and brought to trial. The Awami League's students' wing, the Chhatra League had already been banned. Bangkadesh Nationalist Party (BNP) cadres gathered outside Awami League's central office in Gulistan Dhaka, and chanted slogans against the Awami League. But over 100 AL leaders and activists brought out a procession in front of the BRTC bus terminal under the banner of the Dhaka South Awami League. Another procession was held in front of the South City Corporation, where leaders and activists from the Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League, Jubo League and other affiliated organizations took part. Meanwhile, some leaders and activists from the central AL and its affiliated organizations gathered in front of the Bangladesh Bank near Motijheel and marched toward Zero Point. But all of them were chased and attacked by BNP activists and the supporters of the Anti-Discriminatory Student Movement. Meanwhile, the Students of Jahangirnagar University demonstrated demanding that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's name be removed from one of the faculties.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4rna3sLS5IiZ	2024-11-11T16:39:38-08:00	
Internationalization Of The Rupee: India’s Significant Geo-Econom...	Internationalization of the rupee indicates that it may be freely exchanged between residents and non-residents and that it can be used as a reserve currency in international trade. It entails encouraging the use of the rupee for capital account transactions, other current account operations, and import and export trade. International Trade Settlement in Indian Rupees (INR) To promote the growth of global trade with an emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest of the global trading community in Indian currency (INR), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a new mechanism for international trade settlement in Indian rupees (INR). To encourage the use of theIndian currency in cross-border trade is one of the major goals of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 of India which comes into effect from April 1, 2023. The RBI has also updated from time to time about the broad framework for exporting goods and services from India according to the Master Direction of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). The approved dealer banks will need prior clearance from the RBI's foreign currency department before implementing this method. All exports and imports made in accordance with this arrangement may be priced in rupees. Market forces may decide the rate of exchange between the currencies of the two trade partners. The authorised dealer banks (DB) have been allowed to open rupee Vostro accounts (an account that a correspondent bank holds on behalf of another bank). The rupee payment system also allows Indian exporters to collect advance payments in Indian rupees from foreign importers against shipments. The surplus rupee balance in the Vostro accounts may be used for advanced flow management of export-import transactions, investments in government securities, and payments for projects and investments. According to the RBI, the authorised dealer bank maintaining the special Vostro account will have to ensure that the correspondent bank is not from a country or jurisdiction in the updated public statement of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions on which FATF has called for countermeasures. Driving factor In a move to counter Russia’s war over Ukraine, the US and the European Commission issued a joint statement to exclude seven Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system, which was the trigger point for all countries. This payment arrangement assumed greater importance in 2022–23 as India increased its dependence on discounted Russian oil, making it the second largest source of crude oil. Russia's exports to India in 2021 stood at $6.9 billion, mainly consisting of mineral oils, fertilisers, and rough diamonds, while India exported goods worth $3.33 billion to Russia in 2021, mainly comprising pharmaceutical products, tea, and coffee. In December 2022, India did its first settlement of foreign trade in rupees with Russia as part of the 'International Settlement of Trade in Indian Rupee' mechanism initiated by the RBI. As per the Bureau for International (BIS) Settlements 'Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022', as of April 2022, USD accounts for about 88% of global foreign exchange market turnover, followed by the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling. The Indian rupee accounts for a mere 1.6%. In March 2023, the RBI allowed the opening of Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) to put in place the mechanism forrupee trade settlement with as many as eighteen countries.It includes Botswana, Fiji, Germany, Guyana, Israel, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, New Zealand, Oman, Russia, the Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In April 2023, India and Malaysia agreed to settle trade in Indian rupees. Amid talks towards finalising a free trade agreement with India, Bangladesh is also considering the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees. Significance The most important advantage of internationalising the rupee is to reduce dependency on the USD for foreign trade. It would further increase the bargaining power of India in international business. Expanding the use of the rupee for international trade will reduce currency risk for Indian businesses by eliminating their exposure to currency volatility. This can reduce the cost of doing business and, hence, make exports more competitive in the global market. Additionally, the need to maintain forex reserves can be drastically reduced if a sizable share of India’s trade can be settled in terms of the domestic currency. What are the major roadblocks to the internationalization of the rupee? Rupee-trade arrangements are not easy to implement, which is why India and Russia have suspended efforts to settle bilateral trade in rupees after months of negotiations failed to convince the latter to keep rupees in their coffers. The rupee is not fully convertible; India's share of global exports of goods is just about 2%, and these factors reduce the necessity for other countries to hold rupees. India accounts for less than 4% of global services trade, 2.5% of global merchandise trade, and an even lower percentage of global financial activities. Consequently, Russia wanted the trade to be done in Chinese Yuan, UAE Dirham, or other currencies. India has a trade deficit with its major trading partners, including China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. In fact, India’s large trade deficit vis-à-vis Russia, which implies that the latter would be saddled with large rupee balances, is also why it has been reluctant to engage in rupee-rubble trade. Balancing exchange rate stability and domestic monetary policy is one of the major obstacles to the internationalization of the rupee. As the rupee becomes more internationalised, it is likely to become more vulnerable to external economic shocks, such as changes in global interest rates or fluctuations in commodity prices. This could make it more difficult for the central bank (RBI) to maintain both exchange rate stability and a domestically oriented monetary policy. When a currency is internationalised, both residents and non-residents can buy and sell domestic currency-denominated financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. This means that the demand and supply of the country's currency can be influenced not just by domestic but also external factors (outside the country). If this happens in the case of the rupee, the RBI will have limited control over the money supply within its own borders, which could make it difficult to maintain stable interest rates that are in line with the requirements of the domestic economy. For the rupee to be effectively internationalised, the government will have to remove restrictions on any entity (domestic or foreign) from buying or selling rupee; this implies no restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, which would require full convertibility on the capital account. However, successive Indian governments have avoided full convertibility on the capital account to prevent the Indian economy from being exposed to the risks of external financial shocks. What Measures Can Be Taken to Facilitate Rupee Internationalization? Among the emerging economies, China is the only country that has been able to steadily internationalise its currency while maintaining controls on its capital account. It has done so by finalising currency swap agreements between the central banks of China and 43 other countries, which assure the markets that there will not be an oversupply of the renminbi. Creating an offshore market for its domestic currency that allows foreign entities to sell renminbi for dollars However, it must not be forgotten that China also has a trade surplus with most of the other countries. India needs better planning It would require India to have considerable thinking and planning to make rupee-internationalization function in a manner that does not adversely affect the economy’s fundamentals. The government must carefully balance the benefits with the potential risks and respond appropriately to ensure the stability of the economy. It also requires India to have a large and deep domestic financial market to be better equipped to handle external shocks and make it easier for the RBI to manage its monetary policy. India has made a modest attempt at facilitating rupee trade; the idea will take time to gain acceptance. For the time being, the rupee’s acceptance will potentially be limited to countries that have a deficit with India. India will need to enrol other trade partners that will be able to use their rupees to buy goods from India. The US and European Union are the major export destinations for India, and the others would be oil-exporting nations. Getting the latter into our fold sounds plausible. Removal of restrictions on buying and selling of domestic currency in both the spot and forward markets. Domestic firms can invoice exports and imports in their own currency. Foreign firms, financial institutions, government institutions, and individuals can hold the country’s currency and financial instruments.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4su88VfW9QRY	2024-11-11T16:37:45-08:00	
Securing Bangladesh’s Energy Future: World Bank Offers Payment Gu...	In a move to stabilize energy supplies in Bangladesh, the World Bank (WB) has announced its commitment to supporting the country's access to affordable global energy resources. Abdoulaye Seck, the World Bank's Country Director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, recently reassured global suppliers about the WB's backing, offering payment guarantees to ease the procurement of gas. 'We tell suppliers: Global suppliers, don't worry, you can ship your gas to Bangladesh. We will back Bangladesh. You will not have any concerns about being paid,' Seck noted during a discussion held by the Association of Former Ambassadors at Bangladesh's Foreign Service Academy on November 6. This assurance comes as Bangladesh grapples with a growing energy demand amidst limited domestic resources and a foreign currency reserve crunch. The WB's guarantee could significantly lower Bangladesh's import costs, reducing risks for international suppliers and fostering an environment for more affordable gas imports. This initiative is part of the World Bank's broader support to Bangladesh's economy, with Seck emphasizing that securing gas at manageable costs remains the primary focus. Addressing Energy Supply Challenges Bangladesh has long been concerned with energy issues, which are expected to increase as industrial and residential demand rises. The current energy supply does not yet fully meet the growing demand, forcing Bangladesh to seek alternative energy sources to meet its immediate and long-term needs. Abdoulaye Seck highlighted the World Bank's intention to support Bangladesh through financial and advisory means. He also acknowledged the country's challenges in meeting its financial obligations, specifically in the energy sector, which impact energy import agreements with suppliers, including the Indian Adani Group. The WB's assurance of guaranteed payments to global suppliers is strategic in addressing these issues, particularly by enhancing supplier confidence. This guarantee could be a game-changer for Bangladesh as it seeks to lower energy costs. 'It means that the import price of Bangladesh will really go down,' Seck emphasized, underscoring the expected reduction in energy import costs if suppliers feel secure in receiving timely payments. Navigating Economic Pressures In the discussion, Seck pointed to Bangladesh's financial hurdles, noting the strain on the government's ability to meet payment obligations across multiple sectors, a reality evident in its energy import bills. He acknowledged the government's difficulties in balancing import costs with currency reserve management, which remains a pressing issue. The Bangladesh government has taken steps to negotiate support from the World Bank, especially as Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, faces dwindling foreign reserves, which have reportedly dropped from over $40 billion to a much lower figure in recent years. This decline has been attributed to Bangladesh Bank's policy of supporting the exchange rate, which, according to Seck, has led to unsustainable outcomes. Recognizing the need for reform, Seck reiterated that the WB is poised to offer budgetary support focused on green growth, environmental sustainability, and economic resilience. Pivotal Budget Support and Long-term Growth Bangladesh's economic resilience depends heavily on maintaining strong foreign reserves and controlling inflation. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), expressed optimism over the World Bank's decision to offer budget support rather than project-specific aid. He believes that budgetary support will strengthen Bangladesh's reserves and stabilize remittance flows. With remittances projected to exceed $2 billion, they play a crucial role in bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves, which in turn stabilizes the local currency, the taka. In an economy heavily affected by inflation, the general public's quality of life is intricately linked to purchasing power. As Rahman observed, the interim government's performance will ultimately be judged based on citizens' standards of living and purchasing power. Addressing the inflationary pressures affecting Bangladeshi citizens is a key priority, and, as Rahman suggested, the WB's support is pivotal in sustaining economic stability. Driving Structural Reforms With the economic challenges mounting, the government has formed six reform committees focused on long-term improvements in financial governance, resource mobilization, and administrative reforms. Rahman highlighted that while these committees provide a foundation for reform, their success will largely depend on the technical, analytical, and financial support available to them. One of the most pressing areas for reform lies in domestic resource mobilization. Developing a digitalized, efficient domestic revenue system could help Bangladesh reduce its reliance on foreign aid and shore up its budget. As Rahman noted, such structural changes will require bold decision-making and sustained support from international partners like the World Bank. The WB's involvement is expected to go beyond immediate financial assistance, extending to a comprehensive assessment of the country's economy to identify areas needing reform. Rahman reiterated that, with the right support, these changes could set Bangladesh on a sustainable path, reducing dependency on international aid and strengthening its fiscal position. World Bank's Focus on Energy Security and Economic Resilience The World Bank's support for Bangladesh is not limited to budgetary allocations; it encompasses a vision for a more resilient and self-reliant economy. The WB's immediate focus on energy security is closely linked to Bangladesh's economic resilience, as energy shortages and high import costs have a cascading effect on productivity, inflation, and overall economic growth. Seck indicated that the WB is committed to providing extensive support across multiple sectors, including health and flood management, highlighting the organization's holistic approach to Bangladesh's growth. This support is timely as Bangladesh's economy faces challenges from global market volatility, climate change, and evolving social needs. Seck remains optimistic, asserting that Bangladesh, with the right policy adjustments and strong economic fundamentals, can return to a growth path that is both sustainable and robust. Ensuring Sustainable Economic Growth The WB's payment guarantee for energy imports is a critical step toward alleviating Bangladesh's energy challenges, but it is also part of a broader strategy to ensure sustainable growth. In the wake of these developments, Bangladesh is encouraged to prioritize economic reform, green growth, and social resilience. This focus on sustainability aligns with the WB's commitment to fostering long-term growth rather than merely addressing short-term concerns. The World Bank's ongoing budgetary support, slated for release by December, is intended to provide immediate financial relief while creating opportunities for Bangladesh to stabilize its economy. This support also aligns with the WB's green growth initiatives, which seek to integrate environmental sustainability with economic progress. As Seck noted, a comprehensive focus on policy reforms and green development can steer Bangladesh toward a sustainable future. Public Sentiment and Future Prospects For Bangladesh's citizens, inflation remains one of the most pressing concerns. The World Bank's support is expected to have a ripple effect across sectors, helping to alleviate inflationary pressures and improve living standards. However, much of the public's confidence in the government will depend on tangible improvements in their everyday lives, particularly in terms of purchasing power and economic stability. As Bangladesh moves forward with reforms and economic adjustments, the WB's involvement provides an essential safety net, ensuring that energy supplies remain secure and affordable. This partnership also underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing global economic challenges, as Bangladesh's stability is crucial not only for its own citizens but also for the broader region. Conclusion The World Bank's payment guarantee for global gas suppliers is a bold step in addressing Bangladesh's energy and economic challenges. This initiative, combined with budgetary support focused on green growth, represents a holistic approach to Bangladesh's development. The WB's partnership aims to stabilize Bangladesh's energy imports, control inflation, and promote long-term growth through structural reforms. With international backing, Bangladesh is positioned to implement the necessary reforms to achieve sustainable economic growth and resilience, signaling a promising future for its citizens and the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4thWPNnBKx9F	2024-11-11T16:36:29-08:00	
Will Unrestricted Arms Supplies To Israel Continue Under Trump? –...	After US presidential elections on November 5, a question floating around the US and Middle Eastern capitals relates to Gaza, which has been devastated largely by US-supplied weapons, including fighter planes, air-to-ground missiles, battle tanks, armored personnel carriers (APCs) and 2,000-pound unguided bombs. Will the incoming Trump administration restrict weapons deliveries to Israel or continue the outgoing Biden administration’s policy of unrestrained arms supplies to the Netanyahu government causing more deaths and destruction? The guessing game continues. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the casualties so far include 43,391 plus killed, and at least 102,347 wounded in the Gaza Strip, including 59% women, children, and elderly, as of October 21, 2024. The issues before American voters at the presidential elections last week, where the Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris lost to Republican candidate Donald Trump, included the rising cost of living, the unrestricted flow of thousands of asylum seekers across the border into the US and Biden’s refusal to restrict arms sales to Israel despite country-wide protests. Democrats ignored Gaza The headline in an op-ed piece in the New York Times November 10 by Peter Beinart, a contributing Opinion writer and an editor-at-large of 'Jewish Currents', was on target: DEMOCRATS IGNORED GAZA, AND IT BROUGHT DOWN THEIR PARTY. 'Over the past year, Israel’s slaughter and starvation of Palestinians – funded by US taxpayers and live-streamed on social media—has triggered one of the greatest surges in progressive activism in a generation,' he wrote. Many Americans roused to action by their government’s complicity in Gaza’s destruction have no personal connection to Palestine or Israel, Beinart pointed out. Like many Americans who protested South African apartheid or the Vietnam war, their motive is not ethnic or religious. It is moral, he declared. Dr. Natalie Goldring, who represents the Acronym Institute at the United Nations, on conventional weapons and arms trade issues, told IDN the US government has been a stalwart supporter and defender of the Israeli government, and has been its most significant weapons supplier for several decades. 'But the reality is that US weapons supplies give Israel the capacity to continue prosecuting wars on multiple fronts. The Israeli government has defined its actions as self-defense in the aftermath of the horrendous Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Instead of acting in self-defense, the Israelis have carried out widespread indiscriminate attacks that have disproportionately affected civilians,' she said. $23 billion in US military aid to Israel The Watson Institute recently documented nearly $23 billion in US military aid to Israel and what it describes as related US operations from the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 through the end of September 2024. These weapons included 2000-pound bombs, artillery shells, and precision-guided munitions. [See 'If the US government were willing to halt transfers of US weapons and ammunition to the Israeli government, that would cover the vast majority of weapons Israel receives. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) for example, from 2019-2023, the United States was responsible for nearly 70 percent of the dollar value of Israeli arms imports.' 'It’s also important to remember that US weapons manufacturers have a profit motive in continuing providing massive supplies of weapons to Israel. Weapons manufacturers aren’t neutral participants in these processes.' 'Unfortunately, the prospects for change weren’t good before the US presidential election, and are probably worse now. It seems quite unlikely that President Biden would finally stand up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and halt US arms transfers, for example.' 'And Prime Minister Netanyahu has little incentive to negotiate with President Biden, probably anticipating a friendlier reception from Donald Trump after his inauguration in January,' Dr Goldring declared. Zain Hussain, a Researcher at SIPRI told IDN the US is the most important supplier of major conventional arms to Israel. In 2019-2023, the US supplied 69% of Israel’s imports of major arms. This was comprised of aircraft, armored vehicles and missiles, among other things. The US, he said, sees Israel as a key strategic ally in the Middle East and a strong means of supporting US interests in the region. Enshrined in US law in 2008, it is committed to preserving Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region, which is Israel’s ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from states or from non-state actors, while sustaining minimal damages and casualties. 'As part of this consideration is the perceived need for Israel to have superior military means compared to other individual or possible coalition of states or non-state actors that could pose a credible conventional military threat to Israel.' The US has committed to providing $3.8 billion a year in financial military aid to Israel between 2019 and 2028. The Israeli and US arms industries engage in deep cooperation in different fields, including missile defence. This can be seen in Israel’s three-tiered air defence system: the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow, Hussain said. Israel has been dependent on the US for key military capabilities. All active combat aircraft of the Israeli air force are of US origin. Israel has also relied on the US for the supply of certain missiles and munitions, and one of the most important aspects of Israel’s defence, its air defence systems, also involves cooperation with the US. In times of conflict, US supplied arms have been crucial for Israel’s operations. In case of the current war in Gaza, US supplied aircraft, bombs and missiles have been indispensable for Israel’s operation, said Hussain. Dr Goldring pointed out that at the beginning of November, the government of Türkiye submitted a letter to the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo against Israel, including both weapons and ammunition. The letter was signed by more than 50 states as well as the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It cited the Israeli government’s violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and argued that any country that sold weapons to Israel was complicit in genocide. 'Given that the US has a veto in the Security Council, the call for an international arms embargo on Israel is unlikely to be successful. Even so, the letter to the Security Council is an important statement about the international community’s growing concern about the nature and extent of Israeli attacks,' declared Dr Goldring. Meanwhile, in a statement released November 10, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, welcomed the reported freeze on the delivery of bulldozers to Israel as an 'implicit admission' by the Biden administration that the far-right Netanyahu government is using that equipment in the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. CAIR said the freeze on the bulldozers used in ethnic cleansing must be followed with an end to weapons deliveries to Israel. [NOTE: An editorial in the Israeli media outlet Haaretz today admitted that the 'Israeli military is conducting an ethnic cleansing operation in the northern Gaza Strip.'] According to Israeli media, the delivery of 130 D9 bulldozers to Israel was reportedly frozen because of use of the bulldozers to demolish homes in Gaza and Lebanon. According to the Watson report, U.S. arms deliveries to Israel, October 7, 2023 to September 2024 included the following: 4,127,000 kilograms JP-8 jet fuel; 57,000 155mm artillery shells; 36,000 rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition; 20,000 M4A1 rifles; 13,981 anti-tank missiles; 8,700 (Mk82) 500-pound bombs; 3,500 night vision devices; 3,000 Joint Direct Attack Munitions; 14,100 (Mk84) 2,000 pound unguided bombs; 3,000 laser-guided Hellfire missiles; 1,800 (M141) bunker buster bombs; 2,600 250-pound small diameter bombs; 200 Switch Blade (Series 600) drones; more than 100 Skydio X series drones and 75 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4ot1sus-mdLf	2024-11-11T16:34:30-08:00	
Sino-US Relations May Face Intensified Strains Under Trump 2.0 – ...	The arrival of a second Trump administration is expected to drastically impact the complex fabric of Sino-American relations. Apparently, Beijing is acutely aware of what that could mean: heightened tensions and renewed confrontations on multiple fronts. Sino-American relations, already frayed, may face an era marked by intensified scrutiny, as Trump's rhetoric and policies often frame China as a strategic adversary rather than a partner in global stability. This trajectory is not without grave implications. The stakes here are monumental, touching every corner of the global economy and the daily lives of billions. Good relations between the U.S. and China mean shared prosperity, peace, and predictability. Yet the current bipartisan unity in Washington - to approach China with an hawkish angle - suggests otherwise. This unified American approach, rare in such polarized times, reflects the deepening shift in U.S. policy, a signal to Beijing that the trump administration may intensify this hardened stance, complicating any pathway toward constructive engagement. During the recent presidential campaign, there was an intense rivalry between Democrats and Republicans to be seen as 'tough' on China. For many politicians on both sides of teh divided, a 'soft' stance on China meant nearly a career-ending label. China was often mentioned in the recent bruising election season. For China, this campaign spotlight hints at potential for strategic adjustments in U.S. policy, despite the Americans' obvious trend toward toughness. Trump's stance on China has been strikingly consistent in its bluntness: he casts China as the villain behind America's economic woes, blaming U.S. 'weakness' for a perceived loss of manufacturing and blue-collar livelihoods. In a renewed Trump era, Beijing could expect a focus on trade balances, economic rivalry, and security cooperation - areas where Trump believes his brand of deal-making shines. He'd likely avoid contentious topics like human rights, which don't fit his transactional priorities. Instead, it's a style of diplomacy laser-focused on interests that directly impact the U.S. From China's perspective, this values-free pragmatism may offer clarity but little in the way of partnership or nuanced understanding - another reminder of the narrow lens through which he views the world. Following Trump's return to the world stage, President Xi Jinping extended a measured yet hopeful gesture, urging for a revival of diplomacy that recognizes the delicate but essential link between the U.S. and China. In his congratulatory message, Xi struck a careful balance, acknowledging the stakes of Sino-U.S. relations and advocating for a practical collaboration. 'History has shown,' he remarked, 'that a stable, sustainable China-U.S. relationship aligns not only with our mutual interests but with those of the global community.' Xi's words reflected Beijing's ongoing drive to rebuild the trade bridge with Washington through a framework of mutual benefit - a win-win approach that has served as the foundation of past U.S.-China economic ties. Amid heightened tensions, particularly with the recent U.S. and European tariff hikes on Chinese electric vehicles, Xi's message was clear: China remains open to dialogue and cooperation, even as Washington adopts a more protectionist stance. By extending this olive branch, Xi signals a willingness to work with the Trump administration, to find common ground, and to ease the strains of an escalating trade war—a nod to the potential for a pragmatic coexistence despite the challenges ahead. In his message to Donald Trump, President Xi Jinping offered a pragmatic framework to steer Sino-U.S. relations forward, proposing three guiding principles grounded in the notion that cooperation yields far greater benefits than confrontation for the world's two largest economies. Xi's proposal underscores the need for understanding each other's strategic motivations, addressing sensitive issues - such as Taiwan and the South China Sea - responsibly, and leveraging shared strengths to drive economic growth. With U.S.-China relations at a historic low, Xi's approach signals a pivot from the 'show of strength' rhetoric that has dominated recent years, urging Washington to prioritize common interests over zero-sum strategies. Beijing appears committed to dialogue, viewing it as essential for sustaining any productive relationship. Notably, bilateral working groups between China and the U.S. have continued, a testament to the resilience of diplomatic channels even amid strained ties. Through consistent, open communication, Xi suggests, both nations could recognize that their roles as global stakeholders demand collaboration on issues such as climate change, technological innovation, and global trade - areas where partnership could yield mutual gains rather than exacerbating rivalry. But as Xi's outreach underscores, the future of this relationship rests heavily on how Trump, a leader with a history of unpredictable foreign policy moves, will handle this delicate balancing act. The global dynamics have shifted significantly since his first presidency, and his approach this time could either alleviate or intensify global tensions. If Trump can embrace Xi's call for mutual respect and strategic cooperation, the outcome could foster not just bilateral stability but a positive ripple effect on global economic and political landscapes. The opportunity for progress is there, but it hinges on a recalibration toward a partnership that transcends narrow national interests for the broader, shared goal of global stability. Confrontation, as recent years have shown, yields no winners—only mutual setbacks. The U.S.-China trade war, launched in 2018, inflicted palpable damage on the American economy without truly addressing its underlying concerns. Instead of yielding breakthroughs, tariffs have strained industries on both sides, denoting the limitations of a high-tariff, protectionist approach. From Beijing's perspective, the way forward for a new administration is a pragmatic pivot toward expanded trade ties. If the U.S. genuinely seeks economic revitalization, it would be wiser to pursue cooperation over zero-sum tactics that deepen divisions. President Trump, a self-described pragmatist, might consider that mutual economic growth and stability are more feasible than continued escalation. While U.S. and Chinese interests diverge on some fronts, these differences need not preclude a workable arrangement that serves both sides. Beijing has consistently conveyed that it has no intention of displacing Washington's role on the global stage; rather, it seeks a 'peaceful coexistence' that acknowledges shared interests. After years of volatility, a recalibration that emphasizes coexistence could move the U.S.-China relationship forward in a constructive direction - one that benefits not just both nations, but the global community.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4vIGg4NdYvKo	2024-11-11T16:32:06-08:00	
India: Delays Homecoming In Chhattisgarh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On November 7, 2024, Padam Some (29), a top-ranking female Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadre, carrying a reward of INR 100,000 on her head, surrendered to the Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Sukma District. Padam, a resident of Chhote Kedwal under the Chintalnar Police Station limits in Sukma District, was involved in Naxalite [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] activities in Thana Golapalli, Maraiguda, Kistaram, and the Chintagufa area. She was the 'president' of the Singhanamdagu Revolutionary People's Committee (RPC)'s 'Janatana Sarkar' (people's government of the Maoists) and used to be very active in the organization. On October 29, 2024, five CPI-Maoist cadres, including a female Maoist on whom a reward of INR 500,000 had been announced, surrendered in Bijapur District. Those who surrendered include Sushila aka Bujji aka Vimala Hemla, who served as an 'area committee member (ACM)' and had joined the organisation in 2009, in the children's wing of Maoists, and then worked as a 'militia' ('base force' a secondary force of the Maoists' people's army) member in 2013. She was mainly involved in firing on the Police party and Security Force (SF) personnel in January 2018 in Mutvendi village and in gun battles with Police in Pidmel, Jingaon, and Simepalli between 2018 and 2019. She was active till 2023. The other four were Sukhram Modiyam, Suddu Korsa, Lakku Farsa, and Sannu Madvi, who have been involved in serious criminal activities, including murder, attacking the Police, planting spike holes, digging roads, and using lethal weapons such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), for a long time. The surrendered Maoists were associated with the Aheri 'Area Committee' of Gadchiroli Division and the 'West Bastar Division Party', and included 'section commanders' of the Bandepara RPC 'militia' as well as the Bodlapusanar Grama Rakshaka Dalam (GRD) 'commander'. On October 25, 2024, six CPI-Maoist cadres carrying a combined reward of INR 2.4 million on their heads surrendered before SFs in Sukma District. The surrendered Maoists, who had been active in the district, were identified as Pawan aka Kamalu Hemla, Bandu aka Bandi Sodi, Kunjam Roshan akaMahadev, Dashru aka Kotesh Sodi, and the two women Maoist cadres Kamala aka Bandi Dudhi and Madvi aka Nagul Sushila. These recent incidents of surrender are among many more by the CPI-Maoist cadres, who have surrendered citing that they have been troubled by the discrimination, neglect and atrocities on tribals in the Maoist organization. They have also stated that they were influenced by the surrender and rehabilitation policy of the government and decided to leave the path of violence and return to the mainstream to live a peaceful life. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 304 Naxalites have surrendered in Chhattisgarh in the current year, thus far (data till November 10, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 159 Naxalites had surrendered in the state. Another, 28 Naxalitessurrendered in the remaining part of the year, taking the total to 187 through 2023. 182 Naxalites had surrendered in 2022 and 328 in 2021. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) across the country, at least 4,435 Naxalites have surrendered in the state. An analysis of the surrender data since March 6, 2000, suggests that around 96.39 per cent have taken place in the troubled Bastar Division Bastar Division, which is still considered a significant threat and the 'Final Maoist Bastion,' accounting for 4,275 surrenders, as compared to a total of 4,435 in Chhattisgarh. Such surrenders across the country stood at 17,180. The Bastar Division, spread over a geographical area of over 40,000 square kilometres, comprises seven of Chhattisgarh's 33 districts: Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, and Sukma. To facilitate the surrender of the Naxalites, some districts in the state launched specific initiatives to encourage insurgents to abandon their fight and to join the mainstream. Significantly, the Lon Varratu (a local Gondi dialect expression, meaning return to your home/village) Scheme was launched by Dantewada District Police on June 12, 2020, and it offered a range of incentives to encourage Naxalites to abandon their fight against the state and clear their names from Police records. So far 204 rewarded Naxalites have surrendered under this campaign, out of a total of 880 Naxalites who have joined the mainstream of society under this campaign (till October 21, 2024). Likewise, the Poona Narkom (a local Gondi dialect expression, meaning New Dawn) Scheme was launched by the Sukma District Police on August 9, 2021, and it offered medical facilities that were organised through medical camps in different places of the district, including the district headquarters, for the tribal villagers of rural areas, in collaboration with the district health department. Though the specific number of surrenders under the campaign have not been released, according to the SATP database, at least 436 surrenders have taken place Sukma district since then. Moreover, on February 15, 2024, Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai disclosed that the Chhattisgarh government had decided to launch amenities and welfare schemes for villages in Maoist-affected regions of the state. Sai announced the Niyad Nellanar, scheme which emulates the Centre's Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha AbhiyaN (PM-JANMAN)scheme, catering to the socio-economic welfare of particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). The initiative, which has been taken from the local Dandami term meaning 'Your Good Village', extends essential services and welfare benefits through security camps in Bastar. The ambit of these benefits is to extend to the villages situated within a five-kilometres radius of security camps. Chief Minister Sai stated, 'These security camps will act as not only the police camps, but also as multi-faceted development camps wherein the government will ensure the availability of over 25 basic amenities besides extending the benefits of 32 individual-focused government schemes in the Maoist-affected villages… The government has provisioned an additional Rs.20 crore for this scheme and, if needed, more funds will be provided by both central and state governments.' In recent times, Bastar has seen the establishment of at least 14 new security camps, and these have been opened near the villages so that the people living within a radius of 5 kilometers will be provided the same facilities as the beneficiaries of the PM JANMAN Yojana implemented for special backward tribes. In these villages, all the families are provided housing facilities under the Prime Minister's Housing Scheme, ration cards to all, free rice, gram-salt, jaggery and sugar to all, 4 free gas cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme, Anganwadi (rural child care centre) and community hall, similar to the special backward tribes, Sub Health Centre, Primary School, Irrigation pumps including bore wells for irrigation of farms, hand pumps, solar pumps, sports ground in every village, free electricity, bank Sakhi (women trained to facilitate banking operations), ATM, skill development, forest rights lease, mobile tower, DTH and TV. Facilities including helipads and bus facility till block the headquarters are also to be provided. In the interim, on October 7, 2024, as a final offer for Maoists to shun violence and join the mainstream, Chief Minister Sai announced that his government would soon come up with a surrender policy incorporating the best practices implemented by different states. In the proposed policy, the surrendered Maoists would be housed together in a colony under central schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Sai disclosed, further, 'All surrendered Maoists could be housed together in such a colony, which could be in the district headquarters. They will be provided security in that place. It is still in a policy stage. Our deputy CM is visiting different states to study their surrender policy and incorporate the best practices. He has already been to Assam. They (surrendered Maoists) will be given jobs and training once the policy is introduced. We urge Maoists to join mainstream otherwise our forces from both Centre and state are fully prepared on the ground.' Meanwhile, on September 20, 2024, Union Home Minister (UHM) and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah, while appealing to the Maoists to give up violence, lay down arms and surrender, set March 31, 2026, as the date to end Naxalism in the country. UHM Shah appealed to LWEs to abjure the path of violence and join the mainstream of society. Addressing 55 victims of Naxal violence 55 victims of Naxal violence , from Chhattisgarh under the aegis of Bastar Peace Committee at his residence in New Delhi on the same day, UHM Shah declared, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided that Naxal violence and ideology will be wiped out from the country. March 31, 2026, has been fixed as the last day of Naxalism in this country and I ensure that we will finish Naxalism before that… I want to appeal to those who have picked up guns to surrender. In the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, many have surrendered and joined the mainstream. But if it does not happen, we will initiate operations and will ensure it is successful. Meanwhile, as many as 3,752 Naxalites have been arrested and 1,608 have been killed in the state in the current year, thus far (data till November 10, 2024). The number of surrenders of disillusioned Maoists are increasing gradually from the troubled Bastar division and erstwhile stronghold areas of the rebels in the state. With both the governments - state and union -comprehensively implementing the proposed surrender and rehabilitation policies, along with aggressive developmental initiatives, particularly in roads, infrastructure and communications, there is increasing likelihood that the remaining Naxalitesmay join the mainstream and lead a peaceful life in the state and across the country.

Myanmar’s Civil War And Its Implication For Regional Security – O...	The Myanmar civil war is the longest ongoing civil war in the world. The civil war dates back to the country's independence from British colonial rule in 1948. Armed conflict between various ethnic minority groups and the central government began soon after the country’s independence. In subsequent decades the war has been raging on. The civil war gained more momentum, especially in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The main reason for Myanmar's civil war can be attributed to the demand for autonomy or independence of different provinces by ethnic armed groups. The civil war intensified in response to the 2021 military coup toppling the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Analyzing the historical, ethnic, and political background, it becomes clear to us why the Myanmar civil war has been going on for so long. Wilson Center in their report cited several factors as the main reasons for this protracted war in Myanmar: a. Military coup, b. Hybrid regime, c. Failure of civil government, and d. ethnic history However, in this article we will discuss the current situation of the civil war in Myanmar. On 1 February 2021, Myanmar's military known as Tatmadaw overthrew the NLD government of Aung San Suu Kyi, elected in 2020, in a military coup and established a military junta. The elected government arrested President U Myint and state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. General Min Aung Hlaing, chief of the Tatmadaw forces, moved to the center of power. In response to the coup, on 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician Min Ko Naing announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG). The NUG declared the People's Defense Force (PDF) as its armed wing. More than 30 armed rebel groups from various states in Myanmar expressed solidarity with the PDF. In September 2021, the National Unity Government declared a state of emergency across the country. They call the situation a 'defensive war of the people' against the military junta. After the declaration of war, clashes broke out across the country between PDF militias, various armed groups, and the military junta. Thus, after a temporary democracy, the country was once again embroiled in a devastating civil war. In October 2023, the civil war took a new turn when three ethnic minority armed groups joined forces to ally. The Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army formed the 'Three Brotherhood Alliance'. Currently, the Three Brotherhood Alliance is operating under the umbrella of the NUG and providing them with support on various fronts. On October 27, 2023, the Alliance launched an attack on the Tatmadaw. This attack was the beginning of Operation 1027. The main objective of this operation is to overthrow the military rulers from power. A regional security crisis is emerging as a result of Myanmar's civil war. The refugee crisis, drug and human trafficking, arms smuggling, etc. have created a very uncomfortable situation for Myanmar's neighboring states. As for China, some Myanmar scams center on China's border, which poses a threat to China's national and social security. According to a 2024 report by Crisis Group, these scam centers kidnap educated young women from different countries and force them at gunpoint to scam foreign nationals. These include Bitcoin scams, wildlife sales, drugs, etc. But the most common fraud is through embezzlement. Abductees are subjected to unspeakable torture in these scam centers, akin to modern-day slavery. These centers are largely controlled by the Chinese mafia, according to a 2023 report by the Associated Press. The newspaper claims that since Myanmar's military government receives a share of the income of these fraud centers, they do not take any strong action to suppress these illegal activities. The Chinese government has long been putting diplomatic pressure on the Myanmar junta to take action on the issue. However, the military did not take any visible action. The situation changed in October 2023 when ethnic armed groups went to war against the junta. The groups destroyed numerous scam centers near the Chinese border and freed kidnapped citizens as they seized towns and military posts in northern Shan State. On the one hand, the insurgents hope to destroy the relationships of these mafia groups with the military government and on the other hand, to get the support of China. The rebels handed the arrested criminals to Chinese custody to gain more support from China. Currently, they are imprisoned in various Chinese prisons. Also, there are several projects underway in Myanmar under China's Belt and Road Initiative, among which is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that stretches from Kunming in China to Mandalay in Myanmar. The corridor extends through central Myanmar, east to Yangon, and west to the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, which China helped build. By extracting gas from the Bay of Bengal, the Myanmar government transports it to Kunming, China through a 1,060 km long gas and oil pipeline from the deep-sea port established at Kyaukpyu. However, this economic corridor is supposed to be connected to China by highways and railways, but it has not yet happened. China signed a $7.3 billion deal with Myanmar to build the Kyaukpyu deep-sea port. According to the agreement, China will operate the port for the next 50 years with an option to extend it by another 25 years. According to experts, if China can complete the road and railway project, the Kyaukpyu Port will give China access to the Indian Ocean through the Bay of Bengal. China has long pressured Myanmar's junta government to reduce conflict in the region in consideration of these projects, which has created some tension between the Chinese and the Junta. India's role in Myanmar is different from that of China. India has two projects in Myanmar. These are the Kaladan Multi-Modal Project (KMMP) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Project (IMTTP). India is trying to establish regional connectivity with Myanmar through projects. The objective of KMMP is to develop connectivity with the Northeast region of India through Bangladesh and Myanmar. Also connects Kolkata Port in India with Sittwe Port in Myanmar and extends to Mizoram via the Myanmar Highway. The IMTTP aims to connect India's border town of Moreh with Thailand's Mae Sot via Myanmar. This will establish a land route for uninterrupted trade, business, education, and tourism between the three countries. As a result of Operation 1027, which started in October 2023, the projects are facing many delays. Besides, China's relationship with Myanmar has increased the strategic importance of Myanmar to India. China's growing political and economic influence within Myanmar, and its efforts to secure access to the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar, have become a cause for concern for India. China's establishment of the Sino-Myanmar Economic Corridor and the recent establishment of a surveillance facility on Myanmar's Coco Island in the Bay of Bengal have made India uneasy. China's emergence as a major source of foreign direct investment and China's position as Myanmar's largest trading partner has caused considerable concern for the Indians. Also, as a result of this war, there is an ongoing conflict between the Myanmar military and rebel forces on the border with Thailand. The two groups clashed in the strategically important Myawaddy on the Thai border, where the rebel Karen forces have withdrawn their troops. The war is having a 'spillover effect' on Thailand. A large number of people are fleeing to Thailand, both legally and illegally, to escape the military's persecution and conscription law in the war. There are currently 91,337 Myanmar refugees in Thailand. This has created many problems for Thailand's internal security. Thailand is trying to deal with the problem. Therefore, they together with the ASEAN member countries are searching for a solution. Historically, Bangladesh's relationship with Myanmar can be said to be complicated, especially on the Rohingya issue. Bangladesh has been providing shelter to Myanmar refugees for a long time. Currently, according to UNHCR data, 972,904 Rohingya refugees are staying in Bangladesh, which is affecting Bangladesh in various dimensions. Also, the recent infiltration of the Bangladesh border by the armed forces is a threat to the internal security of Bangladesh. Myanmar's civil war is currently quite uncertain. The military is losing ground very quickly. Only a handful of cities in the country are under military control which is unprecedented. We can imagine that the long period of misrule has motivated the people to stand up against the military. Apart from this, the other armed groups also found some degree of unity among themselves for the first time. However, the durability of this unity is questionable, as unity among so many groups has not lasted long in Myanmar's long history. But whatever the outcome of Myanmar's civil war, Bangladesh will have to work on strengthening its internal security, especially in dealing with the refugee crisis. Because even if the war ends which is highly improbable, sending back so many refugees is quite a challenge. In this regard, Bangladesh has to work together with the international community. Myanmar has been violating international law for several years. They have also done anti-humanities like genocide, especially on Rohingyas. Apart from this, they have often carried out mortar attacks inside Bangladesh, resulting in the casualties of many Bangladeshi citizens. This civil war is affecting Bangladesh as well as other neighboring countries of Myanmar. In this regard, Bangladesh should put diplomatic pressure on Myanmar by coordinating with these countries. Another notable point is that the Arakan Army is in a strong position in the Arakan state bordering Bangladesh. But, according to some news outlets like Al Jazeera, the Arakan Army itself does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar. The Arakan Army has also been accused of burning Rohingya houses and conducting genocide. However, the Arakan Army denied the allegations. If the Arakan Army takes full control of Arakan in the civil war or if the military forces collapse, then Bangladesh should negotiate with the Arakan Army for the rehabilitation of Rohingyas. Besides NUG can also sit in discussions with the interim government. However, doing so would make Bangladesh’s relations with Myanmar's junta government difficult. Bangladesh should monitor the war situation and maintain apparent neutrality. No matter which side wins the war, measures should be taken by keeping an eye on all sides for the sake of Bangladesh's national security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4jfWpNJh9WLg	2024-11-11T16:27:54-08:00	
India’s Path To Becoming A Global Manufacturing Hub: A Long Journ...	The setting up of Tata-Airbus plant in Vadodara (Gujarat), is the first private project in India for the manufacture of aircraft in India. The aircraft manufacturing facility set up by Tata Advance Systems Limited in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space, Spain is part of India's attempt to become self–reliant in the manufacture and assembly of C-295 medium-lift tactical transport aircraft and to reduce foreign dependence. While inaugurating the plant, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, 'We are already working to make India an aviation hub. This ecosystem will pave the way for Made-in-India civil aircraft in the future.' India's quest to become a global manufacturing hub continues to face hurdles because of inadequate physical infrastructure, land acquisition challenges, complex regulatory procedures and supply chain bottlenecks. India continues to assemble products like mobile phones, as it has not created a manufacturing ecosystem like China. India continues to rely on China in many core sectors like electronics, solar and mobile manufacturing and its imports from China constitutes over 60 per cent of its requirements. India's Manufacturing Landscape: Achievements and Challenges Although India's manufacturing sector has made significant strides in recent years, however, it most of the plants set up in India in collaboration with Japan, South Korea and China stays heavily reliant on assembling components imported from countries like China, Taiwan, and the USA. This dependence on foreign components poses a challenge, particularly as international companies are often reluctant to share the technical know-how needed to produce high-end, sensitive equipment within India. As a result, India's efforts to close the gap with China are complicated. Estimates suggest it may take India 15 to 20 years to catch up with China, influenced by factors like economic policies, infrastructure, workforce skills, and geopolitical dynamics. For instance, in mobile phone production, India struggles with high defect rates with estimates suggesting a defect rate of around 50%, far higher compared to Chinese factories. India can become world's smartphone making hub, only when it starts manufacturing the parts in India. Unfortunately, India continues to rely on imported parts from China for the assembly because as it lacks an ecosystem of component manufacturers in the country. China remains the world's largest manufacturing nation, accounting for 28.7% of global manufacturing output. Even in the field of solar manufacturing, where India continues to make great strides, India depends on China for around 60% of its solar equipment. This reliance is largely due to China's dominance in the global solar supply chain, controlling 97% of polysilicon production and 80% of solar module manufacturing China's manufacturing process is built on decades of investment in infrastructure, skilled labour, and technological innovation. The country boasts a well-established supply chain, efficient coordination, and competitive costs, making it an attractive destination for global manufacturers. In contrast, India is still working on strengthening its logistics network, which remains less efficient than China's. Technological Gaps and Innovation While India has made progress in manufacturing, its role remains largely limited to assembly rather than the development of technologies. This is partly due to reluctance from international companies like Samsung and Apple, which have raised concerns about the quality of India's skilled workforce. Today, China leads in advanced technologies such as avionics, semiconductors, and high-end electronics. Significant investments in research and development (R&D) have fostered a thriving innovation ecosystem, with companies like Huawei and DJI leading the way. In contrast, India's focus has largely been on assembly, and a strategic shift toward R&D and innovation is crucial if India aims to catch up. Policy and Infrastructure Challenges China has received help from business-friendly policies, including tax incentives, subsidies, and relaxed regulations that encourage both domestic and foreign investment. India has introduced initiatives likeMake in India and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, but the implementation of these programs often faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, slow execution, and complex bureaucratic processes. China's infrastructure is a key driver of its manufacturing success. The country has invested heavily in its transportation network—roads, ports, and airports—ensuring smooth coordination and the efficient movement of goods. In contrast, India continues to grapple with significant infrastructural bottlenecks, including inadequate transportation networks, unreliable power supply, and inefficient ports. Addressing these issues will require substantial time and investment. Labor Force and Skill Development China's labor force is highly skilled, thanks to decades of investment in education and vocational training. The country has transitioned from being a low-cost labour market to one that supports sophisticated manufacturing processes. India must follow suit by investing significantly in upskilling its workforce to compete in high-tech sectors. In terms of R&D investment, China distributes a large part of its GDP to foster technological innovation. In 2022, China's R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.41%, compared to India's just 0.64%. This disparity reflects a wider gap in innovation ability. Additionally, India's private sector contributes only 36.4% of the country's gross expenditure on R&D (GERD), compared to 77% in China and the US. Geopolitical and Trade Considerations China's geopolitical strategies have bolstered its global trade relationships, positioning it as a dominant player in the global supply chain. While India's geopolitical position is improving, particularly through its growing trade partnerships and strategic alliances, it must navigate complex international relations and trade agreements to enhance its manufacturing prospects. As global manufacturing increasingly shifts toward sustainability, China has integrated green technologies into its processes. India must prioritize sustainable manufacturing practices to meet international environmental standards and improve its competitiveness in the global market. Defense Sector Disparities The defence sector gives another example of the gap between India and China. According to the Global Firepower Index, China spends $229 billion on defence, compared to India's $74 billion. China's naval fleet is also significantly larger, with 49 destroyers and 730 vessels, including 61 submarines and 3 aircraft carriers, while India's fleet consists of just 12 destroyers and 294 vessels, including only 18 submarines. This defence disparity underscores the broader difference in strategic development between the two countries, including in areas like research, innovation, and industrial capacity. India's air defence capabilities are also a concern, particularly with the growing threat of Chinese military advances. The Indian Air Force has struggled to meet its target of 42 squadrons, with delays in the supply of critical components like F-404 engines for its Tejas planes. This issue mirrors the challenges faced by China in securing advanced military technology from foreign suppliers, although China has responded by developing domestically produced jet engines, such as the WS-15, which now power its fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The Way Forward for India India must adopt a long-term vision supported by strategic investments and actionable plans to catch up with China and become a global manufacturing hub. This includes improving infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills, fostering technological innovation, and strengthening policy implementation. Addressing these issues systematically and sustainably will be essential for India to establish itself as a major player in global manufacturing over the next 15 to 20 years. Conclusion In conclusion, while India is making progress toward becoming a global manufacturing hub, it has a long way to go before matching the scale, sophistication, and technological capabilities of China. To close this gap, India needs to invest in infrastructure, R&D, labour development, and efficient policy implementation. Only with sustained efforts and strategic reforms will India be able to realize its vision of becoming a global manufacturing leader in the decades to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4h2qPcrdcRbS	2024-11-11T16:21:59-08:00	
Why Trump Has Always Been The Clear Choice – OpEd	Trump did not steal the 2024 elections; he won them with the resounding and thumping voice of the American people's victory in a powerful message of truth and will. He performed better than in 2016 and 2020 and completed a swing-state sweep, winning all the swing states of Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. Democrats warned that Trump and MAGA are hijacking democracy. Now, they must acknowledge the truth: the Trump movement, no matter how much it has been panned by many, is a powerful expression of democracy. The red wave and Donald J. Trump's victory marked the greatest political comeback in history, symbolizing the advent of the prospects of a new world peace and an end to global conflicts. It shows that despite billions of dollars of ads by the Democrats and top celebrity endorsements for Kamala, and the character assassination of Trump, the endless political witch hunt stretching back nine years, the two assassination attempts, two impeachments, and the 91 contested charges brought against him, Trump stands tall in staying true to his natural conviction and unyielding spirit to create a new wave of change for the American people and the world. Ordinary Americans are wise enough to see through these systemic barriers put in place to hold Trump and Trumpism back. He won more votes with key demographic groups compared to last time, including Hispanic Americans and younger voters, compared to Harris, who did poorer than Biden with women, urban voters, younger voters, and Hispanics. Kamala's overtures to the young and Gen Z voters never produced the intended outpouring of support she has hoped, despite the student loans move. The presidential result was brutal for Harris, also because she failed to bury Biden's ghost, and never had the ability to sell voters on the idea that she was the turn-the-page candidate, refusing to make a clean break from the last four years whereas the voters have long indicated that is what they wanted. She also failed to draw any distinction between herself and Biden, in identifying any specific ways her presidency would be different from him. By focusing on non-relating issues, including the state of the democracy and predominantly on abortion, she failed to connect with the resentments of the people and the real plight and sentiments dominating now even among the Democratic-leaning voters, which are on safety and economy. Considering that this election can be the platform to voice dissatisfaction against the Roe v Wade overturning by siding with Harris, women voters prefer the core issues of economic and personal safety, and they resonate with Trump's call for border security and fixing the economy. As Bernie Sanders put it, the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class. First, it was the working class, and now, the Hispanics and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, further worsened by the soaring inflation. Trump is now seen as the champion of the working class. The victory in retaking the Senate and Trump claiming the popular votes, the first Republican in two decades to do so, also point to the fact that pollsters and all the polls claiming this race to be a dead heat, and one where Des Moines Register/Mediacom put Harris as ahead in Iowa, a traditional Republican base: as yet again fast losing their credibility and relevance, just like in 2016. Exit polls show that the 'threats to democracy' were a top issue, and the mainstream media (MSM), which is traditionally left-leaning and Democrat-friendly, thought that meant votes for Kamala. It turns out that the opposite happened: voters are rejecting censorship, dishonesty, and bias in America. America fought and won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and established the rules-based order that preserved global stability. The US has maintained world peace for over 70 years since WWII and has paid the highest amount to secure world trade, maritime routes, and deterrence. This long peace comes at a cost, with the portrayal of the great American obligation for the spirit of freedom and democracy for the world. All Trump wants is for others to pay their equal burden and fair share for world peace. Harris argued for Trump to stop with the tired old playbook of hyping up the immigrant issue and running a dark and divisive campaign, but the rising migrant crime and millions of undocumented people let in by the Biden administration remain a sad reality. A nation is built on two common-sense factors: a clear border wall and direct control of people and dangerous goods coming in, and a common-sense election and voting norms of having voter ID. These are the principles of sovereignty and control at their most basic for any nation, and America paid the price for its inability to uphold the simplest facets of national security and territorial integrity due to the Democrats' misplaced belief that an open border is what made America great. A fractured voting system where illegal votes have been rampant threaten the fabric of a country and American democracy. More than 20 million illegal immigrants poured in from more than 180 countries,with more than 13,000 convicted criminals estimated to be already in America, with deaths and destruction from fentanyl, crime, and lost economic opportunities for the local everyday struggling Americans already suffering from the worst inflation in decades. The Democrats cast Trump's alleged assault on America's democracy as the greatest threat to America but disregard for voter ID and the ousting of Biden in an internal move are instead seen as the threats to America's democratic foundation. Why Trump Has Always Been the Clear Choice Let's remember his legacies and track record during his first term, when these facts and feats were often drowned in the anti-Trump rhetoric that had been played out for years. Trump's economic record remains the strongest justification for him, resonating with the plight suffered by the people under Biden. When he handed over power to Biden in 2021, he predicted that inflation and high energy prices would hurt the people and weaken America, and he was right. The economy was booming under the first Trump administration with his low tax and low regulations mantra, and a second Trump administration will see bigger tax cuts that will boost domestic production and create more high paying jobs. In his first four years, stock markets and 401(k) were high. Businesses were easier to form, and jobs were returning. Inflation was almost at its lowest, and the sense of economic optimism and unity from both sides of the aisle was at its highest. Trump saved tens of millions of lives worldwide with Operation Warp Speed, in getting the vaccines ready in record time. Trump helped America build its strongest economy in history. Median household incomes rose to their highest level ever in 2019, while the poverty rate hit an all-time low. Under the Trump Administration, more Americans were employed than ever before, numbered at 160 million, and the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans without a high-school diploma all hit record lows, while the Trump 'Blue-Collar Boom' saw wages grow faster for workers than for managers or supervisors. Trump signed the largest relief package in American history to protect workers and families from economic devastation during Covid. The American economy surged back to life within months, seeing record growth and job gains. Trump returned law and order to the American people, and would be tough on crime in the new term. He brought the abortion decision back to the states and overturned Roe v Wade, the first in more than five decades. The pro-life stance started a new opening to save the lives of the unborn. Energy independence was achieved, where reliance is no longer on oil-rich countries in the Middle East, and America is now the biggest energy producer in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. Under the new term, America will soon be an energy dominant country, with common sense utilisation of the vast black gold under the feet of Americans and with the 'drill, baby drill' mantra. In Trump 2.0, the fundamental economic problem plaguing the country will be addressed, starting by cutting energy prices in half within his first year. The appointment of three Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of federal judges, that have been confirmed during his tenure further sealed his legacy. He also oversaw the greatest transformation in the criminal justice reform, a feat where even Obama failed to pass. Border security was among the best in a very long time, and the greatest tax cut since Reagan has enabled manufacturing jobs to return. The military has been rebuilt, and veterans' welfare and support capacity have been prioritized. The Space Force has been created, providing the US with new space dominance for decades to come. When Biden-Harris took over the leadership, the economy got worse. Trump was right when he predicted, way before the 2020 Elections, that if Biden-Harris were to get elected, energy prices and inflation would be through the roof. 65% of Americans cannot afford to own a home, and 800,000 Americans lost their jobs last year. Instead, 1.2 million non-citizens took those jobs. Energy prices and crime were also through the roof. More than ten thousand manufacturing jobs were lost last month alone. Businesses are leaving because of high tax and high regulations, and with the tariff in place under Trump 2.0, they will be coming back to America and new manufacturing bases will sprout in America. Americans are struggling in their daily life with spiking inflation and cost of living and houses, and thousands are dying monthly from fentanyl, but yet the Biden-Harris administration has failed to address these effectively. Trump is being seen as a resonating and honest personality in doing what is right for the country. Under Trump, the stock market and the economy were better off than before Covid era when he left office. Instead, Biden took credit for bounced back jobs. Harris focused on short-term political returns with her left-leaning economic policies, which were enticing, but Trump focused on the larger picture of long-term economic returns based on low taxes and regulations. More money is given to Ukraine to defend democracy, but America's own border crisis is ignored. Ukraine received 250billion dollars, but Europe paid 150billion less. Trump forced NATO to pay more, saving billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money. He also reviewed and withdrew from global memberships including Paris Climate Accords that are weakening America and putting it at a disadvantage, mostly in constraining America's economic potential through green and carbon obligations. In contrast, other countries are allowed to have bigger leeway. For years,America was ripped off by foreign powers. While their cars dominate the American market, other countries are not accepting American cars. Trump's tariff is the saviour of the American economy long held hostage by other countries. This tariff will protect American businesses, get other countries to stop their dumping and market distortion that have obliterated American workers' interests, encourage more companies to shift and start their operations in America, and give new tax cuts to American enterprises. All these will create new jobs and confidence, fix the American coffer bleed, and negate the dependence on China. This will stop overexposure to globalist movements and greater vulnerabilities to Beijing and Europe's new trade maneuvers in choking America. The left focused on the low-hanging fruits in the causes of abortion, student loans, and other free entitlements and pointed out MAGA as the threat to these issues. Trump could have chosen the easier populist route by altering the positions on these causes, but instead remained steadfast in real issues that affect everyday Americans: crime, economy, safety, border security, family and religion, and individual freedom from fear. Trump will fix the ballooning federal government size and bureaucracy, trim it down, and save billions of dollars through common-sense restructuring and tackling wastages, incompetencies, and corruption. He would also dismiss bureaucrats and politicians whose woke influence has stifled the country's true growth, and he would return education and school choice policies to the states. Trump takes a tough stance on crime for the safety of Americans and to empower the police to carry out their responsibilities, while the Biden administration has caused crime to skyrocket and left the police weakened by defunding the police movement and sanctuary cities. Incompetent, typical politicians who have been in the system and establishment for years would be replaced by merit-based experts who know the ground best. Elon Musk remains a case in point, with a potential new role in trimming the federal government and reducing expenses. Trump took the beating for pointing out the truth affecting America and its people. He took a bullet and faced persistent years-long attacks on his credibility and character, from a fake Russia investigation to the endless political witch hunt and character degradation. Peace Through Strength and New Advent of Global Peace Trump's America First agenda has been panned by the Democrats and the world over, but it brought unconventional approaches and returns to both America and the world through relative peace and stability. The world is safe because of Trump. His peace through strength mantra has kept the world peaceful and deterred aggression from even the harshest enemies. Under his watch, no major conflicts or wars happened, and he stopped war-mongering neocons. Biden-Harris' weak administration saw the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal with the loss of 13 American soldiers and 85 billion dollars of military equipment left behind. This weakness led to the mushrooming of new alliances and actions that threatened and violated international law and the rules-based order. The Afghanistan withdrawal weakened America's standing and resolve and led to renewed power flexing, as shown by Putin, Kim, and Xi. The Ukraine war and the various instabilities across the world that are now happening would have been prevented. Despite the casting of Trump as weakening America's global standing via his treatment of allies and withdrawal from multilateralism and globalism, Trump fixed the cancerous plague that has held America back with smart and common sense foreign policy that has benefitted everyday Americans through fixing the manipulations by other powers and rebuilding the military with Space Force, taking care of the veterans and regaining America's military strength. Clear deterrence was established, and aggression by other powers was deterred. For 18 months, no American was killed by the Taliban under Trump. Trump never left a vacuum in global dominance, he strengthened the US position through military and economic rebuilding at home. During the initial period of his presidency, when he took over from Obama, the predominant threat at that time was the growing belligerence and nuclear danger from Pyongyang, which Trump inherited. He managed to settle the mess with his unconventional approach. In other words, Trump has indeed Made America Great Again and the world safe again, and will do it again with this greatest political comeback in the history of the world. Hopes are highest that he will end the Ukraine war and the conflicts in Gaza and West Asia once and for all and bring peace to the regions, as he has proclaimed to do. Trump has always focused on the core issues that matter to the American people at large: a sense of economic and personal safety and security and the sense of appreciation and role in taking America back and securing its future while also safeguarding America's role in keeping the world safe and preventing World War III. The choice for the 47th President of the United States has always been clear, and he has proven it on a historic day for the country and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4imLmjAsogzc	2024-11-11T16:19:17-08:00	
Anti-Haitianism: A Hemispheric Rejection Of Revolutionary Blackne...	From the United States to the Dominican Republic to the Bahamas, the collective scapegoating and mass deportation of Haitians for political gain lays bare a particular kind of anti-Blackness. On September 25, 2024, Democratic representative Steven Horsford introduced House Resolution 1500 on the floor of Congress. The intent of the resolution was to censure Republican Congressman Glen Clay Higgins of Louisiana over a social media post that amplified false claims made by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. In a post on X responding to an Associated Press article about Haitians in Springfield filing charges against Trump and Vance, Higgins wrote: 'Lol. These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP.' He continued: 'All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th.' Higgins later deleted the tweet but the damage was done. Condemnations flooded in, followed by the resolution to censure the congressman. Such comments and lies reflect the worst white supremacist stereotypes about Haiti and Haitians. Broadly, anti-Haitianism consists of actions, beliefs, outcomes, policies, political strategies, and practices that reify the negative connotations associated with Blackness and Haitian identity. Trump and Vance both used the admittedly false anti-Haitian rumor as a form of anti-Black, anti-immigrant fear mongering to garner political support. Examples of such strategies abound. In September 2021, for instance, U.S. Border Patrol agents appeared to whip Haitians in Del Rio, Texas amid a crackdown at the border that resulted in the largest mass expulsion of asylum seekers in recent U.S. history. Between January 2021 and February 2022, the United States expelled or deported over 20,000 Haitians. During the same period, more than 5,000 Haitians were deported from other countries, about half of them from the Bahamas. Anti-Haitianism, of course, is not limited to the United States. It is a regional and hemispheric phenomenon. Within scholarly and informed circles, the best known example of this form of political domination, marginalization, racism, and anti-Blackness is in the Dominican Republic. In his study of race and politics, Ernesto Sagás analyzes how Dominican political elites use race and antihaitianismo to 'construct national myths and then use these myths to stymie challenges to their hegemony.' As Sagás explores, the national myth undergirding Dominican statehood was that the Dominican Republic was the most Spanish colony in the so-called New World. After Haiti's occupation of Santo Domingo from 1822 to 1844—which liberated enslaved people, guaranteed Haitian freedom and independence, and culminated in Dominican independence—the Dominican Republic solidified its distance from Blackness and Haitian identity. Antihaitianismo then developed as an ideology based on anti-Black prejudices, stereotypes, and myths about Haitians and people of Haitian descent. Antihaitianismo, Sagás writes, scapegoats Haitians for problems within Dominican society and considers Haitians to be culturally and racially inferior Black sub-humans. Antihaitianismo was violently on display in Dominican society in the 1937 genocidal massacre of tens of thousands of Haitians at the orders of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. More recently, in 2013, the country's highest court issued a ruling, locally known simply as la sentencia, that not only upheld a constitutional amendment that abolished birthright citizenship but also retroactively stripped the citizenship of more than 200,000 Black Dominicans of Haitian descent, rendering them stateless. Beginning in 2015, tens of thousands were forced out of the country. Now, Dominican President Luis Abinader has announced plans for a new round of mass deportations. 'A Certain Kind of Black' In my book project, Anti-Haitianism in Paradise: Marginalization, Stigma, and Anti-Blackness in the Bahamas, part of the 'Black Lives and Liberation' series from Vanderbilt University Press, I build on Sagás's work and use anti-Haitianism to articulate the unique form of oppression Haiti and people of Haitian descent experience. In other words, I am wresting the idea and reality of anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic, applying it to varying social contexts, and broadening the theory to explain what anthropologist Gina Athena Ulysse—in reference to the racist treatment and degradation of Haitians in other parts of the world—refers to as 'the rejection of a certain kind of Black.' The Bahamas, a small, predominantly Black Caribbean archipelago nation, has a history of anti-Haitian actions. Haitians have migrated to the Bahamas since the era of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1803). Yet on November 9, 2019, members of a Bahamian nationalist group called Operation Sovereign Bahamas protested outside a gymnasium housing hundreds of victims of Hurricane Dorian. The devastating Category 5 hurricane hovered over Grand Bahama for 24 hours starting on September 1, 2019, flooded much of the island, and mostly submerged the Abaco Islands, rendering these areas uninhabitable. Haitians who had been living in informal settlements in Abaco were displaced. Two months later, the Operation Sovereign Bahamas demonstrators called on the Bahamian government to evict the displaced people taking shelter at the gymnasium. 'The Bahamas is for Bahamians,' the group's founder, Adrian Francis said, according to Bahamian news service Eyewitness News Bahamas. Other members of the group held Bahamian flags and shouted at evacuees, presumably of Haitian descent, 'Go home!' 'Repatriation!,' and 'We want you out of our country!' This scene came after the same civic group had held a well-attended town hall meeting on October 4, 2019 in New Providence, Bahamas titled 'Eradicating Illegal Immigrants in the Bahamas, Shanty Towns Down.' Cyclical White Supremacy Anti-Haitianism operates as an ideology rooted in anti-Blackness, nationalism, political domination, and marginalization. We can also see anti-Haitianism expressed as a set of practices. But what is the relationship between antihaitianismo in the Dominican Republic and anti-Haitianism in the Bahamas? As in the United States, political elites in both nations use anti-Haitianism as a strategy, suggesting that both African-descended nations are structurally anti-Haitian. When Black Dominicans of Haitian descent were forced to leave the Dominican Republic in 2015 due to la sentencia, it was partly done by the party in power as a move to garner political capital. Another dimension of anti-Haitianism is that these nations express and exert their sovereignty through anti-Blackness. In the wake of Hurricane Dorian, the Bahamas repatriated 228 Haitian migrants, 153 of whom had lived in hurricane-ravaged Abaco. Many Haitian residents of Abaco lived in informal settlements, locally called shanty towns, and had unexpired work permits that granted them legal status in the country. When majority Black nations assert their sovereignty through anti-Haitianism, they extend the spirit of white supremacy and anti-Blackness, traditions previously exerted on the ancestors of Bahamians and Dominicans through slavery. These cycles also expose the cyclical nature of white supremacy and the durability of anti-Blackness. Anti-Haitianism in Hemispheric Perspective Reflecting its hemispheric dimensions, anti-Haitianism has also developed into an important type of anti-Blackness informing other types of Blackness within nations in North America, the Caribbean, and South America. Regine O. Jackson's 2011 Geographies of the Haitian Diaspora discusses how Haitian migrants and their progeny have served in the past and present as repugnant cultural 'others' in relation to the citizens of Jamaica, Guadeloupe, and Cuba. In Haiti, in the wake of the 2010 earthquake, a United Nations-introduced cholera outbreak claimed nearly 10,000 lives and adversely affected more than 820,000 people. The United Nations remains unaccountable and unpunished for this human rights catastrophe. In addition, much earthquake aid did not go to Haitians but to donors' own civilian and military entities, UN agencies, international NGOs, and private contractors, suggesting that humanitarian aid can be wielded as an anti-Haitian weapon. And in Brazil, scholars Denise Cogo and Terezinha Silva have observed the racist treatment of Haitians who were encouraged to migrate the country in the post-earthquake period to work as laborers ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The adverse experiences of Haitians in Brazil—home to the largest Black population in the Americas—expose the linkages between labor extraction, anti-Blackness, and anti-Haitianism. Anti-Haitianism also serves other purposes within these examples, such as identity construction. The peoples of the Bahamas, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and other countries construct their identities as superior in relation to Haitian identities, producing anti-Haitian outcomes. The fact that Haitians have still not been compensated by the United Nations for cholera-related illness and death, and that the people who caused the epidemic have not been punished through Haitian or international law, reflects how Haitian lives are not only considered expendable but also unworthy of justice. While we must consider differences in the local histories, socioeconomic conditions, and political situations of the Bahamas, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere, a clear anti-Haitian pattern emerges in the wake of the 2010 earthquake. This pattern, on display in the news and scholarly publications, includes alienation, death, expulsion, elimination, humiliation, marginalization, and stigmatization. Also, while these majority Black nations are subject to anti-Blackness, all these countries promote a unique form of anti-Blackness that specifically adversely affects Haitians. This should remind us that all that is Black is not the same type of Black, reflecting hierarchical and differentiated Blackness. Anti-Haitianism is, in other words, an expression of a rejection of the Blackest of the Black—a revolutionary Blackness that demands freedom, equality, and dignity, but remains collectively punished and stigmatized.

Mind Meets Market: The Psychological Foundations Of Political Eco...	Political psychology and political economy, though distinct fields, are deeply interconnected. Political psychology explores cognitive biases, social influences, and motivations shaping individual political behavior, while political economy examines how economic frameworks impact political power, governance, and societal welfare. Together, these fields reveal how psychological factors influence economic policies and how economic conditions impact political attitudes and actions. Historical Context and Foundational Theories The relationship between economics and politics dates back to early thinkers like Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Smith, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776), explored how personal interests and social influences shape economic behavior and, consequently, political structures. Marx's materialist conception in Das Kapital (1867) posited that economic conditions—defined by class relations—are foundational to political authority and societal change. These early frameworks laid the groundwork for understanding the psychological motivations driving economic behavior and political outcomes. In the 20th century, the rise of behavioral and cognitive psychology reshaped political psychology, with thinkers like Herbert Simon and Amos Tversky pioneering studies in bounded rationality and cognitive biases. Simon's concept of 'bounded rationality' highlighted that decision-makers often operate with limited information and cognitive constraints, which affect economic and political choices. Tversky and his collaborator Daniel Kahneman further examined how heuristics influence risk assessment, anchoring, and loss aversion—key aspects that often shape political and economic decision-making processes. Behavioral Insights into Political Economy Behavioral economics, grounded in insights from political psychology, investigates how biases and heuristics affect economic policy decisions. For example, the concept of prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky suggests that people assess gains and losses asymmetrically, often preferring to avoid losses rather than achieve equivalent gains. This loss aversion can influence policy choices, as policymakers may prioritize short-term economic stability over long-term growth to avoid the political repercussions of economic downturns. Additionally, Robert Jervis's work on misperception and security dilemmas in international relations shows how cognitive biases affect economic diplomacy and international trade. Misperceptions can lead to an overestimation of threats, shaping protectionist policies and impacting global economic cooperation. Social Identity and Economic Inequality Social identity theory, introduced by Henri Tajfel, emphasizes the psychological need for individuals to affiliate with social groups, impacting political attitudes and preferences. Economic inequality exacerbates social divisions, often fostering in-group and out-group dynamics that manifest in political preferences and party affiliations. Economic conditions thus interact with social identities to influence voting behavior, as demonstrated by the work of Shanto Iyengar and Donald Kinder on how racial and economic identity shapes political attitudes. The relationship between economic inequality and political psychology becomes particularly evident during periods of economic crisis. Economic hardship often triggers a psychological sense of threat, increasing support for populist and nationalist movements. This trend, as highlighted by Thomas Piketty in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, underscores how perceptions of inequality influence political movements, as economically disenfranchised groups seek representation through populist leaders who promise economic redistribution. Political Beliefs and Economic Systems Political psychology helps explain how personal values and cognitive biases shape preferences for different economic systems. The work of Milton Friedman on free-market economics and John Maynard Keynes on interventionist policies show that personal ideologies and psychological leanings—such as tolerance for risk, openness to innovation, or aversion to uncertainty—play a role in shaping economic beliefs. Studies on authoritarian and democratic personalities by Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm further illustrate that individual psychological profiles correlate with preferences for centralized versus market-based economies. For instance, those with authoritarian-leaning personalities may favor a regulated, hierarchical economic system, seeing it as more predictable and orderly. Conversely, individuals high in openness and tolerance for ambiguity may be more inclined to support market-driven economies, seeing them as fostering innovation and diversity. Policy Implications: Understanding Decision-Making In practical terms, the intersection of political psychology and political economy has important implications for policy-making. Policymakers' cognitive biases can lead to flawed economic judgments, especially when they rely on intuitive rather than analytical thinking. Jonathan Haidt's research on moral foundations, for example, shows how deeply held moral beliefs impact policy preferences and economic legislation, with implications for policies on welfare, taxation, and social services. Recognizing these biases can help policymakers implement strategies that counteract overly risk-averse or ideologically rigid decisions. Economic policies also shape psychological well-being and societal stability. The concept of 'relative deprivation,' developed by Samuel Stouffer, explains how perceived economic inequality, rather than absolute wealth, influences satisfaction and political stability. This notion is central to understanding political unrest, as economic policies that fail to address perceived injustices can exacerbate social tensions and lead to political instability. Conclusion The intricate relationship between political psychology and political economy underscores the importance of integrating psychological insights into economic policy and vice versa. As economic conditions influence political attitudes and identity, psychological factors shape preferences for different economic systems. This interplay highlights the need for policymakers to consider both economic structures and psychological motivations in order to foster more resilient and inclusive societies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4hTLGxm2h2nz	2024-11-11T16:12:18-08:00	
Ideological Agenda Of Russian Information Influence In Africa – A...	By Olena Snigyr (FPRI) -- Russian information operations in Africa are multidimensional, malleable, and opportunistic. It is hard to find a sphere of social life where Russians are not present—from daily life of small villages to cooperation in the nuclear sphere and space industry. The content of Russian communication is designed to be efficient in all dimensions of information environments of the target countries, and it is presented by three groups of actors: Russian top government officials, the Russian Orthodox Church, and representatives of Russian public diplomacy including Rossotrudnichestvo, Russkiy Mir Foundation, and other organizations. While the content of communication and its style differs depending on the group of communicators and the target audience, a general frame of a grand narrative, and even ideological framework, exists particularly for the African countries. Decolonization. Dewesternization. Modernization. Russian official communication carried out by top diplomats and by President Putin himself is built on the basic Russian strategic narrative. This narrative focuses on the necessity to tear down the existing, Western-led system of international law and institutions to create a new multipolar world order. Russia presents this narrative to African countries as the idea of fighting against Western neocolonialism and finishing the process of decolonization. This is a grand and multilayered framework that covers narratives in a broad number of spheres: from international politics and economics to historical memory and the ideational part of Russian information operations. First and foremost, Russian authorities, using the existing decolonial discourse, insist that the economic success of Western countries is not due to the competitive advantages of liberal democratic systems but to Western neocolonialism. In other words, the West, through spreading Western governance models, created a world order that allows it to continue exploiting its former colonies and other countries. Thus decolonization means dewesternization, which according to Russian expectations presumes political rapprochement with Russia and recognition of Russia’s 'discourse power' or 'right to speak.' In official interstate communication with African countries, the Russian authorities adhere to a black-and-white approach, pitting Russia against the West, and declare that partnership with Russia will provide the benefits of modernization and protection. The goal of Russian information influence in Africa is to widen the area of shared knowledge and values. Therefore, educational and scientific cooperation, Russian language and culture training programs, and training for journalists are an important part of Russian information operations through which Russia expands its circle of sympathizers and disseminators of Russian narratives and ideas. The narrative about 'modernization with Russia' rests on a fruitful ground of persistent African poverty despite resource wealth. Russia declares that its approach to partnership with African countries differs from the Western one due to the intention to share knowledge to help in modernization. Published data of such cooperation looks quite modest. For instance, only about 35,000 African students are studying in Russian universities, and the Russian-African Network University, created in 2021, engages 75 Russian and 27 African participants (11 of which are from Zimbabwe). However, Russia effectively promotes itself—even with such modest initiatives—and expands cooperation in areas of interest to African countries. An example is the establishment of the public professional association of technical universities of Africa Consortium of Universities 'Subsoil of Africa' at St. Petersburg Mining University in 2023. The collaboration involves over 130 organizations from 42 African countries. Participation is presented by African voices as an opportunity to cooperate with partners 'whose philosophy is different from that one of the West' (Tjekero Tweya) and as an initiative that will help 'to develop the full value chain of the mineral sector in Africa without being slavishly dependent on the West' (Paul Omojo Omaji). The narrative about 'Russia as a protector and stabilizing force' embraces three main messages: 1) Russia is a protector of African countries’ interests by advocating for fairer representation in the UN and protecting political regimes from foreign interference; 2) Russia supports traditional values in African societies by countering liberal influences; 3) Russia will support allied political regimes by all necessary means (including military assistance). The UN possesses an important role in Russian international communication in general and with African countries in particular. Referring to the principle of sovereign equality, written in Article 2 of the UN Charter of 1945, the Russian leadership promotes the concept of 'democratization of international relations,' which—in the Russian interpretation—means the inviolability of authoritarian regimes and impunity for their leaders regardless of human rights and international law violations. It is worth noting that although Russian leadership, including Putin himself, declares the invalidity of international humanitarian law, Lavrov in his communication with the African countries persistently mentions international humanitarian law as an important instrument of international relations. However, he notes that the US themselves do not recognize the authority of International Criminal Court by obstructing investigations into 'Washington’s possible war crimes in Afghanistan.' Combining the concept of 'democratization of international relations,' or literally the inviolability of political regimes, with the idea of protection of traditional values, Russia undermines the idea of the universal character of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Russian strategic narrative about the 'conflict of values' adds ideational features to Russian information influence in general. As to African countries, it may be suggested that Russia is testing its ideological influence there, spreading two main narratives: Messianic role of Russia as a liberator, decolonizer, and protector. Thus Russia’s foreign policy goal of preserving the status of a world power is interpreted ideologically through the idea of ​​the existence of Russia as a civilization that has a mission to save humanity; therefore, any Russian actions become legitimate and whitewashed in the eyes of supporters of this idea. Contradistinction of liberal values to traditional values. The modern Russian ideology is based on the concept that liberal values ​​are the main evil for humanity; therefore, Russia has a mission to protect traditional values. Russkiy Mir Exploring the content of Russian communication directly in the information space of African countries, it is safe to say that one of its goals is the spread and popularization of elements of the revamped Russian ideology. There are three main Russian institutions, responsible for the dissemination of Russian ideas among citizens of African countries: the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), Rossotrudnichestvo, and the Russkiy Mir Foundation (RMF). The declared mission of the ROC, Rossotrudnichestvo, and the RMF is to strengthen Russia’s influence in the world, to promote the Russian language, and to spread the idea of the Russian World (Russkiy Mir). On December 29, 2021, the ROC decided to establish its own exarchate in Africa, encompassing all African countries. Today, it reports the presence of communities and parishes in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, South Africa, Tanzania, the Central African Republic, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Togo, Malawi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, South Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Ghana, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and Côte d’Ivoire. The ROC is optimisticabout expanding its presence on the African continent, viewing Africa as an undeveloped territory receptive to Russian influence. Rossotrudnichestvo and the RMF have significantly increased and expanded their presence in Africa over the past four years too. Just this year, Rossotrudnichestvo officially formalized its operations by signing agreements to establish partner 'Russian Houses' in seven African countries: Nigeria, Guinea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, and Equatorial Guinea. Additionally, Rossotrudnichestvo has expressed intentions to sign similar agreements with organizations in Cameroon, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique. Such agreements represent only the visible part of Russia’s presence in these countries, often serving as the formalization of an already well-established network of influence. For example, the Russian House in CAR is widely regarded as a humanitarian front for the activities of the former Wagner Group. Similarly, the yet unofficial Russian House in South Africa reflects Russia’s long-standing and traditionally strong presence in the region. The declared activity of RMF is focused primarily on the popularization of the Russian language. Though Africa has never been a target region for the RMF, today the Foundation is present in ten countries—Egypt, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Madagascar, Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Uganda. Promoting the idea of the Russkiy Mir in African countries may seem like an overly ambitious goal. However, it is important to consider how the Russians themselves understand and advance this concept. The RMF website defines Russkiy Mir as follows: '[It] is not only Russians, not only our compatriots in the countries of the near and far abroad, emigrants, people from Russia and their descendants. It is also foreign citizens who speak Russian, study or teach it, all those who are sincerely interested in Russia, who care about its future.' The concept of Russkiy Mir has undergone significant evolution since its inception in the late 1990s, and it now serves as a framework for legitimizing Russian interference in regions deemed to be within Russia’s sphere of interest, under the pretext of 'protecting' members of the Russkiy Mir community. Notably, it now includes 'compatriots,' who are effectively denied the option of renouncing this status and also those currently subject to Russian informational influence.[1] The most clear definition of the concept of Russkiy Mir was proposed at the cathedral congress held on March 27, 2024, under the leadership of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the ROC. This definition fully encapsulates the meaning and scope of the Russkiy Mir ideology: Russia is the creator, supporter, and protector of the Russian world. The borders of the Russkiy Mir as a spiritual and cultural-civilizational phenomenon are significantly wider than the state borders of both the current Russian Federation and the greater historical Russia. Along with representatives of the Russian ecumene scattered throughout the world, the Russkiy Mir includes all those for whom the Russian tradition, the shrines of Russian civilization, and the great Russian culture are the highest value and meaning of life. The highest meaning of the existence of Russia and the Russkiy Mir it created—their spiritual mission—is to be the world 'Restrainer,' protecting the world from evil. The historical mission is to repeatedly defeat attempts to establish universal hegemony in the world—attempts to subordinate humanity to a single evil principle. This ideological definition of Russkiy Mir, presented by ROC and Russian far-right ideologues Malofeev and Dugin, encompasses all the official Russian narratives discussed in this text and is promoted by ROC among its African flock. 'True Faith' While a set of narratives, disseminated by Rossotrudnichestvo and RMF are similar to the rhetoric of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the composition of the ROC’s informational influence deserves a closer look due to its religious character. The actions of the ROC in Africa highlight its ambition to spread not just Orthodoxy, but specifically Russian Orthodoxy, which is now intertwined with the ideology of the Russian state. A narrative built around the global mission of the Apostolic Canonical Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate claims to have preserved the 'true faith' contrary to Western Rite churches influenced by modernization and to other Orthodox churches that supported granting autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The ROC’s activities in Africa are part of a broader strategy to leverage historical narratives and contemporary grievances to extend Russia’s geopolitical reach. This includes presenting Russia as a non-colonial power, a defender against Western neocolonialism, and a moral authority against liberal values that are portrayed as contrary to biblical teachings. The ROC asserts that Russia was never a colonial power, enriching its 'rescue mission' narrative with themes of liberation from the influence of other churches that 'tainted themselves by participating in the slave trade, supporting colonizers, as well as inter-tribal conflicts…' even encouraging genocide in Rwanda, and in recent years 'caused the disappointment of Africans due to the course taken to reject the biblical moral teaching in favor of homosexuality, transgenderism, of feminism, etc.' The Russian leadership perceives Africa as an important ally in promoting 'traditional values' within the larger struggle between two value systems. Representatives of the ROC believe that African societies favor so-called traditional values—patriarchal and patrimonial in nature—contributing to the favorable attitude of African peoples toward Russia. In their rhetoric aimed at African audiences, the Russians emphasize family values, contrasting these with Western concepts of gender equality and the right to self-expression. Last but not least among narratives in the Russian communication with African countries is that 'Russia is the victim of the West.' This explains the Russia-Ukraine war as a demonstration and a result of the Western neocolonial policy toward Russia and Russian-speaking people. This argument extends even further to statements about the Nazi and fascist nature of the Ukrainian political regime and blunt assumptions about the similarities between modern, liberal, Western democracies and the Nazi regime in Germany during WWII. In this manner, Russia draws a connection between the African peoples’ memory of decolonization and one of the central myths of Russian propaganda—the idea of the Russian people as liberators of Europe from fascism. This narrative is further developed to suggest that Russia’s contemporary struggle against Western hegemony is merely a continuation of its historical mission to liberate oppressed peoples everywhere in general, and in Africa in particular. However, in this updated version, the role of global evil is attributed to liberalism and to the ideas of human rights and freedoms. In conclusion, the effectiveness of Russian information influence in African countries is largely determined by Russia’s ability to draw upon the legacy of Soviet-African relations and to adapt to the unique information environment of each nation, leveraging its sentiments and weaknesses. Russia’s information influence in Africa serves its long-term foreign policy objectives, aiming to integrate African societies into a shared perspective on global order and history. These operations not only spread disinformation but also introduce elements of a renewed Russian ideology that stands in opposition to Western democracies.

How The MCMC Has Become The Most Powerful Government Agency In Ma...	The Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is arguably becoming the most powerful government agency under the Anwar Ibrahim administration. The MCMC power, responsibilities, and influence spans many areas that affect citizens on a daily basis. The MCMC was very much in the background until the ‘unity government’, as it is called, started its term in December 2022. The commission, under the chairmanship of UMNO political stalwart Salim Fateh Din, and his minister Fahmi Fadzil have been in the news, almost on a weekly basis. Minister Fahmi’s recent admission over the controversial tender decision to appoint U Mobile as Malaysia’s second 5G network operator, that such an important national decision was made solely by the MCMC, indicates the ‘unchecked’ power the commission has. In the light of heavy and widespread criticisms that the MCMC has favoured political cronies in awarding tenders, as well as being overly heavy handed and politically biased in the governance of the internet and media, its important to examine the structure, function, and abuses of the organization. The MCMC was created in 1998 under the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, under former prime minister Mahathir Mohemad, who promised the internet in Malaysia would never be censored. The MCMC is under the purview of the Communications Ministry, with Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil as minister. The MCMC budget is unknown, as funding within all ministries are itemised as programs, rather than what particular agencies and departments receive. The total budget allocation to the Ministry of Communications is RM 2.55 billion. Looking at program allocation, the MCMC would be expected to receive a major chuck of these allocations, somewhere near to the size of the Malaysian Religious Development Department (JAKIM). The 2022 annual report shows the MCMC holds RM 4.783 billion in assets, indicating a massive organization size. The powers and responsibilities of the MCMC have grown since 1998. In 2010 under the Postal Services Act (PSA 2012), the MCMC took over responsibility for overseeing and regulating postal and courier services in Malaysia. This includes the issuance of postage stamps and licencing of couriers. The MCMC is totally responsible for implementing government broadband objectives and strategies. The MCMC regulates the framework by which telecommunications, broadcasting, and on-line activities are conducted. This includes the responsibility for the licensing of Network facilities Providers, network service providers, application service providers, and content applications service providers. The MCMC grants licenses to companies exporting digital equipment. The MCMC licenses training providers in the area of digital communications, and conducts its own set of courses. According to the MCMC Annual report, the MCMC received an income of RM 1.37 billion from all of the above activities. The MCMC has offices in each state. The MCMC conducts its own research, hosts events to promote research, and provides digital research grants to research institutions and corporations to develop policies and programs to promote digital inclusion. Controversies involving the MCMC since 2022 Since the appointment of the Anwar administration in December 2022, the MCMC has been involved in a number of controversies. These include the recent awarding of the second 5G network, surveillance and monitoring of citizens, media control, social media censorship, and politically appointed leadership. The award of the second 5G service network license The recent awarding to the second 5G license to U Mobile has received wide criticism. U Mobile was the smallest bidder for the license in the restricted tender, which has raised claims of cronyism. This is especially the case when the Yang Di-Petuan Agong or king was a major shareholder in U Mobile, owning 22.3 percent of the company. The MCMC press statement awarding the network to U Mobile, specifically mentioned that U Mobile could collaborate with other companies leading to claims this was an ‘ali-baba’ deal, which may be sub-contracted to other parties. This led to an attempt by the MCMC to explain the reasons for their decision, which is very unusual for the commission to do. The minister of communication Fahmi personally stepped back from the issue by stating he had no involvement in the decision. Malaysians have not been informed about how much U Mobile will pay the MCMC for the license, due to the opaque nature of selection of the network provider. Other bidders for the license have publicly complained and requested the MCMC account for the criteria used in awarding the contract to U Mobile. The only way citizens will ever have any idea of how much was paid will be by making an estimate of the MCMC’s revenue, based upon previous years income in the 2024 annual report, which is not expected to be released until well after 2026. Use of Israeli Pegasus ease-dropping software The MCMC is finalising the process of building a ‘fake news’ verifier for the social media app WhatsApp. The MCMC is collaborating with Meta, a foreign owned company, which undertakes work for the US intelligence community. Within part of the new CHATBOT system the MCMC is creating, powerful AI software that uses metadata to be able to ‘zero in’ on ‘persons of interest’ is incorporated. The system will be able to find the political views of any individual it desires, and then alert police to arrest these people. This new system will complement the Israeli Pegasus ease-dropping software currently in use by law enforcement agencies in Malaysia. This is an illegal and massive breath of privacy, beyond any public scrutiny. Control and censorship of social media The MCMC has recently published a code of conduct for internet messaging providers service providers and social media service providers. It is in the process of discussing the code of conduct with service providers and the public. This is in conjunction with the proposal to license social media platforms in 2025. This is being resisted by companies such as Google, Meta, and X (formally Twitter), which wrote an open letter to prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. The letter claims the licensing may ‘stifle innovation and competition’, leaving platforms under great uncertainty. At the individual user level, MCMC officers (sometimes in collaboration with the police) call in individual users for interview concerning comments users make, over what the MCMC defines as infringements of the 3R (race, religion, and royalty). This is not just restricted to the public at large, members of parliament are also being summoned for interviews. During these interviews mobile phones and other communication equipment are confiscated in raids on premises. In addition pictures of interviews are published on the MCMC website, amounting to what could be seen as ‘guilt by accusation’. Such practices have been common over the last 12 months. Critics as labelled this practice as intimidation, as only few occasions have these interviews led to any prosecution. In addition, the MCMC has been issuing ‘take down’ notices to social media platforms over what it defines as defamatory, false, or obscene. According to Tik Tok, the MCMC has submitted the highest takedown request in the world during 2023, which led to 1,862 content takedowns in the second half of 2023. The MCMC and the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (JAKIM) have a special collaborative unit in the MCMC that monitors insults against Islam and the spending of deviant Islam, as defined by JAKIM. Online new portals The MCMC has put pressure on online news portals to takedown any posts that it defines as infringing the 3R ban. There are reports the MCMC has also directed news portals as to which columnists and author’s of ‘letters to the editor’ should not be carried by the portals. In general, news portals are struggling financially, where the government, possibily through the MCMC has offered some portals financial assistance. In the Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index 2024, Malaysia fell 34 places from 73 to 109, indicating a loss of freedom of speech in Malaysia. The RSF specifically mentioned the Communications and Multimedia Act (administrated by the MCMC), as often being used to curb what authorities call ‘fake news’. Political leadership Political appointments to GLCs and government agencies has been a contentious issue in Malaysia. The MCMC is no different and the current chairman was appointed by the former UMNO led government and reappointed in March 2023 by the current government. To have partisan leadership in an agency that regulates ‘freedom of speech and political ideas’ is flaunt with conflict of interest. This is a danger to any healthy democracy that is reflected in the fall of Malaysia in the RSF Freedom of Speech Index last year. There needs to be an ombudsman appointed to oversee complaints about the MCMC, particularly due to the pseudo-judiciary role it is carving out for itself, and unchecked power to define what constitutes an offense under the Communications and Multi-media Act.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbSaz5XMZaNjV	2024-11-10T17:27:58-08:00	
Look Before We Leap: Peace, Security And The Second Quantum Revol...	By Dr Alexander Blanchard We are on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. The first saw the advent of world-changing technologies like nuclear fission, lasers and semiconductors. The second, which exploits the behaviour of individual quantum systems, promises to transform technologies for sensing, imaging, navigation, computing, information science, communications and many other applications. Some of these advances will soon be mature enough to be adopted at scale. This has profound implications for a wide range of fields, including global peace and security. The second quantum revolution could have many benefits for peace and security. For instance, advances in quantum sensing could provide better detection of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards and threats. Moreover, quantum computing could bring about advances in climate modelling and monitoring, allowing us to better forecast the long-term effects of climate change. But this coming revolution could also introduce substantial risks. Advances in quantum computing could, for example, undermine current encryption methods on which digital information security depends, including for communications and financial transactions. New quantum technologies could bring advances to several critical industries tied closely to global peace and security, such as semiconductor research and development, thereby instigating a race to securitize these technologies. These risks—many of which we barely understand and some, undoubtedly, that we cannot anticipate—require governance responses, including at the multilateral level. It is high time to set this in motion. New capabilities, new risks As my colleagues and I argued in a recent comment article in Nature, many of the peace and security risks posed by quantum technologies are likely to derive from their use in a national security context, particularly by the military. Quantum technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance existing and future capabilities, including in data collection, intelligence analysis, secure communications and the development of weapons and materials. For example, quantum sensors may be able to detect objects underground and underwater (such as submarines, missile siloes and underground research facilities) that would be invisible to conventional satellite sensors. Quantum sensors could also be used to enhance navigation; field testing has already begun on so-called quantum compasses, which use a quantum accelerometer to measure the velocity of super-cooled atoms. Quantum compasses could enable accurate navigation, something particularly valuable for conducting military operations in environments where the global positioning system (GPS) cannot be used, whether due to poor weather or enemy action. Quantum technologies for military applications are attracting substantial interest and investment. This year, NATO developed a Quantum Technologies Strategy calling on the alliance to be ‘quantum-ready’. In 2023, the United States Department of Defense launched a $45 million initiative to integrate quantum components into weapons systems in order to enhance targeting precision. US lawmakers are currently pushing for the creation of a centre of excellence on quantum computing, focused on developing military applications and building the US military’s capabilities in this field. The British Ministry of Defence acquired a quantum computer in 2022. It has also invested in quantum sensors and clocks. India’s Ministry of Defence is investing in quantum key distribution (QKD), which would greatly enhance the security of its encrypted communications. China, meanwhile, is making advances on a range of military quantum capabilities, including QKD, and a quantum radar system designed to detect objects that are hidden from conventional radar by stealth technology. The deployment of such applications has some troubling implications. For example, using quantum technologies to enhance the lethality of weapons systems could have implications for states’ obligations under international humanitarian law if they lead to greater risk of harm to civilians. Or the use of quantum sensors to detect and track nuclear-armed submarines could weaken nuclear deterrence regimes and thus affecting strategic stability. There is also an ever-present risk that quantum technologies developed and deployed in the national security domain will have unintended consequences for wider society. For example, quantum computing could be used to break existing encryption standards, undermining information security protocols that global digital communications and transactions depend on. Moreover, the interaction of quantum technologies with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), could intensify the risks already associated with them. A coordinated governance response cannot wait Growing recognition of the transformative impact of quantum technologies has led a small number of states and international organizations to publish quantum strategies. These include growing calls for governance frameworks and international norms to anticipate the challenges of quantum technologies and to direct their development and applications to globally beneficial ends. For example, Australia’s National Quantum Strategy, published in 2023, highlights the need to develop principles to guide the responsible and inclusive development and use of quantum technologies. The United Kingdom’s National Quantum Strategy, also published in 2023, highlights the urgent need to establish technical standards to aid global efforts to address the risks of quantum technologies. There are some practical initiatives underway to forestall some of the types of risk posed by quantum technologies. These have predominantly been focused on cybersecurity. For example, governmental organizations, like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have been working on so-called post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for digital information and communications, which are designed to be more secure against quantum-enabled attacks. Several businesses, including Apple, have been doing the same. However, so far there has been very little international policy discussion on the peace and security implications of quantum technologies, including what multilateral responses could and should look like. Indeed, given the pace at which these technologies are developing, and the potential risks they present once they are scaled up, we are already far behind where we need to be. To begin responding to the peace and security risks, and to develop frameworks and norms for responding to quantum technologies, the international policy community needs to overcome three initial challenges. The first is the daunting complexity of the topic. The science is arcane, even for experts; theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman is often quoted as saying: ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.’ There is also the sheer range of potential applications of new quantum technologies, which is far wider than could be captured in this essay. But these need not, and should not, be impediments to understanding the practical implications of quantum technologies and their applications for national security and military purposes. Researchers have an important role to play in translating and unpacking the key issues in ways that policymakers find accessible and actionable. This might include research on the current feasibility and maturity of different quantum technologies that could generate peace and security risks, as well as tracking progress in standards and certification for quantum technologies to gauge their maturity in different domains. The second, related, challenge is that the peace and security implications of the second quantum revolution are far from fully understood, even by those who study it closely. If and how risks materialize will depend on many factors, including how quantum technologies are applied; where and how quantum technologies are developed; challenges and limitations to their development; and strategic drivers for their development and deployment. Efforts to drive the development of quantum technologies for globally beneficial uses will be premature if they are not underpinned by an evidence-based understanding of current developments, as well as frameworks for interpreting those developments. There is a pressing need to step up research to these ends. Whether quantum technologies can be developed and applied for the greater good without increasing peace and security risks will also depend on a timely response from the international community. A third major challenge is that there are currently no dedicated multilateral policy forums for states to discuss the responsible development, adoption and use of quantum technologies. Where states can have these conversations, and what form they take, is an open question—but one that needs answering soon. The dizzyingly rapid development and adoption of AI provides´ a cautionary tale about the dangers of failing to anticipate the challenges associated with emerging technologies. Policymakers were too slow to identify and respond to the challenges related to AI. At best this has resulted in a situation where international and multilateral initiatives are playing catch-up with developments in the technology and its deployment. At worst, opportunities for globally concerted action on governing AI may have been lost forever. While the timescales for the maturation and adoption of quantum technologies may not be clear, the magnitude of the peace and security challenges they pose are. With quantum technologies, policymakers still have the opportunity to get ahead of the challenges presented by an emerging technology. This opportunity will not last long. ‘Consider the ethical impacts of quantum technologies in defence—before it’s too late’ by Mariarosaria Taddeo, Alexander Blanchard and Kate Pundyk was published in Nature on 22 October 2024.

Trump-Proofing The East Asia Economy Through Elusion – Analysis	By Adam S. Posen US President-elect Trump will put tariffs up across the board, even if only initially as a negotiating tactic. He will increase bilateral tariffs on China and Mexico. The US Congress is likely to withdraw ‘Permanent Normal Trading Relations’ — that is, Most Favoured Nation treatment — from China, which would be even more aggressive, with even worse consequences. All else being equal, Trump’s tariff increases could yield an economic gain for East Asia in the short term. US exports are likely to become increasingly uncompetitive, while offshoring would continue to flow into the region from China, Europe and the United States — especially if US–Mexico tensions escalate. But the longer-term damage his policy tactics will do in undermining the open world economy — and the likely political pressures from both China and the United States to choose sides — will quickly overwhelm any benefits. This will increase uncertainty for businesses and governments in the region and right around the world. East Asia needs to band together and resist the temptation to play the game that Trump instigates with Xi. The region has advantages in creating its own open markets tied to the rest of the world, both inherently and as an attractive alternative to China and the United States, that it would be well-advised to pursue. This strategy would emphasise institutional processes and openness, as opposed to doggedly pursuing outcomes in specific industries or trying to cut deals with one or the other of the big powers. In contrast to the self-sufficiency driving both Chinese and US industrial policy, this approach would take the agency and markets of third nations seriously, in the region’s enlightened self-interest. There are both low-hanging fruits and perennial crops to be harvested from East Asia differentiating its approach from that of the two big powers. In the short term, allowing foreign direct investment in from all comers (with extremely narrow national security restrictions) and encouraging cross-border investment in developing economies would rapidly grant a competitive advantage over rivals who restrict technology transfer. East Asia’s supply chains would stand out for their efficiency and resilience. If the region foregoes the race to high tariffs or rapidly negotiates them into cross-border investment and integration of production, it would increase the purchasing power of both its households and businesses, while the United States and China would lose price competitiveness in the industries they wish to dominate. Longer-term, the returns to East Asian economies are even larger from separate, more open strategies than those of the United States and China. Those two economies are already on the way to destroying their own competitiveness by reducing economies of scale; by limiting their competition around protected champions; by supporting ‘critical industries’ chosen by backward-looking bureaucrats blinded by national security concerns; and by hobbling their ability to invest in research and other public goods by massive escalation of subsidies to production. An ASEAN coalition around or with the full membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) that sustains a policy of strategic openness would exert a greater influence over the standards and networks that are essential to today’s technology-based trade and consumption. The vast majority of third nation governments would prefer to play a part in the standards they accept rather than being forced into one or another rival camp. More collaboratively developed standards and functionally interoperable networks can emerge by reaching out to Europe and India or working through plurilateral processes at the World Trade Organization. Of course, there are other goals that matter for foreign and industrial policy beyond exports or manufacturing employment. On all these scores though, the alternative approach to that of China and the United States is clearly superior. More open sourcing of green tech components as well as final products would accelerate the green transition and make it far more accessible to the rest of the world. The United States and China could end up repeating the self-defeating economic arms race of only paying attention to third nations when the other rival does. This neglect presents not only an opportunity for East Asian foreign policy, but a need for the region’s governments to work with like-minded counterparts on supplying public goods, such as rapid transition to a carbon neutral economy, that are increasingly under-supplied. Sometimes, one cannot beat another at their own game. A better strategy is to choose to do something different. East Asian economies cannot win, either in the narrow sense of achieving industrial parity or in the more meaningful sense of shaping the world’s relationship with new technologies, by emulating current US and Chinese trade and industrial policies. The region simply does not have the fiscal resources, military capacity or ability to make enemies that the United States and China have.

Mexico’s New President Claudia Sheinbaum Must Overcome Political ...	By Bernardo Sainz Martínez Mexico is experiencing a profound shift in its political landscape. The first weeks of Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo’s administration are marked by concerns of democratic backsliding, power centralization, a potential constitutional crisis, and rampant violence. The legitimacy of the June 2 election results is not in question. The concern lies in the exceptional concentration of power in the presidential position as well as the instability that will arise from such unchecked authority. The inability to address root causes of violence and the disregard for institutional checks and balances raises questions about the government’s commitment to democratic processes. Rampant violence shows cracks in public security Observers’ previous expectations of a moderate administration are slowly fading. Violence remains rampant across Mexico. Over a thousand killings have been recorded in Sheinbaum’s first 13 days in office alone. Among the most significant incidents were the beheading of Alejandro Arcos Catalán, the mayor of Chilpancingo, and the recent killing of Marcelo Pérez, a priest and social activist in Chiapas. Additionally, military personnel were accused of negligence after six migrants and a nurse were killed in the crossfire of a shootout between the National Guard and suspected drug cartel vehicles. While Sheinbaum has proposed a new security plan, it does not diverge significantly from her predecessor Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s strategy. Obrador’s approach, which was to create the National Guard, a nationwide police force, resulted in the most violent presidential term in Mexico’s modern history. Furthermore, the Mexican Congress passed a controversial reform that places the National Guard under the Ministry of Defense. Sheinbaum supports both of these decisions and vows to strengthen the National Guard even more. Critics argue this will only further militarize public security and fail to address the root causes of violence. Judicial overhaul has consolidated executive power even further This failure to address the rampant violence isn’t the only concern Mexican citizens have regarding Sheinbaum’s administration. There has also been a blatant disregard for checks and balances within the institution as a result of her administration. The recent judicial reformis the clearest example. This reform mandates a complete overhaul of the judicial system, replacing all the judges in the country, at all levels, with new ones elected by popular vote. However, more than half of the appointees will be filtered by Morena, the governing party, through 'expert committees.' The reform also reduces the requirements to become a judge, which used to involve examinations and a long technical career. This has raised serious concerns about the politicization of the judiciary and the potential loss of judicial autonomy. Critics warn that this reform could threaten core democratic principles, including the separation of powers and adherence to the rule of law. The judicial reform has also the potential to spark a constitutional crisis. Numerous judges have already filed amparos (legal injunctions) challenging the reform’s constitutionality. They argue, among other things, that the legislative procedure to pass the reform was deeply flawed. However, Sheinbaum’s government has largely disregardedthe rulings and doubled down by proposing a new constitutional reform that shields any constitutional changes, even retroactively, from judicial oversight. The main argument used by the president and the governing party is that 'a few judges' cannot overturn 'the will of the people.' This move has alarmed many human rights advocates and legal experts. They view it as a regressive step in the defense of human rights and a violation of Mexico’s civil commitments. Mexico’s future remains unclear Despite the uncertainty surrounding the political situation, the day-to-day operations of Mexico have not been significantly disrupted. Much of this is due to the anticipation surrounding the new political context. Both the business community and political observers are closely watching how Sheinbaum will address internal challenges within Morena and its coalition. In addition, Mexico’s global economic and political ties, such as the USMCA trade agreement, serve as external constraints on the government’s ability to implement drastic changes. The country’s diversified economy also limits the scope for dramatic policy shifts. External factors such as trade, debt obligations, and international relations stabilize Mexico’s economy during this period of political transition. While it is true that internal political dynamics and violence present serious challenges, these external influences may help curb some of the more drastic reforms that threaten democratic checks and balances. It is clear that Mexico faces significant challenges and uncertainties. Strengthening democratic institutions, maintaining checks and balances, and protecting the electoral system’s capacity for power alternation are essential for ensuring stability and upholding the rule of law. Equally important is the need to respect institutional democratic processes, even when they produce outcomes that may not align with all preferences.

What Trump’s Reelection Means For Russia – OpEd	As the world braces for Trump 2.0, this time with broad immunity and a tight inner circle of true believers and China hawks, the effect of Trump’s victory on Russia is coming into view. From ideological to geopolitical shifts, here’s how a second Trump term might impact the Kremlin’s calculations. Following the post-Cold War era of liberal triumphalism celebrated most iconically in Francis Fukuyama’s 'end of history' pronouncement, the 2008 financial crisis cast serious doubt on the shibboleths of globalization. Skepticism grew across the globe about the capacity of the liberal economic, political, and social order to continue delivering either prosperity or peace. Now, 'postliberalism' or illiberalism is on the march throughout the developed world, a trend that Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed years ago. Pointing to the refugee crisis in Germany in the wake of the Syrian civil war, the Russian president told the Financial Times in 2019 that the liberal system 'has become obsolete.' The popular will, according to Putin, longs for nationalist states protected by impregnable borders. America reelecting Trump, whose right-wing populist platform embraces isolationism, protectionism, and nationalism while excoriating immigrants, open trade, and independent institutions, is the most conclusive natural experiment Moscow could have wished for. In his ideological battle against the West, Putin has long predicted the 'decline' of the U.S.-led liberal world order. In this narrative, Trump’s resurgence confirms Putin’s suspicion that liberal democracy is an unworkable failure, destroyed by the very democratic processes that made it possible in the first place. Instead, Trump’s win legitimizes the illiberal politics of countries like Hungary and (formerly) Poland, led by strongmen who represent populist nationalism triumphing over liberal pluralism. Disruption and Provocation Despite the ideological boost of Trump’s victory, the Kremlin is not entirely eager for the former president to return to the White House. Better equipped to haggle over hunks of real estate than master the subtle strategy of international bargaining, Trump approaches foreign policymaking as 'naked transactionalism.' His first-term National Security Council advisors worked in an atmosphere of constant chaos as the former president lurched from one foreign policy bungle to another, harming everyone from U.S. allies to American consumers. Bitterest of all, Trump never delivered on his 2016 promise to lift sanctions on Russia, instead adding on new, broader sanctions. For the ever-suspicious Putin, who prefers order and predictability, Trump’s erratic mode of governing makes him an unreliable and untrustworthy partner. On the other hand, Russia pursues what historian Mark Galeotti identifies as a 'strategy of inconveniences,' involving cyberattacks, sabotage, and other forms of political warfare that result in minor but irritating disruptions to everyday life in European countries. From delayed train lines to slow Internet speeds, the goal is simple: weaken and destabilize Western societies. A second Trump term, with its promise of mass deportations, new import tariffs, a greater risk of inflation, brinksmanship with North Korea, and a panicked EU, is precisely the sort of Western 'inconvenience' that Moscow delights to see. Ceasefire in Ukraine As the Russian army continues making slow battlefield gains, adding more pressure on Ukraine with thousands of North Korean combat troops, European leaders brace for the impact of a Trump presidency on EU security. Trump pledged, after meeting with Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, to end the war in Ukraine 'in 24 hours.' For his part, Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance has expressed his desire to pursue 'some sort of negotiation' with Ukraine, Russia, and Europe. The proposed negotiated settlement would likely concede a fifth of Ukrainian territory to Russia, freezing the current battle lines, and force Ukraine into a position of perpetual neutrality, barred from joining NATO. Although this would be music to Putin’s ears, Trump’s new administration has yet to reckon with a timeworn international relations concept: the dreaded commitment problem. The problem goes like this: when negotiating, say, the terms of a peace treaty, states have a difficult time making credible promises not to use force in the future because the state whose power is ascendant will have a powerful incentive to renege on the treaty and grab more land later on. Consider the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to give up the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States, and the UK. A weak post-Soviet Russia, swept up in the friendly mood of the 1990s, gave security assurances to Ukraine. Two decades later, a resurgent Russia annexed the strategically valuable Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale attack on a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity it had once promised to respect. The lesson for Ukraine is bitterly clear: Russian security guarantees cannot be trusted. This time around, it is not clear who would guarantee Kyiv’s security following a possible peace deal, especially if Moscow continues to find NATO troops on Ukrainian soil to be unacceptable. A Stronger Europe Trump is convinced that NATO, instead of being a military alliance that protects American strategic interests in Europe while deterring the world’s biggest nuclear power, is little more than a protection racket in which humble small fry gratefully pay the big boss. He has thus threatened to withdraw financial support from NATO. However, Trump’s critics tend to overlook that this position is not exclusive to Trump who, after all, maintained American military support for Europe throughout his first term. There is widespread bipartisan, public support for fairer burdensharingamong NATO members, with Mark Rutte remarking immediately after the election that '[Trump] is right' about the need for European countries to spend more on their defense. Moreover, as Washington and Beijing are increasingly locked into what political scientist Graham Allison terms the 'Thucydides Trap', the U.S. defense community prepares budgets and resources to meet the growing threat of military confrontation with China. This makes the redirection of Pentagon dollars away from Europe inevitable regardless of who occupies the role of commander-in-chief. What a revitalized Europe will mean for Russia is not yet entirely clear, but a couple of observations can be made. First, Russian designs on Europe tend to be overblown, with most analysts arguing that the NATO deterrent is strong and that Russia is unlikely to be contemplating using force against an alliance member. While Putin has imperial ambitions in Ukraine, which I wrote aboutlast year, they are unlikely to extend to other European countries. Second, Russia is paying dearly for its war of attrition, suffering enormous losses of experienced officers and soldiers as well as military equipment. Even as the country rearms and rebuilds its forces, the Kremlin’s postwar efforts at recruitment, industrialization, and modernization will be slow and expensive. This process does not promise to create a more efficient military—and certainly not one capable of taking on the substantially superior NATO forces.

Nixon Versus McGovern 2.0? Not So Fast – OpEd	In early August, I wrote an essay posted in Brownstone Journal entitled, 'Nixon vs. McGovern 2.0.' I sought to demonstrate that the most useful way of looking at the just-ended 2024 election cycle was to compare Trump vs. Harris with Nixon vs. McGovern in 1972. Back then, progressive leftists, having recently taken over the colleges and universities in this country, succeeded in choosing the Democrat Party’s presidential candidate, George McGovern. The result was the greatest landslide victory for Republicans at the presidential level that had ever been seen up until that time. In comparing 2024 with the 1972 election cycles, the question I raised was whether the left’s grip on colleges and universities (and the Democrat Party) for more than 50 years had changed the electorate to the point where an extremely progressive candidate could finally be chosen President of the United States, and permanently end our Constitutional Republic. Note that I use the word chosen deliberately, given the selection process that unfolded. Personally, I believed that the chances of a Democrat victory were greater than 50%, so I left things in the LORD’s very capable hands. Looking back at that previous post, my description of the likely chain of events leading up to Election Day 2024 tracked very closely with 1972. More importantly, the result of the election has been described using similar terms, such as landslide or blowout. Based on that election outcome, many Republicans (and a few dinosaur centrist Democrats) are already writing the obituary for the current, very progressive iteration of the Democrat Party. In effect, they’re saying that the 50+ year effort to remake America has imploded…to which I say: Not so fast! In order to demonstrate that the purported similarities between the outcomes of the 1972 and 2024 election cycles are barely skin deep I will examine, in a more granular way, the election results from a couple of different perspectives. First, while both elections have been described as a landslide or a blowout, a look at the data shows significant differences. In 1972, Nixon won 49 states and received 61% of the popular vote. In 2024, Trump won all seven battleground states by an average of just over 2%, and his overall popular vote percentage will be approximately 10% lower than Nixon. Had Harris increased her popular vote by a mere 2% in each of the battleground states, she would have won the Electoral College. In sum; Nixon’s margin of victory was an order of magnitude greater than Trump’s. Second, we need to look at the respective Democrat Party candidates in 1972 and 2024; McGovern and Harris. George McGovern, as I’ve previously described, was a well-respected Senator with a very distinguished World War II service record, who went back to the Senate for another decade after his defeat. His landslide loss was entirely a repudiation of his message, not a repudiation of him. On the other hand, Kamala Harris was the poster child for what is known as a DEI (diversity/equity/inclusion) candidate, as demonstrated by the criteria by which she was chosen to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020, and the fact that she had rarely gone through the fire of seeking competitive elective office. She was ill-equipped, both temperamentally, and in her work ethic for the positions she sought. To me, she was barely qualified to run for Senior Class President at a poorly performing high school. How can someone like this make a case for her party’s message when she couldn’t make a case for herself? As a result, the VP’s political career is now over, and she will not be heard from again at the national level. Should she try to remain relevant by inserting herself into the political fray, the real power players within the Democrat Party will quickly cancel her. Speaking of Joe Biden, he was nothing but a corrupt, decrepit, and increasingly demented old man that history will describe as an accidental President at best, and a fraudulently elected President, if the truth about the 2020 election shenanigans is finally revealed, at worst. Given this set of circumstances, it is obvious to me that the electorate rejected the Democrat messenger(s) in 2024, rather than the message. As such, I firmly believe that Dylan Mulvaney (of Bud Lite fame) would probably not have fared much worse than VP Harris in the Electoral College, had she been the candidate. Be assured that the Democrats will not be engaging in any sort of self-reflection. Once the political recriminations and shooting within the tent by the various factions is complete, which won’t take very long at all, they will use all of their energy to obstruct the Trump agenda, and, more importantly, find Obama 2.0 to run for President in 2028. To repeat, don’t let the noise and invectives fool anyone into thinking that 50+ years of educational indoctrination will be reversed by one election. Make no mistake: the far-left progressive message is alive and well. Those who oppose them better be ready for the onslaught. While time is short for our side, the progressives can bide their time, since their armies have been in place for a long time, and are well entrenched in the administrative state. Those of us at Brownstone, whose prime objective is to expose the atrocities committed by the public health Gestapo during the so-called Covid response, need to be very strategic in approaching this matter, since a substantial majority of the public will be incredibly resistant to hearing the truth. This means that when it comes to the 3-letter healthcare agencies (CDC, FDA, NIH, etc.), trying to amputate them will not be received positively. My experience tells me that if the professionals chosen to lead these agencies are solid, the corrupt, the incompetent, and the stragglers will fall away rather quickly, while telling themselves that they are indispensable. Good riddance! This will create an atmosphere where the competent professionals within these agencies will feel supported enough to rise to the occasion. If I may be allowed to wax theologically, I believe that the 2024 election cycle, rather than being compared to 1972, is best compared to the Book of Esther. A unique feature of that Book is that the LORD is never mentioned, yet HIS impact is evident throughout. Other than when the LORD deflected an assassin’s bullet with HIS finger on July 13th, HIS actions during this election cycle were subliminal but totally determinative of the outcome. It’s now up to seekers of truth to seize the opportunities that have been given in order to restore the nation’s founding covenant, consisting of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.

The Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran-UN Axis Of Evil – OpEd	Incredibly few Palestinian civilian casualties in Israel's war of survival – yet only Israel is condemned On October 7, 2023, Hamas butchered 1,200 innocent people, maimed 5,400, kidnapped 250, and drove tens of thousands out of southern Israeli towns. The next day, to show solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah began launching rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel, driving 80,000 from their homes. Israel's war rages on, against Hamas and Hezbollah, ISIS, Houthis and their Iranian theocracy puppet masters. It is a conflict that Israel did not start and did not want, a war for the Jewish state's very survival. It was preceded by suicide bombings and other deadly attacks by Palestinians going back many decades. Hamas leader Sinwar is now dead. So are Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, his successor, the successor's replacement, his successor and dozens of other top terrorists. But Hezbollah still demands 'appropriate and suitable' terms for ending the conflict. A Lebanon ceasefire might happen, if a new American proposal is accepted, under which US, EU and UN 'partners' would (finally) enforce 2006 UN Security Council Resolution 1701, requiring that Hezbollah disarm, withdraw north of the Litani River, and let the Lebanese government govern. President Biden wants to 'move on' to other matters. VP Harris says 'de-escalation' is essential. They want a ceasefire, and Palestinian statehood that may be less likely than ever, because Israeli trust is gone. However, Donald Trump's resounding reelection is already making Iran less relevant. It may make Hamas and Hezbollah more open to a cessation of hostilities, release of still-living hostages, and even a long-term, wide-ranging peace agreement ... though at this point largely on Israel's terms. Meanwhile, Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis and Iran continue to target any Israelis unlucky enough to be in blast zones – with few condemnations or repercussions from the UN, US or anyone else. The Hamas war is the most dangerous and complex urban warfare imaginable. It's horrific for anyone caught in target zones or crossfires. And yet Israel is condemned for crimes against humanity for attacking Hamas and Hezbollah ambush sites, weapon and missile storage depots, terror tunnels and strongholds that were deliberately built in and under homes, schools and hospitals to deter attacks or maximize civilian casualties. Even Israel's brilliant booby-trapping of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies – probably the most precise targeting in military history – was labeled a war crime. Meanwhile, Russia continues targeting Ukrainian schools, apartment buildings and hospitals, maiming and killing civilians – with few or no condemnations or repercussions. In reality, civilian death tolls in Gaza and Lebanon are a fraction of noncombatant casualties in other recent wars – Afghanistan, Africa and Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, for example. US, UN and allied forces often killed nine civilians for each combatant. In Gaza and Lebanon, fewer than two civilians died per combatant, because Israeli Defense Forces take 'more measures to avoid civilian harm than virtually any other nation that's fought an urban war.' Israel was also condemned for kicking the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinians out of Israel, because UNRWA employed terrorists who participated in the 10/7 massacres and helped kidnap Israelis; indoctrinated children to be terrorists; aided and sheltered Hamas; funneled food, water, concrete and other resources to the terrorists; and concealed weapons and explosives in UNWRA facilities. President Biden and the US State Department are 'deeply concerned' that this decision could prevent humanitarian aid from reaching people, even though the IDF and other aid agencies are more than capable, and pictures and videos prove UNRWA employees committed multiple crimes. Norway has asked the UN General Assembly to request an International Court of Justice 'advisory opinion' outlining Israel's supposed 'obligations as an occupying power to facilitate humanitarian assistance' to Palestinians. The US says it 'categorically rejects' any Israeli actions that could lead to the 'forced relocation' of Palestinians from Gaza Why haven't Norway, the US, UN or pro-Hamas mobs sought similar legal opinions regarding Russia's obligations toward Ukrainians – or regarding other horrific international conflicts? Years-long war in Sudan has killed well over 60,000 people, forced millions to leave their homes, added another 135,000 to the refugee stream just since late October, and created the 'world's worst current hunger crisis.' And yet these 'human rights advocates' have said virtually nothing. Similar stony silence reigns regarding butchery in Nigeria, where Islamist 'jihad and genocide' have slaughtered 150,000 Christians since 2009 and driven millions of refugees into neighboring countries. Some bizarrely blame resource scarcity, eco-violence and climate change for the slaughter. During Israel's 1948 War of Independence, some 750,00 Arab people fled or were forced to flee the new nation. Their six million descendants now live Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and other places, largely assisted by UNRWA. They are still considered 'refugees,' with a 'right of return' to what is now Israel – the only people in history with such status. Most Holocaust survivors (perhaps 3,000,000 of 9,000,000 pre-WWII Jews) had no desire to remain in Europe; they emigrated to Israel and other countries and started new lives and families. Most who tried to enforce their 'right of return' to their pre-war homes were murdered or driven away. On November 8, Islamist mobs hunted and attacked Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. Israel's creation also resulted in 850,000 Jews being forced to leave their centuries-long homes in Muslim countries across North Africa, through the Middle East to Iran and beyond. They received no UN help. This October, Israel finally responded to Hezbollah's ongoing attacks – and its preparations for Hamas copycat massacres via tunnels similar to those in Gaza. IDF targeting of Hezbollah headquarters, war rooms, and stockpiles of weapons and explosives, rockets and missiles in populated areas damaged parts of Beirut and southern Lebanon, displaced more families, and killed terrorists and civilians. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other finance ministers sent a letter to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, warning that the West Bank's economy could collapse if Israel doesn't extend a waiver allowing Israeli and Palestinian banks to continue cooperating in disbursing international financial support. The Palestinian economy faces 'systemic collapse' if action isn't taken immediately, they claim. Israel's economy has also been battered, but the ministers said nothing about that. The US, UN and EU are further outraged that Israel wants the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to move out of its forts, to safeguard its 'observers' from air and ground actions in active combat zones. UNIFIL rejected the demands. UNIFIL has been deployed in Lebanon since 1978, supposedly to prevent Hezbollah having an armed presence south of the Litani River. However, it studiously saw nothing, said nothing, reported nothing and did nothing to prevent Hezbollah from building terror tunnels, sniper positions, missile launch pads, munitions depots and more within a hundred yards of UNIFIL positions along the Israeli border. These travesties, threats and hypocrisies must end. The wars on Israel must be brought to a close and the hostages returned – but only with the dismantling of Hezbollah and Hamas forces that still promise to wipe Israel off the map. Thankfully, the election of Trump 47 may make all that more likely than ever.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbS8uCzcBC_y3	2024-11-10T17:11:07-08:00	
All States Are Empires Of Lies – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo 'Most economists are political apologists masquerading as economists,' wrote Doug Casey in one of his columns. 'They prescribe the way they would like the world to work and tailor theories to help politicians demonstrate the virtue and necessity of their quest for power.' Moreover, wrote Casey, 'The field of economics has been turned into the handmaiden of government in order to give a scientific justification for things the government wants to do.' This of course is not a new development. Ludwig von Mises was calling the universities of his day 'nurseries of socialism' but, thankfully, there is always a remnant of students who resist the statist brainwashing. The above quote about concocted 'scientific' justifications for interventionism and socialism, by the way, sounds like a precise definition of Keynes’s General Theory. Casey’s sound advice is that to be a good citizen one needs to 'become your own economist.' Don’t rely on the state’s mouthpieces in the 'media' or even academe for your economic knowledge. Educate yourself to some degree; it doesn’t take a university degree. Indeed, everything we do at the Mises Institute is geared toward helping anyone anywhere to become their own economist (preferably Austrian School and not Keynesian or Post Keynesian!) and avoid being bamboozled by the state and its court historian economists. Mises never joined the American Economic Association, the association of academic economists founded in the 1880s. The association’s founding document provides a clue as to why. 'The state is an educational and ethical agency whose positive aid is an indispensable condition of human progress,' the document purred. 'The doctrine of laissez faire,' on the other hand, 'is unsafe in politics and unsound in morals,' said the statist moral scolds who founded the American Economic Association. There are exceptions, the Austrian School economists being the most prominent, but the majority of academic economists view themselves as advisors or potential advisors to the state. They are Rothbard’s 'court historians' with degrees in economics instead of history. The role that they serve is the same as all 'intellectuals' in our almost 100 percent state-funded universities. As Rothbard put it: 'The majority [of the electorate] must be persuaded by ideology that their government is good, wise, and at least inevitable. Promoting this ideology . . . is the vital task of the ‘intellectuals.’' In return, the 'intellectuals' are given government jobs, grants, placement at prestigious universities, book deals, and myriad other political payoffs. (Mises wrote that history, law, and economics are the disciplines most widely used to bamboozle the public about the supposedly good, wise, and inevitable state). Take the Fed – please (as Rodney Dangerfield would say). Economist Larry White published a journal article several years ago that revealed that about 75 percent of all articles published in academic economic journals on the subject of monetary policy are published by economists who are in some way associated with the Fed. As Milton Friedman once said, 'If you want a career as a monetary economist it is best not to criticize the major employer in your field.' And so they do not. If there is ever any criticism it is always constructive criticism about how to supposedly become even better at central planning. Most Americans are rationally ignorant of the Fed, and what little they do know about it is overwhelmingly shaped by the Fed’s 'court historians,' especially the ones who teach economics at colleges and universities. The Austrian economists (but not all of them) are the only ones to challenge the existence of the Fed and call for its abolition. In addition to being the federal government’s legalized counterfeiting arm, the Fed is also another appendage of the government’s massive propaganda apparatus. The laughingly labeled 'independent' Fed’s research, according to economist Emre Kuvvet writing in The Independent Review, increasingly focuses on 'climate change, gender, race, and inequality' – the 'woke' political agenda of the Democrat party. The one true statement that Joe Biden made as president was 'It’s not Milton Friedman’s Fed anymore.' The New York Fed has always been considered to be the most powerful and influential of all the Fed branches. Its homepage defines its mission as a 'desire to root out the intolerable inequities and injustice grounded in systemic racism . . . steadfast in our commitment to work for a more equitable economy and society.' A clearer definition of socialism would be hard to find. Kuvvet found that of all the employees of the Fed’s Board of Governors there are 97 Democrats and 2 Republicans. 'Leadership positions' on the Board consist of 45 Democrats and 1 Republican. As I said, it’s just another D.C. government propaganda mill. Some Examples of the Empire of Economic Lies A typical introductory economics textbook devotes most space to endless stories of 'market failure' (free-rider problems, externalities, monopoly and oligopoly, monopolistic competition, asymmetric information, and on and on), and almost nothing about entrepreneurship, the cornerstone of capitalism. It wasn’t always like that. When the first federal antitrust law was passed in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act) the entire economics profession, which was very small at the time, opposed then new law as being inherently incompatible with competition, as Jack High and I proved by quoting all of them in a July 1988 Economic Inquiry article. They all viewed competition like the Austrian economists always have – as a dynamic, rivalrous process of discovery and entrepreneurship, and thought that antitrust law could only disrupt that process and distort markets. By the 1930s a new and more 'scientific-sounding' theory of 'perfect' competition had been invented, which asserted that competitive perfection required all homogenous products and prices in an industry, perfect information in the minds of buyers and sellers, costless entry into and exit from industry, an 'many' firms, whatever that might mean. For the next half century and more, economists would spin thousands o tall tales about how the real world fell short of this 'perfection,' defined as market failure, and prescribed regulation, control, nationalization, or regimentation by presumably wise and, well, perfect politicians and bureaucrats. UCLA economist Harold Demsetz labeled this dishonest method of analysis 'the Nirvana fallacy': Comparing the real world to an unachievable never never land of Nirvana. As F.A. Hayek once described it, 'In perfect competition there is no competition.' That is, there could not be product differentiation, price cutting, advertising, research and development, the rise to the top of a few superior-performing firms in an industry – all the ingredients of genuine competition. Generations of students have also been taught that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries large-scale production of electricity, water supply, telephone services and other similar products was producing 'natural' (i.e., free market) monopolies. Governments then stepped in and legally mandated public utility monopolies, supposedly to be regulated 'in the public interest.' I proved this to be yet another falsehood in my paper, 'They Myth of Natural Monopoly.' There was vigorous competition in all these industries. They were monopolized by the state, not the free market, with loot-sharing agreements whereby state and local governments would share in the monopoly profits created by their government-mandated monopolies. Then there’s the Big Lie of the Sherman Antitrust Act which was supposedly needed because of 'rampant monopolization' in the 1880s as the industrial revolution proceeded in America. In an article in The International Review of Law and Economics I showed that the industries being accused of monopolization at the time were by far the most competitive, dynamic, price-cutting, innovative, and production-expanding industries in America. The purpose of the Sherman Act was to stifle competition, not to 'protect' it. One of the most ridiculous things taught to generations of economics students was that because of the free-rider problem the U.S. would be spending far too little on 'national defense.' 'Efficiency' requires coercive taxation. There are economists who have defended Pentagon corruption and fraud on the basis that it expands defense spending, which is supposedly hindered by that nasty free rider problem. Who on earth would define Pentagon spending as 'efficient'? ! It was only in the past ten years that the 'mainstream' of the economics profession finally discovered that the massive interventions of the New Deal actually made the Great Depression more severe and longer lasting, something the Austrian economists have said all along. This Big Revelation was made in an article in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy by Professor Lee Ohanian of UCLA, an editor of the American Economic Review at the time. Better late than never. Nobel prizes in economics have been awarded for many theories of 'market failure' that subsequent research proved to be bogus. Janet Yellen’s husband, George Akerloff, was a co-recipient of the award for a paper that, in 1970, predicted that the used car market would soon disappear because of 'asymmetric information' between buyers and sellers. He apparently never heard of thirty-day warranties that allow car buyers to determine whether or not they had been sold a 'lemon.' David Card was awarded a Nobel prize for a paper claiming that minimum wage laws do not cause unemployment that was called 'deeply flawed' by a National Bureau of Economic Research redo of his study. There are many similar episodes. Economics students are taught that the root cause of pollution is profit seeking, which ignores the fact that the worst pollution in all the world over the past century, by far, was in the socialist countries of the world in the twentieth century that prohibited private profit seeking. A corollary to the profit-seeking-causes-pollution theory is that wise and benevolent government bureaucrats are needed to solve this problem. This not only ignores political reality, but also ignores how the absence of property rights causes many pollution problems in the first place, and also how entrepreneurs solve many 'externality' problems because it is profitable to do so. In public finance students are taught that tax 'loopholes' are inefficient because they supposedly create 'artificial' market distortions. It’s much more efficient, they are taught, to let government bureaucrats spend more of your money. Then there’s the cornerstone of Keynesian economics – the canard of 'the paradox of thrift' which asserts that savings reduces consumption, which in turn reduces GDP, which leads to lower savings. This theory has 'justified' confiscatory taxation of interest income on savings for decades. The intellectual godfather of mainstream economics will probably always be Paul Samuelson, whose Principles of Economics textbook dominated textbook sales for forty years, with almost all other textbooks during that time being imitations of his book. The statist bias that permeated that book and the others like it can be encapsulated by what Samuelson wrote in his 1988 edition – a prediction that by the year 2000 Soviet GDP would be larger than U.S. GDP. All of this demonstrates why Austrian economics is more important now than ever. The economics profession has not been immune from the cult of political correctness. In fact, it was politically incorrect before political correctness was cool, as Mises’ comment about how the universities of his day were 'nurseries of socialism' shows. Doug Casey was right when he wrote that most economists are political apologists masquerading as economists. Yours Truly recognized this as a college student decades ago, and was blown away by the discovery of Mises and the Austrian School, the writings of which very clearly showed that the Austrians were unique in that they were powerfully devoted to the intellectual search for the truth about how the economic world (and beyond) works, and how governments don’t work, and were not at all interested in being apologists for the plundering class.

Iran’s Rebellious Youth Target Regime Symbols Amid Rising Executi...	On Saturday, November 9, Iran’s rebellious youth attacked regime targets in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Mashhad in response to the increasing executions and massacres in Iran’s prisons, including: – 94 executions from October 22 to November 8 – 441 executions during the tenure of regime president Masoud Pezeshkian – 17 executions on Wednesday, November 8 alone The rebellious youth also responded to the regime’s growing repressive measures against women and girls. The targets of the attacks included: Explosion at headquarters of the Khomeini Foundation in Shiraz, which is responsible for looting the wealth of the country to serve the regime’s nefarious purposes Setting fire to a center for suppressing women in Tehran Setting fire to three IRGC Basij bases in Tehran and Mashhad Setting fire to banners of regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, supreme leader Ali Khamenei, and former IRGC Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani in Tehran Setting fire to banners of the regime’s terrorist proxies in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz While Khamenei increases executions to intimidate the oppressed and impoverished masses who have been driven to despair, the rebellious youth rise to lead the way for the downtrodden to protest. On November 8, Resistance Units in Zahedan carried out anti-regime activities against the regime’s wave of repressive measures aimed at intimidating the public. The Resistance Units held banners and placards in public areas, reiterating their commitment to protect the rights of all Iranians and fighting for a free and democratic Iran. – 'For the freedom of the people and homeland, we only rely on ourselves' – 'The time has come to call for overthrowing the regime ' – 'The first and last word is overthrow, overthrow!' – 'Terrorism and trafficking plots don’t stick to our brothers who fight for justice and the minimum rights of the oppressed Baluch people' – 'The people of Sistan-Baluchistan and Sunni Iranians won’t be fooled by the appointment of a Sunni governor' (reference to the regime’s appointment of one if its loyalists as governor of the province) – 'The destruction of Chabahar residents’ homes is the accomplishment of the new Baluchistan governor' – 'The blood of the Baluch and their martyrs from Zahedan’s bloody Friday and Khash is still alive today' – 'The response to the execution of prisoners and killing of fuel carriers is uprising ' – 'The Sunni and Baluch governor whom Khamenei and Pezeshkian installed in Sistan-Baluchistan is theirs to keep' – 'The overthrow of this regime won’t come from the sky, so we must rise up' – 'Khamenei should know the response to executions is uprising' The rebellious youth also carried out activities on the fortieth day after the tragic disaster at the Tabas coal mine, where 53 miners lost their lives and dozens more were injured, targeting the regime’s centers of repression and plunder across various cities, including: – Explosion at a Basij base in Shiraz – Explosion at the HQ of the Khomeini Foundation in Golpayegan – Setting fire to three Basij bases in Tehran – Setting fire to two Basij bases in Mashhad – Setting fire to a poster of Qasem Soleimani in Shush – Setting fire to banners of the regime’s proxy forces in Tehran, Karaj, and Ahvaz In a situation where cries of protest from the oppressed, impoverished by poverty, rising prices, and empty tables, echo against the dark tyranny of the mullahs’ regime, and while the regime uses executions and terror to stop uprisings, the rebellious youth are sending the message that the only path to freedom is resistance and uprisings.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbXymKlMfHqOs	2024-11-10T17:03:56-08:00	
Strategic Choke Points: Why India’s Access To The Malacca And Hor...	In an era of strategic competition, India's geostrategic positioning and access to two of the world's most critical maritime chokepoints—the Malacca and Hormuz Straits—grant it significant leverage. Together, these straits see over 60% of the world's oil flow and a third of global trade, underscoring their strategic importance for energy security and economic continuity. This article delves into how these chokepoints have evolved from avenues of trade to arenas of strategic influence, further cementing India's status as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific. The heightened focus on the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and Indo-Pacific is driven by multiple factors, including China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a recalibrating U.S. presence in the region, and the growing importance of maintaining secure, unimpeded global trade. India's maritime strategy has evolved to meet these shifting dynamics, moving beyond a coastal defence approach to a sophisticated, multi-layered strategy to protect its interests and those of its allies. Historical and Strategic Context: India's Maritime Evolution India's maritime ambitions have deep roots, with its naval history tracing back to ancient trade routes that once flourished across the Indian Ocean. However, India's naval posture was initially limited post-independence, focusing on littoral defence. Only in the last few decades, spurred by economic liberalisation, regional competition, and strategic imperatives, India began asserting its presence across the IOR. India's gradual shift toward a blue-water navy capable of operating in open oceans aligns with Alfred Mahan's concept of 'sea power' as a defining force for national strength. Key elements reshaping India's strategy include: China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): China's investments in ports across South Asia, such as Gwadar and Hambantota, are components of a 'String of Pearls' strategy, creating a network of logistical hubs and potential military outposts that could encircle India. U.S.-China Rivalry: As tensions increase, India's alignment with democratic maritime powers like the U.S. has become essential. The convergence of Indo-Pacific interests now shapes India's partnerships. Energy and Economic Security: Since over 85% of India's oil is imported via the Strait of Hormuz and key trade routes pass through the Malacca Strait, secure access to these chokepoints is fundamental to India's economic and energy stability. By securing and monitoring these chokepoints, India amplifies its influence, not just regionally but across the broader Indo-Pacific, underpinning its ambitions to be a net security provider. The Role of the Indian Navy: Strategic Surveillance and Rapid Response As the primary instrument of India's maritime power, the Indian Navy plays a central role in safeguarding India's strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. Several key assets and strategies support India's naval vigilance over the Malacca and Hormuz Straits: Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC): The ANC is India's first tri-service theatre command, enabling coordinated defence capabilities at a vantage point near the Malacca Strait. This location allows India to maintain a robust monitoring and rapid-response presence over a critical waterway that carries nearly half of the world's maritime trade. Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): Established in 2018, IFC-IOR facilitates real-time information sharing on maritime traffic, enhancing situational awareness and coordination with regional partners. This collaboration supports surveillance and ensures quick mobilisation in case of suspicious or hostile activities. Mission-Based Deployments (MBDs): India's year-round mission-based deployments allow the Indian Navy to maintain continuous patrols and surveillance over critical chokepoints, ensuring freedom of navigation and deterring piracy, terrorism, and other regional threats. Notably, anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and patrols in the Straits of Malacca and Hormuz reinforce India's ability to act as a first responder in crises. Regional Exercises and Operational Engagements: India has participated in high-profile naval exercises such as Malabar (with Quad members) and bilateral exercises with ASEAN nations. These drills enhance operational readiness interoperability and allow for joint strategic planning and rapid response to emerging threats in the region. By combining surveillance, intelligence sharing, and rapid deployment, the Indian Navy projects power across the Indo-Pacific, showcasing its ability to maintain stability and counter threats in these critical waterways. Geopolitical Challenges and Regional Rivalries: Balancing China's Influence India's strategic aspirations are increasingly impacted by the competition posed by China's expanding influence across the Indian Ocean. The 'String of Pearls' network of ports and bases, extending from Gwadar to Hambantota, raises the stakes, as China's presence in these locations grants it proximity to vital Indian interests. Key Aspects of India's Response India's SAGAR Vision: Under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy, India has focused on fostering stability, economic connectivity, and security in the Indian Ocean. Through SAGAR, India has strengthened ties with ASEAN, Gulf nations, and littoral states, encouraging collaboration in maritime security, economic investment, and infrastructure development. Counterbalancing through the Quad and Regional Alliances: India's strategic engagements within the Quad (U.S., Japan, Australia, and India) and with ASEAN partners counterbalance China's assertive posture. Joint exercises, increased port calls, and dialogues on Indo-Pacific security underscore India's commitment to countering Chinese influence in these waterways. Partnerships in Port Development and Military Access: India has enhanced its logistical and military presence by developing infrastructure in the Maldives, Mauritius, and Seychelles. These partnerships extend India's operational reach and foster economic development in partner countries, strengthening India's influence in response to Chinese port acquisitions. These efforts signal India's resolve to safeguard its sovereignty over the IOR, mitigate Chinese encirclement, and maintain a balance of power, favouring an open, rules-based order. International Legal Frameworks: India's Commitment to UNCLOS India's adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) bolsters its image as a responsible maritime power. Part III of UNCLOS guarantees freedom of passage through international straits such as the Malacca and Hormuz, essential for global trade. India's operations abide by these regulations, contrasting with China's assertive activities in the South China Sea, where Beijing's territorial claims have contested freedom of navigation. By championing the principles of UNCLOS, India promotes a legal framework that upholds maritime stability and security. This commitment to international law enhances India's legitimacy as a stabilising force in the region, reinforcing the importance of a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific. Partnerships and Naval Diplomacy: Building Strategic Depth India's strategic partnerships extend beyond traditional alliances, encompassing extensive naval diplomacy and logistical support arrangements across the Indo-Pacific. Key Partnerships and Exercises Quad Exercises (Malabar): These exercises showcase the collective capabilities of Quad nations and enhance interoperability, ensuring that partner navies are operationally prepared for joint crisis response, freedom of navigation operations, and disaster relief efforts. ASEAN and Gulf Collaboration: India's bilateral exercises with ASEAN nations and increasing defence ties with Gulf states foster maritime interoperability and coordination. These alliances are pivotal as they help counterbalance regional threats, ensuring a cooperative security environment in the Indo-Pacific. Dual-Use Facilities in Key Locations: India's dual-use logistics facilities in Mauritius, Seychelles, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands extend the Indian Navy's reach across the Indian Ocean. By combining military capabilities with developmental aid and infrastructure, India strengthens its influence over these critical chokepoints, ensuring a sustained presence. These alliances support India's ambition to be a net security provider, allowing it to extend influence across the Indo-Pacific and respond quickly to regional threats. A Vision for Stability in the Indo-Pacific The Malacca and Hormuz Straits are more than maritime corridors—they are strategic assets that shape India's vision for a secure Indo-Pacific. By leveraging its naval strength, establishing partnerships, and adhering to international norms, India plays a decisive role in maintaining regional stability. As regional rivalries intensify, India's resolve to safeguard these chokepoints aligns with its vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, underscoring its responsibilities as a regional security provider. With its evolving naval strategies, proactive diplomacy, and steadfast adherence to international law, India is well-positioned to lead as a regional net security provider. India's commitment to securing these straits serves its national interests and fosters stability and resilience in the Indo-Pacific, ensuring the security and prosperity of all regional stakeholders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbbwVIRwe573-	2024-11-10T17:02:25-08:00	
The Russian Invasion Of Ukraine: An Uncertain Future – OpEd	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has reached the culminating point in an unanticipated way for Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is one of the most brutal wars seen in recent history, with exponential losses in terms of human lives and destruction of properties, as well as lingering psychological impacts in both nations. This war is seen as one of the strategically miscalculated wars immensely supported by the West, which continues to react to Russian strategies instead of being proactive. The West's reactive approach has proven time and time again that it paved this precarious situation in Ukraine. The West's unwavering support to Ukraine has undergone different phases of transition with changes of governments of staunch supporting nations. However, the impact was minimal as the United States was leading the supporting efforts in Ukraine. In this context, Ukraine still obtained all the support needed to prevail in this conflict. The West's unwavering support, to a greater extent, not only encouraged the ambitious plans of President Zelensky to liberate some areas under Russian occupation but also to challenge Russian military might. As one can see, there were many inconsistencies in Ukraine's strategic planning and preparations. Ukraine's response solely depended on external support on paper rather than the availability of resources in hand. This strategic miscalculation of President Zelensky took Ukraine towards an unreversible failed path, thus permanently changing international security dynamics affecting areas beyond Ukraine. One such example is creating a new military alliance between Russia and North Korea that ultimately augmented the Russian military might. It is evident that President Zelensky's plans were merely based on hypothetical situations rather than the availability of resources, thereby over-extending capabilities and making them vulnerable. One such example is the occupation of Russia's Kursk region with battle-hardened brigades with considerable resources, thus creating a vacuum in the frontlines in Ukraine. Without absolute control of the war mechanism under Ukrainian leadership, the success achieved so far with this move is questionable, and it is hard to understand the strategy behind it. Such moves are only effective for a specific battlefield achievement that could turn the tide in Ukraine's favor within a specified period. However, Russia maintained its strategic objectives unperturbed, effectively dividing Ukrainian concentration until it had enough combat power to retake areas in Kursk. The level of uncertainty is proved by Ukraine's top military commander, Colonel General Syrskii's recent statement that the situation on the front lines is 'very, very difficult' due to being outnumbered and outgunned by Russian forces. According to the latest intelligence reports, the Russian military has assembled a force of 50,000 troops, including North Koreans, to retake the territory seized by Ukraine. If this Russian operation goes as planned, Ukrainian troops in Kursk will face one of the biggest challenges for their survival: over 5:1 enemy superiority. This will undeniably thin the frontline combat readiness in Ukraine, likely resulting in an early culmination of the conflict. Nevertheless, as of now, the recently concluded elections in the United States won by former President Trump have sent a clear message to the rest of the world that the United States does not intend to drag wars to achieve indirect strategic advantage but aims to stop killings for a better world. As one can see, no supporting country to Ukraine has put forward any means to end the war or encouraged Ukraine to resort to negotiations. This attitude of the staunch supporters has given President Zelensky a free hand that led to this calamity in the international security landscape. Unrealistic planning, while dependent on external support with hope, is not a recipe for success but leading the way towards a strategic failure. So far, President Putin's gambit worked as he had envisaged, including incorporating North Korean troops to equate to the combined West. On all accounts, the combined West with Ukraine failed to telegraph a plan to halt Russian aggression and prevent weakening Ukraine's security posture. On the other hand, President Zelensky's unrealistic, ambitious plans further weakened Ukraine's security posture and made frontlines even more vulnerable. Yet, despite strategic miscalculations, President Zelensky seems not to realize the ground realities. He faced a significant setback in his latest plan, demanding regaining Crimea control. A senior advisor to President-elect Donald Trump has said Ukraine needs to be 'realistic' in its aim for the war, adding the Russian-occupied peninsula of Crimea was 'gone.' It is time to grapple with the reality that unwavering support does not mean being unrealistic. In such a scenario, 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' It is time to take a prudent approach to end this brutal war meaningfully that promotes broader international security. It is evident that President Zelensky's 'Victory Plan' has fallen well short of achieving its intended goals. Many Western staunch supporters have expressed different opinions on the Victory Plan for practical reasons, such as to avoid escalation and dragging them toward direct conflict with Russia. It is time for President Zelensky to come to reality and devise an alternative plan to sustain its efforts realistically to garner international support to end the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbcloRK3rhV9T	2024-11-10T16:56:08-08:00	
The Musings Of Shigeru Ishiba: Visions Of An Asian NATO – OpEd	Japan’s new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is stirring the pot – notably on regional security matters. He has proposed something that has done more than raise a few eyebrows in the foreign and defence ministries of several countries. An Asian version of NATO, he has suggested, was an idea worth considering, notably given China’s ambitions in the region. 'The creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' he revealed to the Washington-based Hudson Institute in September. During his campaign for office, Ishiba had mooted changes to the deployment arrangements of the Japan Self-Defence Forces and the need to move beyond the purely bilateral approach to regional security anchored by US agreements with various countries, be it with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others. Ishiba’s suggested changes to Japan’s self-defence posture builds on a cabinet decision made during the Abe administration to reinterpret the country’s constitution to permit exercising the right of collective self-defence. It was a problematic move, given the pacifist nature of a text that renounces the use of force in the resolution of international disputes. In September 2015, then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convinced the Diet to pass a package of security bills known as the Legislation for Peace and Security, thereby allowing Japan to participate in limited forms of collective self-defence. Opponents warned, understandably, that the legislation paved the way for Japan to attack a country in concert with another on the premise of collective self-defence, despite not itself being directly attacked. They have every reason to be even more worried given Ishiba’s recent meditations. The intention to broaden the remit of how Japan’s armed forces are deployed is also a reminder to the United States that Tokyo is no longer interested in playing a subordinate role in its alliance with Washington. 'The current Japan-US security treaty,' complains Ishiba, 'is structured so that the US is obligated to ‘defend’ Japan, and Japan is obligated to ‘provide bases’ to the US.' He suggests 'expanding the scope of joint management of US bases in Japan', a move that would reduce Washington’s burden, and revising the Japan-US Security Treaty and Status of Forces Agreement to permit the stationing of Japanese forces on Guam. What makes his suggestions disconcerting is not merely the establishment of a power bloc bound by the glue of collective self-defence – an arrangement that has much to do with defence as a growling provocation. Ishiba is intent on being even more provocative in suggesting that any such 'Asian version of NATO must also specifically consider America’s sharing of nuclear weapons or the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region.' Were such a move taken, it would, at least from a Japanese perspective, fly in the face of a doctrine in place since December 1967, when Prime Minister Eisaku Sato articulated the three non-nuclear principles of 'not possessing, not producing and not permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons, in line with Japan’s Peace Constitution.' As with so many in the business of preaching about international security, false paradigms and analysis are offered from the pulpit. The Japanese PM, much like neoconservative hawks in Washington and Canberra, prove incapable of seeing conflict in generic, transferrable terms. 'Ukraine today is Asia tomorrow,' he falsely reasons. 'Replacing Russia with China and Ukraine and Taiwan, the absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense.' Ergo, he reasons, the need for an Asian version of NATO. Ishiba’s suggestions have yet to gather momentum. Daniel Kritenbrink, US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, told a forum on Indo-Pacific security at the Stimson Center in September that he preferred the current 'latticework' approach to US regional alliances featuring, for instance, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving Japan, India and Australia, and AUKUS, featuring Australia and the UK. 'It’s too early to talk about collective security in that context, and [the creation of] more formal institutions'. It was far better to focus on 'investing in the region’s existing formal architecture and continuing to build this network of formal and information relationships.' Kritenbrink’s analysis hardly gets away from the suspicion that the 'latticework' theory of US security in the Indo-Pacific is but a form of NATO in embryo. As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said with tartness in 2022, 'The real goal for the [US] Indo-Pacific strategy is to establish an Indo-Pacific version of NATO. These perverse actions run counter to common aspirations of the region and are doomed to fail.' From New Delhi, the view towards such an alliance is not a glowing one. On October 1, at an event held by Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar proved dismissive of any NATO replication in Asia. 'We don’t have that kind of strategic architecture in mind.' India had 'a different history and different way of approaching' its security considerations. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the collective defence hawks so keen on adding kindling to conflict will have their teeth chattering. Ishiba’s ideas may well have to be put back into cold storage – at least in the interim. And as luck would have it, his own prime ministerial tenure already looks threatened.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbXH544SP64FE	2024-11-10T16:49:12-08:00	
The Role Of Political Psychology In US Energy Diplomacy: Strategi...	Political psychology—a field that examines how psychological processes influence political decision-making, behavior, and relations—plays a significant role in the energy diplomacy of the United States. As one of the world's largest energy producers and consumers, the U.S. has established sophisticated mechanisms in its energy diplomacy that extend beyond mere resources and policies. By using psychological principles to shape perception, build alliances, and influence international energy policy, the United States wields a unique diplomatic approach that ensures its interests are safeguarded and advanced globally. This article explores how the U.S. uses political psychology in its energy diplomacy, analyzing its application through strategic influence, perception management, and alliance building. Understanding Political Psychology and Energy Diplomacy Political psychology in energy diplomacy is centered around how beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions impact energy policy and international relations. The U.S. uses political psychology to assess the motivations, fears, and aspirations of global actors, crafting messages and policies that resonate with target audiences. Through a deep understanding of these psychological dynamics, the U.S. is able to influence foreign governments, energy markets, and public opinion in ways that align with its broader geopolitical objectives. Presenting Energy Independence and Security The U.S. presents energy independence and security as cornerstones of its national identity and strength. Domestically, this framing is designed to evoke a sense of self-reliance and resilience, instilling public support for policies that reduce dependence on foreign oil and promote domestic energy production. Internationally, this psychological framing positions the U.S. as a robust and reliable player in energy markets, reinforcing the perception of stability and control over energy resources. By highlighting energy independence, the U.S. promotes a message that it can be trusted as a partner who won't succumb to foreign energy pressures. In response to events like the 1973 oil crisis, the U.S. developed a narrative around the importance of energy security to prevent future vulnerabilities. This narrative continues to shape U.S. energy diplomacy, where it projects itself as an energy-secure nation capable of supporting allies in times of crisis, such as Europe during its recent energy challenges with Russia. This framing appeals to allies' psychological desire for stability and reassurance, positioning the U.S. as a dependable partner. Perception Management and Psychological Influence The United States excels at perception management, a strategy that manipulates how other nations perceive its energy policies, resources, and objectives. By using political psychology to understand the concerns and priorities of other countries, the U.S. tailors its diplomatic communications to foster favorable impressions. For instance, during the European energy crisis following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. presented itself as a stable provider of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. This assurance was not only about supplying energy but also about projecting an image of the U.S. as a trustworthy, steady ally, reinforcing a sense of psychological security in an unpredictable energy landscape. Perception management extends to how the U.S. shapes narratives around environmental and climate policies. By emphasizing its role in clean energy development, the U.S. not only appeals to global environmental concerns but also differentiates itself from nations like Russia and China, which are often seen as less committed to climate action. This positions the U.S. as both a leader and moral authority on sustainability, a strategy that appeals to countries looking for partnerships that align with their own climate goals. Influence Tactics in Diplomatic Negotiations In energy negotiations, the U.S. employs a range of influence tactics grounded in political psychology to achieve its objectives. Techniques such as reciprocity, social proof, and authority are used to build consensus and secure commitments from other nations. Reciprocity: The U.S. often engages in reciprocal agreements, where it provides energy resources, technology, or financial aid in exchange for political or economic concessions. This tactic creates a sense of obligation and goodwill, fostering a reciprocal dynamic that strengthens alliances. Social Proof: By collaborating with influential multilateral organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and promoting collective action on issues such as climate change, the U.S. taps into the principle of social proof. Countries are more likely to adopt U.S.-favored energy policies when they see other nations doing so, reinforcing a norm of alignment with U.S. standards. Authority: The U.S. uses its expertise in energy technology, regulatory frameworks, and climate science to assert authority in international energy discourse. By positioning itself as a knowledgeable and reliable leader, it influences other countries to follow its recommendations, especially in areas like nuclear energy safety and renewable energy investment. Soft Power and Cultural Messaging in Energy Diplomacy Soft power—the ability to attract and persuade rather than coerce—is a critical component of U.S. energy diplomacy. Through initiatives like the Clean Energy Ministerial and the U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership, the U.S. promotes energy policies that align with global values of sustainability and innovation. This messaging resonates particularly well with countries striving to improve their energy infrastructures while addressing climate goals. The U.S. also uses cultural diplomacy to promote clean energy values. Public diplomacy campaigns, academic exchanges, and international conferences all serve to promote an image of the U.S. as a pioneer in sustainable energy. These efforts subtly encourage other nations to align their energy policies with U.S. standards, fostering a psychological alignment that facilitates diplomatic cooperation. Building Psychological Resilience through Strategic Communication During energy crises or market disruptions, the U.S. employs strategic communication to maintain psychological resilience among its allies and prevent adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities. By quickly addressing energy supply concerns, the U.S. reduces fear and uncertainty, preventing panic that could destabilize markets or compromise alliances. For example, during the 2022 European energy crisis, the U.S. communicated its commitment to support Europe with LNG supplies, helping to calm anxieties and maintain solidarity against Russia's use of energy as a geopolitical weapon. This communication reinforced a sense of unity and collective resilience, a psychological strategy that not only provided immediate relief but also strengthened long-term trust in U.S. energy partnerships. Psychological Tactics in Countering Energy Influence from Adversaries The U.S. actively counters the energy influence of adversaries like Russia and China through psychological tactics designed to diminish their appeal and expose vulnerabilities. By highlighting the environmental and security risks of relying on Russian energy or Chinese coal-based investments, the U.S. seeks to sway countries toward U.S.-backed energy options that are presented as cleaner, safer, and more transparent. Moreover, the U.S. often presents its energy exports, particularly LNG, as a means of freedom gas to promote the idea of energy as a tool for liberating countries from authoritarian influences. This framing creates a psychological association between U.S. energy and ideals of democracy and freedom, appealing to countries wary of over-reliance on energy from less democratic nations. Leveraging Identity and National Pride in Energy Diplomacy The U.S. taps into the identity and national pride of other nations as a psychological lever in energy diplomacy. Recognizing that countries often seek to bolster their own national image and self-sufficiency, the U.S. offers partnerships that empower other nations to build their own energy capabilities. For instance, the U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative encourages African countries to develop sustainable energy infrastructures, appealing to their aspirations for independence and modernization. In many cases, the U.S. also encourages the adoption of U.S.-backed technologies and standards, framing them as symbols of modernization and progress. This approach resonates with national pride and the desire for development, positioning the U.S. as a valuable partner in achieving these goals. Using Fear Appeals and Security Concerns In some aspects of its energy diplomacy, the U.S. employs fear appeals by emphasizing the risks of energy insecurity and reliance on unpredictable suppliers. By highlighting the potential for supply disruptions, economic downturns, or security vulnerabilities, the U.S. appeals to the fear of instability among its allies, reinforcing the desirability of a secure energy partnership with the U.S.For example, the U.S. response to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project was partially based on raising awareness of the security risks posed by dependence on Russian gas. This approach used fear appeals to sway European public opinion and political leaders toward alternative energy arrangements, including increased imports of U.S. LNG, framing it as a more stable and secure choice. Psychological Commitment to Environmental Stewardship The U.S. leverages global psychological commitment to environmental stewardship as part of its energy diplomacy. By positioning itself as a leader in climate action and green energy technology, the U.S. appeals to the growing environmental consciousness of countries worldwide. Through initiatives such as the Paris Agreement, where the U.S. is a prominent participant, it appeals to the psychological need for global unity in addressing environmental crises. In promoting clean energy, the U.S. also addresses the concept of cognitive consistency. Many countries have publicly committed to climate goals and renewable energy transitions, and by aligning with the U.S., they are able to maintain this consistency. The U.S. takes advantage of this psychological drive to align policy actions with public commitments, fostering partnerships that support its own clean energy goals. Conclusion The United States' approach to energy diplomacy is deeply infused with psychological strategies that shape global perceptions, alliances, and policy decisions. By using political psychology to understand and influence the motivations, fears, and aspirations of other nations, the U.S. creates an environment conducive to its energy interests and objectives. From framing energy independence to leveraging environmental commitments, the U.S. employs a range of psychological tactics that reinforce its role as a leader in global energy diplomacy. As energy markets become more complex and interdependent, the psychological dimension of energy diplomacy will only grow in importance. The U.S. continues to refine its psychological strategies, adapting them to new geopolitical realities and evolving environmental priorities. Through this sophisticated blend of political psychology and energy policy, the U.S. sets an influential model in energy diplomacy—one that emphasizes resilience, stability, and strategic influence in the global energy arena.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbTHWCY69-HV2	2024-11-10T16:45:13-08:00	
Africa At Valdai And First Ministerial Conference: What’s Next Fo...	At the Valdai Discussion Club's meeting held on 7th November 2024, President Vladimir Putin at the plenary session continued to build indepth discussions on Russian and African bilateral relations, Russia's passion to support Africa's attainment of economic sovereignty. It was explicitly noted, and this noticeably reflected in the declarations adopted after the first and second Russia-Africa summits, that Africa needs to liberate itself from the trapings of neo-colonialism of the United States and Europe. That was not the first time. Valdai's experts have been interested in Russia's policy in Africa, particularly in this contemporary era of evolving multipolar architecture and new world political order. Africa is an integral part of the focus in the Global South. Russia has already held two symbolic summits and outlined certain economic directions for Africa. In practical terms, Russia with its previous experience with Africa during the Soviet times, now has the potential to assert as an investment leader in Africa. African leaders have unreservedly expressed their preparedness for mutual economic cooperation and in other fields, voiced their support for building a new world order through the association BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). Given the proven fact that Russia certainly has both the financial and technological capability for investing in public infrastructure, in addition to to providing necessary security in conflicting regions in Africa. Conflicts in Africa are partially as a result of under-development, and persistent weak economic development and rising levels of unemployment in the society. It is abundantly clear that with its multivectoral foreign policy, Russia has presented itself as a reliable partner, and currently is leading African countries to confront western hegemony, political exceptionalism and dominating power. It has offered guarantees of being in position to support Africa to attain economic sovereignty but, for now, largely remained as a virtual investor. Russia's economic presence in Africa is still comparatively weak, even after the symbolic summits held in Sochi and St. Petersburg. Notwithstanding, African leaders consider efforts at reforming international institutions and Africa's incorporation into their structures would facilitate the process of attaining a better economic status, enable the expected transitions from the current trends of neo-colonialism and further move away from blames of state management inefficiency, development unsustainability and frustration of democracy. Across the continent, leaders and the elites have shown their inability to mitigate crises and to mobilise sufficient resources, including financing and human for promote their development goals. Undeniably, the Valdai Club represents a critical area of research for humanity, experts dive into useful details or debate the causes of ongoing developments now around the world. In his contribution at Valdai, an Indian expert Rasigan Maharajh, rightly explained that 'common security can only be enhanced by actively reducing these inequalities in world systems, actively promoting knowledge sharing, and ensuring equitable opportunities for the development of all and sundry.' And the global majority seems to obviously prefer multipolarity. As relations are developing, moving ahead with concrete policy decisions should be an ideal direction. Quite often, there has been a lot of positive momentum in developing remarkable cooperation, several bilateral agreements have been signed and yet little noticeable results. Russians get irritated by the statement indicating little impact after series of business meetings, conferences and summits. At the Valdai meeting, Professor Irina Abramova, Director of the Africa Studies Institute had the opportunity to ask Vladimir Putin a few questions relating to Africa. Specifically she wanted to know Putin's views over the impact of Russia's relations with Africa based on the fact that Putin has repeated his popular phrases, at the Kazan's BRICS press conference that Africa, together with Southeast Asia, are new centers of global growth. Today, at Valdai meeting, Putin repeated this same idea. Professor Abramova, in addition, stressed the fact that in the conditions of fierce competition – China, India, and old global players, and even Turkey, the (Persian) Gulf countries, and Iran are working seriously in the continent, – Russia needs to find its niche, where it would be the best for Africans. But, dozens of negotiations with African leaders have been held these several years, with some more than once. Was there any one promising direction in these negotiations that all African leaders would talk about? As expected, Putin reiterated all those popular Soviet-style rhetoric, ultimately reflecting the historical support for Africa to attain political independence from colonial rule, western exploitation and for sovereignty, for the creation of some basic conditions for economic development. Officials have indicated that colonial trends in the African system constitute impediments for Russia to effectively invest in Africa. Without mincing words, Putin stressed further at the Valdai meeting: 'these neo-colonial instruments have been preserved in the economy by Western countries, but also in the field of security. In general, we will work intensely, responsibly, systematically in all directions.' The first Russia-Africa ministerial conference was also held, on 9–10 November 2024, in southern coastal city of Sochi as per the decisions reached at the Second Russia–Africa Summit. The business programme included around 20 panel sessions and thematic events focusing on perspectives for Russia–Africa cooperation in the areas of security, economics, and humanitarian engagement. It aimed at building on the outcomes of the Second Russia–Africa Summit, bringing together more than 40 foreign ministers from Russia and Africa, the African Union Commission, and executive bodies of regional integration organizations. In attendance were approximately 1,500 representatives from financial institutions, Russian and African businesses, civil society, academia, and the media. There was, as always, those similar themes for dialogue between Russia and Africa. 'Cooperation with the countries of the African continent is now one of the common priorities, noting that there are existing wide prospects for cooperation as demonstrated by the large numbers of African partners to the conference,' stated Anton Kobyakov, Adviser to the President of the Russian Federation, Executive Secretary of the Organizing Committee for Russia–Africa at Roscongress Foundation. Available on the Kremlin website, Vladimir Putin greetings to the first ministerial conference participants read: 'African countries enjoy a growing prestige on the international stage. By pursuing a constructive and peace-loving foreign policy, they are playing an increasingly important role in addressing major international matters. For its part, Russia attaches particular importance to strengthening relations with its African partners. We are united by our aspiration to building a just multipolar world order based on genuine equality and the rule of law and any form of discrimination.' In absolute terms, Russia showed preparedness to facilitate the implementation of large infrastructure projects, without publicly mentioning financial allocation. It further pointed to issues of promoting the development of trade and economic relations between Russia and Africa, while emphasizing on the possibility of creating favourable environment and conditions. There is absolutely no need to repeat multi-dimensional contents from speeches of President Vladimir Putin and that of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov here. But an insight into all the previous official statements, there have already been layout steps for concrete areas of cooperation. What remains are valuable and thorough examination of Russia's potential focused directions in Africa policy. Many have indicated that Russian and African leaders really have to take off existing barriers for promoting economic development, and this could have positive implications for African countries, and particularly for Russia as one of the leaders of the emerging multipolar world. Aside setting priorities, Russian and African leaders working-style of state-to-state and government-to-government format, both have to broaden joint parameters to include the private sector operatives, the civil society, entrepreneurial diaspora, youth and women, to pave pathways for broader relationship between Russia and African countries. The questions arising from the historic first ministerial conference provided an additional strong basis, and one more step forward, especially coordinating the implementation of joint projects involving potential Russian operators in the spheres of trade, economic and investment partnership, and embrace new mechanisms and on suitable ways to bolster multifaceted relations between Russia and Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbeMa83tGKrNn	2024-11-10T16:42:46-08:00	
Second Trump Term A Threat To Rights In US, World, Says HRW	Donald Trump’s second term as United States president poses a grave threat to human rights in the United States and the world, Human Rights Watch said. These concerns reflect Trump’s rights-abusing record during his first term, his embrace of white supremacist supporters and ideology, the extreme antidemocratic and anti-rights policies proposed by think tanks led by former aides, and campaign promises, including to round up and deport millions of immigrants and retaliate against political opponents. 'Donald Trump has made no secret of his intent to violate the human rights of millions of people in the United States,' said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. 'Independent institutions and civil society groups, including Human Rights Watch, will need to do all we can to hold him and his administration accountable for abuses.' During Trump’s first term as president, from 2017 to 2021, Human Rights Watch documented his record of rights abuses. These included policies and efforts to expel asylum seekers and separate families at the US-Mexico border, advance racist tropes against Black communities and other people of color, adopt policiesthat punish low-income families and deprive them of health care, and to fuel a violent insurrection to overthrow the results of a democratic election. Trump’s pledges during his 2024 campaign raise greater cause for concern in a second term, both domestically and internationally. In 2023, he said he would not be a dictator 'except for day one' in office. Trump has repeatedly praised autocrats such as Viktor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un. He has proposed policies that would weaken democratic institutions that protect fundamental human rights and would lessen checks on presidential authority. The threat of abusing the executive office is of even greater concern because of a recent US Supreme Court decision that grants presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken in office. Project 2025, a governing plan written by Trump’s former advisers and political allies, details many other abusive, often racially discriminatory policies that the new administration may adopt. Although Trump has denied connections to Project 2025, many of his statements echo its premises. While the presidential campaign cycle featured rhetoric from both candidates that was hostile toward immigrants, Trump made scapegoating immigrants a central pillar of his campaign. He has called for extreme policies that include mass detention of migrants and mass deportations of millions of people, which would tear apart families with deep roots in the US. Such a program would invariably entail racial profiling, lead to heightened abuses by law enforcement during mass roundups, and instigate more xenophobic actions among the wider public. During the campaign, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, spread racist lies about Haitian migrants in particular and fomented disinformation that immigration leads to increased crime in the United States. Abortion rights will be under increased threat during Trump’s second term. His insistence that states should have the power to block access to basic health care allows policies that violate rights, endanger health, lead to preventable deaths, and criminalize private health care decisions. Trump has vowed to retaliate against his political enemies. Throughout speeches and campaign interviews, he has used increasingly dangerous rhetoric, referring to his critics as 'the enemy from within.' Trump threatened to order the US Department of Justice to pursue prosecutions against President Joe Biden and others he claims oppose his agenda, including election officials and voters. Trump has also suggested he would invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the US military and national guard against people in the US who might exercise their right to protest. With respect to foreign policy, during his first term Trump demonstrated little respect for treaties, multilateral institutions, or efforts to protect the human rights of people living under repressive governments. His administration consistently worked against women’s rights and environmental progress at the United Nations and tried to redefine and limit the definition of rights to be protected through the US Department of State. Trump has signaled opposition to funding for humanitarian aid and civilian protection efforts in major conflicts and crises. Likely partnerships with rights-abusing governments during a new Trump administration risk emboldening these governments to further harm people within their purview and perpetuate cycles of abuse and immunity from accountability around the world. 'Rights-respecting institutions and officials need to hold the line during the Trump administration,' Hassan said. 'World leaders, federal and state workers, activists, and ordinary citizens have a role to play in protecting human rights and keeping Trump from carrying out the abuses he has promised.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbRnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-10T16:39:29-08:00	
Adapting Bangladesh’s Energy Strategy For A Surge In Global Renew...	As the world moves toward a renewable energy future, Bangladesh has an opportunity to integrate sustainable energy sources across its power, heat, and transport sectors. Between 2024 and 2030, global renewable energy consumption is projected to increase by nearly 60%, driven by technological advancements, falling costs, and supportive policies. For Bangladesh, aligning with this global trend is essential not only for enhancing energy security and meeting climate targets but also for reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and fostering economic resilience. Here's a sector-by-sector analysis of how Bangladesh can adopt a proactive approach to leverage renewable energy within the context of global trends. 1. Power Sector: Scaling Up Renewable Electricity Global forecasts show renewable electricity, particularly from solar and wind, will be the primary driver of growth in renewable energy. By 2030, renewable electricity is expected to reach 46% of global electricity generation, with solar PV and wind becoming the largest contributors. For Bangladesh, where demand for electricity is rapidly rising, expanding renewable power sources is crucial for both energy security and carbon reduction. Steps Bangladesh Can Take: Expanding Solar and Wind Capacity: Bangladesh has already started investing in solar energy projects, but there is significant potential for further expansion. To support this, Bangladesh could incentivize utility-scale solar and wind farms, particularly in areas with high solar irradiance and wind potential. Decentralized Solar Power: Given the geography and challenges of grid expansion, solar home systems and mini-grids in rural areas could provide off-grid solutions, especially in regions where extending the main grid is cost-prohibitive. Policy and Financial Support: Bangladesh could benefit from policy reforms that attract foreign investment in renewables and provide financial incentives for local renewable energy developers. Leveraging international funding, such as the Green Climate Fund, would also be essential for scaling up investment. Grid Modernization: Variable renewables like solar and wind require an adaptive grid infrastructure. Strengthening the national grid and developing energy storage solutions, such as batteries, can ensure that renewable electricity is efficiently integrated and managed. 2. Industrial and Building Sectors: Embracing Renewable Heat Solutions Globally, the industrial and building sectors are projected to experience significant shifts toward renewable heat, with bioenergy, solar thermal, and geothermal sources expected to meet 20% of heating demand by 2030. In Bangladesh, transitioning to renewable heat sources can be vital for decarbonizing industries and reducing fossil fuel dependency, particularly in industries with high heat demand like textiles and ceramics. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Bioenergy and Biomass Utilization: With a substantial agricultural sector, Bangladesh has a readily available source of biomass. Developing bioenergy facilities to produce heat from agricultural residues, such as rice husks and sugarcane bagasse, could support rural industries and reduce waste. Solar Thermal Systems for Water Heating: Solar thermal installations for water heating in residential and industrial buildings offer a cost-effective renewable heat solution. Bangladesh could introduce incentive programs to encourage adoption in hotels, hospitals, and residential complexes, reducing demand on electricity used for heating. Geothermal Exploration: While geothermal energy is less developed in Bangladesh, exploring geothermal potential, especially in high-temperature regions, could support long-term renewable heating objectives. Investment in research and feasibility studies is necessary to assess the viability of geothermal projects. 3. Transport Sector: Transitioning to Renewable Fuels and Electrification The transport sector globally is set to achieve a 6% renewable energy share by 2030, with significant contributions from biofuels, renewable electricity, and emerging technologies like hydrogen. For Bangladesh, reducing emissions from transport is a critical goal, especially as urbanization and population growth increase the demand for mobility. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Promoting Electric Vehicles (EVs): Developing EV infrastructure, such as charging stations and incentives for EV purchases, is key to reducing transport emissions. Bangladesh could start with electric buses and three-wheelers, which are common in urban areas and well-suited for short commutes. Supporting Biofuel Production: Bangladesh could explore biofuels derived from local feedstocks, such as jute and waste oils, to power road and marine transport. Partnerships with local industries and international biofuel programs can help establish a domestic biofuel market. Hydrogen Pilot Projects: While hydrogen infrastructure is nascent, Bangladesh could initiate pilot projects in industrial transport applications. The introduction of hydrogen-powered buses or ferries could serve as a demonstration for future expansion and build awareness of hydrogen's potential. Reducing Traffic and Encouraging Public Transport: By improving public transit options and discouraging private vehicle use through urban planning and policy incentives, Bangladesh can minimize overall energy demand in transport. Transitioning public transport fleets to renewable energy sources can set an example for sustainable urban transport. 4. Developing Renewable Fuel Markets for Transport and Heating Renewable fuels, such as bioenergy and hydrogen, are essential for sectors that are difficult to electrify. Bangladesh can leverage these alternatives in both the transport and heating sectors to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Supporting Local Biofuel Production: Bangladesh could establish partnerships with local farmers to supply biomass for biofuel production, creating an integrated approach that benefits both the agriculture and energy sectors. Policies to support biofuel blending mandates could further boost demand. Hydrogen Research and Development: Encouraging research institutions and private sector involvement in hydrogen technology can help Bangladesh build a foundational hydrogen economy. Pilot projects in industries or transport fleets would demonstrate hydrogen's feasibility and create momentum for broader adoption. Integrating Renewable Fuels in Policy Frameworks: Bangladesh's energy policy could establish goals for renewable fuel adoption in sectors such as aviation and marine, which are harder to electrify. Incentives for renewable fuel production, along with clear government targets, can help stimulate the domestic market. 5. Addressing Investment and Policy Challenges For Bangladesh to successfully increase renewable energy across sectors, addressing investment barriers and creating supportive policies are crucial steps. The global renewable heat market, for example, faces challenges due to high interest rates and inflation, and similar issues could impact Bangladesh. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Attracting Foreign Investment and Public-Private Partnerships: Given limited domestic funding, Bangladesh should actively seek international investment through public-private partnerships. Partnerships with foreign governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector can supply the expertise and capital necessary for renewable projects. Implementing Favorable Tariffs and Subsidies: Subsidizing renewable technologies and adjusting tariffs to make renewables cost-competitive with fossil fuels would incentivize wider adoption. Policies to encourage low-interest loans or tax credits for renewable energy installations can alleviate the initial financial burden for businesses and consumers. Adopting Clear Renewable Energy Targets and Roadmaps: To guide sustainable energy transition, the government could establish a national roadmap with clear targets for renewable power, heat, and transport sectors. Aligning national policies with international climate goals, such as the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, will not only improve policy clarity but also make Bangladesh an attractive location for renewable investment. Conclusion The projected global surge in renewable energy consumption presents a valuable opportunity for Bangladesh to build a resilient, sustainable energy system. By adopting a multifaceted approach that includes expanding renewable electricity, adopting bioenergy and hydrogen, enhancing electric mobility, and investing in renewable heating, Bangladesh can align with global energy trends and address its own energy security and climate challenges. Bangladesh's renewable energy potential can be further unlocked through supportive policies, international partnerships, and a focus on building domestic expertise. As renewable energy markets transform worldwide, Bangladesh's proactive involvement in this shift can lead to a cleaner, more sustainable energy landscape—ensuring both environmental and economic benefits for the nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbbuofv7p8eIb	2024-11-10T16:34:42-08:00	
Firewall Gender Equality From Threats Like Anti-Rights Geneva Con...	Trump's earlier tenure as President of the United States was marred by the infamous jolt to abortion rights and broader sexual and reproductive health and rights. Within days after the 2024 election results point towards his imminent return as the President, anti-abortion and anti-rights agenda is menacingly on the rise once again, as per the recent news. We must remember that all governments have promised to deliver on gender equality and human rights by endorsing a range of declarations, agreements and other commitments, including the legally-binding treaty CEDAW in 1979 (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), ICPD in 1994 (International Conference on Population and Development and its Programme of Action), Beijing Declaration in 1995 and its platform for action, UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, among others. But anti-rights push of Geneva Consensus Declaration threatens to undo whatever-little progress has been made on gender equality and human rights. The Geneva Consensus Declaration takes an anti-rights stance against recognising abortion as a human right and aims to scuttle sexual and reproductive rights. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned us last year that 'on the current track, gender equality is projected to be 300 years away.' Governments have promised to deliver on gender equality by 2030 as part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 'When the PACT for the future was adopted at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2024, alarmingly over 30 countries have adopted it which are also signatories to the regressive and anti-rights Geneva Consensus Declaration,' said Menka Goundan, Programme Director, ARROW (Asian-Pacific Resource & Research Centre for Women). She was speaking at the 2nd session of SHE & Rights (Sexual Health with Equity and Rights) co-organised by ARROW, IPPF, WGNRR and CNS. Menka added: 'Whilst the bigger winds like the PACT of the future adopted at the UNGA might come in, and we would be like 'oh yeah! this is so progressive' but we often do not underscore it against threats like Geneva Consensus Declaration which will impede the progressive implementation of the PACT for the Future, and other commitments we are making for gender equality and human rights.' 'That is why we need to educate ourselves in terms of threats like Geneva Consensus Declaration. This Declaration is regressive and anti-abortion, and right winged (in terms of its framework) because it allows governments to hide under the principle of 'sovereignty' and to release these countries from their obligation to enact sexual and reproductive rights for women. So, it is a very slim move to regress when it comes to sexual and reproductive health and rights. We are failing to ensure that women have autonomy to make choices on their sexual and reproductive health' said Menka. Conflicting policies Kavutha Mutua, Advocate, High Court of Kenya and Founder-Director of The Legal Caravan said: 'Most African countries have signed on to international human rights instruments which include the CEDAW of 1979, ICPD of 1994, Beijing Declaration of 1995, and the SDGs in 2015. All of them provide critical aspects on gender equality and women empowerment with a focus on safe abortion, access to contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education. But contradicting policies, like Geneva Consensus Declaration, go against what is provided in local laws. For example, Kenya (whose constitution provides for the right to access abortion services) has signed on to the regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration - and there has been a campaign in African countries led by our respected First Ladies who are encouraging signing on to such declaration which goes against the provisions of our local laws. As Africa we need to prioritize the removal of legal and policy barriers towards access to safe abortion services and access to contraceptives.' Safe abortion rights are critical to the progress of humankind Dr Suchitra Dalvie, Co-Founder and Coordinator, Asia Safe Abortion Partnership (ASAP) said: 'Safe abortion rights are critical to the progress of humankind because the inability to control fertility reduces womens' opportunities to access education, financial independence and overall well-being. It reduces capacity to exercise autonomy, agency and the ability to fulfil their highest potential. Criminalization does not reduce or stop abortions, rather it only reduces safe abortions.' 'The regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration is absolutely a conservative, authoritative and repressive attempt against the choice of women for their reproductive rights as it promotes no right to abortion. Ironically, Geneva Consensus Declaration is meant to be for the 'women's health and gender equality'. However, it neither promotes the health rights of women nor includes any issues of people from sexual minorities. Geneva Consensus Declaration pushes against the international efforts to make safe abortion a human right, and calls for global health policies to focus on improving maternal health without prioritizing abortion,' said Tushar Niroula, Executive Director, MSI (Marie Stopes International) Nepal. 'Nepal has got a very progressive safe abortion law in the country, but the consequences of Geneva consensus declaration can pose a threat and have a very negative impact, even though Nepal is not a signatory to the Geneva Consensus Declaration. However, there is a rise in anti-abortion groups promoting pro-life which may further fuel anti-abortion movements of conservative forces within Nepal, especially among the religious organizations or individuals,' added Niroula. Rise of global anti-rights movements is threatening SRHR Dr Rathnamala M Desai, Member, Board of Trustees, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and President, Family Planning Association of India (FPA India) said that 'Now a transnational anti-rights movement is gaining further political, social and economic legitimacy- historically targeting abortion rights. Various coalitions of nationalist religious and ultra-conservative actors and organisations have become emboldened to attack gender equality and sexuality more broadly in pursuit of a regressive social and political agenda. The rise of a global anti-rights movement is threatening sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as liberal democracies and the civil liberties and human rights of all.' Tushar Niroula of MSI Nepal says: 'We cannot be complacent in countries where we have a progressive safe abortion law because attempts like Geneva Consensus Declaration will encourage anti-abortion movements and active opposition from religious groups, which may potentially lead to the rollback of safe abortion laws. 28 out of 36 countries within MSI Network have reported active opposition against sexual and reproductive health and rights in the last two years. 8 country programmes in MSI Network reported direct attack from anti-abortion pro-life groups and many more reported attacks from local organizations. Regressive activities like Geneva Consensus Declaration can create a barrier to access safe abortion services, which could lead to an increase in unsafe abortions resulting in high maternal morbidity and mortality.' Agrees Dr Dalvie of ASAP: 'We must be very involved in strategizing to mitigate the risks that could be posed by regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration to whatever progress has happened on gender equality and human rights. Even in countries where we have the abortion law there is still potential for it to be taken away as we have seen with the example of the United States.' Gender justice is vital cog-in-the-wheel for SDGs Gender justice remains the essential and critical cog-in-the-wheel to advance progress on all goals and targets enshrined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Health justice, economic justice, redistributive justice, social justice, climate justice, gender justice and accountability to peoples are essential and interdependent pillars of development justice. While on the larger level, political agendas have to be rooted in gender and development justice where 'no one is truly left behind' yet at an individual level too we have to dismantle harmful gender stereotypes and norms. Harmful narrative for gender inequality is regressive and so is the rise of anti-rights movements worldwide. The year 2025 will mark 30 years since Beijing Declaration and its Platform for Action were adopted in 1995. Beijing+30 intergovernmental review processes are being held in Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) and later this month in Asia and the Pacific region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbR8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-10T16:32:25-08:00	
A New Era Of Hope: Trump’s Return And The Promise Of Stability – ...	By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor The reelection of President Donald Trump heralds a new era of optimism and possibility for both the US and the global community. His impending return to office signals a steadfast commitment to revitalizing the US economy and prioritizing the well-being of the American people. As a businessman with a proven track record, Trump brings a practical approach to governance, focusing on economic prosperity and tangible results.During his previous term, Trump’s policies spurred economic growth, reduced unemployment and created a favorable environment for businesses. His emphasis on deregulation and tax reforms breathed new life into various sectors, fostering investment and job creation. The American people can expect a continuation of these strategies, aimed at further strengthening the nation’s economic foundation.Beyond the economy, Trump has consistently championed traditional family values and has made it clear he intends to protect the youth from harmful ideologies. His stance against the 'woke' movement demonstrates a commitment to safeguarding cultural values and shielding younger generations from agendas that threaten to erode societal foundations. This form of leadership is not only crucial for the US but also serves as an example for young people around the world.On the international front, Trump’s approach to foreign policy is characterized by a focus on peace and stability. His administration’s success in brokering agreements in the Middle East, such as the Abraham Accords, underscored his commitment to fostering dialogue and reducing tensions.As the conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues to claim lives and create global instability, I am confident that Trump will leverage his diplomatic acumen to facilitate negotiations that could bring an end to this crisis. Trump’s commitment to addressing the Middle East’s unique security challenges is clear. A renewed US-Gulf Cooperation Council partnership under his leadership would reinforce stability across the Gulf states. His strategic alliance with the GCC nations reflects a shared commitment to countering common threats and promoting regional security. UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan last week extended his congratulations to Trump and emphasized the importance of this collaboration by stating: 'The UAE and US are united by our enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress. The UAE looks forward to continuing to work with our partners in the US toward a future of opportunity, prosperity and stability for all.' In a Middle East where stability is paramount, Trump’s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a path forward. His leadership is an encouraging sign for all those invested in a secure and prosperous future for the region.Trump’s foreign policy extends beyond the Middle East, reaching key players in Asia. His diplomatic engagements with North Korea and China signaled a shift from military confrontations toward economic cooperation. His landmark meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though met with skepticism by some, opened channels of communication that had long been dormant, while his firm stance on trade imbalances with China sought to establish a more equitable economic relationship.As Trump once said, 'sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.' This sentiment captures the resilience and adaptability that characterize his approach to leadership — qualities that will undoubtedly serve him well in navigating both domestic and global complexities.World leaders have expressed optimism regarding their renewed collaboration with Trump. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised Trump’s 'historic victory,' highlighting the enduring UK-US alliance, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the 'true partnership' between the EU and the US, emphasizing a strong transatlantic agenda to address shared challenges during Trump’s presidency.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, recognizing the significance of Trump’s reelection, expressed hope for 'strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.' His message reflects the optimism felt by nations worldwide that Trump’s leadership will contribute to a more peaceful and balanced international order. Reflecting on my endorsement of Trump during his first campaign, I believed that his background as a businessman would bring a refreshing change to American politics. While some people, including celebrities, opposed him, it was crucial to set aside personal biases and offer him the chance to implement his vision. His subsequent achievements demonstrated the effectiveness of a pragmatic, business-oriented approach.Today, with his reelection, we are presented with an opportunity for a brighter future. I urge all stakeholders to put personal differences aside and engage constructively, listening to the voices of the American people who have chosen this path.As we look ahead, the alliance between Trump’s incoming administration and the Gulf nations will be instrumental in countering the threats posed by those who seek to destabilize our region. With a renewed focus on economic and security cooperation, we can achieve a prosperous future that reflects the values we hold dear.In conclusion, Trump’s reelection is not just a victory for the US but a beacon of hope for the world. His leadership, grounded in practical experience and a results-oriented mindset, is poised to address both domestic and international challenges. As we move forward, let us seize this moment to build a future of stability, security and growth for all. • Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor is a prominent UAE businessman and chairman of the Al-Habtoor Group and Dubai National Insurance and Reinsurance Company.

The Sad Case Of Momin Khawaja In Canada – OpEd	In the late 1970s, I came to Canada for higher studies in chemical engineering. I had the rare opportunity there of being taught by some of the professors whose former student included my own teacher – professor Nooruddin Ahmed who would later become the vice chancellor at BUET, Dhaka. In my short stay, I found the Canadian people very warmhearted and friendly. Perhaps, it is that national character, which has earned Canada much respect in the international front for its commitment to peace and human rights. However, something has gone drastically wrong since 9/11 when the country joined Bush and Blair’s perennial ‘War on Terror’. Much of the Muslim world was transformed into a test lab to try the efficacy of the newer killing machines and armaments. Israel’s latest genocidal campaigns inside Gaza and Lebanon are just footnotes in that long crusade. Hatred of Islam and Muslims became the norms rather than the exceptions. Following Bush’s declaration of ‘you are either with us or against us’, global entente was forged amongst many Islamophobic nation states to cripple and destroy one Muslim nation state after another. Equally problematic has been the treatment of Muslims residing in non-Muslim countries – from India, Myanmar and Australia down south to Europe, Canada and the United States of America up north. Muslims were demonized and dehumanized. By default, they were considered a national threat: either suicide bombers in waiting or members of the ‘sleeper cells’. In that calculus, ignored there were the established international laws and regulations of human rights and even the local customary laws were violated. Canada, sadly, remains an example of that abuse of human rights. Many legal and human rights experts have criticized Canada’s justice system, particularly concerning the treatment of prisoners in solitary confinement. American journalist and lawyer Glenn Greenwald criticized the post-9/11 justice system, arguing that it unfairly targets Muslims with a separate set of rules designed to ensure harsh sentences. As I have noted in the past, the case of Momin Khawaja shows a blatant disregard for human rights, dignity and decency. The Case of Momin Khawaja - Background: Mohammad Momin Khawaja, a Canadian with no prior criminal record, was sentenced under anti-terrorism laws to 10.5 years in prison by a trial judge, which was later increased to life plus 24 years by the Supreme Court of Canada. - Academic Achievements: Khawaja is a sociology graduate, journalist, and author of academic books on various subjects, including women in the ancient world and North American colonization. - Incarceration: Despite being acquitted of involvement in a London case, Khawaja has spent over 21 years in prison, with his time in solitary confinement amounting to 1400 days, raising questions about the fairness of his treatment. Legal Challenges and the Canadian Justice System - Class Action Lawsuit: A class action lawsuit (Brazeau v Canada, Reddock v Canada, Gallone v Canada) highlighted the questionable policies regarding solitary confinement, with the government found guilty of violating inmates' rights in Ontario and Quebec. - International Law and Human Rights: The prolonged solitary confinement of Khawaja, particularly after an assault by another inmate, has been criticized for violating Canadian Bills of Rights and International Law. Comparisons and International Perspectives - Maher Arar Case: Similar to Khawaja, Maher Arar, a Syrian-Canadian engineer, was wrongfully arrested and tortured with the alleged complicity of Canadian authorities, leading to a formal apology from Prime Minister Stephen Harper after a commission of inquiry. The Fallacy of 'Momin Khawaja - a Mechanism of Radicalization' - Criticism of the Canadian Intelligence Project: The project, which was not part of the legal proceedings, has been accused of fabricating evidence and promoting a narrative of fear without factual support, contributing to a perceived bias against Muslims in the justice system. - Impact on Public Perception: The narrative surrounding Khawaja has been challenged for undermining the integrity of academics and for perpetuating fear and hatred based on religious identity. In summary, the case of Momin Khawaja and the broader issues of solitary confinement in Canada raise significant concerns about the application of justice and the treatment of prisoners, particularly those from Muslim communities. It challenges the nation to live up to its ideals and to ensure that its justice system is fair, equitable, and respectful of human rights. Recommendations - Human Cost: The irreparable damage caused by solitary confinement and torture cannot be compensated with monetary settlements alone. - Need for Systemic Change: I call upon Prime Minister Trudeau and the Minister of Justice and Security to take immediate action to release Momin Khawaja and other victims of 9/11 tragedy who have no bloods in their hands and to reform the justice system to uphold the principles of law and justice for all Canadians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbcYXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-10T16:25:10-08:00	
The Man In The Iron Musk: Billionaire Behind Trump Comeback – Ana...	When Donald Trump announced his 'great victory' as the results of the US presidential election started coming in, he specifically thanked one person who had played a key role in helping him return to presidency. In a speech at West Palm Beach, Florida, he praised Elon Musk, calling him his strongest supporter in the presidential race. He referred to Musk as 'a star', highlighting the impact of the billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk has been a major force in Trump's return—not only by investing millions into his campaign, but also by advising on policy and promoting his ideas. He has even used his X social media platform as a strong supporter of the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement. Elon Musk shared on X that the future would be 'amazing' as it became clear that Donald Trump would be back in the White House. This statement hints at Musk's optimistic view on the direction America may take with Trump's return, signalling his belief in positive changes ahead. The billionaire's influence could grow significantly with Trump in office again, as Trump once hinted that his supporter may take on a role like 'secretary of cost-cutting' in his Cabinet. This shows Trump's confidence in the billionaire's skills to help reduce government spending. Experts caution that Musk, whose company, SpaceX, already holds significant influence as a key defence contractor for the government, could potentially gain the power to 'oversee those who typically set the rules'. This suggests he may have an unusual level of control over the authorities who usually regulate businesses. Now that the election dust has settled, here is a simple lowdown on how the world's wealthiest person played a key role in creating one of the most unexpected political comebacks in history. How did Musk use his wealth and influence to help Trump regain his position and what motivated him to do so? Musk's Contribution to Trump's Campaign It is clear that billionaires had more influence than ever in both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Microsoft's Bill Gates and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Vice-President Kamala Harris. However, it was Musk's broad support for Trump that truly made an impact. Musk's influence and resources played a significant role in shaping Trump's comeback. According to the Federal Election Commission's ((FEC's) final disclosures last month before election day, Musk contributed around $132 million to Trump and other Republicans leading up to the 2024 election. The FEC is a government agency that oversees, and enforces, rules on campaign funding in US elections, ensuring donations and spending are transparent and legal. Two major donations—$43.6 million and $75 million—were channelled directly into Trump's campaign efforts, particularly benefiting the America Political Action Committee (PAC) founded by Musk. The America PAC is a fundraising group that supports political campaigns, such as Trump's, by collecting donations. PACs help gather, and spend, money to promote specific candidates and political causes. In a controversial move, Musk started a cash giveaway in important swing states. Registered voters who signed a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments—which protect free speech and the right to own firearms—were given a chance to win $1 million each day. Musk announced at a campaign event on October 19, 'Every day from now until the election, we'll randomly award $1 million to people who have signed the petition.' The action faced a legal challenge in Pennsylvania after the US Justice Department cautioned that the group may be violating election laws, which prohibit offering payments to encourage people to register to vote. On Monday, November 4, judges allowed Musk's cash giveaway to continue after his lawyers clarified how winners were chosen. Instead of being picked randomly, the winners were selected as 'vetted spokespeople', meaning they were carefully chosen based on specific criteria. This approach, possibly, ensured they would promote the campaign in a controlled and positive way, rather than just handing money to anyone who signed the petition. The court accepted this method, giving Musk the green light to keep the giveaway running. Musk is now facing a class-action lawsuit—a legal case filed by a group of people with similar complaints—from voters who say he misled them into signing the petition by making them believe they had a real chance of winning the $1 million. According to Al-Jazeera, the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty, who also claimed that Musk used the giveaway to gather personal data and boost traffic to X. This was possible because people who signed up for the giveaway possibly had to provide personal details, such as their contact information or social media profiles. By collecting this data, Musk's team could build a list of contacts and use it to reach more people on X, increasing the platform's traffic and visibility. This strategy could help promote X, while also gaining valuable information about the participants. FEC records revealed that Musk had donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee (PAC) focused on 'protecting and expanding the Republican Senate Majority'. This support could potentially help Republicans regain control of the Senate in this election. FEC filings are official records that track donations to political campaigns and committees, showing who is funding political activities and how much they are giving. Musk is said to have made additional donations to Republican candidates that have not been reported. Ways X Was Used to Promote MAGA Views It may seem unusual now, but Elon Musk was once seen as a liberal and a supporter of renewable energy. He even said he had voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Since taking over Twitter in 2022, which has since been renamed X, this image has changed. After promising to make Twitter a 'politically neutral' platform, Musk let go of the employees who were in charge of checking for false information. He also reinstated over 62,000 accounts that had been suspended, including those linked to white nationalists and neo-Nazis—groups that promote hatred and racism, often targeting people of colour, Jews and other minorities—known for spreading hate speech and conspiracy theories. Importantly, he also lifted the ban on Trump's account, which had been suspended by the platform following the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol—a situation many believe Trump influenced. As the election approached, critics argued that X had essentially turned into an unofficial platform promoting the MAGA side of the Republican Party. The owner himself faced accusations of openly supporting Trump and sharing misleading information with his 200 million followers, with X's algorithm boosting his influence even further. One example involved a fake video of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, edited with a false voiceover saying, 'I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire' (meaning choosing someone for a job partly to increase variety in backgrounds, such as race or gender). Musk shared this video in July, commenting 'this is amazing' with a laughing emoji. This re-post added 136 million more views to the video. False information about 'illegal immigrants' voting in the election spread across X. This claim was shared widely, although, in the US, only citizens can vote in federal elections. Non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, are not allowed to participate in these elections. Studies from both conservative and liberal groups show this offence is very rare. While breaking this law can lead to serious consequences, such as up to a year in jail, fines, or even deportation, the research suggests that very few people actually commit this offence. A conspiracy theory spread on X, with Musk, himself, promoting it, claimed that Democrats were bringing in undocumented immigrants and planning to grant them amnesty to increase their voter base in future elections. After Trump's debate with Harris in September, where he falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town were eating cats and dogs, Musk shared a meme featuring a cat holding a sign that said, 'Kamala hates me', followed by a laughing emoji. Although Musk claims to support free speech, he has blocked some news stories, including one by journalist Ken Klippenstein, as reported by Al-Jazeera. This article discussed the weaknesses of Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, reportedly based on leaked documents. Although the journalist's account was eventually restored, access to the article's links remained blocked. A survey by the Pew Research Center in March showed the platform's rising popularity with Republican supporters. About 53% felt it was 'good for democracy', nearly three times the 17% who had said the same in 2021. Musk's Reasons for Aligning with Trump The combined support from their fan bases strengthened the Trump-Musk alliance. Not too long ago, Trump and Musk did not use to get along. In 2022, Trump called Musk a 'bulls**t artist', accusing him of lying about supporting him in the 2016 election. Musk replied on Twitter that it was 'time for Trump to retire and ride off into the sunset'. Two years later, the tech mogul stood alongside Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wearing a black MAGA hat. Musk's shift towards more conservative views is often linked to the forced shutdown of his Tesla factories during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, he defied orders by reopening a plant in Fremont, California, saying he was prepared to face arrest. This move was seen as a stance against what he viewed as excessive government control and red tape. Musk's move towards conservative views is evident in his connections with leaders who also oppose regulations, such as Argentina's President, Javier Milei. Musk has also formed connections with conservative leaders around the world, including Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. This shows his growing alignment with Right-wing viewpoints on the global stage. Several American media outlets, including Vanity Fair and the Washington Post, have suggested that a significant reason behind this situation may be connected to one of Musk's children coming out as transgender in 2022. This child decided to distance from Musk and changed the last name to Wilson. In an interview with Jordan Peterson—a Canadian psychologist, professor and author known for his views on culture, politics and personal responsibility who gained attention for his opposition to certain gender identity policies in Canada, arguing they infringed on free speech—Musk shared that he felt 'tricked' into agreeing to his child's medical treatment. Following this, he announced a mission against what he called the 'woke mind virus', a term used to describe what some people see as strict or extreme ideas about social issues, which they feel spread like a 'virus' and may limit free speech or push certain beliefs too strongly. The medical treatment Musk mentioned, possibly, relates to gender-affirming care—support that helps a person's physical characteristics align with their gender identity—for his transgender child. This type of care can include counselling, hormone therapy, or other steps to support their gender identity. Musk's statement about feeling 'tricked' suggests he felt pressured or misled into agreeing to this care without fully understanding it or feeling comfortable with the decision. In 2021, Musk moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto, California, located in Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas. At the same time, he also relocated his own residence from California to Texas. In July, Musk announced plans to move his companies, SpaceX and X, from California to Texas. This move is linked to a recent California law that stops schools from requiring teachers to inform parents if a student changes their gender identity. Musk's decision highlights his disagreement with this policy, as he believes that parents should be kept informed of such changes. By relocating, Musk is signalling his stance on the importance of parental involvement in these sensitive matters. Helping Trump Connect with Young Men Some people believe that Musk and Donald Trump, who act bold and different from others, have connected with many American men who feel left out or misunderstood. Movements like #MeToo, which highlight harassment issues and talk about 'toxic masculinity', have left some men feeling judged or ignored. Musk and Trump's strong, rule-breaking personalities appeal to these men, who see them as leaders speaking to their concerns and frustrations. Last month, in The New York Times, John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics, described Trump's efforts to attract young male voters as a 'master class in connecting with men'. Trump's strategy to win over young male voters seems to be working. A recent Harvard Youth Poll showed that 35% of men aged 18-24 expressed support for Trump, an increase of 5% over a survey in 2020. This attitude is often reflected in popular 'bro' podcasts, such as the 'Joe Rogan Experience'. Joe Rogan is a popular podcast host, comedian and former TV personality known for his above-mentioned show. On his podcast, he talks with a wide range of guests, including celebrities, scientists and political figures, discussing topics from current events to science, health and culture. Known for his casual, conversational style, he is popular among young men. After interviewing Musk, Rogan gave his support to Trump on Monday (November 4). Rogan shared on X, praising Musk, saying, 'Elon Musk is truly incredible. Without him, we'd be in trouble. He presents what I believe is the strongest argument for supporting Trump, and I agree with him completely.' This message struck a chord with many people. Just two days later, Trump was elected as the 47th President of the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-09T17:57:24-08:00	
The Influence Of Political Psychology On Energy Diplomacy: Unpack...	In an increasingly interdependent world, energy resources have become essential bargaining chips in international relations. Countries engage in energy diplomacy to secure access to these vital resources, balancing national interests with global alliances. While economic factors traditionally dominate discussions on energy diplomacy, political psychology offers a unique lens to understand the motivations and strategies driving these complex negotiations. Political psychology examines how cognitive biases, perceptions of threat, social identity, and leadership psychology influence decisions. This perspective is essential for understanding how psychological factors shape the strategies and outcomes of energy diplomacy worldwide. Defining Political Psychology in the Context of Energy Diplomacy Political psychology combines insights from psychology and political science to understand how leaders and nations make decisions under uncertainty, stress, and competitive pressure. In energy diplomacy, psychological factors such as risk perception, threat assessment, and identity politics play a crucial role in shaping diplomatic behavior. Political psychology addresses questions like: How do leaders perceive energy security risks? How do cognitive biases impact the negotiation strategies of different nations? By exploring these questions, political psychology can provide deeper insight into the drivers of energy diplomacy. 1. Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making in Energy Diplomacy Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that influence how individuals interpret and act on information. In energy diplomacy, common biases can significantly shape decision-making. a. Status Quo Bias Status quo bias can cause countries to favor familiar energy sources and partners, even when alternative strategies may offer long-term benefits. This reluctance to change existing energy arrangements often stems from the psychological comfort of maintaining predictable alliances. Example: European Union countries' historical reliance on Russian gas can be partially attributed to status quo bias. Despite growing concerns over energy security, these countries were initially hesitant to diversify energy sources due to the perceived risks of changing an established supply relationship. b. Anchoring Bias Anchoring bias can lead negotiators to focus on specific numbers or initial conditions in a negotiation, potentially overlooking other relevant factors. This bias can be particularly influential in energy pricing negotiations, where early price offers may set a psychological anchor, making it challenging to reach more flexible or advantageous agreements. Example: In negotiations on oil prices, initial figures proposed by a supplier may anchor the perceptions of buyers, making it difficult for them to negotiate significantly lower prices even if market conditions change. c. Availability Heuristic The availability heuristic leads individuals to base judgments on recent or easily recalled events rather than on comprehensive data. In energy diplomacy, leaders might overemphasize recent energy crises, leading to heightened perceptions of energy security risks. Example: Following disruptions in oil supply chains, policymakers may over-prioritize securing stable oil sources at the expense of exploring renewable options, influenced by the availability of recent disruptions. 2. Threat Perception and National Identity in Energy Diplomacy Threat perception plays a central role in how countries approach energy diplomacy, influencing both defensive and offensive strategies. The psychological dimensions of national identity and perceived threats often shape a country's approach to securing energy resources. a. Energy Security as a National Identity Component In many countries, energy self-sufficiency is closely tied to national identity and pride. Countries with limited energy resources may perceive their dependence on foreign energy as a threat to sovereignty. This perception can lead to aggressive efforts to secure diversified energy sources, often through high-stakes diplomacy or even militarization of energy corridors. Example: China's Belt and Road Initiative, which includes strategic investments in energy infrastructure across Asia and Africa, is partly driven by a perceived need to secure energy independence, which is viewed as essential to national identity and long-term security. b. Social Identity Theory in Regional Energy Alliances Social identity theory suggests that people derive a sense of self from group memberships, leading to in-group favoritism and out-group hostility. In energy diplomacy, this manifests in regional alliances where countries with shared identity markers (such as cultural or ideological commonalities) collaborate on energy projects to counter perceived threats from opposing blocs. Example: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries often collaborate on oil and gas projects based on shared cultural, religious, and geopolitical identities. This alliance serves as a counterbalance to perceived threats from neighboring regions, particularly in maintaining influence in global energy markets. 3. The Role of Leadership Psychology in Energy Diplomacy Political psychology also focuses on how leaders' personal characteristics, cognitive styles, and stress tolerance influence energy diplomacy. Leaders bring their unique psychological profiles to the table, impacting decisions and shaping diplomatic relationships. a. Cognitive Complexity in Diplomatic Negotiations Cognitive complexity refers to an individual's ability to understand and integrate multiple perspectives. Leaders with high cognitive complexity are often better equipped to navigate the intricacies of energy diplomacy, finding compromises that benefit both parties. In contrast, leaders with low cognitive complexity may approach negotiations with rigid, black-and-white thinking. Example: The contrasting styles of U.S. presidents regarding Middle East energy policies show the impact of cognitive complexity. Presidents with higher cognitive complexity, such as Barack Obama, have tended to pursue nuanced, multilateral strategies, whereas those with more straightforward views have favored aggressive, unilateral approaches. b. Risk Tolerance and Crisis Response Energy diplomacy often involves high-stakes negotiations under significant pressure, where leaders' tolerance for risk plays a critical role. Leaders with high risk tolerance may be more willing to explore new energy partnerships or take bold steps toward energy independence, while those with low risk tolerance may prefer stability over innovation. Example: Leaders in countries with volatile energy supplies, such as Venezuela, often exhibit high-risk tolerance in seeking alternative energy alliances, reflecting a willingness to experiment with unconventional partnerships to secure national energy needs. 4. Public Opinion and Domestic Psychological Pressures Domestic public opinion and the collective psychological state of a nation significantly influence energy diplomacy. Politicians may adopt strategies that align with public attitudes toward energy security and national sovereignty, especially when energy diplomacy affects employment, the cost of living, or environmental sustainability. a. Nationalism and Energy Independence In many countries, energy independence is seen as a source of national pride. Politicians may respond to nationalist sentiments by pursuing energy policies that prioritize self-sufficiency, even at the expense of cost-effectiveness or environmental impact. Nationalism can push leaders toward aggressive energy policies that emphasize independence over international collaboration. Example: The 'America First' policy during Donald Trump's presidency saw increased investment in U.S. fossil fuel industries, with the goal of reducing dependency on foreign oil—a strategy driven by nationalist appeals to energy independence. b. Environmental Psychology and Public Support for Green Energy Diplomacy As climate change awareness grows, public support for renewable energy has increased. Environmental psychology shows that when people feel directly impacted by environmental degradation, they are more likely to support sustainable energy policies. This shift in public opinion influences political leaders to adopt energy diplomacy strategies that favor renewable energy partnerships. Example: In Europe, where public concern for climate change is high, governments are more inclined to form alliances for renewable energy projects, aligning diplomatic efforts with public demand for sustainability. 5. Psychological Impact of Historical Events on Energy Diplomacy Historical events, particularly energy crises, can have long-lasting psychological impacts on a nation's energy policy. Collective memory of energy shortages or price spikes can lead to heightened vigilance and preventive diplomacy aimed at mitigating future risks. a. The Legacy of the 1970s Oil Crisis The oil crisis of the 1970s left a psychological imprint on many countries, particularly in the West, leading to a collective desire for energy independence. This historical memory influences current energy diplomacy, motivating countries to avoid over-reliance on single suppliers. Example: Japan's energy policies are heavily influenced by the 1970s oil crisis, with efforts to secure diversified energy sources and pursue diplomatic ties with various energy-exporting nations to avoid dependency on any single country. b. Psychological Trauma of Energy Disruptions in Developing Nations In developing nations that have experienced energy shortages, psychological trauma from these events can drive policies aimed at securing stable and affordable energy sources. This may involve alliances with energy-rich countries, even if these relationships are politically complicated. Example: Bangladesh's efforts to secure steady natural gas supplies through diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries are partially driven by the collective memory of frequent power outages that disrupted daily life and economic growth. Conclusion Political psychology offers invaluable insights into the underlying motivations and strategic decisions that drive energy diplomacy. By analyzing cognitive biases, national identity, leadership psychology, and public opinion, political psychology provides a nuanced understanding of how countries navigate the complex landscape of global energy relations. For policymakers, incorporating psychological insights into diplomatic strategy can lead to more effective, resilient, and adaptive approaches to securing energy resources. As nations continue to grapple with the challenges of energy security in a rapidly changing world, the psychological dimensions of diplomacy will play an increasingly central role in shaping the future of international energy relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-09T17:55:16-08:00	
Education Under Siege: Examining Taliban’s Restrictions On Female...	The return of the Taliban in August 2021 marked a critical turning point for Afghanistan, especially in the realm of women’s rights and education. Historically, women’s education in Afghanistan has been a contested domain, marked by ideological conflicts and restrictive measures, with significant progress achieved during the last two decades under international support (UNICEF, 2015). The Taliban’s rapid imposition of bans on secondary education for girls and university access for women not only signals a severe policy regression but also intensifies a cultural shift that reinforces gender-based segregation (Amnesty International, 2022). These restrictions, justified by the Taliban as aligned with Islamic values, have faced widespread criticism from scholars who argue that Islamic teachings support education for all genders, revealing inconsistencies in the Taliban’s rationale (Quraishi-Landes, 2021). The socio-cultural implications of these restrictions are profound, as education is globally recognized as vital for individual and societal development. The World Bank (2018) and UNESCO (2020) emphasize that access to education correlates with economic stability, lower poverty, and better health outcomes, all of which become increasingly inaccessible for Afghan society under the Taliban's restrictive policies. The Taliban’s limitations on female employment in the education and public sectors further exacerbate economic insecurity, disempowering educated women and limiting household economic contributions. This has resulted in broader social consequences, as educated Afghan women have historically contributed significantly to essential fields like healthcare and civil services (Human Rights Watch, 2021). At the community level, restricting female education is linked to increased rates of early marriage and domestic violence, as economic dependence and constrained options heighten vulnerability (UN Women, 2022). Psychologically, the loss of educational opportunities has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and identity crises among young Afghan girls, undermining their sense of autonomy and purpose (Medica Mondiale, 2023). In denying women education, the Taliban constrains not only individual development but also community progress, as research indicates educated women enhance community well-being and civic engagement (World Bank, 2018). The theoretical framework of this analysis draws from feminist and human rights perspectives. Feminist theory reveals the Taliban’s restrictions as reflective of systemic patriarchy, imposing limitations on women’s public roles while confining them to traditional domestic spheres (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights perspective frames education as a fundamental right, essential for autonomy and societal participation, and emphasizes that the Taliban’s policies infringe upon international human rights standards (CEDAW, 1979; OHCHR, 2021). This analysis integrates both quantitative data and qualitative accounts, using a mixed-methods approach. By combining primary sources, such as Afghan government and international organization reports, with secondary research, the study provides a comprehensive examination of both policy impacts and societal responses (Amnesty International, 2023). While the Taliban contends that these educational restrictions reflect cultural values, critics argue this defense misrepresents both Islamic and Afghan values, suggesting instead that these policies serve as mechanisms of control rather than religious adherence (Abu-Lughod, 2002; Aslan, 2005). The ramifications of these policies extend beyond the education sector, with adverse effects on Afghanistan’s socio-economic stability and gender equality. For these reasons, international advocacy is essential to restore educational access for Afghan girls, bolstering societal resilience against gender oppression and reversing regressive policies. In conclusion, the Taliban’s restrictions on female education represent an infringement on basic human rights and a hindrance to Afghanistan’s societal progress, underscoring the need for sustained global intervention and support for Afghan women’s right to education. Taliban’s Restrictions on Female Education The Taliban’s restrictive policies on female education in Afghanistan are profoundly impactful, with wide-ranging consequences on Afghan society. Their policies, enforced by the Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, prohibit girls from attending secondary school and restrict women's participation in higher education. These bans are unprecedented in scale, severely limiting the educational aspirations and career potential of Afghan girls and women. Historically, the Taliban's ideology has opposed Western-style education, and since 2021, they have systematically dismantled educational access for females, contrary to the significant strides made toward gender equality in Afghanistan over the previous two decades (Human Rights Watch, 2022). According to Amnesty International (2023), these bans have impacted over one million Afghan girls, denying them the fundamental right to education. As noted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2023), these restrictions significantly set back Afghanistan’s educational and economic progress, with potential generational consequences for the well-being and socio-economic standing of Afghan families and communities. The Taliban’s Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforces these policies through various mechanisms, including surveillance, fear tactics, and public shaming. The Ministry’s role is crucial in ensuring compliance with Taliban decrees, as officials patrol schools and universities, often imposing fines or punitive measures on educators or families who attempt to bypass restrictions (UN Women, 2022). This institutionalized surveillance and control over female education have cultivated an environment of fear and uncertainty. Female students and educators report feeling constantly watched and intimidated, leading many to self-censor or withdraw from education out of concern for personal and family safety (Medica Mondiale, 2023). This intimidation strategy has been particularly effective, as families often choose to keep girls at home, prioritizing security over educational opportunities. In assessing the impacts of these policies, specific cases reveal both the persistence of Afghan girls and women and the oppressive reactions they face. For example, small, covert networks of teachers in Afghanistan have been reported to organize secret schooling initiatives for girls barred from formal education. Such efforts demonstrate resilience, yet they are met with repression. Reports document cases where teachers and students involved in clandestine education initiatives face threats, physical violence, or detention, underscoring the severe limitations on educational resistance (BBC, 2023). Moreover, testimonies from affected women highlight the deep psychological toll of these restrictions. One Afghan girl, Fatima, explained, 'I feel like my future has been stolen from me… I cannot dream of becoming a doctor or a teacher now because I am not allowed to study' (Amnesty International, 2023). Such narratives exemplify the intense psychological distress and sense of hopelessness experienced by many Afghan girls, who, deprived of education, see few paths to personal or economic independence. From a feminist theoretical perspective, the Taliban’s policies on female education can be viewed as a means of enforcing patriarchal control, aiming to maintain traditional gender hierarchies by confining women to domestic roles. This approach aligns with feminist critiques of institutionalized patriarchy, which argue that restricting women’s access to education perpetuates social structures that keep them economically and socially dependent on men (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights framework further emphasizes that the right to education is protected under international conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979). By denying education to girls and women, the Taliban’s policies constitute a clear violation of this fundamental right. The broader societal consequences of these policies are grave: without education, Afghan girls are more susceptible to forced marriages, health complications, and economic dependency, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social inequality (World Bank, 2018). So, the Taliban’s policies on female education not only infringe upon individual rights but also erode the social and economic fabric of Afghan society. By analyzing these restrictions through feminist and human rights lenses, it is clear that education for Afghan girls is not merely about schooling but about the broader societal empowerment and progress of Afghan communities. These policies, therefore, represent a profound setback, both in terms of Afghanistan’s development and in the global fight for gender equality. Given the dire implications, continued international advocacy and support for Afghan girls' right to education are essential to challenge and ultimately reverse these regressive policies. Socio-Cultural Implications of Restricted Female Education in Afghanistan The Taliban’s policies restricting female education have far-reaching socio-cultural consequences that extend beyond the classroom, impacting women’s empowerment, family dynamics, and community structures in Afghanistan. First, the long-term restriction of education significantly diminishes women's roles in society, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and limiting opportunities for individual and collective empowerment. Without access to education, women lack the skills needed for economic independence, perpetuating a reliance on male family members. According to UNESCO (2023), limiting female education directly impacts women's employment rates and constrains their participation in the workforce, exacerbating poverty and widening gender inequalities. This impact is particularly concerning when considered through feminist theoretical perspectives that highlight education as a fundamental pathway to self-empowerment and social mobility (hooks, 2000). Denying Afghan girls this pathway restricts not only their potential but also their capacity to contribute meaningfully to Afghanistan’s economic and social development. Broader societal consequences include profound shifts in family dynamics and the structure of community relationships. In Afghan society, women’s traditional roles are already constrained by conservative interpretations of gender roles, but the Taliban’s policies deepen this marginalization. Research has shown that educated women tend to make more informed choices regarding family planning and health, leading to healthier families and higher child survival rates (World Bank, 2018). Restricting education undermines this potential, leading to communities with limited access to health and wellness knowledge, which can perpetuate cycles of poor health and high dependency rates. In areas where female education was previously more accessible, families now struggle to adjust to restrictions that limit young women’s futures, which has led to increases in early and forced marriages as parents seek security for their daughters in the absence of education (Amnesty International, 2023). This shift reflects an alteration in cultural norms, reinforcing gender-specific expectations and lowering aspirations for young girls, who come to see these marriages as their only feasible path. The psychological impact on female students deprived of education is severe. Studies indicate that educational deprivation contributes to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and a diminished sense of self-worth, particularly in societies where education is a primary avenue for personal growth and social integration (Medica Mondiale, 2023). Many Afghan girls and young women express feelings of hopelessness and frustration, as described by UN Women (2022), which captures testimonies of Afghan girls who fear a future of 'enforced ignorance' and lost potential. Psychological theories on self-determination suggest that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are essential for psychological health, all of which are compromised when education is restricted (Ryan & Deci, 2000). In Afghanistan, where these educational restrictions are tied to policies of control rather than individual choice, the resultant impact on mental health is particularly profound. A generation of girls deprived of education may be at risk of internalizing low self-esteem and diminished agency, further entrenching the cultural narrative that women’s roles should be confined to the domestic sphere. This enforced ignorance has implications for future generations as well. Restricted access to education limits not only women’s immediate prospects but also their ability to educate their own children, passing down cycles of restricted knowledge and opportunity. According to UNICEF (2023), educated mothers are more likely to invest in their children's education, thereby raising future generations that value and pursue knowledge. By denying women the chance to learn, the Taliban’s policies disrupt these positive generational cycles, perpetuating poverty and dependency. Consequently, the broader societal effects of these restrictions hinder Afghanistan’s progress toward an equitable society and sustainable development, reinforcing patterns of economic underperformance and social stagnation. The Taliban’s restrictions on female education, therefore, carry implications that reverberate through individual lives, families, and society, ultimately setting Afghanistan on a path that undermines both its human capital and potential for inclusive growth. Thus, the socio-cultural implications of restricted female education in Afghanistan are deeply interconnected, affecting women's empowerment, family structures, and psychological well-being, as well as the future cultural and economic trajectory of Afghan society. The denial of education to Afghan girls not only infringes upon individual rights but also reinforces structural gender inequalities, with implications that threaten the well-being of entire communities and hinder the nation’s development. Addressing these educational restrictions is critical not only for the rights of Afghan girls but also for the broader goal of achieving sustainable, inclusive progress in Afghanistan. Resistance and Resilience amid Educational Restrictions in Afghanistan The resilience of Afghan women in the face of the Taliban’s educational restrictions underscores their commitment to self-determination and societal contribution, despite severe limitations on their autonomy. Afghan women have adopted various strategies of resistance, leveraging both visible and underground forms of activism to challenge these oppressive policies. Notably, protests organized by Afghan women and girls, though often met with violent repression, exemplify a defiant stance against the Taliban’s restrictions. For example, in Kabul, groups of women have gathered to demand access to education, often carrying banners with slogans like 'Education is our right,' despite facing significant personal risks (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These public protests highlight the ongoing agency of Afghan women, who continue to advocate for their rights, thereby underscoring the relevance of human agency within the broader feminist framework that sees such acts as essential to fostering social change (hooks, 2000). Another prominent strategy of resistance is the establishment of underground educational initiatives, where Afghan women educators clandestinely gather students in private homes or safe spaces to continue their studies. These informal networks provide educational resources, instruction, and support, maintaining an educational lifeline for Afghan girls. According to Medica Mondiale (2023), these underground classes, though small and limited, serve as a critical tool for resilience, preserving a semblance of intellectual engagement and community solidarity. In these settings, women are defying not only the Taliban’s mandates but also cultural constraints by fostering environments where girls can learn and interact, albeit discreetly. This form of resistance aligns with feminist theory's emphasis on collective resilience and adaptability as women utilize available resources to protect their rights within restrictive environments (UN Women, 2022). The international community has responded with varied strategies of support, ranging from direct advocacy to funding underground initiatives and providing psychological and educational resources. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the United Nations have issued strong statements condemning the Taliban’s restrictions, labeling them as violations of international human rights standards, particularly concerning the right to education for girls and women (Amnesty International, 2023). These organizations have also actively lobbied for international pressure on the Taliban, urging governments to tie foreign aid and diplomatic recognition to the restoration of women’s rights, including access to education. Such advocacy is rooted in global gender equality principles outlined in documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which highlights education as fundamental to personal and societal development (United Nations, 1948). In addition to advocacy, certain NGOs and international entities have provided material support for underground education efforts within Afghanistan. Organizations like UNICEF and UN Women have contributed educational materials, supplies, and financial support to groups operating discreetly in Taliban-controlled regions. These efforts emphasize the broader socio-political consensus that educational access is integral to human rights, bolstering feminist perspectives that prioritize equal educational opportunities as a foundation for gender parity and self-empowerment (hooks, 2000). However, despite these efforts, challenges remain, as international support is often constrained by political concerns, security risks, and limited access to Taliban-controlled regions, thus complicating the delivery and sustainability of these resources (Crisis Group, 2023). Nevertheless, criticism exists regarding the efficacy of the international response, with some arguing that diplomatic pressure has been inadequate and insufficiently coordinated. Opponents of current approaches argue that without stronger measures—such as economic sanctions or concerted multilateral action—the Taliban is unlikely to modify its policies. This counterpoint suggests that the international community’s responses lack the intensity needed to achieve meaningful change, reflecting a gap in political will rather than a lack of resources (International Crisis Group, 2023). Yet, advocates maintain that consistent international pressure and support, however limited, still offer crucial reinforcement to Afghan women’s resistance, providing psychological and moral support that signals global solidarity with their struggle. Hence, Afghan women’s resistance to educational restrictions, expressed through both public protests and underground schooling, reflects their resilience and unyielding demand for autonomy and equality. The international community’s support, while crucial, remains a complex and challenging endeavor, often falling short of the robust response many activists argue is necessary. Together, these acts of resilience underscore the determination of Afghan women to assert their right to education, despite facing one of the world’s most repressive regimes for women’s rights. Thus, the collective efforts of Afghan women, bolstered by international support, highlight the enduring power of human agency and solidarity in the struggle for gender equity. Future Prospects for Female Education in Afghanistan: Pathways for Change and Action The future of female education in Afghanistan rests on a complex interplay of international policy, grassroots resistance, and sustained advocacy. Despite the severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban, the potential for change remains viable through strategic international shifts and strengthened support for Afghan activists. Analyzing these dimensions in light of feminist theory and international human rights principles reveals the importance of multifaceted, globally coordinated efforts to address the systemic denial of education to Afghan girls and women. Potential for Change through International Policy Shifts and Grassroots Activism International policy shifts carry significant implications for the future of women’s rights and educational access in Afghanistan. The international community's stance towards the Taliban has so far been a mixture of condemnation and selective engagement, with countries balancing humanitarian assistance against political pressure (Crisis Group, 2023). Recent recommendations from organizations like the United Nations and Amnesty International have emphasized leveraging foreign aid as a bargaining tool, with several governments proposing that the restoration of educational rights should be a prerequisite for any diplomatic recognition or developmental aid (UN Women, 2023). Such approaches align with political consensus-based frameworks within feminist theory, where global cooperation is critical to enforcing gender equality norms, particularly when local systems systematically violate women’s rights (hooks, 2000). If implemented consistently, these policies have the potential to pressure the Taliban into reconsidering its stance on female education, especially if they are supported by comprehensive sanctions and clear accountability mechanisms for human rights abuses. Meanwhile, grassroots movements and community-based activism within Afghanistan serve as crucial avenues for sustaining women’s educational aspirations in the immediate term. Despite the Taliban’s attempts to stifle dissent, Afghan women have organized small-scale, localized movements, often in the form of underground educational programs that cater to girls who have been excluded from formal schooling (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These initiatives highlight the agency and resilience of Afghan women in reclaiming their rights, even under stringent societal constraints, and resonate with feminist perspectives on empowerment and human agency, where local activism provides a foundation for broader societal change (hooks, 2000). While these movements face enormous risks, their persistence has garnered international attention, demonstrating that grassroots activism can serve as both a form of resistance and a powerful symbol for global solidarity with Afghan women. Recommendations for Action: Supporting Female Education and Global Solidarity To secure lasting change, actionable strategies must be developed and sustained by both local and international actors. Key recommendations for supporting female education in Afghanistan include increasing financial and logistical support for underground education initiatives, improving mental health resources for affected women and girls, and enhancing secure channels for local activists to communicate with international supporters. Organizations such as Medica Mondiale (2023) have already begun funding programs aimed at providing educational materials and psychological support to Afghan women, ensuring that even informal educational spaces can deliver critical resources. Further, the development of secure communication platforms and community networks could enable Afghan activists to coordinate more effectively with international allies, allowing for real-time collaboration and access to information on global legal and human rights developments (UNICEF, 2022). Such efforts reinforce the necessity of collective support mechanisms within the feminist framework, emphasizing the role of institutional design in fostering inclusive education and gender parity even under adverse political conditions. Global solidarity and advocacy are equally essential for advancing Afghan women’s rights. Ongoing campaigns led by NGOs, international legal bodies, and academic institutions emphasize the need for unified international condemnation of Taliban policies, coupled with diplomatic efforts that explicitly prioritize female education (Amnesty International, 2023). These strategies include lobbying for special provisions within international human rights law that recognize gender apartheid as a prosecutable crime, as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, thereby establishing a legal precedent for intervening in countries where women are systematically oppressed (UN, 1948). By framing the issue within global gender equality norms, such advocacy amplifies Afghan women’s voices, ensuring that their plight remains prominent in international forums. As a result, the future of female education in Afghanistan depends on the successful convergence of international pressure, grassroots resilience, and sustained advocacy. A comprehensive approach that includes strict international policies, targeted support for local activists, and unwavering global solidarity offers the most promising pathway to restore and protect Afghan women’s educational rights. Although significant challenges persist, the combined strength of these efforts represents a robust foundation for eventual change. Such a multifaceted response underscores the enduring relevance of feminist theories that advocate for global cooperation, human agency, and collective resilience, demonstrating that even in the face of extreme repression, the fight for gender equality and education can continue. Conclusion The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan since August 2021 has led to one of the most profound and alarming crises regarding women's rights and gender equality in recent history. This article has examined the multifaceted impacts of Taliban policies on female education and the broader implications for Afghan society. The systematic erosion of hard-won educational gains has not only restricted access to learning for girls and women but has also entrenched a culture of gender apartheid that perpetuates inequality and marginalization. The findings highlight that the Taliban's restrictions extend far beyond education; they encompass significant mental health implications for Afghan women, a deterioration of family dynamics, and a chilling effect on community structures. The psychological burden of enforced ignorance and oppression is profound, contributing to a cycle of despair that threatens the very fabric of Afghan society. Despite these overwhelming challenges, the resilience and agency of Afghan women shine through. Grassroots movements, underground educational initiatives, and acts of defiance reflect a commitment to reclaiming rights and freedoms. However, the international community's response has often been criticized as inadequate, with calls for more robust and coordinated advocacy to hold the Taliban accountable for human rights violations and to support Afghan women's rights activists. The urgency of addressing female education and empowerment in Afghanistan cannot be overstated. Restoring access to education and ensuring the fundamental rights of Afghan women is not only a moral imperative but also critical for the country’s socio-economic development and stability. As Afghanistan faces a precarious future, the role of global solidarity and action becomes essential in advocating for the rights of women and fostering an environment where gender equality can thrive. Therefore, the situation demands immediate and sustained international attention to dismantle the barriers imposed by the Taliban and to support the ongoing struggles of Afghan women. Without concerted efforts, the potential for progress remains bleak, and the aspirations of a generation of Afghan girls may be irrevocably thwarted. It is through this collective commitment to justice and equity that a more hopeful future for Afghanistan can be forged. References Abu-Lughod, L. (2002). Do Muslim Women Need Saving?

Defunding NPR – OpEd	Elon Musk has talked about eliminating at least two trillion dollars of United States government yearly spending. While it would contribute a small portion toward this grand goal, a spending cut that jumps out as among the most obvious for Musk and the incoming Donald Trump administration to pursue is eliminating all US government support for National Public Radio (NPR) and its affiliated programing and radio stations. The most convincing argument for US government funding of NPR has faded away over the decades since the media organization’s creation in the pre-internet and even quite limited cable television age. Nowadays, there is easy access to news and entertainment sources aplenty at the click of the mouse or remote control. There is no arguable need for Uncle Sam to provide a helping hand to a select media organization. Fundamentally, though, the US government supporting NPR has been wrong from the beginning. Providing news and entertainment to Americans is an activity many steps removed from the few powers the US Constitution sets forward as delegated to the US government. Further, it is inconsistent with the tenor of the First Amendment for the US government that is prohibited from making any law abridging the freedom of the press to be selectively providing funding for one media organization, thus giving it a leg up on the competition. Relevant for the Trump administration and Republicans in the US House of Representatives and Senate as well would be that NPR, since the 2016 presidential election, has placed a target on Trump’s back. Attacking Trump relentlessly has been pursued across NPR programs for the past eight years. How is it acceptable for the US government to be funding a media organization that has as part of its editorial policy the belittling and demonizing of this man who for most of this time period was either serving as president or running for president? Election interference anyone? Hopefully, some Democratic Congress members would join in condemning the unfairness of the situation even though their presidential candidates were the beneficiaries. On April 9, longtime NPR employee Uri Berliner went public with his insights on how 'an open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR' and how instead there is a 'distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.' He also discussed how NPR engaged in 'efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.' If, like most Americans, you listen little or not at all to NPR, Berliner’s article, which you can read here, is a good introduction to some of the intense bias you have missed out on hearing. To reach two trillion in savings, Musk and Trump would certainly find some spending cuts difficult. Eliminating US government support for NPR, in contrast, seems like something that should be an easy choice.

The Complex Legacy Of George Orwell – OpEd	By Allen Gindler George Orwell, one of the most influential political writers of the 20th century, is widely recognized for his searing critiques of totalitarian regimes in his novels Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell’s portrayal of state control, propaganda, and the manipulation of truth has resonated with readers across the political spectrum. However, Orwell’s personal political ideology and his critiques of totalitarianism are far more complex than is often acknowledged. Rather than being a passive observer or simply an opponent of dictatorship, Orwell was deeply involved in the socialist movements of his time, aligning himself—whether accidentally or intentionally—with Trotskyist circles. Orwell was a powerful voice of the left, despite being a target in the war among socialist factions. Orwell’s Political Ideology and Alignment with Trotskyism While Orwell is best remembered for his criticism of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, it is essential to understand that he was, first and foremost, a committed socialist. Despite never formally joining a political party, Orwell was an active and vocal participant in the socialist movement. This may surprise those who associate Orwell solely with his critiques of state tyranny. Indeed, Orwell’s disdain for the left dictatorship did not extend to all forms of socialism, and his political writings often reflect an internal critique of socialist regimes rather than a wholesale rejection of socialist principles. Orwell’s critique of Stalinist totalitarianism is best understood as part of a broader ideological struggle within the socialist movement itself. Specifically, Orwell’s critiques echo the views of Leon Trotsky, a key figure in early Soviet history and one of Stalin’s most prominent critics. Trotsky was a revolutionary Marxist who played a crucial role in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent civil war. He was instrumental in founding the Red Army, which secured the Bolshevik victory over the anti-communist White Army during the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky’s theory of 'permanent revolution' set him at odds with Stalin, who favored the consolidation of socialism in one country—namely, the Soviet Union—before pursuing global revolution. Trotsky’s insistence that socialism must be spread worldwide made him a figure of suspicion within the Soviet hierarchy. In the early 1920s, Stalin consolidated power, leading to Trotsky’s exile in 1929. Despite this, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin’s policies from abroad, particularly through his writings. Trotsky’s critique of Stalinism included accusations that Stalin had betrayed the original goals of the Russian Revolution. According to Trotsky, Stalin had established a bureaucratic dictatorship rather than a dictatorship of the proletariat, as envisioned by Marxist theory. He argued that Stalin’s regime represented, not the rule of the working class, but the rise of a privileged bureaucratic elite, a 'nomenklatura,' that dominated Soviet society. In addition, Trotsky accused Stalin of fostering a cult of personality, suppressing political opposition, and betraying the internationalist principles of socialism. Orwell and the Spanish Civil War In 1936, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, Orwell made the fateful decision to join the Republican side, fighting against Francisco Franco’s Nationalista forces. What makes Orwell’s involvement particularly significant is his choice of faction. Rather than aligning himself with the International Brigades, Orwell joined the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a Marxist faction heavily influenced by Trotskyist ideas. Orwell’s decision to fight with the POUM speaks volumes about his political leanings during this period. The Spanish Civil War was not simply a battle between Republicans and Nationalistas; it was also an ideological battleground for various factions of the international left. The Republican side was a coalition of various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups. The POUM, with which Orwell fought, was aligned with Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist factions, while the Communist Party of Spain, supported by Stalin, took a hard line against any left-wing groups that did not adhere to Moscow’s policies. As Orwell would later write in Homage to Catalonia, his firsthand experience in Spain profoundly influenced his understanding of the brutal dynamics of power within the left. This dynamic reflects what biologists refer to as 'intraspecific struggle,' where members of the same species (or political movement, in this case) compete most aggressively with each other for dominance. While Orwell fought against Franco’s Nationalistas at the front, Stalin’s agents were conducting a purge of Trotskyist and anarchist factions behind the lines. The NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, were sent to Spain to suppress all non-Bolshevik leftist elements within the Republican forces. This included the POUM, which was eventually outlawed by the Stalinist-backed Republican leadership. NKVD agents kidnapped and killed the head of POUM, Andreu Nin. Orwell himself narrowly escaped assassination by the NKVD and covertly fled to England. These experiences deepened his disillusionment with Stalinism and reinforced his belief that the Soviet regime had betrayed the original ideals of socialism. Orwell’s Literary Response: Animal Farm and 1984 Orwell’s experiences in Spain and his understanding of the internal conflicts within socialism found their most potent expression in his literary works. Animal Farm, published in 1945, is widely understood as an allegory of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. Because of this, he struggled to find a publisher willing to take on the book, as many feared the political consequences of criticizing Stalin at the time of WWII. In the novella, Orwell portrays the betrayal of revolutionary ideals through the story of a group of farm animals who overthrow their human owner, only to see their new leaders—the pigs—become as oppressive as the humans they replaced. The pig Napoleon, who represents Stalin, manipulates the other animals, gradually consolidating power and rewriting the revolution’s history to justify his dictatorship. What is often overlooked in discussions of Animal Farm is the role of Trotsky’s ideas in shaping Orwell’s narrative. The character of Snowball—who is expelled from the farm by Napoleon—represents Trotsky. Snowball, like Trotsky, is portrayed as an idealistic, but ultimately powerless figure, who is demonized by the regime in power. Orwell’s depiction of Snowball’s exile and the subsequent demonization of his legacy mirrors Trotsky’s real-life expulsion and assassination by Stalin’s agents in 1940. In this sense, Animal Farm can be read as an artistic rendering of Trotsky’s The Revolution Betrayed (a critique of Stalinism from the left), with Orwell using the fable to illustrate the broader betrayal of socialist ideals by Stalin’s regime. Yet, Orwell could not grasp that if Trotsky had been the head of the Soviet Union, his regime might have been even more ruthless than the one Stalin built. Proletarian dictatorship is no better than party dictatorship. Orwell’s final novel, 1984, extends his critique of totalitarianism beyond Stalinism to address the broader implications of state control, surveillance, and the manipulation of truth. Although 1984 is not explicitly focused on socialist ideology, its portrayal of a dystopian world ruled by a single party—where dissent is brutally suppressed and history is constantly rewritten—draws heavily on Orwell’s understanding of the Stalinist regime. The famous phrase 'Big Brother is watching you' has since become synonymous with state surveillance and authoritarianism, but in the context of Orwell’s political trajectory, it also serves as a broader warning about the dangers of unchecked power, regardless of ideological orientation. Orwell’s Dilemma: The Limits of Socialist Critique Despite his damning critique of Stalinism, Orwell remained a socialist until the end of his life. His disillusionment with the Soviet Union did not extend to socialism as a whole. In fact, Orwell believed that socialism could still provide the solution to the social and economic problems facing the world, provided it did not fall into the traps of authoritarianism and bureaucracy. This presents a fundamental paradox in Orwell’s thought: while he was acutely aware of the dangers of totalitarianism produced by different currents of socialism, he continued to advocate for a general utopia that, in practice, often led to the very abuses of power he critiqued. Orwell could not comprehend that, regardless of the specific flavor of socialism —whether Trotskyist, Stalinist, or otherwise—given enough time, it would inevitably lead to the same outcome: economic stagnation, moral decadence, and repression. His deep belief in the potential of socialism, particularly in its democratic form, blinded him to the inherent authoritarian tendencies within socialist movements. Orwell’s Legacy George Orwell’s legacy as a writer and political thinker is marked by his commitment to socialist ideals and his fierce opposition to totalitarianism. His engagement with Trotskyist ideas, his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and his literary responses to Stalinism reveal a nuanced understanding of the complexities within the socialist movement. While Orwell’s critiques of political tyranny remain profoundly relevant today, his continued belief in socialism—even after witnessing its failures—underscores the intricacies of his thought. Therefore, it feels somewhat awkward to rely on a socialist’s critique of the very regimes that socialism consistently produces.

Ukrainian And North Korean Forces Clash In Russian Region Of Kurs...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukraine’s First Encounter with North Korean Troops Marks a Pivotal Moment In the Russian region of Kursk, North Korean combat formations reportedly exchanged fire with Ukrainian servicemen for the first time since Pyongyang deployed its forces to Russia. The limited availability of open-source intelligence makes it difficult to assess this skirmish in detail. But press sources have noted that North Korea’s troops were equipped with assault rifles, 60mm mortars, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), sniper weaponry, night-vision equipment, and hand grenades. This reinforces previous assessments that special forces light infantry units are the backbone of the forward-deployed North Korean presence for now. According to Ukrainian defense intelligence sources, three North Korean generals and up to 500 officers have already made it to Russia to oversee the units deployed there. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that many of these brigades are from Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit. This corps is considered a strategic force and is trained to open a second front in a conventional conflict or attack an enemy’s rear area. The United States Department of Defense reported that Pyongyang has already fielded around 10,000 troops in Kursk for combat operations. South Korean intelligence services foresaw a total contingent of around 12,000arriving in the region. But force-generation patterns suggest that North Korea’s deployment there may eventually be even more substantial than this estimate. Two questions loom large at this juncture. First, will the North Korean troops’ mandate extend beyond Kursk to fighting in occupied Ukraine? Second, will Pyongyang reinforce its initial deployments with additional troops? Our forecast suggests the answer to both questions is yes, underscoring the potential for a significant escalation of the conflict. 2. Ukraine Conducts Strikes in Geopolitically Crucial Caspian Sea Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reportedly struck two Gepard-class frigates in the Caspian Sea, showcasing the increasing reach and strength of Ukraine’s drone warfare capabilities. Equipped with Kalibr naval cruise missiles, these frigates play a vital role in the Russian Navy’s long-range strike deterrent. Russia’s Caspian flotilla has previously launched Kalibr missiles to hammer Ukrainian population centers. The Caspian Sea has also become important for strategic transactions between the Russian military and its Iranian partners. The extension of Ukraine’s long-range drone threat to the Caspian marks a meaningful shift in the war—particularly should Kyiv repeat this success and continue to pressure Russian naval warfare capabilities in the basin. 3. Shahed Drone Strikes on Ukraine Have Increased Tenfold from 2023 to 2024 Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounded the alarm about the worrying rise in Shahed drone salvos, stating that Russian forces have employed the loitering munitions 10 times as often as they did in 2023. According to the Ukrainian high command, the most recent three-month data-collection period featured 4,300 Shahed launches. October was particularly grim, as it saw over 2,000 of the drones rain down on Ukrainian population centers. Russia used 790 Shahed drones in August of this year, and 1,300 in September. This boost in attacks carries implications well beyond Ukraine. Iranian drones are being produced at astronomical levels. When Iran and Russia initially launched their joint drone production plant in the Russian region of Tatarstan in 2023, initial estimates pegged its annual production rate at around 2,500 drones. By exploiting the indigenous Tatar population—and even using child labor—the Kremlin believes it can produce 6,000 Shaheds annually by 2025. Worryingly, current drone warfare trends in Ukraine suggest that Russia and Iran may have already met this production goal. Previous editions of this report have observed that the Islamic Republic and the Kremlin are now capable of producing massive amounts of low-cost loitering munitions on the doorstep of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The two allies can now sustain a high operational tempo of more than 2,000 drones per month. Even if Ukraine intercepts 90 percent of these munitions, it would be allowing 200 hits a month on civilian and military targets. With evolutions including thermobaric and high-explosive-incendiary warhead configurations, Shahed drones have become more destructive than ever. 4. Battlefield Assessment Russian forces have managed to gain territory on multiple fronts. Facing problematic manpower disadvantages, Ukraine has issued a social media summons to personnel who have deserted or are considered absent without leave (AWOL). Ukraine is also bracing for another mobilization. Last week Russia captured the Ukrainian village of Kurakhiva, further boosting its push into Kurakhove. Kurakhove, situated between the Vovcha River and the N-15 Highway, lies south of the strategically important city of Pokrovsk. Another critical flashpoint on the eastern front is Illinka, where the Ukrainian 79th Air Assault Brigade has been trying to hold the line against Russia’s formidable 20th Motor Rifle Division. Available writings suggest that Russian formations have a favorable five-to-one force-on-force ratio here. The Russian offensive has also advanced on other fronts. In Siversk, heightened combat activity and growing material losses have characterized the fighting. In southern Ukraine, Russia has intensified its tactical efforts without tangible success. Finally, in the Russian region of Kursk, the powerful Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade’s Abrams main battle tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles have been engaging Russian heavy armor. North Korean troops face considerable odds as they enter the fray.

The Role Of Data Science In Shaping Bangladesh’s Energy Diplomacy...	As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, energy diplomacy has become a key pillar of international relations, especially for nations like Bangladesh, where energy security and sustainable development are national priorities. Bangladesh, a nation with limited indigenous energy resources, has been strategically engaging with other countries to secure energy resources, including oil, gas, and renewable energy investments. Data science, with its vast potential to gather, analyze, and interpret large volumes of information, can offer Bangladesh powerful insights into global energy markets, demand forecasts, and international relations, enabling more effective and nuanced energy diplomacy. Bangladesh's Energy Diplomacy Landscape Energy diplomacy for Bangladesh primarily involves balancing national energy demands with sustainable and reliable access to energy sources. This requires partnerships, investment strategies, and policy alignments with countries in the region, including the USA, Russia, Qatar, Indonesia, India, China, and so on. Through collaborations, Bangladesh seeks not only to meet its energy requirements but also to position itself as a regional player in the energy market, particularly in the context of renewable energy and climate change initiatives. How Data Science Contributes to Energy Diplomacy Data science can enhance Bangladesh's energy diplomacy by supporting decision-making processes, enabling predictive modeling, and facilitating data-driven engagements with energy stakeholders. Here are some specific areas where data science can make a significant impact. 1. Energy Demand Forecasting and Management Data science can help Bangladesh model its future energy demand, considering variables like population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancement. By utilizing predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, data scientists can create robust models to estimate the country's future energy needs. This insight is crucial for diplomatic negotiations as it allows Bangladesh to approach potential energy suppliers with well-defined demand estimates, improving the bargaining position and making the case for stable, long-term energy agreements. Example: Through machine learning, data scientists can analyze historical consumption patterns, economic trends, and policy impacts to predict future energy needs, informing negotiations with suppliers on a reliable basis. 2. Resource Optimization and Renewable Energy Integration Bangladesh aims to diversify its energy sources, and renewable energy is a cornerstone of this strategy. Data science can optimize the deployment of renewable resources by determining the ideal mix of solar, wind, and hydropower based on geographic and meteorological data. Additionally, data-driven resource optimization can support Bangladesh in its diplomatic engagements with countries that have advanced renewable technology. Example: Using geospatial analysis, Bangladesh can identify the most suitable locations for solar and wind farms, supporting its push for investments from foreign nations that specialize in renewable technology. 3. Understanding Global Energy Market Trends Data science can process and analyze vast amounts of market data, providing insights into global trends, price fluctuations, and geopolitical events that impact the energy sector. For Bangladesh, understanding these dynamics is essential for forming effective energy alliances and negotiating favorable terms in international energy agreements. By analyzing real-time and historical data, Bangladeshi diplomats can stay ahead of market trends and tailor their strategies accordingly. Example: Data-driven insights into oil price volatility and supply chain shifts help Bangladesh make informed choices about when to buy or negotiate long-term contracts, potentially reducing energy costs. 4. Risk Assessment in Energy Investments Foreign investments in Bangladesh's energy sector often come with risks, including political instability, market volatility, and policy changes. Data science tools, particularly those focused on risk analysis and financial modeling, can help identify and mitigate these risks. By understanding these risks, Bangladesh can present a clear, data-backed assessment to potential investors, ensuring more secure and stable energy investments. Example: Predictive models assessing political and economic risks can give international investors a clear picture of the energy landscape in Bangladesh, thereby enhancing the country's credibility as a reliable energy partner. 5. Mapping Diplomatic Networks and Trade Relationships Data science, through network analysis and social graphing, can map Bangladesh's current diplomatic and trade relationships in the energy sector, identifying key partners and potential allies. This analysis helps in understanding where Bangladesh's energy diplomacy can expand or deepen and also provides insights into competitive and cooperative dynamics with neighboring countries. Example: Social network analysis tools can visualize Bangladesh's existing energy ties with regional players, showing where diplomatic efforts may yield more collaborative or competitive outcomes. 6. Environmental Impact Assessment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Data science can help Bangladesh in monitoring and reducing the environmental impacts of energy projects, aligning with its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Environmental data analysis provides insights that support responsible energy extraction, carbon reduction, and compliance with international environmental standards—key considerations in forming alliances with countries committed to sustainability. Example: Data-driven environmental monitoring tools can track emissions and environmental degradation from energy projects, helping Bangladesh showcase its commitment to green energy diplomacy on the international stage. 7. Strategic Use of Artificial Intelligence in Energy Negotiations Artificial intelligence (AI) can simulate various negotiation scenarios, helping Bangladeshi diplomats refine strategies for energy talks. AI-driven decision support systems can analyze historical negotiation data, identify patterns, and suggest effective approaches for future engagements. Example: AI models can recommend the most favorable negotiation strategies by analyzing previous energy agreements, benefiting Bangladesh's negotiation efforts with other energy-producing nations. 8. Monitoring Geopolitical Factors Impacting Energy Diplomacy Geopolitical stability is crucial to secure energy resources, and data science enables Bangladesh to monitor factors that could affect energy security, such as conflicts, sanctions, and diplomatic tensions. Using text mining and natural language processing (NLP), data scientists can analyze news reports, social media, and government publications to anticipate potential disruptions in energy supplies. Example: A real-time analysis of diplomatic stances or conflicts in oil-producing regions can help Bangladesh adapt its import strategies quickly, ensuring stable energy supplies. 9. Enhancing Energy Supply Chain Management Data science applications in supply chain management can help Bangladesh streamline its import and export processes, reducing costs and improving energy security. By analyzing logistics data, weather patterns, and international shipping trends, data science can help optimize Bangladesh's energy supply chain, minimizing risks of disruptions. Example: Predictive analytics in supply chain management can forecast potential disruptions, allowing for proactive solutions and ensuring that energy imports reach Bangladesh on time and at optimal costs. 10. Promoting Transparency and Accountability in Energy Deals Transparency is key to building trust in international partnerships, and data science tools, including blockchain technology, can ensure greater transparency in energy transactions. By enabling secure and traceable transactions, data science can reassure international investors about the integrity of Bangladesh's energy deals. Example: Blockchain-based systems for tracking transactions and contracts in the energy sector can provide clear and tamper-proof records, increasing trust among Bangladesh's foreign energy partners. Conclusion The application of data science to energy diplomacy offers Bangladesh transformative opportunities to strengthen its position on the global energy stage. By leveraging predictive models, optimizing resource management, and fostering transparent transactions, Bangladesh can engage in more effective energy diplomacy, achieving long-term energy security and sustainable growth. Through a strategic alignment of data science and energy diplomacy, Bangladesh can ensure that its national interests align with global energy trends, securing a resilient and prosperous energy future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbdgM6TlnK19	2024-11-09T17:44:26-08:00	
Trump Act II Spells The End Of The American Empire – OpEd	By Susan Thornton Many around the world may joke that they should be allowed to vote in American elections because the results have as big an effect on them as they do on those who live in the United States. The actions of a unipolar superpower reverberate around the world and other countries are forced to respond. But American voters almost never vote based on events happening in the world, on foreign policy issues or even on things that might affect future generations at home. Voting is an emotional, last-minute impulse. During times when there was consensus around the United States’ global roles and responsibilities, the vagaries of elections did not much alter the US approach to the world. But times have changed. The election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term affirms a fundamental shift in America’s relationship with the world. In contrast to other empires, which tended to fall apart slowly over an extended period, Americans themselves have decided they no longer want to bear the burdens and distractions of global hegemony. Americans are no longer confident in the promise and effectiveness of their institutional system, they reject the obligation of answering the world’s fire alarms, they are weary of bearing the cost of global security and they see clearly that other states are free-riding on US largesse. The US electorate has been consistently ahead of its politicians in its rejection of the role of ‘world policeman’. The Biden administration’s claim that costs borne by the United States in these endeavours is more than returned by having global friends and keeping the wars ‘over there’ was not sufficient to overcome nagging doubts and grievances. Political gamesmanship over support for Ukraine and other conflicts contributed to the impression that American commitments were optional or, more problematically, ‘scams’ perpetrated by out-of-touch elites. Those living in other countries, and many living in the United States, might see these issues differently, but they do not vote or they do not vote enough. Trump, and certainly his national security team, does not appreciate that he was put in power to dismantle US global hegemony. But Trump’s bullying transactionalism, his aversion to commitment, his penchant for tariffs and complete indifference to the potential impact that the United States has on other countries can have no other outcome. It is obvious that permanent damage will be done to the United Nations, international economic institutions, multilateral organisations in which the United States is a member and any international effort to combat transnational challenges. The dissolution began during his first term and will be irreversible after the coming four years. The Americans who elected Trump as their standard bearer will cheer their demise. But, more worryingly, Trump’s national security appointees will not accept the message the Trump electorate has sent them. They will cling to American primacy through ever-escalating military deployments under the rubric of ‘deterrence’. Asian partners should steer clear of whiplash from the collision between Trump’s transactionalism and his national security team’s fever dreams. This means allies, especially those in the Pacific, can likely continue to count on US security backing, as long as they can demonstrate that they are not free riding. This has implications for Japan’s financing of its defence budget increase, for Taiwan’s defence reforms and for other partners stepping up their contributions to their own defence (including purchases of US weapons systems through deals like AUKUS). Despite Trump’s claim that he ‘doesn’t start wars, he stops them’, his re-ascension likely portends more turmoil in the world. It is true that Trump’s political invulnerability may allow him to make big moves in foreign policy — cultivating personal diplomacy with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin or expanding Israel’s diplomatic space. But Trump relishes provoking others. His confidence in being able to avert wars by sowing fear is misplaced and likely to backfire. Biden’s modest stabilisation of US–China ties is unlikely to hold and Taiwan is a particularly hot potato in Trump’s hands. The economic implications of the Trump term will of course be significant, especially for Asia — the most globalised part of the international trading system. The playbook here is familiar, and it revolves around tariffs and bilateral negotiations to increase US exports. It is not clear how much room this strategy has to run in Trump II, but a Trump administration may be more welcoming of foreign investment into the United States, which could alleviate pressure on trade for some countries or sectors. There will be a further sharp disconnect of the US and Chinese economies. Trump and the Republican Congress are likely to invoke more tariffs, export controls and sanctions leading to global fragmentation, rising costs and slower growth. Businesses will face an ever more complicated picture and are already strategising how to adjust. Many countries in Asia are devising economic hedging strategies and will try to walk a middle line amid deteriorating US–China relations. Whether and how a Trump administration might impose costs for such an approach remains an open question. We have already entered the transition to a post-Pax Americana world — Trump is an accelerant. This does not mean that the United States will disappear. It will remain the most powerful and wealthy country in the world. But it does leave a vacuum in the international arena and US partners will hopefully step in to provide leadership and public goods. In this more fragmented, disordered world, US partners in Asia should also pursue more networked security cooperation and regional integration to safeguard peace and mitigate the negative effects of deglobalisation for their economies. Such measures are useful on their own merits, no matter who is in the White House, as the world is set to become a more difficult and dangerous place.

Armenia: Government Efforts To Enhance Surveillance Infrastructur...	By Ani Avetisyan (Eurasianet) -- The Armenian government is proceeding cautiously on a security bill that would build up surveillance infrastructure in the capital Yerevan, allowing more time for public discussion of the pros and cons of giving authorities expanded powers to potentially track individuals’ movements. Introduced in the spring, and already approved by parliament in a preliminary reading, the Interior Ministry-drafted bill would grant law enforcement agencies 24/7 access to live feeds and recordings from video cameras installed across the city, providing expansive coverage of all public space in the center of Yerevan. Private businesses, educational institutions, and other entities would be required to install cameras covering all building entrances and surrounding areas, with footage retained for 15 days. Armenia’s deputy interior minister also hinted at plans to use artificial intelligence to analyze footage, something that many privacy experts fear could facilitate the use of biometric and facial recognition technologies in video surveillance. The potential use of widespread surveillance has political ramifications, as opponents of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan have mounted protests against his government in recent months. The bill’s provisions, if enacted, could potentially be used to identify opposition supporters for politically motivated retribution. Officials cast the bill as an anti-crime measure designed to strengthen 'public security.' But it has sparked spirited public debate over privacy concerns and potential rights abuses. Human Rights Watch has urged officials to reconsider their approach, and, at the very least, create guardrails that 'mitigate any human rights risks,' as well as create comprehensive 'plans for oversight and accountability.' 'Widespread, indiscriminate video surveillance would inevitably lead to unjustified intrusions on privacy,' a HRW statement quoted Giorgi Gogia, the organization’s associate director for Europe and Central Asia, as saying. 'Mass surveillance in public spaces would have a chilling effect on fundamental civil and political rights.' Armenian law enforcement authorities have faced increasing public pressure to reduce crime rates, particularly amid a spike in drug trafficking. Proponents of the bill argue that enhanced surveillance could serve as a deterrent and facilitate the more efficient solving of crimes. But the country’s Data Protection Agency has echoed HRW’s concerns, issuing a statement that, in its current form, the bill would cause 'disproportionate interference' with citizens’ privacy rights by enabling 'unlimited and continuous processing of personal data' by authorities. Information Security expert Artur Papyan warned that a rapid expansion in the numbers of CCTV cameras could potentially increase the risks of them being hacked and used for malicious surveillance purposes by third parties. He cited the example of Russian hackers breaking into the database of security cameras in Kyiv prior to an attack earlier this year. The government, which is striving to steer the country away from Russia and enhance tieswith the West, is taking heed of the criticism. Final parliamentary consideration of the bill, originally scheduled for September, has been postponed. Parliament is now expected to consider adoption before the end of the year. The Armenian government’s cautious approach on the surveillance bill contrasts with the behavior of the Georgian Dream leadership in neighboring Georgia, where the ruling party rammed restrictive legislation, known as the 'foreign agents' law, through parliament without public input or legislative debate, sparking mass protests. Unlike Armenia which is aligning itself closer to the West, Georgian Dream has moved in recent years away from the European Union and United States and closer to Russia. Armenian leaders have voiced interest in seeking EU membership. The country’s legal obligations as a signatory to various international treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights, require it to uphold strict privacy protection standards, yet some of the country’s existing laws, as well as pending bills, fall short of meeting EU benchmarks. For example, Armenia’s Electoral Commission has made public the database of all eligible voters in Armenia, including personal information about individuals and the people registered with them at the same address. In 2020, the current government sought to pass a law that would make it easier for the police to access residents’ bank details without a court order, as required by current legislation. The bill, which the government tried to present as a means of combating money laundering, was declared unconstitutional by the country’s Constitutional Court.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTV4dzcu4cO3A	2024-11-09T17:37:47-08:00	
35 Years After Fall Of Berlin Wall, Germany Is In A Funk That Mig...	By Andrew Hammond Ordinarily, Saturday’s 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall might have been expected to be a cause for much joy in Germany. However, celebrations of the milestone will for many people be subdued given the nation’s deep economic and political funk. This was most recently illustrated by the collapse on Wednesday of the three-way governing coalition that included the left-of-center Social Democratic Party (the SPD), the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party. Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leader of the FDP, declaring that there was no longer any 'basis of trust' between them. Scholz, who is leader of the SPD, said he would seek a vote of confidence by Jan. 15 so that MPs 'can decide whether to clear the way for early elections.' These could take place as soon as March, six months earlier than scheduled. Beneath this governmental instability there lies a deeper issue: the breakdown of the traditional duopoly of power between the SPD and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. These parties have been the twin pillars of German politics since the end of the Second World War. But with the SPD now very unpopular and the direction of the CDU/CSU still uncertain since the end of Angela Merkel’s long chancellorship between 2005 and 2021, Germany appears to be moving from de facto two-party politics to a multiparty system. This is illustrated by the growing number of smaller parties that previously functioned as subsidiaries of either the SPD or the CDU/CSU. One of the drivers of this unraveling of traditional German politics and the fracturing of the political landscape has been the fact that the nation’s post-war consensus is eroding on multiple issues, including history, geopolitics, the economy and ethics. These political fractures might mean politics is becoming more generally unstable and less predictable, with significant challenges each election cycle in establishing a governing coalition. So there might be more rotation of ruling coalitions, with all the problems this can bring including, potentially, the prospect of the role of the chancellorship becoming weaker in patchwork governments. For much of the 35 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, many Germans have been mostly content with their post-Cold War lot, seeing themselves in general as beneficiaries of globalization. This might be changing, as evidenced by the rise of smaller parties. The far right Alternative for Deutschland is currently running second in the polls, for instance. It was the first far-right group to gain seats in the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, for six decades. Moreover, in September the party won its first state election, in Thuringia. The AfD campaigns extensively on immigration, an issue that has grown significantly in salience in Germany in recent years. This is in part because of the integration of more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion in 2022, and the arrival of about 1 million migrants, largely from the Middle East, in 2015 and 2016. This political malaise is mirrored on the economic front. The fall of the Berlin Wall hastened the end of Soviet Communism and led to the reunification of Germany, but the nation has more recently been given the moniker of the 'sick man of Europe.' Certainly, Germany has long had the largest economy in the region and is the most powerful nation in the EU, yet it is flatlining. The country has been in a state of ferment now for many years, exacerbated by the pandemic and the energy shocks that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Economically, the latest data shows that Germany very narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter of this year but is still struggling after shrinking last year, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting zero growth in 2024. The challenges the country faces are exemplified by Volkswagen, which has experienced a sharp fall in profits and might decide to close several factories for the first time in its almost 90-year history. Operating profits for the nine months to the end of September fell by more than a fifth compared with the same period a year ago to just under 13 billion euro ($14 billion), the causes of which included weaker demand from China. The company’s problems reflect a wider malaise in the automotive industry, which is Germany’s single largest business sector. With economic confidence weak, there has also been the biggest reduction in employment for about half a decade, according to an S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank index. In addition, the Federation of German Industries has warned that a fifth of the country’s industrial output might be at risk between now and 2030. This is not only because of weaker export markets for German goods (exports account for nearly half of the nation’s gross domestic product, a higher proportion than many other major economies) but also high energy costs. One worrying sign of the declining economic confidence might be German birth rates, which have gone into decline after rising before the pandemic. Between 2011 and 2016, the birth rate rose from 1.38 to 1.59 children per woman. However, it had fallen to only 1.35 in 2023. To rub salt into the wounds, the nation’s troubled public finances could soon become much worse as a result of a Federal Constitutional Court decision that might reduce tax income by up to 75 billion euro. The court case concerns the legality of a so-called 'solidarity surcharge' that was introduced to tackle the burden of German reunification. Reportedly at risk is about &euro;66 billion collected since 2020, and approximately &euro;9 billion in interest. If the court rules against the government on this, it will blow a huge hole in public finances. All of this explains why the nation might now be at a historic crossroads. The danger is that it might result in a significantly weaker Germany, and wider EU, at a time of growing global geopolitical flux and economic uncertainty. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTQl-xxpaIgOH	2024-11-09T17:36:06-08:00	
Trump Is Expected To Secure US Rights Through Tough But Fair Tran...	US President-elect Donald Trump is feared by some and extolled by others. On the one hand, those who fear him say he will make the US aggressive, impulsive and selfish, driven by the battle cry 'America First' and 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). On the other hand, those who laud him say he will make the US concentrate on pressing domestic issues and not waste resources on saving other countries from authoritarian hegemons in a pretentious colonial-era 'civilizing mission'. While there is a grain of truth in both assessments, overall, Trump has shown through his performance in his previous stint in the White House between 2017 and 2021, that he could be both tough and benign, waging war to assert America's rights on the one hand, and bringing peace if that was the way forward, on the other. Trump is a pragmatic politician, but not an unprincipled one. He has no 'Trump Doctrine' to expound, as he has no fixed notions. He goes mostly by his instinct and assessment of the ground reality. His decisions are 'his' in the true sense of the word. According to Robert C. O'Brien, US National Security Adviser from 2019 to 2021, Trump may replicate President Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) who used US power with panache, but judiciously, to achieve a number of diplomatic triumphs. Like Trump, Jackson believed in give and take. He showed the fist when necessary, and struck a compromise when called for, as he did in the case of disputes with France, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain. Jackson signed trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Britain, and Siam. The treaty with Britain reopened American trade with the British West Indies. Overall, US trade boomed in Jackson's time- exports increased by more than 75% and imports by 250%. By the time Jackson retired from the White House in 1837, he had significantly altered the office of the President, expanding its veto power, basing its authority on the will of the people. He dramatically enhanced the chief executive's political and legislative powers, O'Brien recalled. But Jackson was not foolhardy. He would leave some issues to the Congress even if he had strong views on them as he did in the case of the integration of Texas State into the USA. Likewise, Trump would be an aggressive President but would leave some sensitive issues to the legislature. Presently, he has now left the decision on the critical issue of abortion to the States. Indeed, Trump was an aggressive 'Make America Great' proponent. But he was also a peacemaker when he was in office from 2017 to 2021. Listing his achievements, O'Brien says that he facilitated the Abraham Accords, bringing peace to Israel and three of its neighbours and Sudan. He brought about economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo; pushed Egypt and the Gulf states to settle their rift with Qatar and end their blockade of Qatar. More importantly, the US entered into an agreement with the Taliban to being about an American withdrawal. This prevented any American combat deaths there for nearly the entire final year of the Trump administration. Trump ended one war- against the ISIS as an organized military force. He eliminated its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump was determined to avoid new wars and endless counterinsurgency operations. According to O'Brien the Trump Presidency was the first since that of Jimmy Carter in which the US did not enter a new war or expand an existing one. O'Brien notes that when Trump was in office, Russia did not press further forward after its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and Iran did not attack Israel, and North Korea stopped testing nuclear weapons after a combination of diplomatic outreach and a U.S. military show of force. But Trump ordered a limited but effective air attack on Syria in 2017, after Bashar al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against its own people. Trump's critics say that his 'America first' is 'America alone'. But this is debunked by O'Brien. Yes, Trump is critical of NATO and thinks expenditure on it is unwarranted but this is because the European members are not contributing enough for its upkeep. He says that Ukraine's Zelensky is a 'salesman' because every time he came to the US he successfully made a case for billions of dollars. Trump would insist the Taiwan which spends only 3% of its GDP on defence should spend more and not burden the US so much. Trump is all for free international trade but not when some countries raise tariffs and erect other protective barriers, and expect the US not to respond. There is a message here for China and also India. Trump is strongly against making a song and dance about climate change but his views deserve a careful examination and not outright rejection. Perhaps climate change programs could be reassessed taking all views into consideration. For example, the developing countries feel that the developed countries are the major polluters and should do more and also contribute more to the climate change mitigation kitty. Trump was shown to be a man of the White ruling class or the White majority, but the recent election result has shown that his support base spans various ethnicities. Even the Latinos (Mexicans and South Americans) he is trying to bar from entering the US illegally, supported him because everybody wanted America to be free from illegal migration as it was affecting the prospects of locals in the shrinking job markets. Talking of employment, by raising tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump hopes to encourage local American industries that will give Americans job and not Chinese thousands of miles away. All in all, Trump's supporters at home and others abroad can expect the US under Trump to veer from the existing policies of Left–Liberal America to be a more traditional inward-looking America with a calibrated approach to the world to maintain its position as the numero uno.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXTBZNnWOJV6	2024-11-09T17:22:56-08:00	
Interventionism, Sanctions, And Conflict: The Hallmarks Of US For...	Many countries around the world harbor unwarranted fears about the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024. However, a review of the history of U.S. foreign relations suggests that Trump’s foreign policy may not differ dramatically from that of his predecessors, including the incumbent President Biden. In fact, there are clear continuities in the way U.S. presidents—whether Republican or Democrat—engage with military intervention and the use of force. Take, for example, the military interventions under Republican George W. Bush. Bush invaded Afghanistan in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, occupying the country for nearly 20 years. The U.S.-backed government of Ashraf Ghani collapsed in 2021, leading to a negotiated return to power for the Taliban. Similarly, Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the deaths of approximately 4.6 million people and inflicted trillions in costs over two decades, consequences that continue to shape the region today. Democrat Barack Obama also authorized military action in Libya in 2011, which further destabilized North Africa and contributed to the growth of extremist groups in the region. Trump, during his first term, explicitly violated international law when he ordered the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, an action that heightened tensions with Tehran. Biden’s administration, meanwhile, has largely continued this trajectory, ignoring Moscow’s security concerns and pushing forward with NATO expansion, which played a significant role in triggering the war in Ukraine. Biden's tough stance toward China—continuing Trump’s aggressive approach—has included military posturing around Taiwan and the expansion of U.S. military bases in the Asia-Pacific region. Biden also continued to engage in proxy conflicts, such as his administration’s ongoing military operations in Yemen alongside the UK. The U.S. has also maintained its unwavering support for Israel, including its controversial actions in Gaza, leading critics to accuse Washington of complicity in war crimes and violations of international law. Life, war, and nothing else: this observation by the renowned Italian historian Oriana Fallaci, in her famous work of the same title, captures a grim reality of U.S. foreign policy, where the instruments of war and military intervention have dominated since the early 21st century. For the U.S., ensuring the loyalty of countries to Washington has long taken precedence over other concerns, driving U.S. presidents to repeatedly engage in military action and intervention around the world. The history of American interventionism is longer and more extensive than that of any other aggressor nation. Washington has frequently disregarded the sovereignty of other countries under the guise of promoting human rights and democracy. In 1953, the U.S. orchestrated a coup in Iran against its democratically elected government, sowing resentment that would culminate in the 1979 hostage crisis. In Vietnam, American forces fought a bloody war for two decades, only to suffer defeat and leave the region in chaos. In the 1980s, the U.S. funded and armed Islamic extremists to counter the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, contributing to the rise of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The 'color revolutions' in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, from 2003 to 2005, highlighted U.S. efforts to intervene in the politics of former Soviet states, often with the aim of establishing governments more aligned with Washington. Moreover, U.S. economic coercion, including secondary sanctions and export controls, continues to undermine the sovereignty of even Washington’s closest allies, leaving many nations vulnerable to American economic power. Given this history, it is clear that whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden is in office, the primary objective of the United States remains the maintenance of global dominance and the subordination of other nations to U.S. geopolitical interests. The differences between these leaders often lie more in rhetoric and style than in substance. Whether under Trump or Biden, the U.S. will continue to pursue aggressive policies toward China, offer unflinching support to Israel, keep Europe under its strategic thumb, and resist demands for more equitable engagement with the 'Global South.' In this sense, the fears surrounding Trump's return to the presidency are often exaggerated. Biden's administration has not been a radical departure from Trump’s foreign policy in many areas, particularly with regard to Russia, China, and the Middle East. Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021—a failure that Trump had similarly prepared for—demonstrated the inability of either party to manage the consequences of two decades of militarism in the region. Biden also escalated Trump’s confrontations with China, while pursuing policies that continue to inflame tensions in the Middle East, including his administration’s role in the normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel, sidelining the Palestinian issue in the process. Trump’s return to power would likely see a continuation of these policies, if not a further escalation. Trump, like Biden, remains committed to NATO expansion, confrontation with Russia, and the use of military force to maintain global hegemony. The U.S. commitment to military intervention and coercion will remain unchanged, and Washington’s role as the global policeman will continue—regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. Ultimately, whether under Biden, Trump, or any other future U.S. president, one principle of U.S. foreign policy remains certain: the reliance on coercive tools—military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure—will continue to dominate U.S. foreign relations. This strategy has been ingrained in the American political culture for decades, making war, violence, and intervention central tenets of U.S. diplomacy. The instability and crises afflicting the world today are the result of this unrelenting pursuit of dominance, a legacy that seems destined to continue for the foreseeable future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTZspKZPAPln9	2024-11-09T17:14:48-08:00	
Robert Reich: The Lesson – OpEd	A political disaster such as what occurred Tuesday gains significance not simply by virtue of who won or lost, but through how the election is interpreted. This is known as The Lesson of the election. The Lesson explains what happened and why. It deciphers the public’s mood, values, and thoughts. It attributes credit and blame. And therein lies its power. When The Lesson of the election becomes accepted wisdom — when most of the politicians, pundits, and journalists come to believe it — it shapes the future. It determines how parties, candidates, political operatives, and journalists approach future elections. There are many reasons for what occurred on Tuesday and for what the outcome should teach America — about where the nation is and about what Democrats should do in the future. Yet inevitably, one Lesson predominates. Today, I want to share with you six conventional 'lessons' you will hear for Tuesday’s outcome. None is or should be considered The Lesson of the 2024 election. Then I’ll give you what I consider the real Lesson of the election. None of these are The Lesson of the 2024 election: 1. It was a total repudiation of the Democratic Party, a major realignment. Rubbish. Harris would have won had there been a small, less than 1 percent vote shift in the three main battleground states. The biggest shift from 2020 and 2016 was among Latino men. We don’t know yet whether Latino men will return to the Democrats; if they don’t, they will contribute to a small realignment. But the fact is America elected Trump in 2016, almost reelected him in 2020, and elected him again in 2024. We haven't changed much, at least in terms of whom we vote for. 2. If the Dems want to win in the future, they have to move to the right. They should stop talking about 'democracy,' forget 'multiculturalism,' and end their focus on women’s rights, transgender rights, immigrants’ rights, voting rights, civil rights, and America’s shameful history of racism and genocide. Instead, push to strengthen families, cut taxes, allow school choice and prayer in public schools, reduce immigration, minimize our obligations abroad, and put America and Americans first. Wrong. Democrats shouldn’t move to the right if that means giving up on democracy, social justice, civil rights, and equal voting rights. While Democrats might reconsider their use of 'identity' politics (in which people are viewed primarily through the lenses of race, ethnicity, or gender), Democrats must not lose the moral ideals at the heart of the Party and at the core of America. 3. Republicans won because of misinformation and right-wing propaganda. They won over young men because of a vicious alliance between Trump and a vast network of online influencers and podcasts appealing to them. The answer is for Democrats to cultivate an equivalent media ecosystem that rivals what the right has built.Partly true. Misinformation and right-wing propaganda did play a role, particularly in reaching young men. But this hardly means progressives and Democrats should fill the information ecosystem with misinformation or left-wing propaganda. Better messaging, yes. Lies and bigotry, no. We should use our power as consumers to boycott X and all advertisers on X and on Fox News, mount defamation and other lawsuits against platforms that foment hate, and push for regulations (at least at the state level for now) requiring that all platforms achieve minimum standards of moderation and decency. 4. Republicans cheated. Trump, Putin, and election deniers at county and precinct levels engaged in a vast conspiracy to suppress votes. I doubt it. Putin tried, but so far there’s no sign that the Kremlin affected any voting process. There is little or no evidence of widespread cheating by Republicans. Dems should not feed further conspiracy theories about fraudulent voting or tallying. For the most part, the system worked smoothly, and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to election workers and state officials in charge of the process. 5. Harris ran a lousy campaign. She wasn’t a good communicator. She fudged and shifted her positions on issues. She was weighed down by Biden and didn’t sufficiently separate herself from him. Untrue. Harris ran an excellent campaign, but she had only a little over three months to do it. She had to introduce herself to the nation (typically a vice president is almost invisible within an administration) at the same time Trump’s antics sucked most of the oxygen out of the political air. She could have been clearer about her proposals and policies and embraced economic populism (see below on the real lesson), but her debate with Trump was the best debate performance I’ve ever witnessed, and her speeches were pitch perfect. Biden may have weighed her down a bit, but his decision to step down was gracious and selfless. 6. Racism and misogyny. Voters were simply not prepared to elect a Black female president. Partly true. Surely racism and misogyny played a role, but bigotry can’t offer a full explanation. Here’s the real Lesson of the 2024 election: On Tuesday, according to exit polls, Americans voted mainly on the economy — and their votes reflected their class and level of education. While the economy has improved over the last two years according to standard economic measures, most Americans without college degrees — that’s the majority — have not felt it. In fact, most Americans without college degrees have not felt much economic improvement for four decades, and their jobs have grown less secure. The real median wage of the bottom 90 percent is stuck nearly where it was in the early 1990s, even though the economy is more than twice as large. Most of the economy’s gains have gone to the top. This has caused many Americans to feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger. Harris did not. The real lesson of the 2024 election is that Democrats must not just give voice to the anger but also explain how record inequality has corrupted our system, and pledge to limit the political power of big corporations and the super-rich. The basic bargain used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you’d do better and your children would do even better than you. But since 1980, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. Why? While Republicans steadily cut taxes on the wealthy, Democrats abandoned the working class. Democrats embraced NAFTA and lowered tariffs on Chinese goods. They deregulated finance and allowed Wall Street to become a high-stakes gambling casino. They let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices (and profit margins) high. They let corporations bust unions (with negligible penalties) and slash payrolls. They bailed out Wall Street when its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy but never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. They welcomed big money into their campaigns — and delivered quid pro quos that rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy. Joe Biden redirected the Democratic Party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes he catalyzed — more vigorous antitrust enforcement, stronger enforcement of labor laws, and major investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, semiconductors, and non-fossil fuels — wouldn’t be evident for years, and he could not communicate effectively about them. The Republican Party says it’s on the side of working people, but its policies will hurt ordinary workers even more. Trump’s tariffs will drive up prices. His expected retreat from vigorous antitrust enforcement will allow giant corporations to drive up prices further. If Republicans gain control over the House as well as the Senate, as looks likely, they will extend Trump’s 2017 tax law and add additional tax cuts. As in 2017, these lower taxes will benefit mainly the wealthy and enlarge the national debt, which will give Republicans an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — their objectives for decades. Democrats must no longer do the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy. They must instead focus on winning back the working class. They should demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, higher taxes on great wealth, and housing credits that will generate the biggest boom in residential home construction since World War II. They should also demand that corporations share their profits with their workers. They should call for limits on CEO pay, eliminate all stock buybacks (as was the SEC rule before 1982), and reject corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credit to particular companies and industries unrelated to the common good). Democrats need to tell Americans why their pay has been lousy for decades and their jobs less secure: not because of immigrants, liberals, people of color, the 'deep state,' or any other Trump Republican bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off most of the economy’s gains. In doing this, Democrats need not turn their backs on democracy. Democracy goes hand-in-hand with a fair economy. Only by reducing the power of big money in our politics can America grow the middle class, reward hard work, and reaffirm the basic bargain at the heart of our system. If the Trump Republicans gain control of the House, as seems likely, they will have complete control of the federal government. That means they will own whatever happens to the economy and will be responsible for whatever happens to America. Notwithstanding all their anti-establishment populist rhetoric, they will become the establishment. The Democratic Party should use this inflection point to shift ground — from being the party of well-off college graduates, big corporations, 'never-Tumpers' like Dick Cheney, and vacuous 'centrism' — to an anti-establishment party ready to shake up the system on behalf of the vast majority of Americans. This is and should be The Lesson of the 2024 election. What do you think?

Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Election – OpEd	Sri Lanka's President Dissanayake made a smart decision to dissolve parliament after winning the presidential election on September 21. The national legislature was dissolved on September 24, and the election has been scheduled for November 14, 2024. Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are increasingly becoming predictable regarding winners and losers. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) wanted a two-thirds majority in 2020, and the SLPP-led coalition won a two-thirds majority. One of the reasons why the general elections lack excitement and unpredictability is that winning presidential candidates opt to dissolve parliament and go for fresh elections in the hope of capitalizing on the euphoria created by the presidential election results. It is the same logic that prompted President Dissanayake to dissolve parliament. This time, there are hardly any doubts about the victory of the JVP/NPP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna/National People’s Power). It will emerge as the single largest party in the national legislature. However, the question is, would the JVP/NPP win a clear majority on November 14? The JVP/NPP presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake presented himself as the 'change' candidate in the presidential election. However, after winning the presidential election, the Dassanayake administration has not demonstrated a keen interest in any substantial changes to the system. Not even policy changes have been announced as they continue with the key policies and practices of the previous governments, especially the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Many examples could be cited. The primary examples include the decision to continue with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) bailout deal, the decision to seek membership in BRICS, an emerging group of powerful states including China, India, and Russia, and the decision to continue with the fuel price formula system. There could be three reasons why the present government has not introduced any significant changes. First, the government is inexperienced. The cabinet of ministers has only three ministers, including the president. This was not by choice because the party had only three members in the previous parliament, and the Sri Lankan constitution does not allow ministers to be appointed from outside parliament. The JVP/NPP was not inclined to partner with like-minded parties in parliament to form a reasonable-sized cabinet because the party believed that all others in parliament were corrupt or unclean except for the JVP members. This is precisely why the party has urged the voters to 'clean' the parliament through their votes on November 14. Nevertheless, the government's inexperience may be preventing it from contemplating structural changes Dissanayake’s voters wanted. The present administration operates like a government with an opposition mentality. More resources and energy have been spent on criticizing the opposition parties rather than addressing administrative issues. Second, the government may be hesitant to introduce any structural changes because it fears that any immediate alterations could create an economic crisis like the one instigated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022. Returning to the era of queues was a slogan Dissanayake’s critics used against him during the presidential election. They argued that voting Dissanayake to power would push the country back to long queues for essential commodities. Third, the government may be waiting until the parliamentary elections are over to initiate structural change. For the moment, the government seems to have considerable support, which could be translated into votes essential to win the election on November 14. The idea is not to rock the boat before the election. In other words, the government may be playing it safe until the parliamentary election. If this is the case, the election results would shed more light on the government's system change plans. Failure to introduce substantial changes immediately could disappoint the JVP/NPP supporters, who expected revolutionary reforms during the presidential election. Would this disappointment damage the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election? It is unlikely because they understand the need to win the parliamentary election. However, continuing Wickremesinghe policies without substantial change, even after the election, could set off resistance from JVP’s grassroots supporters and aragalaya proponents. Therefore, the JVP/NPP government could be under pressure after the parliamentary election. Does this mean the JVP/NPP is entirely safe in the parliamentary election? It is important to note that the government encountered several issues that have the potential to reduce its votes in the parliamentary election. For example, the increasing Israeli presence in Sri Lanka has the potential to dent the Muslim votes of the JVP/NPP slightly. In November 2024, The United States and a small number of Western states publicly warned about an impending attack on Israeli tourist facilities in Sri Lanka, which, on the other hand, exposed the sudden increase of Israeli visitors and Israeli interest in Sri Lanka. The government immediately took action to protect these facilities with enhanced security arrangements to the dissatisfaction of the local Muslim population. In the 2024 presidential election, compared to other minority communities, Muslim voters favored Dissanayake. They vehemently defended and promoted Dissanayake. For example, Dissanayake won Beruwala, a Muslim region, with about 42 percent of the votes. Therefore, one cannot underestimate the Muslim support of the JVP/NPP. The Israeli issue could discourage some Muslim voters from voting for the JVP/NPP on November 14. Another issue that could potentially take some votes from the JVP/NPP column is the government’s inability to control the prices of essential commodities. Reports indicate that rice and coconut prices have skyrocketed. The government also could not reduce fuel (petrol and diesel) prices. These issues can potentially limit the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election. These issues, however, are unlikely to prevent the JVP/NPP from winning the election. Many voters in Sri Lanka currently seem to have a special relationship (based on expectations rather than satisfaction) with the JVP/NPP government. If they believe the government will eventually address their needs, they will continue voting for the JVP/NPP. On the other hand, if one translates Dissanayake’s presidential election votes to parliamentary votes, the JVP/NPP will win about 110 seats, three short of a clear majority. There is no evidence to suggest that the party has substantially increased its support base in the last month and a half. Therefore, the party is highly unlikely to win a two-thirds majority. Last week, a JVP/NPP leader declared that the party is not seeking a two-thirds majority. Perhaps the signals are clear. However, many JVP/NPP supporters and sympathizers strongly believe that the party will easily win the majority in parliament. They argue that no strong opposition exists to challenge the JVP/NPP supremacy. What is important to note is that the opposition votes could be scattered. A striking reality that many JVP/NPP supporters fail to consider is that the party won two elections (the presidential election and the Elpitiya pradeshiya sabha election) in the recent past. The JVP/NPP failed to get 50 percent of the votes in both polls. I believe that a warning shot has already been fired in the Elpitiya election because, compared to the presidential election, the JVP/NPP lost some votes in Elpitiya, and the SLPP managed to increase its share of the votes. Since the Gotabaya Rajapaksa votes transformed into Dissanayake votes in the presidential election, the Elpitiya results should worry the JVP/NPP supporters. Moreover, Elpitiya is a heavily Sinhala region. The parliamentary election includes Tamil voters, who did not prefer Dissanayake in the presidential election. The Tamils in the Northern and Eastern provinces would mostly vote for Tamil political parties. Therefore, theoretically, Sri Lanka could end up with a hung parliament on November 14.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTTsIqpsIDcPn	2024-11-09T17:07:33-08:00	
Tawhid, Torah And Three Unique Abrahamic Religions – OpEd	There are hundreds of millions of people today who have two or three self-identities. This was also true 3,500 years ago; although to a much lesser extent than today. For example, Prophet Abraham is called a Muslim in the Arabic Qur'an; and in the Hebrew Bible he is called a Hebrew [speaker] and a Babylonian immigrant who crossed the Jordan River. The term ivri (the Hebrew) first appears in the Torah, when Prophet Abraham is called 'the Hebrew: 'And it was told to Abram the Hebrew' (Genesis 14:13) Prophet Joseph uses the name Hebrew as both a geographical and an socio-ethnic term: 'I was kidnapped from the land of the ivrim' (Genesis 40:15), and 'The Egyptians would not eat with the ivrim, since that would be an abomination' (Genesis 43:32) The word Muslim is a religious identity term that refers to all faithful monotheistic believers who submit to the one and only God who created the universe. The word Hebrew is a linguistic, geographical and ethnic identity term like German [a language], Germany{a country] and Germans [a people]. The word descendent is a biological inherited birth identity term like nobility or tribe. Islam is a religion designed by God to overcome all other self-identities: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you (into) peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.' (Quran 49:13) 'Once all humans were but a single community; then they disagreed (formulating different beliefs and rites). Had it not been that your Lord had already so ordained, a decisive judgement would have been made regarding (the truth of) their disagreements.' (Qur'an 10:19) In those generations all human communities created different religions of their own with different creeds and ways. Now, if you desire that Allah Himself should uncover the truth and present it to you to enable you to decide which religion is the true one, you should know that this will not be done in this lifetime, because God now requires you to decide this yourself by using your own intelligence and your moral kindness. This worldly life is a trial to see whether or not you yourselves recognize truth by competing in doing acts of kindness, toleration and welcoming others who are different into your lands. This is why the Qur'an declares: 'Let there be no compulsion in Religion: truth stands out clear from error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah (one God) has grasped the most trustworthy unbreakable hand hold: Allah hears, and knows all things.' (2:256) The three Abrahamic religions; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are closer to each other than each of them is to any non-Abrahamic religion. Yet each of the three religions is very unique; and each relates to the other two in its own unique way. 'And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good; and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.' (4:125) There could be no Christians before the birth of Jesus; and although there have been many hanif muslim monotheists, they could not be members of the Muslim Umma prior to the revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad. Judaism is unique because the Jewish People actually proceeded the Jewish religion. Thus Qur'an 3.67 states: Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was one pure of faith and a muslim (submitting to the one God). He was never of those who associate partners with God.' Abraham could not be a Jew or a Christian, because both the Torah and Gospel were revealed centuries after Abraham. Historically, Judaism and Christianity are the names given to the religions revealed to Prophet Moses and Prophet Jesus, respectively by their faithful followers. The diversity among mankind mentioned in Qur'an 49:13 is mentioned with a comprehensive affirmation that its purpose is that different groups and individuals were enabled to learn to know each other. This point is underlined in several verses teaching that diversity in ethnicity, colour, faith and culture was intended by the Creator: 'If God had so willed, He would have made you one community, but He wanted to test you through that which He has given you. (5:48) 'If your Lord had pleased, He would have made all people a single community, but they continue to have their differences. (11:118–19) And 'Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed. So can you [Prophet Muhammad] compel people to believe? (10:99) Among attributes most American Jews consider essential to being Jewish, 82% say caring about Israel, with 58% saying that they feel attached to the nation of Israel; 76% say remembering the Holocaust; 72% say leading an ethical life; and 59% say working for justice and equality. Jews do have many names to self-identify because they have been immigrants for a little more than half of their 36-7 centuries of Jewish history. Even more important, by God's design Prophet Abraham's biological descendants through Isaac and Jacob became the first ongoing monotheistic community to last to this very day. 'And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – those of strength and [religious] vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [the 'safe haven' Land of Israel]. And indeed they are to Us among the chosen and outstanding.' (Qur'an 38:45-7) The Christian community and the Muslim Umma were formed by those individuals who became faithful believers in the Gospel or the Qur'an. But the Banu Israel-the Jewish People only received the Torah after several generations of oppression in Egypt, when the Jewish People escaped and stood at Mount Sinai and received the Torah from Prophets Moses and Aaron. This is why the history of the People of Israel Hebrews makes up such a large place in the Hebrew Bible. Indeed, the name 'Israel' is mentioned 2,319 individual times in the Hebrew Bible because the historical experiences of the nation of Israel (the descendants of Jacob/Israel) is the central focus of most of the books in the Hebrew Scriptures. As the Qur'an states: 'And We certainty settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement [Israel] and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them. So your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. So if you [Muhammad] are in doubt, about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (Qur'an 10:93-4) Judaism, as the abstract term is understood today, did not exist. There was not even a word for 'religion' in any traditional Jewish language. Rather, what we call 'Judaism' today was generally understood as a complex amalgam of religious belief, practice, and national/ethnic identification. That view prevailed in many Jewish circles until modern times and is best exemplified in the Biblical Book of Ruth. Ruth clearly states that she identifies first with the people of her mother-in-law Naomi, and only after that with Naomi's God (1:16). In other words, Ruth was adopted into the Jewish people first because of her identification with the Jewish people, followed by her attachment to the God of Israel. Ruth's oath is still stated by converts today: Ruth replied, 'Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.' (Ruth 1:16-17) Although most Jews share a common gene pool, they are not a race because any non-Jew who converts to Judaism will be recognized as being Jewish by all those rabbis who share a commitment to the same denomination of Judaism as the rabbi who did the conversion. But what about the Jewish law that defines a Jew as anyone who is born of a Jewish mother. Isn't this evidence of Jewish racial thought? For Christians, who believe that only adult baptism as a result of personal belief (Protestant), or infant/child baptism by an authorized church sacrament (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) makes one a Christian, it seems strange that children of any Jewish mother, religious or not, are Jewish; even if the father was not Jewish and the children know little or nothing about Jewish beliefs. But Muslim law says the same thing for the male gender: children of any Muslim father are Muslim, even if the mother was not Muslim; and Muslims are clearly not racist. In truth, Christianity is an unusually disembodied religion compared to Judaism, Islam and many eastern religions, and there is no reason other religions should be equally disconnected from the ethnic body of their original believers. When it comes to Jews who are non-religious or even anti-religious, they are considered secular or cultural Jews, unless they as adults convert to another religion. Like most nations, Jews have a national language, a shared history, which is much longer than most nations, and a style of cooking and thinking that is as distinctive as that of many other nations. But the Jewish People is a very unusual kind of nation: a transnational mobile nation; what Russian Communists used to call 'unrooted cosmopolitans'. From the very beginning. when Abraham and Sarah left their families and homeland to immigrate to the Land of Israel, the majority of the Jewish People has been subject to major geographic relocations. What the Jewish People have lacked for most of their 3,500 year history was an independent Jewish State located in one geographical area. However, states come and go (Yugoslavia) and go and come (Poland and Israel) so having a state, and a stable territorial location, is not in the Jewish experience, the most important aspect of being a nation. Being a faithful part of the Jewish community in terms of group connection and religious action is more central to being Jewish than adhering to credal statements. That is why the majority of Jews do not view 'Jews for Jesus' or Messianic Jews as belonging to the Jewish community. The answer to the question of what are Jews is that Judaism and the Jewish People are so deeply intertwined they cannot and should not be separated. Individuals Jews act in all kinds of ways, but the historical community of Jews is a blend of Jews by birth (genes) and Jews by belief, behavior and belonging. As anyone who has visited present day Israel knows, Jews come in many shades and looks. This is because even in the diaspora, and even against the will of the ruling religious authorities, Jews have almost always, when they were free to do so, proselytized their neighbors, and quietly welcomed converts into the Jewish community, even against the formal rules of medieval rabbis. That is why most Jews in different geographical locations tend to look similar to the local majority after a few centuries. This could not happen without significant marriage with converts to Judaism. The rabbinical rule that one should not refer to any Jew's convert status is evidence of the desire of Jewish leaders to keep Jewish proselytizing activities hidden from the ruling non-Jewish religious authorities. Yet from the very beginning converts to Judaism and their genes, have entered the Jewish gene pool. In the west today many converts are descendants of ex-Jews from previous generations who are now returning to the Jewish People, and bringing home some lost Jewish genes; as well as some non-Jewish genes with them. This is how it has always been to a greater or lesser extant. Thus it is clear that Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people because non-Jews can always enter the Jewish community, and become a part of the inter-national Jewish community.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTfw6FR-a0AHP	2024-11-09T17:01:35-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Two Sides Of The Same Coin – OpEd	For over two decades, Pakistan has been embroiled in a battle against groups that cloak their violent actions in religious rhetoric. Among the most notorious of these are TTP and ISKP. Though these groups present themselves as distinct entities, they are two sides of the same coin—both driven by a Khawariji ideology that has been declared un-Islamic by religious scholars. The relationship between TTP and ISKP goes beyond ideological alignment. While each group may superficially claim a unique identity, their origins and leadership have substantial overlap. The first leader of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was previously a well-known TTP commander from Pakistan’s Orakzai agency. This connection extends beyond individual members; TTP and ISKP share personnel, tactics, targets, and objectives, leading experts to believe that they are, in essence, two fronts of the same battle against Pakistan. The nexus between these groups extends to their operations and resources. Both TTP and ISKP have found refuge in Afghanistan, where they enjoy safe havens free from conflict with one another, despite their alleged rivalry. While ISKP openly criticizes the Afghan Taliban and has clashed with them physically, it maintains a strangely neutral or even supportive stance toward TTP. This relationship suggests that ISKP and TTP are cooperating at some level, creating a perception that TTP may be using ISKP to deceive and divide Pakistani authorities and the public. The ideological foundation of both TTP and ISKP can be traced back to Khawarijism, a sect that emerged in early Islamic history and was known for its extreme and uncompromising views. The Khawariji ideology advocates the use of violence against Muslims who do not adhere to their narrow interpretation of Islam, labeling them as infidels. This ideology has been denounced by Islamic scholars around the world, including those in Pakistan, who have deemed it un-Islamic and 'haram' (forbidden). The Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, endorsed by Pakistani scholars from various sects, specifically condemns the actions of groups like TTP and ISKP as haram, asserting that armed struggle within Pakistan is fundamentally against Islamic principles. Yet, TTP and ISKP continue to exploit religion to radicalize young, impressionable minds. They employ twisted interpretations of Islamic teachings to justify heinous acts of terrorism, targeting civilians, religious scholars, mosques, and schools. While these groups claim to fight in the name of Islam, their actions reveal the opposite. They engage in acts of brutality that Islam explicitly condemns, including suicide bombings, which are forbidden in Islamic jurisprudence. Their manipulation of youth into carrying out suicide missions further highlights the hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy of their cause; while young recruits are encouraged to sacrifice their lives, the leaders of these groups rarely, if ever, take such risks themselves. Another factor that binds TTP and ISKP is their role as foreign proxies. Their operational activities and financial resources are largely derived from external sources that have vested interests in destabilizing Pakistan. These foreign backers use these groups to further their own agendas, effectively making TTP and ISKP puppets in a larger geopolitical game. This aspect of their existence further distances them from any legitimate claim to Islamic principles, revealing their true motivations: serving foreign powers rather than pursuing any genuine religious or nationalistic cause. Both TTP and ISKP have been linked to foreign intelligence agencies, which use them to create unrest and destabilize Pakistan. By attacking both civilian and military targets within Pakistan, they attempt to sow fear, undermine public morale, and create an environment of instability. Their continuous efforts to destabilize Pakistan serve only to benefit their foreign handlers, further highlighting the role of these groups as pawns in a broader regional struggle. While TTP and ISKP may appear to target different groups, this distinction is strategic rather than genuine. TTP focuses on security forces, claiming its attacks as part of a 'legitimate' struggle, while ISKP has been known to attack religious gatherings, mosques, and scholars. This tactic serves to deflect public anger from TTP by allowing ISKP to take the blame for civilian-targeted violence. In this way, the TTP presents itself as a group focused solely on attacking state security apparatuses, while ISKP assumes the role of attacking 'soft' targets like religious institutions. This tactic of 'good cop, bad cop' allows them to maintain public confusion, diminishing a unified response against their terrorism. Furthermore, the TTP’s use of ISKP as a proxy allows them to deflect blame and manage public backlash in Pakistan. Whenever a particularly heinous act of terrorism occurs, ISKP often claims responsibility, distancing TTP from the outrage and condemnation that follows. This tactical divide is evidence of their strategic collaboration, and it underscores their shared goal of destabilizing Pakistan through different methods of terror. In sum, TTP and ISKP are two sides of the same coin, sharing a common Khawariji ideology and serving foreign interests in their campaign of terror against Pakistan. Their superficial distinctions are a tactical ploy to deceive the public and divert attention from their unified goal: the destabilization of Pakistan through un-Islamic acts of violence. The only way forward is a combined effort from Pakistan’s government, military, and religious scholars to expose these groups for what they are—agents of destruction who have no legitimate claim to Islam or its teachings. By building on the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa and fostering public awareness, Pakistan can work towards eradicating these threats and securing a peaceful future for all its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXOOsbhUF-0y	2024-11-09T16:41:14-08:00	
Bangladesh: The Evil That Was The Behemoth Hasina And Her Gargant...	Shakespeare’s King Lear which, critics think, begins with a climax with the old and frail Lear already falling as he divides his kingdom among his three daughters in the very first scene. Similarly, horrible Hasina’s bloody regime already began to crumble with a climax early on (BDR massacre on 25-26 February 2009), only to end with another climax, the massacre of July-August 2024. This is not to speak of her countless other beastly atrocities and brutal acts of repression committed during more than a decade and a half in between. The almost long 16 years saw the inferno of the monstrous dictator’s barbaric mafia misrule. The carnival of her harrowing tales of oppression reached the finish line in July-August 2024 when the tables were finally turned on her and she, like many other dictators in modern history, had to flee the country for her life on 5 August. Just a few days before, on 23 July, the New York Times reported that 'An unbending leader’s crackdown rains carnage on Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s response to protests has left at least 150 people dead and created the biggest challenge yet to her grip on power.' On 29 July when her bloodthirsty crackdown on the popular students-people uprising was still going on with increasing intensity, (Ret) Col Mohammad Abdul Hoque, one of the best social media influencers, did one of his finest videos in support of the uprising. Many of those young and teenage school and college and university students, along with many nonstudent members of the public were already killed in hundreds, probably over a thousand all across Bangladesh. Although most of the major parties’ participation, including the BNP, was very half-hearted, far below the expectation of the nation, many writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were highly encouraging and inspiring about the July-August Chatro Janata uprising that finally got the army on their side providing the most crucial help they needed. The works of the writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were making a significant contribution to the moral, ethical and political reconstruction of Bangladesh and should therefore provide the building blocks in the progress of the foundation of the nation after the Awami destruction of it. All Bangladesh governments, including the present (interim) one and those to come in the future, may benefit from their patriotic and enlightening ideas. All such governments, now and later, should stay, as the majority of those writers and speakers clearly convey, rooted and anchored in Islam and Muslim identity—the identity of the vast majority of the country with justice, safety, peace and security ensured for all, regardless of caste and creed. Unfortunately, fascist Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) was a massively and monstrously Modi-fied ruling machine defrauding the nation right and left all the way. It was so horrendous in its oppression and so highly and hugely Hindu-spirited in its mafia political culture that it has justifiably acquired the humiliating acronym of BAL over the years of its awfully authoritarian rule. That acronym is just an abbreviation of the full name of the party with no cultural connotation or expletive implied. It’s like the last name ‘Chuppu’ of Hasina-appointed ‘President’ Shahabuddin (who rose through filthy and fishy means). চোরের মনে পুলিশ পুলিশ, যারা চুরি করে তাদের মনে সবসময় ভয় থাকে। No wonder, she dropped ‘Chuppu’ from her devilishly loyalist Shahabuddin just as she dropped ‘B’ of Bangladesh from her AL and just as she dropped Bangladesh and ‘Wazed’ to India in her devilish intentions. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah describes the BAL as a party that has existed all these years without their political circumcision (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। BNP MP Rehana Akhtar Ranu’s classic চুদুর বুদুর or the BAL’s Dipu Modi’s নিষিদ্ধ পল্লীর ভাষা (language of the red light district), both told in the parliament in 2013, still rings funny with a hullabaloo. Donald Trump, famous for sharply ridiculing his political opponents by referring to their names, would have attacked the BAL the same way. Almost 16 years of Hasina regime leading up to July-August 2024 were a time of radical opposites and contrasts representing the forces of good and evil--fascist bondage, on the one hand, and freedom and liberation, on the other. As Dickens’s novel A Tale of Two Cities (London and Paris) begins with a famous juxtaposition of a series of paradoxes, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ….' Dictator Hasina, dubbed a cruel canine crime minister and sadistic she-hyena prime monster, fell a sudden fall on 5 August only to flee away to her evil and egregious political backer India. Well-known journalist Masood Kamal rightly suggests: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' Barrister Fuaad Abdullah is just brilliant in talking about the need of embargo/moratorium to be imposed on the ‘uncircumcised’ BAL and Sheikh family/dynasty (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। Even after Awami RakkhiBahini’s widespread killings and widespread Awami corruption during Mujib’s not too long reign, they were allowed to walk away without their ‘circumcision’ being complete. They made a comeback in 1996 and again in late 2008. In the words of self-employed Bangladeshi-Canadian A K Delwar Hussain, son of A K Rafiqul Hussain, second Joint Secretary of the then Awami Muslim League in the 1950s, '২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনের ঠিক আগে পরে বাংলাদেশের জয়-বাংলা ব্যবস্থা একটি পরিকল্পনা, সমন্বয় এবং সতর্কতার সাথে বাস্তবায়নের মাধ্যমে BAL এর ক্ষমতায় ফিরে আসার আয়োজন করা হয়েছিল! বাংলাদেশ সশস্ত্র বাহিনীর মূল অংশে আঘাত করে BALএর ষোল বছরের অশুভ যাত্রা শুরু হয়।আমাদের নিরাপত্তা, সার্বভৌমত্ব, সম্মান এবং গর্ব --আমাদের প্রিয় বাংলাদেশের সশস্ত্র বাহিনীকে কেন্দ্র করে ‘মিউটিনি ফর দ্য বাউন্টি'র’ লক্ষ্য করা হয়েছিল। ৫৭ জন অত্যন্ত বীর ও অভিজ্ঞ অফিসারকে অসহায়ভাবে হত্যা করা হয়। যারা এই মর্মান্তিক ঘটনা ঘটিয়েছে তাদের চুল-চেরা বিচার ও শাস্তি ছাড়া জাতি স্বস্তিতে থাকতে পারে না।' This is the voice of reason, voice of Bangladesh. To continue with Hasina the Terrible and her Awami fascists, India is the hiding place of the horrible hyena Hasina (1975-1981, 2024-?). It is also a communal, fanatical and fundamentalist Hindutva country, especially under the BJP-RSS Narendra Modi, known as the 'Butcher of Gujarat', ever hostile and inimical to Bangladesh and the Muslims of his own country. So, 'That is no country' (meaning India here) for patriotic Bangladeshis, regardless of their caste and creed. The quoted phrase is the opening words of W B Yeats’s 'Sailing to Byzantium' that makes an indirect reference to the poet’s country of birth Ireland. It was on 5 August that a 'terrible beauty was born', to borrow the classic oxymoron, again, from Yeats ('Easter 1916'), following an unprecedented bloodshed and genocidal violence starting from around 15-18 July. There was hardly any news leaked then in ​the state-controlled mass media. It was a media running in the heinous Hasina’s Dracula-and-Gestapo-style police and prison state of absolute authoritarianism. The recent spate of chaos and turmoil​--inhuman, blood-clotting, and heartbreaking​ as it was--started when ordinary students from all levels –schools, colleges, and universities--demanded that the ridiculously biased​ and discriminatory job quotas​ (intended for the utterly toxic and autocratic Hasina’s men of crooked and canine loyalty) be done away with so that the​ graduated or graduating students' fair share of jobs and job opportunities based on merit could be ensured and made available to them. But the call for their more than just and fair cause fell on ​the deaf ears of the hooded and horrible Hasina. Awfully authoritarian Hasina has entirely destroyed all kinds of human rights, civil rights, constitutional rights, and individual rights, there being no space for freedom of speech available, no scope for democratic dissent left, no room for free and fair electoral culture remaining and no ‘privilege’ for any opposition politics whatsoever under cultivation. Horrendous Hasina’s fascist ​one-party rule was a rule of ​nepotism, favoritism, cronyism, division, bondage, and state terrorism​ that had no limits during the last sixteen years. She was bent upon eliminating and annihilating the entire range of social justice and rule of law. To repeat after Fyodor Dostoevsky (in his The Brothers Karamazov), she thought that when there was no God (in her case, absence of strong political opposition), everything nefarious, notorious, and anarchically nihilistic was possible. In her enormously gargantuan appetite for power and corruption, she thought, as the French emperor Louis IV did, she was the state. Backed by India with which Hasina, by admission of her own foreign minister, developed a ’husband-wife’ relationship and also agreed to by politicians like Dr Col Oli Ahmad (not to speak of the alleged or fake rumours of her father’s origin of birth), she was gloating in glee in exercising her sole and absolute dictatorial authority and total grip on power. The latest round of slaughter by the ​hooded and hissing Hasina and her canine police was unleashed ​on young protesters from 15-18 July onwards and was still continuing through 5 August. They suddenly lost their tender lives and got their blooming dreams nipped in the bud. The number of casualties stood at least in hundreds (over one thousand killed and many more critically injured and dismembered), even if one goes by the most conservative estimate. No wonder, journalist Masud Kamal says: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' As the nation has noticed, those few days, especially since 18 July, were as dark and black as those of her bloody and beastly massacres before, one after another and also those of her father in the past, not too long after the birth of Bangladesh. In fact, the father-daughter duo’s days were doomed and dotted (one can’t miss them!) with some of the darkest and blackest and bloodiest in ​the history ​of the nation. Weeks and days of July (and to continue into early August) saw the entire count​ry immersed and engulfed in the loud and legitimate protest cries that were abruptly quelled by live bullets and deafening sound grenades from tanks and armored vehicles of the police (and later some isolated cases from the army too) descending like locusts and vultures on Dhaka streets. The country just witness​ed a wild carnage of school children, college and university students, small boys and girls, and innocent men and women on the​ir rooftops and by the side of their windows at home. That was the latest ​and ugliest manifestation of the idiotically fascist Hasina’s police rule behind the iron curtain she ​established since 2009. In July 2024 the country was bleeding from a brutal crackdown under the darkness of a nationwide curfew when there was a total internet shutdown and complete news blackout imposed by ​illegal, illegitimate and unelected Hasina killing hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed student protesters and the supporting members of the public. The nation is well aware that Hasina came to power in late 2008 for the second time through Indian-orchestrated foul means and was clinging to power since then by using all tools and means available to her in the state machinery—police, army, judiciary and the parliament​. Her cynical and manipulative tactics found ways to bend​ and twist all those ​presumably position hungry and/or ‘willing’ offices and institutions to her personal favor​ and ​her self-serving whim​s and caprices. ​In addition to police and paramilitary forces like RAB and BGB, autocratic Hasina was letting her party cadres armed with lethal weapons to ​ruthlessly assault and suppress the people ​in a deadly manner. By the force of her sheer and sordid authoritarian power, she held sham​ and shoddy​ and shadowy ​and ghostly ‘elections’-cum-selection​s again and again with the people indiscriminately killed and cowed down by her police, RAB and party operatives and apparatchiks. Dictator Hasina had her intelligence, administration and ‘law enforcement’ but actually lawless agents take away the freedom of press and freedom of expression; do blanket detentions, widespread repression, and enforced disappearances; commit rampant human rights violations and indiscriminate murders, and file millions of fake and baseless and harassing court cases against dissenting leaders, activists, journalists, writers, and thinkers, thus completely wiping out the whole range of democratic opposition consisting of numerous parties, big and small, major and minor. Never accountable to anyone, Hasina and her men were widely known to have been involved in massive loot and plunder from bank heists, foreign loans, mega projects, state coffers and state budgets in the name of so-called development, a mirage for the majority facing a complete moral, political, educational and economic decline and deterioration. All this oppression and repression was done by the horribly authoritarian Hasina with the help of her blind puppets and flatterers deployed in all the branches of the government during the last 16 years and also with the help of the government of her dark and evil allies in the neighbouring country. All this was also possible to a great extent by the fact that there was no strong and effective challenge coming from the political opposition. The major party, BNP, highly popular though it was, has been rendered weak and useless, primarily at the top level, due to the regime’s ongoing persecution and prosecution. The top ranks of the party were/are also ideologically lost and floundering, suffering from lack of worthy leadership. Many supporters and sympathizers accuse them of being ignorant, incompetent, compromising, uncommitted, opportunist, and hypocritical, widely rumored to be involved in demoralizing favoritism, nepotism, extortion scams and lucrative ‘businesses’ related to nomination, appointment and committee memberships at every level, from top to bottom. As mentioned at the outset, that was how the Hasina government recently attempted to 5suppress, with dastardly and despicable heavy-handedness, a great and just historic movement -- a movement of memorably 'terrible beauty' -- by millions of students and other people together demanding that the very unjust and unfair quota system for government jobs be scrapped. The evil quota system had earlier been in practice for many years, then dropped in the face of student protest a couple of years ago, then was reintroduced again in July (until it would be gone only after this most unwanted mass slaughter) by the autocratic and unelected government—as fascist and totalitarian as one could imagine, corrupt and rotten to the core. In the quota system, nearly 60% jobs were reserved for the government supporters and sycophants, their crooks and conmen and their dolts and dullards in the guise of different but deceiving, hoodwinking, dust-throwing and eye-washing categories with no true opportunities for merit-and-competition-based selection process. As a result, millions of students and other eligible job seekers found their future to be blank and bleak, and dark and dreary with no real hope and prospect for their dreams to come true. As Bangladesh knows, the Awami government was extremely fetid and fascist. It was intolerably and obnoxiously so since early 2009. Since then, hundreds and thousands of people, including political leaders and activists and journalists, were mercilessly killed and beaten and tortured to death. Since then, not to speak of those perpetrated before by the same party known for their notoriously nihilistic oppression, there were brutal and beastly massacre after massacre--Arson attack on double decker public bus near Hotel Sheraton (4 June 2004); Logi Boitha (Boat Hook and Oar) massacre on 28 October 2006; BDR massacre (25-26 February 2009; Hefazat massacre (5 May 2013); Jamaat-Shibir massacre (17 December 2013; and countless other killings by the Hasina regime throughout the last 16 years. Since 2009, there were hundreds and thousands of premeditated political murders, killings, kidnappings, and enforced disappearances by the Hasina police, Indian-infiltrated Hasina DGFI, and Hasina’s party thugs in separate, yet connected incidents, which became a regular phenomenon of repression made possible by direct state terrorism unleashed by Hasina and her henchmen. Since then, there were thousands and thousands of detentions, including those inmates in the dark dungeon AinaGhor, inhumanly tortuous remands and deadly beatings and incarceration in jail, many dying or getting critically injured due to police brutality while in custody or in open public places. Last two weeks of July and the first few days of August were no different when hundreds and thousands of protesting students and ordinary people joining together in solidarity were being maimed, wounded and shot to death with machetes and live bullets on the streets and even in their homes – bullets coming from the helicopters flying overhead and also the tanks and armored vehicles deceptively carrying the UN signs and logos. All concerned worldwide were then requested to bring that plight and predicament of the people of Bangladesh to the attention of the freedom-loving international news and human rights organizations and ask their respective governments to take necessary punitive and punishing measures against the almost two decades-old Awami regime that had brought the nation of 175 million people to their knees during the regime’s iron-fisted muscle-powered mafia rule of malicious intent for that long duration. All concerned also took the opportunity to sincerely urge the democracy-loving international entities and authorities to take steps to force that utterly obnoxious regime headed by Hasina the Horrible to go. Time was long overdue then to force a regime change with Hasina caught, detained, handcuffed, chained, remanded, imprisoned and brought to justice. Time was overdue to bring to power a third party of honest and committed people drawn from selected politicians, academics, intellectuals, journalists, political analysts and other professionals. We the people of Bangladesh needed the help of Chatro Janata (political parties failing), America and the West to achieve this democratic, patriotic and nationalist goal to save our country from the clutches of a ferociously fascist regime led by Hasina the Horrible, far worse than Hitler, Namroud (Nimrod) and Feraoon (Pharoah)! Thank God the country would be free on 5 August! Post-5 August unacceptable role of the BNP However, it’s unfortunate that the BNP, under its present incompetent leadership, has been playing a mew-mew cowardly and compromising role despite being a target of nonstop ruthless oppression by the fascistically strong BAL. Cowed down by its RAW-BAL-engendered B-team-like ineptitude and inability, BNP has been drifting and deviating far, for well over a decade, from the patriotic, nationalist, pro-Islam, and pro-Bangladesh ideals and legacies of their party’s great and glorious founder late President Ziaur Rahman and then the stellar and spectacular Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. Not only that, they, including her treacherously selfish son, never fought for Begum Zia and against the injustice she suffered for years. It is in this context that the BNP’s Standing Committee Member (Ret) Maj Hafizuddin Ahmad Bir Bikram has recently hurled blistering criticism of the horrible Hasina BAL, praising the students-people movement and vilifying those (maybe some of his own party!), who are shamelessly compromising with the fascist Hasina and her party associates consisting of mafia gangs and goons and hoodlums and hooligans. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah was also brilliant in asking for the political dialysis for the endlessly corrupt and criminal Hasina BAL whose ‘kidney’ (in metaphorical sense) has gone extremely bad. At the same time he also took to task those people and parties (perhaps implying the hopelessly useless BNP leaders like Mirza Fakhrul), who are still trying to play civil and sympathetic to the Hasina BAL. In the name of being so-called civil/সুশীল to the fascist BAL, Mirzas and Fakhruls of the BNP also have become indistinguishable from the forces of Hasina, as Fuaad Abdullah claims. Those who are stupid to the extent of being shamefully soft and weak and compromising with the hugely Modi-fied and highly Hinduized Hasina BAL need to be kicked out immediately. Committing perfidy, they are traitors and betrayers to Zia’s and Begum Zia’s ideals and legacies and thereby to the people of the whole country, who suffered indescribably hard in the hands of the Indianized fascist Hasina BAL. (Ret) Maj Delwar Hussain rightly attacks the mew-mew Mirza Fakhrul. এই প্রসঙ্গে আরো বলতে হয়, এই বিএনপি অমর ও মহান জিয়া ও বেগম জিয়ার আদর্শের দল নয়। অনেকে বলে থাকেন এই বিএনপি ও বাল (BAL) একই মুদ্রার এপিঠ এপিঠ। এই বিএনপির বড় ছোট বিভিন্ন পর্যায়ের অনেকই RAW Mathur India-controlled অযোগ্য, চাঁদাবাজ দখলবাজ, দুর্নীতিপরায়ন, আপোষকামী।এই বিএনপি আবার কখন কোথায় আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করলো? তাদের লক্ষ লক্ষ লোক থাকা সত্তেও তেনারা হাসিনাকে নামাতে পারে নাই। RAW India-controlled and compromising, তেনারা মুজিব-হাসিনার মতই রাজপথ থেকে বার বার পালিয়েছেন। তেনারা যদি লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের দিকে এগিয়ে যেতেন হাসিনা অনেক আগেইতো পড়ে যেত। হয়তো কিছু লোক মারা যেত। তেনাদের নয়াপলটন বা আরামবাগে সীমাবদ্ধ আন্দোলন ছিল লোকদেখানো। আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করেছেন ছাত্র জনতা আর দুই GOP। তেনাদের নেতৃত্ব ছুটে যাবে এই আশংকায় ও আপোষকামীতার কারনে তেনারা লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে ঘরে বসেছিলেন। তেনারা তেমন শক্ত করে ডাকও দেননি ঝাঁপিয়েও পড়েননি। দায়সারা গোছের ডাক। ভারতিয় সৈন্যরা যেমন ১৯৭১-এ একদম শেষের দিকে যোগ দিয়েছেন বিনপিও ছাত্র জনতার আন্দোলনে একদম শেষের দিকে কিছুটা হয়তো ছুটে গিয়েছেন। যদি তেনারা জুলাই ১৫ থেকে ইনিয়ে বিনিয়ে যোগ দেয়ার কথা না বলে সমস্ত শক্তি দিয়ে ঝাঁপিয়ে পড়তেন তাহলে হাজার লোকের প্রানহানি হতনা হাজার লোকের অঙ্গহানি হতোনা। কাজটা করলেন ছাত্রজনতা ও GOP উভয় গ্রুপ আর কৃতিত্ব নিতে চাচ্ছেন BNP-র তেনারা। তড়িঘড়ি করে নির্বাচন করে ক্ষমতায় এসে ফাযদা লুটতে চাচ্ছেন। আমরা চাই বর্তমান ইউনুস সরকার অনেক দিন শাসন করুক এবং সব সংস্কার শেষ করুক এবং দেশকে RAW BAL মুক্ত করুক। জুলাই আগস্ট বিপ্লব শুধু তথাকথিত সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠতার জোরে বিএনপির মত অথর্ব অয়োগ্য ভুয়া ভাঁওতাবাজ অকর্মক দলকে ক্ষমতায় আনার জন্য হয়নি। আমরা BAL-এর মতো BNP-র ও tyranny of the majority চাইনা অথবা দুই পার্টি মিলে মিশে সন্ত্রাস চুরি বাটপারি করে যাবে সেটাও চাইনা। আওয়ামী বালকেতো নিষিদ্ধিই করতে হবে। দেশে ইসলামী মনোভাবসম্পন্ন দেশপ্রেমিক অনেক পার্টি আছে। সবার ক্ষমতার অংশীদার হয়ে দেশের উন্নয়নে অবদান রাখুক সেটাই চাই। আবার হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের মতো কুখ্যাত হাওয়া ভবনের সাথে যারা জড়িত ছিল অথবা তাদের মতো অসাধু এবং অনুপযুক্ত বা আওয়ামী যুক্ত যারা লন্ডনে তারেক রহমান সাহেবকে ১৫ বছর ধরে ঘিরে আছেন এমন লোকদের উত্থান বা পূণর্বাসন চাইনা (শুধু এম এ মালেক একটু ব্যতিক্রম হতে পারেন)। অথচ তিনি তাদের সঙ্গ ছাড়ছেননা যেমন তিনি ঢাকা থেকে শুরু করে লন্ডন পর্যন্ত RAW Mathur-কেও ছাড়েননি। । ১৫ বছর ধরে তিনি লন্ডনে কোন উচ্চ শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের দোরগোড়ায়ও যাননি। দুঃখের বিষয় উনার শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা ছোটবেলা থেকেই প্রশ্নবিদ্ধ। Enlightened intellectual Azam Mahmud is correct to say that 'মূলত বিএনপি এবং আওয়ামী লীগের ভিতরে তেমন কোন পার্থক্য নাই। দুটোরই বেশিরভাগ বড়-ছোট নেতা সমানভাবে পরিত্যাজ্য। এবং এই অতি ঘৃণ্য এবং অতি নিকৃষ্ট মহিলাকে বাদ দিলে তারা আসলে একই। পরস্পরের প্রতি সত্যিকারের সম্মানবোধ তাদের খুব একটা কখনোই ছিলো না। আর এই মহিলা যখন তার অন্তর ভরা বিষ এবং বিদ্বেষ নিয়ে সামনে আসলো, রাজনীতিবিদদের স্বভাবজাত সম্মান বোধের ঘাটতির কারণে তখন তার দলের অন্যেরাও (নিজস্ব স্বার্থ রক্ষার খাতিরেই) তার সাথে তাল মিলালো। ফলে একটা ভয়াবহ এবং অতি জঘন্য পরিবেশ এবং পরিস্থিতির উদ্ভব হলো। তার অবর্তমানে বিদ্বেষ টুকু যদি কেটে যায়, তারা আগে যেমন *খারাপ ভাবে* চলছিল তেমনি চলতে থাকবে।' People of Bangladesh think that the BNP’s appeasement of the BAL and India is tantamount to national treachery. That’s the view subscribed to by A K Delwar Hussain (identified above), who states that 'At the same time, BNP has played a foul sinister game along with the Awami Bha-RAT-io League in the past 16 years!!! BNP is the very reason by which the BAL perpetrated its ruthless mafia regime over Bangladesh. ‘চোরে চোরে হালি/এক চোরে বিয়া করে/আরেক চোরের শালি’. In hindsight, since Hasina's vacation to her BhaRAT, the role of the BNP has surfaced clearly, particularly through Mirza Fakhrul (whom Donald Trump, J D Vance and Elon Musk would have targeted as ‘fool’ and ‘trash’ and perhaps belittled as Mirza-Far Fake-Rule), Mirza Abbas (same as Fakhrul), Habibur Rahman Ya Habibi, Ya Rumman Farhana and others.' It’s the same view subscribed to by the veteran and highly knowledgeable Bangladeshi-British online activist and campaigner Zoglul Husain, who has this to say: 'স্বাধীনতা ও অর্থনৈতিক মুক্তির জন্য আজ আমাদের জাতীয় করনীয় হচ্ছে, ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদকে সম্পূর্ণ পরাভূত করা এবং একটি দেশপ্রেমিক ও গণতান্ত্রিক সরকার প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। বর্তমান বিএনপি সহ যে সব দল ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ ও আওয়ামী ফ্যাসিবাদের কাছে নতজানু রয়েছে, এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগকে তোষণ করে চলেছে, তাদের উচিত আত্মশুদ্ধি করা এবং ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে দৃঢ় অবস্থান নেওয়া, তা নাহলে তারা জাতীয় বিশ্বাসঘাতকতার ভূমিকাতে অবস্থান নেবে।' He takes the opportunity of the BNP’s 7 November observation this year (2024) to criticize the party’s ungrateful forgetfulness towards the 15 August heroes asking the Interim Government to withdraw all unjust lawsuits against them and allow them to walk free --- আজ, ৮ নভেম্বর ২০২৪, ঢাকার নয়াপল্টনে বিশাল মিছিল ও র‍্যালি করে বিকাল ৩ টা থেকে বিএনপি, ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর স্মরণে, বিপ্লব ও সংহতি দিবস উদযাপন করছে। কিন্তু, লক্ষ্য করার বিষয়, সেখানে ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান সম্বন্ধে কোন উচ্চবাচ্চ্য নেই। বলা বাহুল্য, ১৯৭৫ এর ১৫ আগস্ট, ৩ নভেম্বর ও ৭ নভেম্বর এক সূত্রে গাঁথা, ১৫ আগস্টের অভ্যুত্থান ৭ নভেম্বরে সম্পন্ন হয়। কাজেই, ১৫ আগস্টের গৌরবজনক অভ্যুত্থানের কথা ভুলে গিয়ে ৭ নভেম্বর উদযাপনে রয়েছে বিশাল ঘাটতি ও অসংগতি। এর কারণ বিএনপির অনেক বড় বড় নেতা আছেন যারা এখনও মুজিবভক্ত। অথচ মুজিব ছিলেন একজন ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, যিনি কখনো স্বাধীনতা চান নি, কিন্তু ক্ষমতায় এসেই যিনি ভারতের সঙ্গে মৈত্রী ও বন্ধুত্ব নামক ২৫ বছরের গোলামী চুক্তি করেছিলেন, ভারতের তৈরি রক্ষী বাহিনী দিয়ে ৩০ থেকে ৫০ হাজার দেশপ্রেমিক হত্যা করেছিলেন, সীমাহীন দুর্নীতি ও সীমান্ত পাচারের মাধ্যমে মানবসৃষ্ট দুর্ভিক্ষ সৃষ্টি করেছিলেন যাতে মৃত্যু হয় ১৫ লক্ষ মানুষের, যিনি বাকশাল সৃষ্টি করে গণতন্ত্র ধ্বংস করেছিলেন এবং যিনি জনগণের উপর হত্যা, নির্যাতন, নিপীড়নের স্টিমরোলার চালিয়ে জনগণের জীবন দুর্বিষহ করেছিলেন, আওয়ামী-ভারতীয় সীমাহীন লুণ্ঠনে দেশটিকে ঝাঁঝরা করেছিলেন এবং ভারতের কাছে স্বাধীনতা-সার্বভৌমত্ব বিকিয়ে দিয়ে বাংলাদেশকে ভারতের অধীন করেছিলেন, দেশকে ধ্বংসের অতল গহ্বরে ঠেলে দিয়েছিলেন। তখন দেশকে রক্ষা করেছিল ১৫ আগস্ট ও ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর বিষয়ে সেই সব বিএনপি নেতা চুপ থাকেন যারা মুজিবের প্রতি নতশির এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগের প্রতি নতজানু। তারা ভুলে যান ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ না হলে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্থান হত না বিএনপিও গঠিত হত না, এবং জামায়াতে ইসলামী দলও বাংলাদেশে রাজনীতি করতে পারতনা। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান যারা করেছিলেন তারা সকলেই সূর্য সন্তান, জাতীয় বীর। কিন্তু সাড়ে তিন যুগ পর ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, মুজিব কন্যা শেখ হাসিনা প্রতিহিংসার বশবর্তী হয়ে একটি প্রহসনের বিচার ঘটিয়ে এই জাতীয় বীরদের ৬ জনকে ফাঁসিতে ঝুলান, এরা সকলেই শহীদ। এছাড়াও অনেকে আছেন যাদের বিরুদ্ধে ফাঁসী অথবা জেলের রায় বলবৎ থাকায় তারা দেশে ফিরতে পারছেন না। আমরা আজ ৫ আগস্ট ২০২৪ এর গৌরবজনক ছাত্র-জনতা-সেনা অভ্যুত্থানের সকল শহীদদের যেমন শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি, তেমনি শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর শহীদদের, ১৯৫২ র ভাষা শহীদদের, এবং স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধসহ অন্যান্য সংগ্রামের শহীদদের। আমরা অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের কাছে আবেদন জানাচ্ছি যে, ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অবস্থান নেওয়া যেসব বীরগণ, হাসিনার মিথ্যা আদালতের ফাঁসি অথবা জেলের আদেশের কারণে দেশে আসতে পারছেন না, তাদের উপর থেকে ঐসব মিথ্যা আদালতের মিথ্যা আদেশ প্রত্যাহার করা হোক। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অংশ নেওয়া সকল বীরগণকে জাতীয় বীরের মর্যাদা প্রদান করা হোক। Similarly, the following views of the decorated FF, former diplomat and author of dozens of books and articles, (Ret) Col Rashed Chowdhury also amount to the same line of argument. He comments: এটা বড়োই পরিতাপের বিষয় যে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের সৃষ্ট বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ ১৫ই আগস্টের ঐতিহাসিক অবদানকে অগ্রাহ্য বা অস্বীকার করছে। ১৫ই অগাস্ট না হলে জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্তান ঘটতোনা, বিএনপিরও জন্ম হতোনা। অর্থাৎ, জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমান, বিএনপি, বেগম জিয়া, তারেক রহমান এবং বিএনপির পূর্বাপর নেতৃশ্রেণী ১৫ ই আগস্টের ফসল। তাই ১৫ আগস্টকে অগ্রাহ্য করা মানে নিজ পিতৃত্বকে অস্বীকার করা, জারজ হিসাবে পরিচয় দেয়া। এই ঐতিহাসিক গরমিল ও ন্যাক্কারজনক পরিস্থিতি থেকে বিএনপিকে বেরিয়ে আসতে হবে এবং ঐতিহাসিক সত্যকে স্বীকার করে দেশ ও জাতিকে শুধু আস্বস্তই করতে হবে না, তাদেরকে মুক্তি দিতে হবে। নতুবা তারা দলটিকে কোনোদিন ক্ষমা করবে না। Col Chowdhury goes on commenting What is extremely unfortunate is that the present leadership of the BNP, locally headed by Mirza Fakhrul is making the life of the Interim Government (IG) difficult by continuously giving various threats and asking for a quick election. The whole nation agrees that there should not be election before necessary reforms, but Mirza wants to do the reform themselves. No way. All his threats are mostly in favor of rehabilitating the fascist Hasina regime and its disgraced Awami League. Looks like he didn't have enough of Hasina's fascism in the past 16 years and likes to bring them back to continue the same with perhaps more or increased intensity. Zia's assassination, KZ's suffering under Hasina mean nothing to him. খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে মরিয়া হয়ে উঠেছে। It's a sheer betrayal of not only the ideals of Ziaur Rahman's BNP but also the betrayal to the nation. But I believe the party's grassroots are still strong and are still following the original values enshrined by its founder. As such, I think the BNP grassroots should revolt and reject these pro-Awami, pro-Indian leadership. The BNP must return to Zia's BNP. And, let the IG continue working on its agenda of untangling the knots created by the fascists. I would say, the BNP of today was not so in Zia’s time.Mirza Fakhrul, by extension, maybe TR too, is displaying his pro-Awami, pro-Indian attitude more openly. To me, he is becoming a nuisance, to the extent of being an outright villain against the IG. Today he issued a warning that nothing can be done by the government by sidestepping the BNP. This is an outright rebellion. I think the IG should not ignore such villainous utterances from MF. He could be arrested for such a challenge to the running of the government. The IG and students-people should watch out. Whatever, such hostile challenges should not stop or slow down the necessary reforms that include the removal of Chuppu and impose a moratorium, if not total ban, on the Awami League. Also, I am not unaware of what Mirza Fakhrul has gone through over the years, most of which, according to me, were his/BNP’s own doing and their half-hearted opposition to the Hasina regime, some say India/Awami scripted. Mirza Fakhrul’s Mujib-Hasina-Chuppu-India pleasing attitude now gives credence to that. On the other hand, many of us have been screaming for years for the BNP to form a national unity with all parties, particularly the Jamaat, and create a tsunami to oust the fascists, but the Mirzas failed or did not heed. Now when the students-people did the same and succeeded, the Mirzas are out to grab the pie, to the extent of opposing the students-people and their IG. How can one exonerate this villainous attitude? 'Nothing can be done without BNP' is a thuggish statement. Common BNP members and members of other parties also died in the July/August movement but not a single top leader. They were in their Mujrakhana. That’s why I always say, problem is with the leadership, not with the grassroots, which is still strong and dedicated. It is not the question of election any time soon. The IG is already working on a roadmap. Putting undue pressure is counterproductive. There should be no election without the needed reforms, whatever time it takes. Such criticism of the BNP is in tons in Bangladesh itself as well as abroad. Criticism of patriots abroad cannot be overlooked. In today’s infotech, the diaspora is current with minute-by-minute details or developments back home. They know who is worth what and who sings whose songs. The contribution of Bangladeshi diaspora in the victory of August 5 is no less. And they do have a right to think about the good of the country. Enchanted by Mirza Fakhrul’s pro-Awami stances, Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the fallen Hasina regime, wanted to work with the BNP to establish democracy in Bangladesh. Hah-ha, is the sun rising from the west! First, Awami League’s desire to work for democracy in Bangladesh is as weird and ridiculous as a tiger asking a deer cub for peaceful cohabitation after devouring its parents. Second, this demonstrates how dangerous Mirza Fakhrul is turning the Bangladesh’s post-August 5 politics into the Awami hands. I think the IG, the students-people and the people at large must guard against such dubious characters who want to খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে। People must decide if Bangladesh can be safe in the hands of such dangerous leaders. The hard-earned victory of August 5 cannot be allowed to be hijacked or destroyed by rehabilitating the fallen fascists. Let me clarify. When I am talking about the dubious role of Mirza Fakhrul, I am not talking about the glorious BNP founded and nourished by Ziaur Rahman the Great. A highly intellectual-minded and well-educated business owner Bangladeshi-Canadian Shamim Iqbal Rony finds Bangladeshi-Belgian BAL Hasan Mahmud’s expression of interest to work with the BNP towards the establishment of democracy in Bangladesh deeply disturbing and disgusting. It is out of utter frustration that he says that 'Bangladesh is a bastard child of India and is like Palestine actually. We are basically owned by them and BAL is their slave manager. I don’t have much hope for this county, to be honest, as our people are the problem. We are happy to be slaves and have a memory of a goldfish.' To continue with Col Chowdhury finding the BNP’s post-5 August role highly unacceptable, মনে হচ্ছে বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ, বিশেষ করে মির্জা ফখরুল, প্রফেসর ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে গঠিত এবং পরিচালিত অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের প্রতিপক্ষ হিসাবে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছেন। ছাত্র জনতার বিরুদ্ধে জনগণকে বিষিয়ে তোলার চেষ্টা করছেন। দেশের বৃহত্তম দল হিসাবে দেশ পরিচালনার দায়িত্ব নিতে চেষ্টা করছেন। কতেকটা বিশ্বাসঘাতক মুজিব কাহিনির পুনরাবৃত্তি । স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশ না চেয়ে, স্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা দিতে অস্বীকার করে এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধ থেকে পালানো মুজিব নয় মাস জল্লাদ ইয়াহিয়ার মেহমান খানা থেকে ফিরে এসে বনে গেলেন জাতির পিতা। জাতির কর্ণধার । ৪৪ মাসে দিলেন দেশটাকে বরবাদ করে, বারোটা বাজিয়ে। বিএনপির মির্জারা এখন তারই পায়তারা করছে। (মুজিব হাসিনা) বাপ বেটি যেমন ভারতের কথামত চলে দেশটাকে ভারতের করদ রাজ্য বানিয়েছিল, মির্জারাও সম্ভবত গোপনে তাই করছে। ৫ ই আগস্ট হাসিনা মুজিবের পতনে তার কান্না, হাসিনার বিচার না চাওয়া (বলেছেন তিনি হাসিনার মৃত্যু চান না, অর্থাৎ সহিসালামত চান), এসব কিসের আলামত? গণতন্ত্র বিকাশের দোহাই দিয়ে স্বৈরাচারী আওয়ামী লীগকে পুনপ্রতিঠার চেষ্টা চালাচ্ছে। চুপ্পুকে বিদায় নিতে বাধা দিচ্ছে। গতকাল প্রয়াত সাদেক হোসেন খোকার অনুষ্ঠানে ঔদ্ধ্যাত্বপূর্ণ বক্তৃতা দিয়ে বলেছেন, মাইনাস ফর্মুলা চলবেনা। বিএনপিকে কিছুতেই বাদ দেয়া চলবেনা। এটা দস্তুরমত সরকারকে হুমকি। এ যেন মুজিবের ‘কোথায় সিরাজ সিকদার, লাল ঘোড়া দাবড়াইয়া দিমুর’মতো ঔদ্ধ্যাত্ব। মির্জাই যেন দেশের প্রকৃত শাসক বা শাসনের হকদার। আমার মতে মির্জাদের এসব কর্মকাণ্ডের জন্য আইনী ব্যবস্থা নেয়া অতীব প্রয়োজনীয়। নতুবা ৫ d ই আগস্টের বিজয় নস্যাৎ হয়ে যাবে অতি শীঘ্রই। স্মরণ রাখবেন মুজিবও অনেকবার স্বেচ্ছায় বা নিজ অপকর্মের জন্য জেলে গিয়েছেন। অথচ স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশে তার অপকর্মের জবাব দেশের সিপাহী জনতা দিয়েছে ১৫ ই আগস্ট। পরিশেষে বলি, মির্জারা সাবধান। এবং ছাত্র জনতা এদেরকে চিনতে ভুল করবেন না। Texas-based Senior Engineer Aftab Sheikh (unlike the terrible Tungipara and #32 Sheikhs, some patriotic and sensible Sheikhs still roam the earth!) has this to say: আমার মনে হয় বিএনপি ৫ই আগস্টের চেতনা ধারনে Confidence হারিয়েছে। তার পেছনে বড় কারন হচ্ছে জামায়াতের মত চরিত্রবান, সুশৃংখল, আদর্শিকভাবে সুশিক্ষিত এবং সাংগঠনিক নীতির আনুগত্যকারী নেতা ও কর্মীবাহিনী গড়তে পারেনি । ৫ই আগস্টের পরে দলীয় শৃংখলা ভংগের কারনে বহু নেতাকে বহিস্কারাদেশ সহ শোকজ করতে হয়েছে। তাদের অনেকেই আওয়ামী স্টাইলে লুটপাটের ঘটনাও ঘটিয়েছে। এসব আচরন কেন্দ্রীয় বিএনপির পক্ষে কন্ট্রোল করা দুস্কর হয়ে পড়েছে। এসব থেকে সহজেই আন্দাজ করা যায় যে ক্ষমতায় গেলে কিভাবে বিএনপি এদের ঠেকাবে? অন্যদিকে, ফ্যাসীবাদ উৎখাতে সব দলের ও ছাত্র-জনতার অংশগ্রহন থাকলেও অত্যন্ত কৌশলী ও রিসকী এই আন্দোলেনের মুল নীল নকসা যে জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এঁকেছিল তা দিবালোকের ন্যায় পরিস্কার হওয়ার পর বিএনপি হীনমন্যতায় ভুগছে। যদিও জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এই সফলতার একচ্ছত্র দাবীদার তা ভুলেও করেনি। জামায়াত-এর এই উদারতার কারনে দিন দিন এক ঈর্ষনীয় ও অপ্রতিরোধ্য জনপ্রিয়তা (যেমন পিনাকীর ২ মিলিয়নের বেশী ফলোয়ারদের মধ্যে যে জরীপ তাতে জামায়াত ৫৪% এবং বিএনপি ২০%) আমজনতার মাঝে স্পষ্ট লক্ষনীয়। এতে বিএনপির এই হীনমন্যতা, হিংসা বা ঈর্ষা আরো প্রকট হচ্ছে। তারপর থেকেই লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে বিএনপির নতুন রুপ। আর কেউ ক্ষমতায় গেলেও জামায়াত ক্ষমতায় যাক -- এটা তারা মেনে নিতে পারছেনা। সুতরাং আওয়ামী -- বিএনপি মিলে জামায়াত ঠেকাও আন্দোলন গড়ার ভবিষৎ চিন্তা থেকেই এমন একটি পোলারাইজেশন এর দিকে বিএনপি ধীরে ধীরে অগ্রসর হচ্ছে বলে মনে করার যথেষ্ট কারন রয়েছে। অন্যদিকে, বিএনপির এহেন আচরন জামায়াতকে আরো বেশী জনপ্রিয় করে তুলছে । Gen Z-এর চরিত্র বুঝতে বিএনপির বুডো ও মিশ্র আদর্শের (এক সময় বাম রাজনীতি করেছেন বা অন্যদল করছেন) ধ্বজাধারী নেতারা একেবারেই অক্ষমতার প্রমান দিচ্ছেন । যেমন, মীর্জা ফখরুল যিনি ছাত্র ইউনিয়নের নেতা ছিলেন, বলেছিলেন জামায়াতকে উদদ্যেশ্য করে ‘মৌলবাদী’ যা বাম ও লীগের বয়ানের নির্যাস । মীর্জা আববাস, সালাহউদদীনও এমন মন্তব্য করেছেন। রিজভী একা কুলিয়ে উঠতে না পেরে তিনিও সাথে তাল দিয়ে চলেছেন। এসব খুবই অনভিপ্রেত ছিল। আমার মতে ফখরুল ও আব্বাস এর মত অদুরদর্শী নেতারা বিএনপির হাল ধরে থাকলে কোনদিনই বাংলাদেশের মানুষ জুলাই-আগস্টের চেতনার ফল ভোগ করতে পারবে না। বাংলাদেশ যে তিমিরে ছিল সেখানেই বার বার ঘুরে ফিরে আসবে। আমার ধারনা ভুল হোক, বাংলাদেশ ঘুড়ে দাঁড়াক সেটাই কাম্য। ১৯৭৫ সালে আওয়ামী লীগকে এবং ছাত্রলীগকে শেখ মুজিব নিজ হাতে কবর দিয়ে গেছেন। সেই সংগঠন আর নাই । যেটা আছে সেটা জংগী ও মাফিয়া সংগঠন। অনুরুপভাবে, শহীদ জিয়ার ইনতেকালে মুলত বিএনপি জিয়ার আদর্শ থেকে বিচ্যুত হয়ে গেছে। শুনেছিলাম তিনি দলের নেতা কর্মীদের রাজনৈতিক প্রশিক্ষন দেয়ার মত একটা বিভাগ খুলতে চেয়েছিলেন । কিনতু সে সময় তিনি পাননি। কোন দলের নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে দলের লক্ষ্য, আদর্শ ও মোটিভেশন এ ঐক্য না থাকে ঐ দল দিয়ে আর যাই হোক দেশ গড়ার কোন কাজ করা সম্ভব নয়। ফখরুল সাহেব নিজেই স্বীকার করেছেন জামায়াত ও শিবিরের নেতা কর্মীরা নিয়মিত পড়ালেখা করে সংগঠনের একটা আবশ্যক কাজ হিসেবে——-তিনি প্রশংসা করতে বাধ্য হয়েছেন। কিনতু তার নিজের দলের নেতা কর্মীরা পড়াশোনা করে না সেটাও অকপটে স্বীকার করছেন। এই পড়ালেখার ফল কি হয়েছে জানেন? জামায়াত এর কেন্দ্রীয় আমীর থেকে শুরু করে কর্মী এমনকি সক্রিয় সমর্থক পর্যন্ত সবার মধ্যে চিন্তার ঐক্য আছে। যা একমাত্র কমিউনিস্ট পার্টী ছাড়া আর কোন দলে নেই। কেননা কমিউনিস্টদেরও বই পড়তে হয়। বিএনপি has lost their intrinsic values overtime. তাদের দলে শুদ্ধি অভিযান চালিয়ে জামায়াতের ফর্মুলায় শক্তিশালী জাতীয় সরকার গঠন করা ছাড়া দেশী বিদেশী সকল ষড়যন্ত্র মোকাবেলা করা দুরহ হয়ে পড়বে যে কোন এক দলের পক্ষে। কাজেই সময় থাকতে বিএনপি হাই কমান্ডের উচিত বিভেদ নয় বরং দেশের সার্থে লোভ লালসা ভুলে আপনারা ঐক্যবদ্ধ হোন । কাদা ছোড়াছুড়ি বন্ধ করুন। তাহলেই জংগী ও মাফিয়া আওয়ামী লীগ গং আর কখনই মাথা চারা দিয়ে উঠতে পারবেনা, ইনশাআললাহ। All the above views are the voice of reason, voice of logic, voice of Bangladesh. Like the kaleidoscopic বিশ্ব বেহায়া H M Ershad, pretty much RAW-Indian-looking BNP under its treacherous, incompetent and hypocritical Dhaka-London leadership has been shamelessly compromising its position towards the deeply and directly Indian-looking Hasina BAL, which has become an ‘Alias’ of a possible Indian Awami League for decades. It is as if the BNP hasn’t gotten enough lessons from হাসিনা ওরফে হিন্দুস্তান and her last 16 years of terror and torture. Was it all a prearranged drama staged for a shifting/rotating duty through RAW Mathur India? Both the BNP and the BAL have become indistinguishably synonymous with each other in their respective pro-Indian, anti-Muslim, anti-Islam, anti-Jamaat, anti-patriotic and anti-nationalist thuggish ruffian-type savage ‘gunday’ stance. It’s said that when the late Cuban President Castro was asked about the 1960 US elections between Nixon and Kennedy, his reply was that 'It is not possible to compare the two shoes worn by the same person. America is governed by only one party, which is the Zionist Party, and it has two wings: the Republican wing represents the hard-line Zionist power, and the Democratic wing represents the soft Zionist power.' The same is applicable to the BAL and the BNP, the former representing the hardcore Hindustani hegemony and the latter representing softcore. Is it that there are no differences in the so-called ‘goals and strategies’ of the BAL and the BNP, except that their ‘means and tools’ are to differ slightly to give each other some space to maneuver their respective dirty and devilish aims and intentions through in their own ways? Shouldn’t the BNP refrain and be prevented from becoming an Awami BNP (ABNP)? Or, Basically No Party (BNP)? Or, ⁠Basically Nasty Party (BNP)? Or, Basically Nuisance Party (BNP)?Or, Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP)? To rephrase, summarize and versify the above: কে আছ জোয়ান হও আগুয়ান ধর জিয়া-খালেদা বিএনপির হাল । লন্ডন-ঢাকা বিএনপি যে হয়ে গেল হাসিনা আর তার বাল। জেনেভা বিমান বন্দরে ড আসিফ নজরুলের উপর আওয়ামি হামলা-হেনস্তার ঘটনায় লক্ষ কোটি বারের মতো আবারো প্রমানিত হল টুংগি হাসিনা বাল কি মাল। আর বিএনপি নির্লজ্জ বেহায়ার মত তাদের সাথে আবার সতীনের ঘর করার আগ্রহ প্রকাশ করছে। However, BNP may like to take a look at the reading of the pulse of the people of Bangladesh, which is as follows: — 1. No Hasina, No Parliament, No Chuppu. The lame and loose and lax and tailored and retailored constitution is to be thrown out. 2. The Interim Government should adopt more revolutionary character with Dr Yunus assuming the Presidency with all executive powers. 3. General Wakeruzzanan, a great hero, should remove all elements suspected of being pro-Hasina BAL from the army and take his patriotic forces above all bad rumours of a coup attempt or counterrevolution, if any. 4. The BAL and all their activities need to be banned with all urgency.5. BNP under the current Dhaka-London leadership with their compromising Awami and Indian dalali remains incompetent, hypocritical, deceiving and untrustworthy. There should be a revolt against this leadership from within the party and a new patriotic and nationalist BNP should emerge.6. TR needs to be challenged as a hypocritical, cowardly and compromising pro-Indian and pro-BAL agent playing a conman drifting away from the ideals of the great and glorious President Zia and Prime Minister Begum Zia. He and the rest of the top BNP leaders should be politically castrated and castigated. He should be vilified as a parricide, patricide and matricide. 7. People don’t want any Awami BAL BNP. They don’t want any treacherous Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP) in alliance with the RAW India BAL and the secularist leftists, all against Islam and Muslims. Any RAW India BAL-BNP cohabitation as two co-wives of India must be prevented.8. The new revolutionary interim government (RIG) should stay in power for at least 5 years to complete all the necessary reforms inclined and oriented towards the religious faith of the vast majority. No election in 5 years! 9. A due national recognition of President Ziaur Rahman, 15 August heroes, President Khandoker Mushtaq Ahmed, 7 November and 5 August heroes is needed. 10. The name of Sheikh Mujib (who was a national villain, national traitor, national betrayer) should be dropped from the list of true national heroes consisting of H S Suhrawardy, Sher-e-Bangla, Moulana Bhasani, Gen MAG Osmani and Gen Ziaur Rahman. 11. A new Chatro Janata party should be formed under whatever name. 12. An alliance of that new party + the new BNP+Jamaat + GOP both groups + Chor Monai Islami Andolon + Hefazat+Islami Oikkyojote+LDP+AB Party = Allahu Akbar Bangladesh ZindabadIf the TR-Fakhrul BNP soaked and submerged in RAW India is about to forget all the tons and trucks of torture they suffered in the hands of Hasina (looks like they suffered intentionally as part of a prearranged scam or scheme) and is now willing to compromise and work together with Hasina BAL who are more directly and deeply RAW India, who is more নির্লজ্জ বিশ্ববেহায়া—Ershad-GM Qader or TR-Fakhrul BNP? If that is true, let’s say (out of frustration though) that JP deserves to survive and this TR-Fakhrul BNP deserves to be dissipated, dissolved and extinct, while a truly patriotic and nationalist new BNP should arise in the footsteps of Zia and Khaleda. 1.

Asteroid Grains Shed Light On The Outer Solar System’s Origins	Tiny grains from a distant asteroid are revealing clues to the magnetic forces that shaped the far reaches of the solar system over 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere have analyzed particles of the asteroid Ryugu, which were collected by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission and brought back to Earth in 2020. Scientists believe Ryugu formed on the outskirts of the early solar system before migrating in toward the asteroid belt, eventually settling into an orbit between Earth and Mars. The team analyzed Ryugu’s particles for signs of any ancient magnetic field that might have been present when the asteroid first took shape. Their results suggest that if there was a magnetic field, it would have been very weak. At most, such a field would have been about 15 microtesla. (The Earth’s own magnetic field today is around 50 microtesla.) Even so, the scientists estimate that such a low-grade field intensity would have been enough to pull together primordial gas and dust to form the outer solar system’s asteroids and potentially play a role in giant planet formation, from Jupiter to Neptune. The team’s results, which are published in the journal AGU Advances, show for the first time that the distal solar system likely harbored a weak magnetic field. Scientists have known that a magnetic field shaped the inner solar system, where Earth and the terrestrial planets were formed. But it was unclear whether such a magnetic influence extended into more remote regions, until now. 'We’re showing that, everywhere we look now, there was some sort of magnetic field that was responsible for bringing mass to where the sun and planets were forming,' says study author Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. 'That now applies to the outer solar system planets.' The study’s lead author is Elias Mansbach PhD ’24, who is now a postdoc at Cambridge University. MIT co-authors include Eduardo Lima, Saverio Cambioni, and Jodie Ream, along with Michael Sowell and Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech, Roger Fu of Harvard University, Xue-Ning Bai of Tsinghua University, Chisato Anai and Atsuko Kobayashi of the Kochi Advanced Marine Core Research Institute, and Hironori Hidaka of Tokyo Institute of Technology. A far-off field Around 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust, which collapsed into a swirling disk of matter. Most of this material gravitated toward the center of the disk to form the sun. The remaining bits formed a solar nebula of swirling, ionized gas. Scientists suspect that interactions between the newly formed sun and the ionized disk generated a magnetic field that threaded through the nebula, helping to drive accretion and pull matter inward to form the planets, asteroids, and moons. 'This nebular field disappeared around 3 to 4 million years after the solar system’s formation, and we are fascinated with how it played a role in early planetary formation,' Mansbach says. Scientists previously determined that a magnetic field was present throughout the inner solar system — a region that spanned from the sun to about 7 astronomical units (AU), out to where Jupiter is today. (One AU is the distance between the sun and the Earth.) The intensity of this inner nebular field was somewhere between 50 to 200 microtesla, and it likely influenced the formation of the inner terrestrial planets. Such estimates of the early magnetic field are based on meteorites that landed on Earth and are thought to have originated in the inner nebula. 'But how far this magnetic field extended, and what role it played in more distal regions, is still uncertain because there haven’t been many samples that could tell us about the outer solar system,' Mansbach says. Rewinding the tape The team got an opportunity to analyze samples from the outer solar system with Ryugu, an asteroid that is thought to have formed in the early outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, and was eventually brought into orbit near the Earth. In December 2020, JAXA’s Hayabusa 2 mission returned samples of the asteroid to Earth, giving scientists a first look at a potential relic of the early distal solar system. The researchers acquired several grains of the returned samples, each about a millimeter in size. They placed the particles in a magnetometer — an instrument in Weiss’ lab that measures the strength and direction of a sample’s magnetization. They then applied an alternating magnetic field to progressively demagnetize each sample. 'Like a tape recorder, we are slowly rewinding the sample’s magnetic record,' Mansbach explains. 'We then look for consistent trends that tell us if it formed in a magnetic field.' They determined that the samples held no clear sign of a preserved magnetic field. This suggests that either there was no nebular field present in the outer solar system where the asteroid first formed, or the field was so weak that it was not recorded in the asteroid’s grains. If the latter is the case, the team estimates such a weak field would have been no more than 15 microtesla in intensity. The researchers also reexamined data from previously studied meteorites. They specifically looked at 'ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites' — meteorites that have properties that are characteristic of having formed in the distal solar system. Scientists had estimated the samples were not old enough to have formed before the solar nebula disappeared. Any magnetic field record the samples contain, then, would not reflect the nebular field. But Mansbach and his colleagues decided to take a closer look. 'We reanalyzed the ages of these samples and found they are closer to the start of the solar system than previously thought,' Mansbach says. 'We think these samples formed in this distal, outer region. And one of these samples does actually have a positive field detection of about 5 microtesla, which is consistent with an upper limit of 15 microtesla.' This updated sample, combined with the new Ryugu particles, suggest that the outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, hosted a very weak magnetic field, that was nevertheless strong enough to pull matter in from the outskirts to eventually form the outer planetary bodies, from Jupiter to Neptune. 'When you’re further from the sun, a weak magnetic field goes a long way,' Weiss notes. 'It was predicted that it doesn’t need to be that strong out there, and that’s what we’re seeing.' The team plans to look for more evidence of distal nebular fields with samples from another far-off asteroid, Bennu, which were delivered to Earth in September 2023 by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. 'Bennu looks a lot like Ryugu, and we’re eagerly awaiting first results from those samples,' Mansbach says. This research was supported, in part, by NASA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTa6G2VThv7xZ	2024-11-09T16:34:08-08:00	
New Option For Treating Prostate Cancer	Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Despite medical advances in recent years, this type of tumour is still responsible for one in eight male cancer deaths in Austria alone. An international research team led by MedUni Vienna has now investigated a new strategy for the development of treatment options that not only slow tumour growth, but also stimulate the immune system to combat tumour cells. The results of the study have just been published in the top journal Molecular Cancer. The scientific team focused its investigations on the GP130 signalling pathway, which researchers expect to have a major potential in the fight against cancer. The background: the signalling pathway, which is mediated by the protein GP130, plays a central role in cell communication and influences the activity of the transcription factor STAT3, which in turn is associated with the development and spread of tumours. Accordingly, blocking the GP130 signalling pathway is currently seen as a great hope in cancer medicine. Yet the current study proves the opposite: tumour growth can be slowed down not by inhibiting but by activating the GP130 signalling pathway in prostate cells. New hope, especially for aggressive tumours To achieve these new findings, the researchers investigated genetically modified mice in which GP130 was specifically activated in the prostate. 'This allowed us to directly observe the reduction in tumour growth in the cell,' reports Lukas Kenner (Clinical Department of Pathology, MedUni Vienna), who led the study together with Stefan Rose-John (Biochemical Institute, University of Kiel). The results were further backed up by analyses of tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. This showed that high GP130 values correlate with a better survival rate. At the same time, extensive molecular analyses were carried out, including gene expression profiling. 'Our research provides exciting new evidence that the activation of GP130 in prostate cells not only slows tumour growth, but also stimulates the immune system to actively fight the cancer cells,' says Lukas Kenner, summarising the significance of the results, which will now be confirmed in further studies. The research work opens up a promising new therapeutic option, particularly for aggressive prostate cancer, which is still difficult to treat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTVsnRWG5shN0	2024-11-09T16:29:30-08:00	
Up To 30% Of The Power Used To Train AI Is Wasted: Here’s How To ...	A less wasteful way to train large language models, such as the GPT series, finishes in the same amount of time for up to 30% less energy, according to a new study from the University of Michigan. The approach could save enough energy to power 1.1 million U.S. homes in 2026, based on Wells Fargo's projections of AI power demand. It could also take a bite out of the International Monetary Fund's prediction that data centers could account for 1.2% of the world's carbon emissions by 2027—and the water demands that come with that energy use. Some experts say that these costs could be outweighed by environmental benefits. They argue that AI could be a 'game changer' for fighting climate change by identifying ways to optimize supply chains and the grid, manage our energy needs, and improve research on climate change. Still, that doesn't excuse squandering energy, and some of the power used to train AI has zero impact on training time and model accuracy. 'Why spend something when there's no point?' said Mosharaf Chowdhury, U-M associate professor of computer science and engineering and the corresponding author of the study presented at the 30th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. 'We can't keep building bigger and bigger data centers because we won't have the power to run them. If we can reduce the energy consumed by AI, we can reduce AI's carbon footprint and cooling requirements and allow for more computation to fit within our current energy constraints.' The energy waste is created when AI training is unequally divided between GPUs, which are computer processors specialized for large data and graphics applications. Although it opens the door for waste, splitting the work is necessary for processing huge datasets. 'AI models today are so large, they cannot fit inside a single computer processor,' said Jae-Won Chung, U-M doctoral student in computer science and engineering and the first author of the study. 'They need to be divided into tens of thousands of processors to be trained, but dividing the models in perfectly equal sizes across all processors is practically impossible.' The training jobs are so difficult to evenly split up because some tasks need to be grouped together on the same processor—like how each installment of a book series will be grouped together in an organized shelf. Depending on how the tasks are grouped, some processors might get stuck with the AI-training equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica while others get assigned a fantasy trilogy. Because current training methods run each processor at top speed, processors with a lighter load will finish their calculations before other processors. This doesn't speed up training, which isn't complete until every processor finishes its job—but it is wasteful because faster calculations require more energy. In addition, problems such as faulty hardware or network delays create energy waste by slowing down a single processor's computing speed. To save energy, the researchers developed a software tool, called Perseus, that identifies a critical path, or a series of subtasks that will take the longest time to complete. Then, Perseus slows down processors that aren't on the critical path so that they all finish their jobs around the same time—eliminating unnecessary power use. 'Reducing the power cost of AI can have important implications for equitable AI access,' Chowdhury said. 'If a country doesn't have enough power to run a big model, they might need to use services from far away, or be stuck running smaller, less accurate models. This gap could further perpetuate disparity between different communities.' The team tested Perseus by training GPT-3, three other large language models and one computer vision model. Perseus is an open-sourced tool available as part of Zeus, a tool for measuring and optimizing AI energy consumption.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXg-Bx2GVang	2024-11-09T16:26:03-08:00	
Free Trade Agreements Key To Asia’s Prosperity – Analysis	By Mohd Faiz Abdullah Asia’s ascent as the centre of global economic activity has been nothing short of profound. Even in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by cycles of financial and health crises, Asia has withstood the test of time, emerging as the fastest growing continent. Asia’s economic rise has been inextricably linked to the forces of globalisation, particularly through the proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs). These agreements have facilitated Asia’s integration into the global economy and shaped its regional dynamics, making Asia one of the most interconnected and economically vibrant regions in the world. From the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Asia’s FTA network has been a cornerstone of its development and a key contributing factor in maintaining ASEAN centrality. FTAs have been instrumental in driving Asia’s economic growth and prosperity by opening new markets, reducing trade barriers, fostering investment and innovation and, in some instances, accelerating domestic reforms. Countries like Japan, South Korea and China — all of whom are already in some form of free trade arrangement with ASEAN Member States — have leveraged these FTAs to expand their exports, fuelling growth and development. The export-oriented strategies of these nations, supported by FTAs, have lifted millions out of poverty and transformed the region into a global economic powerhouse. The ASEAN region’s economy grew by 5.7 per cent in 2022, maintaining an average annual growth rate of 4.4 per cent between 2010 and 2022. ASEAN’s nominal GDP per capita stood at US$5,395 in 2022, a notable increase of 37.6 per cent from 2015. With such strong economic fundamentals, the region has also become a focal point for global supply chains, with Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia emerging as key manufacturing hubs. The ASEAN Economic Community has promoted the free flow of goods, services and capital, enhancing the competitiveness of its member states. In addition, the ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons has also facilitated the mobility of talentwithin the region. RCEP underscores Asia’s central role in global trade. By harmonising trade rules and reducing tariffs across 15 countries, RCEP has solidified Asia’s position as a critical node in the global economic network. The CPTPP, despite the withdrawal of the United States, remains a significant agreement that binds its members to high standards of trade and investment rules, further integrating Asian economies with the rest of the world. These FTAs are both economic tools and strategic instruments that reinforce ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture. Despite the benefits brought by FTAs, Asia now faces significant challenges as globalisation encounters harsh headwinds. The rise of protectionism, trade wars and the potential decoupling of major economies like the United States and China pose a threat to the very foundation of Asia’s economic success. Any move towards decoupling could have profound implications on Asian economies, particularly for countries heavily reliant on trade with China. If global powers attempt to isolate or decouple from China, the ripple effects would cascade across the region and disrupt supply chains in industries ranging from electronics in South Korea to automotive parts in Thailand. Such disruptions would cause economic losses and destabilise the political and security environment in Asia, where economic interdependence has been a key factor in maintaining peace and stability. Confronting these challenges head-on, ASEAN centrality has become the linchpin upholding and promoting globalisation, particularly through FTAs. ASEAN has been the bedrock of regional economic integration, acting as a platform for dialogue and cooperation among its member states and external partners. Through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, FTAs with Dialogue Partners and RCEP, ASEAN has strategically positioned itself at the heart of Asia’s economic architecture. Still, for the region to continue to benefit from free trade, ASEAN must address persistent weaknesses in the ASEAN Economic Community, such as non-tariff barriers and varying regulatory standards. ASEAN’s commitment to the rules-based trading system, plurilateralism and inclusive growth is a powerful counterbalance to the growing trends of protectionism and unilateralism. By championing FTAs and regional integration, ASEAN can help mitigate the risks associated with decoupling and ensure that Asia continues to reap the benefits of globalisation. ASEAN’s approach to consensus-building and respect for sovereignty serves as a model for other regions facing similar challenges. Through its active participation in FTAs, Asia has secured a strategic edge in globalisation, with its economic prosperity and political stability thriving on open markets and interconnected economies. But with the rise of protectionism and the growing potential for decoupling, Asia stands at a crossroads. ASEAN centrality, supported by robust FTAs, is essential to safeguard Asia’s interests in this shifting global landscape. By continuing to promote regional integration and engage in strategic dialogues, ASEAN can ensure that Asia remains at the forefront of the global economy, navigating the challenges ahead with resilience and foresight.

Cuba’s Real Power Problem Is Socialism – OpEd	Millions of Cubans remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Oscar, but bad weather is not Cuba’s real problem. Its centrally planned socialist economy is the root cause of the blackout and most of its other problems. Cuba’s nationwide blackout began a few days before Oscar made landfall when the Antonio Guiteras power plant went offline. Seven of Cuba’s eight thermoelectric plants were offline for maintenance or otherwise not operational. The failure of the Guiteras plant left the country without a major power producer. Oscar made things worse for Cubans on the island’s east end and will likely delay power returning to that region. However, other areas unaffected by the storm faced blackouts. The Cuba Electrical Union announced that 216,000 people in Havana, a city of more than 2 million, had their power restored Sunday, October 20th, only to have that grid collapse later in the day for the fourth time since blackouts began. Hospitals, hotels, and other businesses have limited power from generators, but fuel is in short supply and will not keep the generators running much longer. Venezuela has provided subsidized fuel to Cuba for two decades, but its own economic crisis has limited how much it can help Cuba in recent years. Meanwhile, fuel from the United States remains unavailable due to the embargo. But the root causes of Cuba’s lack of energy are homegrown. Without private property, socialist economic systems cannot provide the information and incentives necessary to create prosperity. Prices convey information about what goods and services are most scarce in market economies. However, prices in socialist economies don’t convey that same information because they are dictated by central plans or distorted by artificial scarcities due to the planners’ import controls. When I was researching a recent book in Cuba, I thought that Cuba should have a game show called 'The Price Is Wrong.' The lack of property rights also means that the managers of the factors of production, such as power plants, don’t have the same incentive to maintain them as entrepreneurs in market economies do because state managers are not entitled to the profits generated by long-term maintenance. Under socialism, entrepreneurs have no incentive, or even the right, to outcompete inefficient state firms to better serve consumers. Socialist systems stagnate and fail to create prosperity because of their inherent nature. Plenty of fuel could be imported from countries other than the United States and Venezuela, but the Cuban economy doesn’t generate enough wealth to afford it. North Korea is the only country in the world that is more completely centrally planned than Cuba, and it is perpetually without power. Satellite images reveal that the entire country, except the capital, is without power at night, and only about half the population has electricity for more than four hours a day. Power is far from the only thing in short supply in socialist countries. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, beef and pork production is collapsing in Cuba. Starvation has been a recurring problem in North Korea ever since Soviet aid ended in 1991. North Koreans are not free to flee their economic woes, but Cubans are. As a result, more than 1 million Cubans, 10 percent of the population, emigrated in 2022 and 2023. Cubans took to the streets demanding greater freedom three years ago in protests sparked in partby power outages and food shortages. Despite President Miguel Diaz-Canel’s announcement that he will not tolerate protests, pro-freedom protests are exactly what Cuba needs again today. Until it scraps its centrally planned system and grants Cubans a large measure of economic freedom, Cuba’s economic and power problems will continue.

Congress Should Fire Jerome Powell – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken There were a few seemingly tense moments at the FOMC press conference on Thursday when two reporters asked Jerome Powell about the prospect of Donald Trump asking Powell to resign. The first reporter asked 'would you resign if asked to do so by Donald Trump?' To this, Powell responded with a resounding 'no' followed by silence. A few moments later, Powell was asked by another reporter if it was lawful for Trump to either remove or 'demote'—that is, remove Powell as chairman, but leave him on the Board of Governors—Powell. To this, Powell responded with a forceful 'not permitted under the law.' Apparently, Powell wished to leave no ambiguity whatsoever about this position that he cannot be removed or demoted by a sitting president. It would agree that the spirit of the law here is that a president not be able to remove a Fed chairman, except for some kind of misconduct. But, ambiguity remains. Even Alan Blinder, a proponent of the myth of 'Fed independence,' admits that in the world of political reality, Trump could potentially remove Powell: Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court. 'Trump could try and he might try,' Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'It’s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don’t know what to think of the Supreme Court.' Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed’s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said. 'That’s a subtle question that has never been tested,' Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. 'We can’t answer that quite as definitively.' In any case, Trump would likely have to expend some serious political capital if he wants to remove Powell via presidential power. Yet, Powell’s defiance ought to provoke us to ask why wealthy, pampered, out-of-touch technocrats like Jerome Powell get to act like their removal constitutes some sort of transgression. Central bankers are just bureaucrats, and their removal ought to be regarded with no more trepidation than the removal of an undersecretary of agriculture. Congress Should Fire Powell, and Not Stop There Regardless of what Trump’s legal powers may be, it is clear that Congress has the power to remove Powell, just as Congress has the power to abolish the central bank altogether. The Congress ought to abolish the Fed entirely, of course, but if members lack the stomach for that heroic act, Congress can begin with amending the Federal Reserve Act to make it clear that the chairman of the Fed is not a Holy Person, untouchable by the mere mortals who are actually elected to run the federal government. There are many ways Congress could approach this issue. For example, Congress could rewrite the law to allow Congress to remove the Fed chairman with a majority vote in either house. It doesn’t really matter, so long as central bankers get the message that they’re not special. While Congress is at is, it could make a few other crucial changes as well. Congress should prohibit the Fed from buying any assets of any kind. This would end the Fed’s habit of buying up mortgage-backed securities and government securities to prop up the banker class and Powell’s buddies—i.e., Janet Yellen—at the Treasury. It would also end the Fed’s ability to manipulate interest rates since the Fed’s main tool here is its 'open market operations.' A second key change that is very necessary is removing the Fed’s so called 'dual mandate.' As the Fed likes to often mention, the Fed has a dual mandate of both 'stable prices' and 'maximum employment.' Congress should immediately abolish the mandate for 'maximum employment' because the only purpose this has ever served has been as an excuse for the central bank to inflate the money supply. As is abundantly clear from Fed press conferences and publications, the Fed routinely justifies its dovish policy in terms of fulfilling its mandate to maximize inflation. That is, the Fed often says something to the effect of 'we’re embracing easy-money policy because our dual mandate to maximize employment says we have to.' Congress should just delete the mandate. (By the way, the Fed actually has a third mandate. It’s to ensure 'moderate long-term interest rates.' Getting rid of the Fed’s power to purchase assets probably nullifies this mandate in any case, but Congress might as well remove any doubt and totally prohibit the Fed from manipulating interest rates of any kind.) Fed Independence Has Never Been Used for Good Things Of course, if Congress were to attempt any of this, Fed simps in the media and in Congress will try to talk about how such things are unprecedented and we must respect 'Fed independence.' Media stories in the Fed often claim that attempts by elected officials to rein in Fed technocrats violate 'long-standing norms' that respect Fed independence. This is a fantasy version of history. There is not now, and there has never been, any such thing as Fed independence because the Fed always willingly helps the regime get what it wants. Early on, Fed independence didn’t even exist in theory, and was explicitly limited in law. Prior to 1935, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the Treasury sat on the Fed’s Board, thus ensuring a direct line from the White House to the Fed. In 1933, of course, Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order abolishing the gold standard and ordering the Fed to turn over all its gold to the Treasury. So much for 'Fed independence' under the Left’s favorite twentieth-century president. Even after 1935, it was understood that the Fed would always assist the Treasury with funding whenever necessary. This again became obvious during the Second World War when the Fed essentially helped launder funds for the war effort. The Fed agreed in 1942 to peg interest rates on government securities. The Fed also engaged in a variety of price control measures and regulations designed to assist the White House. Only since the Monetary Accord of 1951 has there been a de jure nod to giving the Fed autonomy on policy. The Fed has never used any of this alleged autonomy to do anything good, however. We’ve seen this proven countless times since the Fed has always gladly done its part to ensure the Treasury gets what it wants. From the Fed’s efforts to finance federal deficits in the 1970s, to the Plaza Accord in 1985, and to the flood of easy money since 2008, the Fed has never used its so-called independence to actually rein in federal profligacy. What Matters to the Fed Is Protecting the Banking Class Central bankers have never cared about Fed independence as a way of limiting state power. According to its own historical narrative, the Fed has now allegedly been 'autonomous' for sixty years or more. Has inflation and federal spending been more restrained during that time? Obviously not. The Fed has always and everywhere been happy to enrich the state, regardless of whatever levels of self-governance it might achieve. The real reason the Fed wants more independence is so the Fed can also more easily enrich the banker class while also making the Treasury happy. That is, the banking cartel that works hand in glove with the Fed cares deeply about having control over who gets onto the Board of Governors and who gets to be chairman. The elite bankers are perfectly willing to effectively serve the Treasury so long as the cartel gets to have its own people in charge. This is how the banker class ensures that its monopolistic powers are protected, the competition is crushed, and the bailouts are guaranteed. If the Fed pushes back against the elected government, it’s only if the priorities of the elected government conflict with the Fed’s priority, which is serving the interests of the banker class. Experience makes it abundantly clear that central bankers are fine with endless price inflation. But, the Fed wants to inflate in a way that most suits the Fed and the banking cartel. That’s why Powell and the Fed are so opposed to the idea of being removed from office. There is no higher principle here. There is only power.

Australia’s Covid Inquiry Report Is Not Fit For Purpose – OpEd	On 24 October, Jay Bhattacharya, once derided by Anthony ‘Mr Science’ Fauci as a fringe epidemiologist, was awarded the Zimmer Medal for Intellectual Freedom by the American Academy of Sciences and Letters. The medal ‘is presented annually to a public thinker who displays extraordinary courage in the exercise of intellectual freedom.’ The 2023 winner was Salman Rushdie. Jay’s citation recognises his ‘courage and firm commitment to intellectual freedom’ who ‘resolutely refused…to compromise his scientific findings’ and took ‘a stand for the public’s right to unrestricted scientific discussion and debate.’ His writings and speeches are powerful examples of passion, courage, and clarity of expression that reflects clear thinking. He toured Australia in 2022 and I had the honour to share a packed town hall meeting with him in Melbourne on 22 September. Sadly but not surprisingly, his tour was mostly ignored by Australia’s mainstream media. On 29 October, the official panel inquiring into Australia’s Covid-19 response submitted its 868-page report. I regret to say the report is not fit for purpose. Bottom line: This is a report of, by, and for the public health clerisy. The prolix report is packed with turgid prose and bureaucratic analysis and recommendations. The Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, co-authored by Bhattacharya, still offers better big-picture value in both language and content. The 513-word one page GBD might even profit PM Anthony Albanese to read, since during last year’s doomed campaign for the Voice referendum he let it be known that his attention span does not extend beyond the first page of a report and he sees no reason for it to do so. At the granular level, the report has some positive features but these are outweighed by flaws of commission and omission, much like the response to the pandemic itself. Granted, the inquiry was hobbled by very tightly circumscribed terms of reference in yet another broken election promise that is itself destroying public trust in politicians and political institutions. Still, the panelists could have said no to the call to serve. The report opens with virtue-signalling genuflections to political correctness. There is the ritualistic acknowledgment of ‘Traditional Owners and Custodians of Country throughout Australia on whose lands we all work, play and live,’ ‘their continuous connection to lands, waters, skies, culture and community’ and the ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s significant contribution to society.’ The panelists pay ‘respects to their Elders past and present.’ The relevance of this to an inquiry report on Australia’s Covid response is difficult to discern. If this is a signal that henceforth, every official report is going to begin with these mantras then we can expect a significant and rapid rise of mainstream antagonism and resentment towards Aboriginal people. Next, there is an acknowledgment of ‘lived experience:’ ‘We acknowledge that Covid-19 touched every person, every organisation and each sector,’ albeit ‘in different ways.’ Well, yes, that’s why the inquiry was set up, to determine the details and identify the impacts. To coin a phrase, this is a statement of the bleeding obvious. This is topped off with a content warning: ‘This report contains material that may be distressing for some readers,’ complete with advice on who to contact for help. This was an inquiry into the Covid years that wrecked our lives, economy, and society for three years and counting. What did the panellists think readers would expect: lyrics to the latest kumbaya hymn? Instead of such mindless infantilisation, how about this: ‘We acknowledge the great loss of life, liberty, and happiness caused by Covid-19 and the response to it. We strongly recommend a Royal Commission of Inquiry to establish the division of causal responsibility between the disease and government policies, so that the perpetrators of mass public harms may be held accountable.’ Positives of Report Are Outweighed by Flaws The report confirms that lockdowns, state border closures, school shutdowns, and vaccine mandates broke public trust in governments and science. They drove lower Covid vaccine takeup in the last two years and promoted cross-vaccine hesitancy. Inconsistent advice, recommendations, and enforcement practices across the states, compounded by the refusal to release health advice and its science and evidence base further eroded public trust. The strong emphasis on human rights and the wider economic, social, and mental health consequences of the pandemic policies is also welcome. So too discussion of the long-term damage to children’s learning, development, and emotional health. All this is good, but neither particularly new nor insightful. Several critics warned about precisely these downstream consequences from day one. The report ignores how Australia’s Covid response marked a radical departure from the prevailing consensus on science and policy as synthesised in the WHO September 2019 report. Nor is there any clarity on why Australia’s own existing pandemic preparedness plans were ditched. Critical flaws of commissions begin with paeans to leaders’ courageous decision-making in conditions of mass fear and extreme uncertainty. The fear and hysteria did not match the data yet the government and media fed it. Experts who called for calm and responses that were proportionate to risks were ignored, censored, and vilified. Early data, including from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020 confirmed that the risk from Covid was highly age-correlated and concentrated in the elderly. There was no reason to strip peoples and businesses of their liberties and freedoms, to put healthy populations under wholesale house arrest, treating them as germ-ridden criminals even if proven innocent. Far from courageous, the leaders were cowardly and hypocritical, or else just too credulous of what their expert advisers told them. They had no skin in the game, suffered no financial penalty while decimating small businesses, paid no political penalty, got sugar highs on power tripping, hid behind health officials, and typically exempted themselves from inconvenient restrictions they foisted on all others. Australians were prevented from returning home, diluting the quality of citizenship, and also from leaving the country. But the prime minister was able to fly to the UK to attend the G7 summit (where he reversed Australian policy to commit Australia to Net Zero as the price of a guest seat at the exclusive high table), one state premier flew to Tokyo to lobby for hosting the Olympics, and one state chief health officer flew interstate to Canberra to attend an awards ceremony that recognised his stellar contribution to managing the pandemic. Australia became fixated on the single, dubious metric of case numbers, exaggerating the Covid risks, downplaying the harms of interventions, heightening the fear, stripping people of rights and liberties, censoring dissent, and cancelling critics. Hard to believe, dozens of Victorian firefighters who were dismissed for being unvaccinated are still banned from work despite staff shortages as the fire season is about to start. We threw extravagant and wasteful amounts of money at the problem. We sacrificed children’s futures for modest extensions to old people’s lives. Professor Margie Danchin, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, says bluntly that ‘We punished kids to protect the adults.’ Has any society ever done this before? The assumption of world-leading performance by Australia is rooted in simplistic and inappropriate European and North American benchmarks against which to assess our outcomes. Our Southern Hemisphere location, island identity, plentiful sunshine and open spaces, love of outdoors activities, relative paucity of high-density housing etc. conferred immense advantages in coming through the pandemic with much better outcomes than Europe and America. The most visible embodiments of courage through the pandemic public policy insanity were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Sweden’s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Florida and Sweden resisted the lockdown groupthink, are in the mid-range of Covid metrics, avoided most of the health, economic, educational, and social damage in European countries and US states with authoritarian approaches, including loss of public trust, and came out better on the balance of benefits versus harms. The panelists betray astonishing, one-dimensional ignorance in their references to Sweden, as though we are still stuck in 2020 instead of having moved on to near the end of 2024. The only mentions of Sweden are by way of its significantly worse comparison in the first year of the pandemic. ‘Australia would have had between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths if it had experienced the same Covid-related death rates as comparable countries like Canada and Sweden’ as well as France, the UK, and the US. The most striking variations in Covid mortality rates were by season (the Northern Hemisphere was much harder hit initially because of winter, giving a major seasonal buffer to countries in the Southern Hemisphere), geographical features like island identity and distance from Covid hotspots, and region. Tegnell insisted that lockdowns lacked any ‘historical scientific basis.’ In July 2020, he rejected short-term performance measures and said judge me in a year. Sweden’s initial bad outcomes reflected the equivalent of the ‘dry tinder’ effect with low flu mortality in 2019, the mid-term school holiday calendar that saw many Swedes vacationing on Italian slopes at a particularly unfortunate time for the spread of the infection, and badly mishandled elderly patients in care homes. The better point of comparison for light-touch Sweden is the heavy-handed UK, whose Covid outcomes were worse. Omissions Mean the Report Is Not Fit for Purpose This section explores three important examples of where the inquiry fell short. In the first two on social distancing and facemasks, the non-pharmaceutical interventions departed radically from existing understandings with no scientific basis or evidence in justification. In the third on vaccination, the response departed alarmingly from all established protocols governing the approval and authorisation of vaccines after duly completed trials to determine their efficacy and safety, not just in an immediate timeframe but over the long haul. To circumvent the full trials requirement, emergency use authorisation was necessary. This could not be done if existing treatment was available. When physicians who claimed high success in clinical treatment of Covid patients with repurposed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were ordered by regulators to cease and desist, suspicions were fuelled about industry capture of the regulators. There is also a plausible argument that the legal framework governing the approval process in Australia should have been that for genetically modified organisms. This wasn’t done. Social Distancing ‘Social distancing,’ the requirement that everyone must maintain the minimum specified distance from physical contact with any other human being, was a profoundly anti-social rule that severely disrupted social and economic functioning around the world for more than three years. On 31 May, the US Congress published the transcript of two days of testimony in January from Dr Anthony Fauci, the face of America’s Covid response. On the second day of the closed-door testimony on 10 January, Committee Staff Director Mitch Benzine asked about the origins of the six-foot social distancing rule applied at businesses, schools, and all public settings. Fauci frankly admitted: ‘You know, I don’t recall. It sort of just appeared.’ Pressed on relevant ‘studies that supported six feet,’ he said ‘I was not aware of studies that – in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do’ (pp. 183–84). As early as 25 April 2020, Professor Robert Dingwall, a scientific adviser to the UK government as a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), said there has ‘never been a scientific basis for two metres,’ it was ‘conjured up out of nowhere,’ and it should more accurately be called a ‘rule of thumb.’ He also warned that the social distancing measures would cause ‘serious damage to society, to the economy and to the physical and mental health of the population.’ Was he right, or was he right? A group of Oxford University scientists explained in June 2020 that the science behind the social distancing rule was complex while the rule was starkly binary. It assumed that the sole or primary transmission route was through physical contact or large droplets. This also explained the early phobia about the constant use of hand sanitisers and disinfection of all potential contact surfaces like chairs and tables in restaurants and benches in parks. But the really small viruses can also be aerosolised and spread through the air. Our chief health officers and ‘experts’ thus need to be interrogated on whether the adoption of the two-metre rule for Australia was an example of copycat idiocy or the persistence of culture cringe: where the Brits and Americans lead, we unquestioningly follow. Facemasks At the Congressional hearing on 10 January, Benzine also asked if a cost-benefit analysis had ever been done ‘on the unintended consequences of masking kids versus the protection that it would give them.’ ‘Not to my knowledge,’ Fauci conceded (p. 135). Until 2020, ‘settled science’ was clear. Masks are ineffective. They stop neither infection nor transmission. The UK Influenza Preparedness Strategy 2011, reaffirmedon 27 February 2020, encapsulated the prevailing consensus (paragraph 4.15): Although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks by the public in the community and household setting may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in this setting. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good respiratory, hand, and home hygiene behaviour in order for them to achieve the intended benefit. Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods reduces over time. This conclusion was reaffirmed in the WHO report published in September 2019 that summarised the best available studies to date, noting that ‘there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in community and household settings. It was repeated by top WHO doctors Mike Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove on 31 March 2020: ‘There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly.’ The benefits-harms equation for masks doesn’t compute, especially for children. They are dehumanising and a potent force for stoking mass fear. Facial expressions are crucial in social interactions, including for babies. And also for the elderly and people suffering from dementia in care homes. Consider this poignant testimony to Scotland’s Covid inquiry hearings from Alison Walker, a former BBC sports presenter, on 17 November 2023. Having witnessed the trauma of her 89- and 90-year old parents residing in care homes in 2020, she asked (around the 36-minute mark): ‘If you are surrounded by a group of people 24/7 wearing masks, and you don’t see people smile for up to two years, what kind of effect is that going to have on your mental health and wellbeing?’ Care homes abandoned their duty of ‘care and compassion,’ she believed, and instead ‘operated under a veil of fear’ (at 1:24:46). This was reinforced by the closing statement from the Care Home Relatives Scotland (paragraph 20): ‘The evidence demonstrated that the use of masks caused distress, confusion and considerable difficulties with communication. Residents couldn’t see smiles, had difficulty recognising relatives and those with hearing difficulties couldn’t lip-read or read facial expressions or visual clues.’ Masks also do cause some harms as side effects in some people. Compulsory masking for everyone in all settings is a gross violation of fundamental human rights. It can be justified only if the evidence for their efficacy in community protection is compelling and the risk of harms is negligible. Instead mask mandates were heavy on fear-mongering and virtue-signalling but light on data and science, overturning, in a couple of months, cumulative scientific consensus built over decades. The report mentions masks several times, but only in the context of the inconsistent application of mandates. It doesn’t address the lack of high-quality studies and data that would contradict the pre-2020 consensus on their lack of efficacy in community settings, as confirmed in the Cochrane Review. It fails to tell us why Australia’s health authorities flipped on the old understandings. Vaccines Part of the explanation for the tone-deafness towards the still smouldering white-hot rage in the community is the failure to address the fiasco of the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. From the start of vaccine rollout in February 2021 to 70 percent full vaccination on 21 November 2021, Australia’s total number of deaths was 1,187 (2,110-923) (Table 1). From initial rollout until 80 percent full vaccination on 20 March 2022, it was 5,599 (6,482-923). Since achieving those landmarks, which for practical purposes amount to full adult vaccination, the numbers of Covid-related deaths are 23,126 and 18,754, respectively. There are two ways to put these figures in perspective. More than 25 times as many people have died with Covid-19 since 70 percent full vaccination compared to the total number before vaccination; and more than 20 times since 80 percent full vaccination than before vaccination. Source for Table 1 and Figures 1–3: Our World in Data (accessed 31 October 2024) That is, 91.6 and 74.3 percent of Australia’s Covid-related deaths occurred after 70 and 80 percent full vaccination, respectively. This contrasts with just 3.7 percent before the vaccines began to be rolled out. I really do hate to think what the statistics would be if vaccines were ineffective. And this is even without taking into consideration vaccine injuries or age-disaggregated Covid risks of hospitalisation and death for unvaccinated vs vaccinated and boosted healthy children, adolescents, and adults until age 60. On 23 October, the BBC said that AstraZeneca vaccines had saved 6.3 million livesand Pfizer another 5.9 million, just in the first year from December 2020 to December 2021, including 120,000 British lives saved until September 2021. Looking at Figures 1–2, one can see why they would make such a claim. Yet as per Popperian falsifiability, just the one contrary example of Australia is sufficient to falsify the hypothesis of the Covid vaccines having saved millions of lives. As can be seen in Figure 1, among the four countries plus the EU, Australia’s vaccine rollout was the last to begin yet the most rapid and successful of all five in covering the population. Figure 2 shows that Australia’s Covid mortality rate was above one death per million people almost continually for 17 months from 9 January 2022 to 23 June 2023, except for a brief period of three weeks in March–April 2023. If we look at Figures 2 and 3 against the vaccination coverage in the five jurisdictions, two things become clear. For the four entities in the Northern Hemisphere, the heaviest Covid mortality toll both in terms of the daily count (Figure 2) and cumulatively (Figure 3) was in the first twelve months of the pandemic and the toll fell dramatically coinciding with the vaccine rollouts. For example, contrasting sharply with Australian data where the pre-vaccine deaths with Covid were under four percent of the total until October 2024, for the UK this was almost forty percent. Confusing correlation with causation, authorities, and vaccine-faithful advocates continue to attribute the fall to vaccines. Yet, in the case of Australia, the relationship is reversed. Its Covid-related mortality rates and cumulative toll were exceptionally light in the first twelve months beforethe vaccine campaign was launched. For vaccine-sceptics, it’s tempting to attribute this to vaccines causing the explosion in deaths. Yet such a conclusion is contradicted by the experience north of the equator. Equally, however, the Australian (and New Zealand) experience refutes the hypothesis that vaccines saved millions of lives. Instead, to my mind, taken together the divergent experiences powerfully indicate two alternative conclusions. Firstly, as was the case with lockdown restrictions and mask mandates, the rise and fall of the various coronavirus waves were policy-invariant, following a trajectory to some inner virus logic that was stubbornly indifferent to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Second, population-level immunity acquired naturally through infection likely played a more critical role in getting to herd immunity than vaccines. This occurred much earlier in the UK, Europe, and America. Hard border closures in Australia (and New Zealand) kept the virus at bay until such time as borders were reopened in the wake of rapid and high vaccine uptakes. This finally seeded the virus in the population and infection, hospitalisation, and death rates rose sharply, herd immunity was achieved, and the virus receded. If this is so, then of course the benefit-harms equation for vaccines changes quite dramatically also. To my absolute astonishment, the three words ‘cost-benefit analysis’ cannot be found even once in the more than 353,000 words of the report. The failure – nay, the cussed refusal – to engage in such analysis and publish the results, for an experimental product that may very well be contaminating our DNA (see Rebekah Barnett’s comprehensive refutation of the charge that this is misinformation), offers yet another bit of evidence that regulators have become vaccine enablers first, more committed to defending vaccines from criticism than protect people from harmful vaccines. Conclusion On the one hand, the report confirms how the policies implemented by political leaders acting under the guidance of public health officers and experts caused substantial health, mental health, economic, educational, and social damage that triggered a significant fall in trust in government and science. On the other hand, the major solution to this problem recommended by the report is to increase the authority and resources of the same two groups (politicians and the public health bureaucrats) to control our behaviour in future health emergencies. The contradiction has been picked up by pretty much every commentator. Did none of the panelists notice the incoherence between analysis and recommendations? The report vastly underrates public anger and cynicism. People were locked up at home on dubious data and science, forced to isolate from parents and grandchildren, unable to visit grandparents in their final days or attend family reunions, weddings, funerals, and birthdays, coerced into taking the shot in order to shop, travel, and keep jobs on false assurances of safety and effectiveness. Some of the worst offenders, responsible for the most egregious policies and thuggish enforcement measures, have been awarded the highest gongs going, promoted into governors’ mansions, and even promised a statue in their honour. The report’s solution to the overreach and abuse of power by authorities during Covid is to create even more bureaucratic structures with more powers and resources, including an Australian Centre for Disease Control even as the US CDC sinks into ever greater disrepute by the month. Governments grabbed too much power, coming uncomfortably close to becoming police states. Who but the same experts would staff the Australian CDC? This could potentially include one of the panellists, Catherine Bennett, who is professor of epidemiology at Deakin University. In an interview with SBS TV on 7 July 2022, she said, ‘We have to ensure people have all their recommended boosters because the booster…reduces the risk of serious illness quite dramatically.’ She also recommended ‘people wear face masks and maintain social distancing.’ It’s certainly not unknown for a government report to turn out to be a successful job application for one of the authors. It would incense many if those guilty of the biggest assault on Australians’ health, political, and economic freedoms in the nation’s history were to be rewarded with increased powers and resources to serially indulge their inner bullies. Dealing with the past is a prerequisite for imposing justified punishment for crimes against the people, enabling closure for the many physical injuries and emotional trauma of the totalitarian responses, and deterring future wrongdoers. This report doesn’t take us far on the path we must but are yet to travel.

Don’t Urge Hotels To Censor, Even In The Name Of Opposing Genocid...	Medea Benjamin has done much good in educating people about violent aspects of United States foreign policy and why such should be opposed. But, via a brief video Benjamin posted Thursday at Twitter, in which she calls on people to urge Hilton to cancel an upcoming event at one of its hotels, she is promoting a curtailment of speech that endangers her cause and individual rights more broadly. Hotels have managed to remain a refuge for free speech as a censorship trend has proceeded among major American companies. This refuge is very valuable for people opposing the expansion of government power at the expense of individual rights. And part of defending this refuge is accepting that hotels will host on occasion events you abhor or see as harmful. In Benjamin’s case such an event is a conference to be held on November 14-17 by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) at a Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas. 'Say no to the JNF; say no to genocide and ecocide,' concludes Benjamin in her video. The course Benjamin is pursuing in regard to this conference is detrimental for liberty in America and ultimately for her cause. As we have seen, it is the forces for expanded government power, including in the area of foreign policy, that have been able to direct the extensive censorship pursued by other sorts of companies. If liberty defenders and peace advocates do not stand up unequivocally for free speech, they are sure to lose. They may be able to shut down a 'bad' event here and there at the beginning. But, ultimately, expect the advocates of expansive government power, including the warmongers, to be the ones directing who hotels censor. By all means, educate people about events you oppose. But, beware of taking the censorship approach. That approach plays into the hands of the opponents of liberty and peace.

Days Of DEI In The Pentagon Should Be Numbered – OpEd	By Dave Patterson Governments, like people, all too often adopt beliefs that are not true. As the opening quotation from the movie The Big Short asserted: 'It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.' And when those who believe for sure what 'just ain’t so' include the Pentagon leadership, then America is in trouble. The promise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) falls squarely in the 'just ain’t so' category, as corporations are finding out. Will the Pentagon be the last to get it? DEI Is a Failure When Performance Is Demanded Many have seen all too well the performance of federal agencies that emphasize DEI over the quality of personnel. The Pentagon has favored DEI theories over merit for nearly four years, and there has been little to impede this trend – until now. President-elect Donald Trump will no doubt apply the brakes to DEI as he did in his first administration. 'To further advance equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation,' were the words codified in an executive order signed by President Joe Biden during his first year in office. Since then, the divisive nature of the DEI ideology has had a chilling effect on recruiting and retention. What the Pentagon should find particularly worrying is a recent report in The Wall Street Journal: 'The focus on DEI is driving an especially profound disillusionment among conservative veterans, the military’s longstanding support bedrock. Between 2019 and 2024, the percentage of conservative veterans who would advise a young family member to join the military declined from 88% to 53%. That almost entirely explains the shift in the broader veteran population. Far more conservative veterans cited the ‘military’s DEI and other social policies’ as a ‘major factor’ (85%) in withholding their endorsement.' This is especially troublesome since 80% of volunteers for military service have family members who were in the military. It’s more than likely that the US government’s DEI programs will be short-lived under a Trump presidency. The real question is, why were they installed in the first place? Evidence is building that whatever motives existed for embracing the DEI craze are rapidly disappearing. Many corporations that adopted the flawed notion are backing away. Aerospace and defense giant Boeing is the most recent to ditch DEI. 'Boeing reportedly dismantled its global diversity, equity, and inclusion department as part of an overhaul of its operations ordered by the company’s new top executive — becoming the latest major company to ditch the controversial initiative,' according to The New York Post. Dissolving DEI comes on the heels of billionaire Elon Musk criticizing Boeing for 'prioritizing DEI over safety and quality controls.' Boeing is not the only company that is repudiating DEI. 'First Tractor Supply and John Deere; then Harley-Davidson and Brown-Foreman Corp., then Ford and Molson Coors' are among Fortune 500 companies dropping DEI as corporate objectives, HR Drive reported. You would think that US government agencies would view this trend as a cautionary tale prompting a review of DEI initiatives. One might expect Pentagon leadership to understand that if DEI has failed in business, it is not worth pursuing as a mission goal for the nation’s defense. The US Military Cannot Fail to Keep Americans Safe While Americans depend on the US Armed Forces to keep them safe, the Pentagon is mired in the diversity, equity, and inclusion ethos, prioritizing the tenet that DEI delivers a military that mirrors society. At some level, it does that. But it is pure mythology that such a military service would be preferable to a fighting force focused on relevant accomplishments and skills. The Pentagon should observe the trend of corporations moving away from DEI and follow suit before it is ordered to by its new commander-in-chief. As the saying goes, 'A new broom sweeps clean.' DEI will be something in the dustbin, unencumbered by the past. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

Ralph Nader: Electing An American Fuhrer As Wall Street Cheers An...	On September 17, 1787, the last day after the drafting of our Constitution in Philadelphia, Ben Franklin was leaving the building when a prominent resident, Elizabeth Willing Powel, asked him 'Well Doctor, what have we got – a republic or a monarch?' Franklin replied, 'A republic, if you can keep it.' On November 5, 2024, our fragile Republic became a Monarchy-elect. A majority of voters elected a Dictator. This is no exaggeration. Look at just some of the damage Trump has done and the appalling things he has said. In July 2019, he declared 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as president.' And he did, throughout his four years, he violated all kinds of federal laws and provisions of the Constitution, mostly openly, with impunity. He obstructed justice from the White House as a way of life. He defied over 125 Congressional subpoenas. He is a very successful fugitive from justice with lawyers skilled at endlessly delaying judges and courts where federal and state prosecutors have obtained indictments. His convictions and adverse civil verdicts are like water on a duck’s back. He openly admires foreign dictators and meets with them proudly, musing about wanting to be more like them. Moreover, he is gathering around him a large number of vengeful, dictatorial Trumpsters readying to take over the federal departments and agencies. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, 900-page report prepared a detailed blueprint for the corporate state that is the definition of fascism, American style. Together with Trump, they have their 'enemies list' both individually and collectively. In speech after speech, Trump, Vance, and others have spoken as if they will have boundless power after January 20, 2025. They are not wrong. They control the compliant Republican House and the Senate. The U.S. Supreme Court (6 to 3) decided fanatically last June that a president’s 'official' conduct no matter how extreme was immune from criminal prosecution. Three of the Justices were Trump’s nominees. He believes his presidency will be above the law. There is no one to challenge him. Ordinary citizens have no 'legal standing' to sue. And as is the practice, he will replace all the federal prosecutors working at the Department of Justice, under the new Attorney General whom he chooses. Trump may be on facts and policies, 'dumb as a rock,' 'with a low IQ!' – to use his words about other persons, but when it comes to knowing the electorate and the mass media, he is a master magician who induces mass masochism. As with violent climate disruptions are 'a hoax, drill baby drill.' He weaves a web of fantasy about his past failed business and presidential records and constantly repeats his megalomaniac refrain: 'Only I can fix it.' His daily lies often come across to his supporters as a form of entertainment garnished with massaging their own grievances and biases into political campaign fodder. He tells those who think they are victims, that he is their savior. He promises a paradise in America in his next presidential term but doesn’t have a clue about how to get there. As far as the media, his denunciations of them, 'fake news,' and the 'failing New York Times,' only result in journalists giving him constant top-level coverage, even repeating in CAPITAL LETTERS his pejorative nicknames for people who are not given a chance to reply in the press. True, the major newspapers have exposed his numerous dark sides – whether personal against women, commercial against workers, students and creditors, against the government with his tax evasions, or as past president, with his brazen violations of law and overt unethical self-enrichment. Mark Green and I contributed two books– 'Fake President: Decoding Trump’s Gaslighting, Corruption, and General Bullsh*t' in 2019 and 'Wrecking America: How Trump’s Lawbreaking and Lies Betray All' in 2020 – about dangerous, corrupt Donald. However, in the end, nothing stuck or mattered. Do-little Donald’s fulminating lies were embraced by his followers. His slippery Teflon persona was underestimated. Voter acceptance of the Trumpian mirage reflects poorly on the majority of the voters who cast their ballots for him. Trump did have some crucial luck. A weak, arrogant Democratic Party leadership, loaded with inhibitory corporate campaign money, constrained by corporate conflicted political/media consultants, who control the Party’s campaigns and bar input from the experienced citizen community (see, winningamerica.net) made it impossible for the Democratic Party to learn from its past mistakes or its recurring disastrous strategies. Trump played the Democratic Party, from its bungling nomination process to the anemic Harris campaign like a fiddle – repeatedly, personally, and without a teleprompter, he fed his crowd blatant falsehoods, hateful rhetoric, and delusionary promises. And he gave the middle finger to the 'deep state.' People must realize they are, with all voters, in a two-party duopoly Trap, excluding full access to third-party and independent candidates. No Western country erects, as the U.S.A. does, such barriers to ballot access and many other exclusions and endless harassment. (See Theresa Amato’s book, 'Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny'). A competitive democracy we are not. Still, at the presidential level, alternative candidates are often on the ballot if not in the news or in the debates. But most voters want 'to be with a winner,' and glumly or willingly accept their electoral incarceration. Get ready this January for chaos, revenge, greed, rampant abuses of power, and the unbridled control of corrupt plutocrats and oligarchs. With Elon Musk in the lead. Fascistic states flow into exercises of terror. The majority of the voters have elected an American Fuhrer. Trump will be our founding father’s greatest nightmare. They inserted numerous protections in our Constitution to block another King George III tyrant with their separation of powers and checks and balances. Come 2025 these protections will be shredded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawD9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-08T17:42:43-08:00	
Climate Objectives Of COP29 May Be Unmet – Analysis	By Yi Wang The 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) will be held from November 11 to 22, 2024, in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Over 100 heads of state and government are expected to attend the conference. The primary goal of COP29 is for wealthy countries to support poorer nations in their efforts to combat climate change. To this end, participants are seeking to establish a climate action fund aimed at raising trillions of dollars, with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies. However, many leaders from the world's major economies will be absent from this important event. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.S. President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have all canceled their plans to attend. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have also stated they will not participate. Neither Mexico nor China has been included in the agenda for leaders' speeches at the UN climate summit. Whether due to domestic political developments or personal reasons, their absence signals that COP29 negotiations are unlikely to yield a new climate action agreement, making it difficult to secure additional financial resources. This hesitation among developed countries in fulfilling their climate commitments suggests uncertainty about the outcomes of the conference. Western countries, particularly in Europe and the U.S., have notably downplayed the issue of moving away from fossil fuels.' For them, the more pressing concerns are energy security, price stability, and inflation reduction. Following the U.S. presidential election, after the victory of Donald Trump, it is expected that oil and gas production will increase to lower electricity costs. South Korean officials are considering increasing imports of U.S. oil and natural gas. Changes in Germany's coalition government also highlight the challenges of balancing economic transformation with key measures for emissions reduction, pointing to significant political divisions in decision-making. Global investors are increasingly dissatisfied with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulatory requirements and, in the pursuit of higher returns, are willing to abandon their green commitments. British oil giant BP has announced plans to abandon its restrictions on fossil fuel production, with its new strategy focusing on investing in oil and gas in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. Shell had earlier indicated it might slow down its emissions reduction efforts, and its latest energy transition strategy has lowered its targets. Moving away from fossil fuels is proving to be a hard task. Amid various disruptions and obstacles, momentum seems to be waning. Hence, the expectations for climate financing at COP29 are likely to fall short this year. 1. Localized military conflicts and their increased intensity are generating the most carbon emissions. Parties have failed to reach agreements on ceasefires, and negotiations on military withdrawals are unlikely to form any substantial agreements. Military activities are consuming vast amounts of resources, placing a greater burden of responsibility for global climate change and damage. In developed Western countries, military spending continues to rise, while domestic economic growth slows, making it difficult to quickly deliver on climate financing commitments. 2. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, armed conflicts in the Red Sea, and other tense situations, flights have been rerouted, and commercial ships have altered their paths, further complicating efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Many air routes have been forced to change, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions on both land and sea. Emissions reductions in aviation have a long way to go, especially in terms of reducing the use of traditional aviation fuel. Transportation costs have already risen sharply in many countries, and prioritizing survival has become more important than other concerns. The loss of enthusiasm for climate action may be unavoidable. 3. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence applications has led to a rapid expansion in electricity demand. The production of chips, the construction of cloud data centers, and cryptocurrency mining all consume vast amounts of electricity. In the short term, addressing power shortages is more urgent than the source to generate electricity, and most countries are unable to complete a full transition to clean energy in time. This year is expected to be the hottest one on record, with an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, torrential rainfall, and typhoons, alongside the proliferation of infectious diseases and declines in agricultural yields. These trends are largely driven by climate change and its far-reaching effects. As the full scope of these risks becomes increasingly apparent, it is of utmost importance to critically assess the intricate interplay between economic and social development and climate change. This is not a concern limited to a select few or political leaders. Rather, the climate agenda is inextricably linked to the collective well-being, resilience, and long-term sustainability of societies and individuals across the globe.

Germany: Chancellor Signals Openness To Deal On Earlier Snap Elec...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suggested he would be open to negotiations on an earlier election date in exchange for opposition backing on key legislation, which could trigger snap elections sooner than planned. This marks a notable shift from Scholz’s previous announcement that he would call a vote of confidence on 15 January to hold elections 'by the end of March' after his coalition government broke down on Wednesday (6 November). Scholz said on Friday (8 November) that the 'democratic' parties in parliament would have to come to an agreement on which laws could be passed by the end of the year. 'That understanding could also answer which point in time is the right one to hold the vote of confidence in the Bundestag, also with regard to a possible date for snap elections,' Scholz told journalists at an informal EU summit in Budapest on Friday. He said the discussion on the election date would have to proceed 'with calm.' Prior to this, Scholz had resisted demands to hold an immediate vote of confidence at a meeting on Thursday with Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU leader and frontrunner in the election, according to Merz. Scholz cannot be constitutionally forced to hold a vote of confidence and subsequent elections before the slated election date on 28 September 2025. However, his minority government is dependent on opposition votes to pass any remaining legislation. Scholz refused to detail whether there were specific laws that he would insist on in order to agree to earlier elections. But shortly after Scholz's statement, it emerged that Germany's Federal Returning Office had warned the chancellor against holding elections too early. Ruth Brand, the agency's leader, said that setting 'dates and deadlines' during the Christmas season or New Year's Eve would make important election preparations 'virtually impossible to realise.' A snap election must be called within 60 days after the dissolution of the parliament, which has to follow within 21 days of a vote of confidence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawJSc96iO33yr	2024-11-08T17:33:07-08:00	
NATO-Type Southeast Asian Defense Alliance Not Feasible At Presen...	By Jason Gutierrez A Southeast Asian defense alliance modeled after NATO and aimed at countering China may not be set up any time soon because the region’s nations would want to maintain good relations with the superpower, regional security analysts said. The creation of more minilateral agreements, though, rather than multilateral ones like the 32-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are not only likely but may be more effective, they added. A minilateral agreement is an accord between a small group of nations that have come together to achieve mutual goals or tackle shared problems, according to international relations experts. For instance, a good example is a minilateral agreement renewed last year by the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia for joint patrols on their seas, said geopolitics expert Don McLain Gill. 'The most we can expect [in the form of a defense alliance] for now is an area- specific and time-dependent security cooperation between particular states in the region in a way that would also reflect individual varying sensitivities,' he told BenarNews. Another lecturer from the university concurred. 'I think that [creating] minilaterals is more plausible,' political science lecturer Sherwin Ona told BenarNews. 'I also think that armed enforcement has its limitations and has a tendency for escalation.' Established in 1949, NATO commits its 32-member countries to each other's defense in the event any are attacked. Aside from the United States, other NATO members include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Canada Conversation about a regional NATO, Asian or Southeast Asian, revived after now-Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba wrote a paper late September for think-tank Hudson Institute about his proposal for such a defense alliance. '[T]he absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense,' Ichiba wrote late September. 'Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' added the then-candidate for prime minister added. The proposal was rejected by the United States and India said it doesn’t share Ishiba’s vision. Similar ideas have irritated Beijing, which sees itself as the main focusof these proposals, in the same way that Moscow has accused NATO of concentrating its defense efforts against Russia. In Southeast Asia specifically as well, the idea of a NATO-like grouping has been talked about in response to some countries claiming harassment by Beijing’s vessels in the South China Sea, where they have overlapping claims. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea, but its claims overlap those of Taiwan, which isn’t a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which are. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. trod carefully when asked on Tuesday about a grouping similar to NATO consisting of the 10 members of ASEAN. 'I don't think it is possible at this time because of the dichotomies and divergence between country interests,' Teodoro answered at the venue of a private conference in Manila. Still, he acknowledged the need to boost multilateral security alliances. Teodoro noted that Manila has a bilateral defense alliance with Washington since 1951, even before it became one of the Southeast Asian countries to set up the ASEAN in 1967. Sherwin Ona, a political science lecturer at Manila’s De La Salle University, told BenarNews that ASEAN nations would stick to the bloc’s 'non-interference policy.' Besides, some Southeast Asian countries are very pro-Beijing because their economies are heavily dependent on China, indicated Ona. 'I agree [with Teodoro] about the beneficial relationship between countries that are pro-Beijing.' Another reason Southeast Asian countries may be cool to the idea of an 'Asian NATO' is because they have different security interests, noted a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. 'This is because most countries are convinced that a multilateral security architecture will only elevate regional insecurities, and make them subservient to great power contestations,' Abhishek Sharma wrote on Deccan Herald. 'Loose, flexible' minilaterals Minilaterals are 'loose and flexible,' believes Gill. 'This is not NATO’s established collective security structure,' he said. Minilaterals are 'only as good as they last.' Gill explained that if one country in a three-nation minilateral agreement felt it did not any longer share the same interest with the other two, 'it can walk out anytime.' Geopolitical analyst Julio Amador III believes a network of 'minilateral ties' might be able to offset this shortcoming and would be more effective. Additionally, he said there was a way ASEAN as a bloc could become 'a formidable diplomatic counterweight.' If the group’s members, particularly those that drift towards China, agree that there are some issues 'that go beyond national interests, that there are issues that do matter to the collective interests of the group,' ASEAN could be powerful, Amador said. However, De La Salle University’s Gill said that the character of Southeast Asian cooperation tended to be based mostly on mutual interest. 'An ASEAN version of NATO is unlikely going to happen given the nature of ASEAN,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawMi6QlmHplcK	2024-11-08T17:31:14-08:00	
Trump’s Win Could Lead To Push For Peace In Ukraine, But On Whose...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- The common view is that an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine is nowhere in sight. But Donald Trump’s election could generate a push to reach a peace deal -- with Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and others wrangling over the potential terms. Trump’s victory in the November 5 presidential vote set the clock ticking, in a way, because he repeatedly said during the campaign that he would be able to end the war very quickly if elected, without even waiting for his inauguration on January 20. Russian President Vladimir Putin seized on this in his first public remarks about the U.S. election result, saying on November 7 that what he called Trump’s statements about a desire to 'revive relations' with Russia and help end the war in Ukraine 'deserve attention, to say the least.' That comment came amid high praise from Putin for Trump: He said that the now president-elect had shown 'courage' and 'acted like a man' when a would-be assassin shot at him in July, and that his impression was that during his 2017-2021 term, Trump was straitjacketed and prevented from pursuing his goals. Putin’s words were delivered in a way that was clearly meant to seem casual and off-the-cuff. But they suggest that the Kremlin will try to leverage the change of power in the United States, and Trump’s hopes of brokering peace, in a bid to further its own goals in Ukraine. Big Challenges However, there’s no sign that Moscow has abandoned its stated goals, which include Russian control over five Ukrainian regions in their entirety and a permanent ban on Ukraine joining NATO. The morning after Putin made his remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov seemed eager to drive that message home. He said Putin has repeatedly mentioned that Russia is open for dialogue but that the president 'has never said that the goals [of the invasion] have changed.' With its forces advancing in eastern Ukraine at a faster pace than they have since a few months after the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Moscow does not seem to be in the mood for compromise. Putin’s Security Council chief, Sergei Shoigu, also suggested that Moscow is open to talks, but only on its own terms. 'Now, when the situation in the theater of military operations is not in favor of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice -- to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognize the current realities and start negotiating,' Shoigu said on November 7. That’s one of the big challenges facing any bid by Trump to end the war: A cease-fire or peace on terms that satisfy Moscow would likely be seen as a defeat for Kyiv and could leave Russia in a position to threaten Ukraine and even the West. That would be hard for the White House to cast as a geopolitical victory. With Trump’s inauguration 10 weeks away, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trying to prevent that from happening. He is urging the West to deliver more weapons, to help Ukraine improve its position on the battlefield and pave the way for a 'just peace,' warning that giving Russia what it wants would be a grave mistake. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in a speech at a European Political Community meeting in Budapest on November 7. Rifts In The West Divisions in the West threaten to play into Russia’s hands. Speaking in Budapest on November 8, European Council President Charles Michel echoed Zelenskiy, saying, 'We have to strengthen Ukraine, to support Ukraine, because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin, but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world.' But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an ally of Trump who is also close to Putin, voiced something close to the opposite position. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a [Ukrainian] military defeat,' Orban said. 'The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' But whether that will happen is not yet clear, despite Trump’s repeated statements that the war must end, and his criticism of the tens of billions of dollars in military and other support the United States has provided Ukraine under President Joe Biden. Beyond indications that he would use the volume of aid to Ukraine as leverage in getting Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table, Trump has said little about how he would go about trying to stop the fighting, so the approach he chooses remains a crucial variable as his new term approaches. Trump’s advisers have presented ideas, some of them publicly. But in a November 6 report that cited unnamed allies of Trump, The Wall Street Journal reported that he 'hasn’t approved a specific peace plan' or settled on a way to get Putin and Zelenskiy 'to sit at the same table and negotiate.'

France To ‘Expand And Diversify’ Naval Presence In Asia-Pacific	France is preparing for the deployment of its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the next four weeks, the French navy has announced, amid reports it may head to Asia-Pacific waters. The navy said in a press release that the crew of the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle carried out a three-week training session on Oct. 4-25 in the Mediterranean in order to regain operational capability after a recent technical shutdown that lasted nearly four months. The crew has now embarked on a final four-week logistical and operational preparation at the quayside before the next deployment of the Charles de Gaulle in a 'constituted carrier battle group,' the navy said in the release without specifying where the carrier strike group would be heading to. Before this announcement, however, the Naval News quoted a senior French officer as saying that the months-long deployment would take place in the eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and 'possibly the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean.' The carrier strike group could make first, 'historic' calls to Japan and the Philippines, the Paris-based publication said. Apart from the Charles de Gaulle, the strike group may include several other warships, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, a logistics support ship and some support and assistance vessels. The air wing is set to include two E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft, 24 Rafale Marine jets and four helicopters. About 3,000 sailors and naval aviators would take part in several exercises during the deployment, among which a multinational exercise would 'focus on the theme of maritime security in the Indonesian straits,' Naval News said. China’s reaction 'This deployment is significant because it marks a major expansion of France’s presence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies. 'Since the announcement of France’s Indo-Pacific Strategy in 2019, the French military’s presence in the region has really grown and diversified,' Blandin told Radio Free Asia. Last week, Taiwan’s ministry of defense said that a French naval vessel sailed through the Taiwan Strait from the south to the north. Notably, the Prairial (F731) – a Floreal-class frigate – was sailing on the west side of the median line closer to China, unlike U.S. and Canadian ships, which normally pass east of the median line closer to Taiwan. Beijing did not immediately protest against the transit but on Nov. 4, the Communist Party-sanctioned Global Times published an article denouncing the possible deployment of the Charles de Gaulle carrier strike group in the Indo-Pacific. The Chinese news outlet quoted analysts as saying that the deployment 'is an attempt to pander to NATO’s expansion into the Asia-Pacific, which is detrimental to regional peace and stability.' Zhang Junshe, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that despite being the only country outside the U.S. that possesses a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, France’s strength in this area was limited. Zhang warned that 'neither the countries nor the people of the Asia-Pacific region want external forces to build up their military presence in the region to sow discord and intensify regional tensions.' French comeback Paris has a long history of involvement in the region and after a period of relative inactivity, it seems it is making a strategic comeback. France has several arms deals in the Asia-Pacific, with Indonesia, Singapore and most recently, a US$438-million aid project to provide 40 patrol vessels and logistical support to the Philippine Coast Guard. 'The Philippines can be seen as one of the new cornerstones of France’s strategic presence in the region,' said Blandin. France and the Philippines agreed to enhance cooperation in December 2023 and a French defense attaché office was established in the Philippines in May this year. Frigate Vendémiaire participated in the Balikatan exercise in April and the destroyer Bretagne made a port call in Manila from May 31 to June 4. The frigate Prairial that recently transited the Taiwan Strait also conducted a goodwill visit to Cebu between Oct. 22-25. 'The French military is in the process of negotiating a visiting forces agreement with the Philippines, which is expected to conclude in the first semester of 2025,' said Blandin. 'Paris wants to put its name back on the map.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawOlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-08T17:24:54-08:00	
Despite The Bombast, Trump Never Turned His Back On Europe – Anal...	By Luke Coffey Donald Trump’s historic presidential victory has already sent ripples through Europe, as allies and partners wonder what it means for transatlantic relations. During his first term, Trump’s rhetoric often made European leaders uneasy, but beneath the bombast his administration arguably did more to bolster Europe’s security than any US president since Ronald Reagan. After a rocky start marked by his infamous press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the Trump administration implemented policies that significantly strengthened NATO and US commitments in Europe. By the time Trump left there were more American troops stationed in Europe than when he took office. The US also increased military exercises and stationed forces further east, including Poland. Trump sharply criticized European defense spending and questioned America’s role in European security, but his actions told a different story: US defense spending for Europe, through the European Deterrence Initiative, was more than 40 percent greater than under the Obama administration. Trump’s record on Ukraine also deserves recognition. He was the first US president to provide advanced anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, when his predecessor offered only non-lethal aid. Trump also supplied air defense and anti-tank systems to Georgia within his first year in office, something the Obama administration had resisted for eight years. On broader geopolitical matters, the Trump administration was ahead of the curve. He was a vocal critic of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which deepened Europe’s energy dependence on Russia. While this stance strained relations with Germany, it was welcomed by many Central and Eastern European nations wary of Moscow’s influence. Trump also imposed economic sanctions on companies involved in the pipeline's construction — sanctions lifted by his successor. Additionally, Trump championed the Three Seas Initiative, led by Poland and Croatia, which aimed to enhance infrastructure, connectivity, and trade across Central and Eastern Europe. His administration also oversaw the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats in history, withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty over Russian violations, and welcomed North Macedonia and Montenegro into NATO, strengthening the alliance. The Europe Trump knew in his first term, however, has changed dramatically. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call for European defense. When Trump first took office in 2017, only a handful of NATO members met the alliance’s 2 percent of GDP defense spending target, with the European average at 1.46 percent. Collectively, NATO’s European members spent $254 billion annually on defense. Today, 23 of NATO’s 32 members meet the target and the European average has risen to 2 percent. Annual defense spending by NATO’s European members now totals $380 billion, a significant increase that will undoubtedly be welcomed by Trump. While Europeans need to do more in this area it is undeniable that this has been good news. The biggest question, however, is how Trump will handle Russia’s war in Ukraine. The invasion has reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the transatlantic alliance in ways not seen since the 1940s. While Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war quickly, he has yet to outline a concrete plan for doing so. His meeting in September with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered some insight. Trump emphasized the need for a 'fair' resolution to the conflict but stopped short of detailing how he would balance Ukrainian sovereignty with Russia’s demands. Given the high stakes, a kneejerk approach is unlikely. Instead, Trump will probably take time to craft a coherent policy on Ukraine, drawing on his administration’s past successes in Europe. For European leaders, the focus now is on how to work with Trump’s second administration. Fortunately, they do so from a stronger position. Europe’s increased defense spending and greater commitment to its own security will be welcomed in Washington. There's a far greater awareness in Europe today of the challenges and threats posed by China than there was during Trump’s first administration. Even with Ukraine, Europe has stepped up to the plate and spends as much as the US does. Some around Trump will argue that Europe is yesterday’s news, and there should be a renewed focus on Asia. The reality is different: Europe is too important for America’s economic well-being to ignore. Perhaps the future of the global economy is in Asia, but right now half of the world's GDP is shared between North America and Europe. Europe is responsible for two thirds of foreign investment into the US, and 48 of the 50 American states export more to Europe than they do to China. In the end, Trump’s return presents both risks and opportunities for European security. If he can navigate the complexities of the Ukraine war and broader transatlantic relations with the same strategic pragmatism his administration demonstrated the first time around, his second term could leave a lasting positive legacy. But if he gets Ukraine wrong and misjudges his engagement with Putin, this could have consequences not only for transatlantic security but for other regions too, such as east Asia and the Middle East. The future of transatlantic security depends not only on what Trump does next but also on how Europe rises to the occasion. History has shown that when America and Europe stand united, both sides benefit. The foundation for transatlantic cooperation remains solid. The challenge for Trump will be to build on this foundation while addressing the new realities posed by Russia’s aggression. Europe, for its part, must continue to step up, ensuring that its security framework is robust and meets the new geopolitical challenges. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

US Exposes Iranian-Directed Network Plotting Trump Assassination	By Jeff Seldin Iranian operatives sought to assassinate now President-elect Doanld Trump just weeks before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and were willing to forego other plots against regime critics and high-profile targets to see it through, court documents say. The revelations, in documents unsealed Friday against the suspects in an unrelated murder-for-hire plot, stem from a series of conversations between the alleged ringleader, 51-year-old Farhad Shakeri, and the FBI. The documents indicate that Shakeri, who said he was in Tehran at the time of the conversations, agreed to speak with the FBI to gain a reduced prison sentence for an unnamed prisoner in the U.S. Shakeri told the agents that an official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached him in mid- to late September, asking him to set aside a plot to kill an Iranian dissident and journalist in New York, to instead go after Trump. Shakeri said he was asked to provide a plan within seven days and that when he said targeting Trump would be costly, the IRGC official told him, 'We have already spent a lot of money … money's not an issue.' He also told the FBI that if a plan could not be formulated within the seven-day timeframe, the IRGC official planned to wait until after the U.S. election, reasoning Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him. The court documents do not say whether Shakeri’s conversations with the FBI were authorized by the IRGC or other authorities in Iran. The Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The plot against Trump is just the latest in what U.S. officials have described as brazen attempts by Tehran to kill the former and future U.S. president in retaliation for a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force. In August, U.S. officials charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, who had traveled to the United States months earlier on behalf of Iran looking for hitmen to kill Trump and others. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday. 'We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,' he added. U.S. officials have been especially concerned about Iran's repeated use of criminal gangs and others to carry out its dirty work ((plotting)) on American soil. Court documents allege Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, fits the description. The documents say Shakeri was deported from the U.S. in 2008, after spending 14 years in prison for robbery. But they add that during his time behind bars, Shakeri cultivated a network of criminal associates that he then would use in efforts to carry out Iran's orders. According to prosecutors, one of those associates was working with Shakeri up until the U.S. election to kill VOA Persian Service journalist Masih Alinejad, described in the court documents as 'an Iranian American journalist, author, and political activist, and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime's human rights abuses and corruption.' The associate, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, then turned to one of his acquaintances, 36-year-old Jonathan Loadholt, to carry out the attack for a sum of $100,000. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested Thursday. Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of 10 to 20 years. Shakeri is also charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Alinejad on Friday expressed astonishment that she was wrapped up in the plot to kill the president-elect. 'I am shocked,' she wrote on the X social media platform. '[T]he person assigned to assassinate @realDonaldTrump was also assigned to kill me on U.S. soil.' 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don't want to die,' she said. 'Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me.' Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged a senior IRGC official in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Alinejad in 2022.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawH95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-08T17:19:52-08:00	
Riding The Trump Wave: India’s Gamble With A Tumultuous Ally – An...	The world has taken notice of Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election. The presidential elections in the United States have a significant impact on regional security, economic policy, and international diplomacy due to its status as a global superpower. India, one of the United States’ closest strategic allies, also eagerly anticipated this outcome, and many Indians see Trump's comeback as a chance for deeper bilateral relations and strategic advantages. But there are also serious potential drawbacks, which puts India in a difficult balancing position. Will India face unexpected difficulties under Trump's leadership, or could it be a game changer? In order to understand the implications of Donald Trump for India, it is essential to analyze his objectives for America and contextualize India, a significant player in US strategy, albeit not as crucial as some in India may assume, within that framework. The Unprecedented Comeback: Trump’s 2024 Win and Cleveland’s Legacy Reimagined Donald Trump’s extraordinary reascendancy to the U.S. presidency in 2024 draws historical comparisons to Grover Cleveland, the sole president prior to Trump to hold non-consecutive terms. Cleveland, who held office from 1885 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897, epitomized political resilience by losing his re-election campaign yet successfully reclaiming his position through a concerted and strategic resurgence. Similar to Cleveland, Trump utilized his time away from the White House to sustain public prominence, openly criticizing the policies of his successor and echoing voter dissatisfaction. Cleveland's relentless opposition to the elevated tariffs enacted by President Benjamin Harrison capitalized on economic discontent, which ultimately catalyzed his political resurgence. This strategy reflects Trump's 2024 campaign, in which he leveraged prevalent dissatisfaction arising from economic instability, including inflation and perceived policy shortcomings under President Joe Biden. Trump’s resurgence can be ascribed to a multitude of factors that parallel Cleveland's historical context while also being distinctly modern. His triumph was propelled by a confluence of anti-incumbency sentiment, substantial backing in rural America, strategic augmentation of his minority constituency, and his capacity to sustain credibility among voters as an unvarnished, genuine political figure. Cleveland opposed federal expenditure initiatives that he believed undermined American resilience, whereas Trump's policies focused on pledges of economic revitalization and national pride, appealing to a substantial segment of the electorate, particularly those who felt marginalized by the Democrats. Furthermore, Trump's coalition-building tactics resembled those of Cleveland's political operatives, who maintained his visibility despite challenges. Trump also gained from a demographic transformation, garnering heightened support from Latino and Black voters while solidifying allegiance among rural, working-class whites. Kamala Harris's campaign, by contrast, faced challenges in addressing economic criticisms and reconciling internal contradictions within the Democratic platform. Concerns regarding perceived hypocrisy in foreign policy positions and the inability to mobilize essential voter demographics, particularly women, further highlighted Trump's advantage. Trump's unrepentant demeanor, despite his controversial policies, starkly contrasted with the perceived inconsistency of the Democrats, facilitating a historic and uncommon political resurgence. Trump’s Transactional Blueprint for America's Objectives and Its Impact on U.S.-India Relations Donald Trump’s goals for America highlight a focus on transactions and trade, characterized by economic nationalism and protectionist policies. His focus encompasses the implementation of comprehensive tariffs aimed at addressing trade imbalances, emphasizing the importance of reciprocal agreements, and confronting adversaries such as China with substantial tariffs, potentially reaching 60% or higher. Trump appears to focus on immediate outcomes rather than fostering enduring partnerships or engaging in multilateral agreements, as evidenced by his previous actions and the strategy he may adopt in a potential second term (Sharma, 2024). In the context of India, it is probable that Trump's strategy would be characterized by a transactional nature. He would assess India's value through measurable advantages for the U.S., like job creation or heightened exports, instead of focusing on the overarching objective of countering China or fostering enduring strategic relationships. India's role as a significant ally in countering China is recognized; however, Trump's interactions with India are expected to prioritize trade balance and the protection of U.S. interests. During his previous term, he implemented tariffs on Indian goods and demonstrated hesitance to prioritize stronger relations without evident mutual advantages. Furthermore, the human rights issues raised by the Democrats may not be as significant during Trump's administration, which could reduce certain bilateral tensions while underscoring a 'quid pro quo' approach. It can be said that the policy of Trump 2.0 regarding India is expected to be characterized by a distinct approach focused on transactional relationships. The institutional strength of the India-US relationship guarantees its ongoing existence, yet the extent and character of its development will depend on Trump’s priorities. Should the relationship correspond with his ‘America First’ agenda and yield tangible advantages, it could experience instances of collaboration. Under Trump’s extractive framework, India is likely to encounter pressures such as tariffs and demands for reciprocal benefits. Strategic collaboration remains a possibility, particularly in countering China's influence. However, India needs to approach Trump’s demand-driven strategy with caution to sustain and strengthen the bilateral partnership while safeguarding its wider strategic and economic interests. Potential Benefits for India Despite the complexities, Trump’s presidency holds a promising horizon for India-U.S. relations, given the alignment on certain strategic priorities and Trump's public admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 1. Strengthening the Strategic Partnership Trump's presidency may signify a more robust U.S.-India strategic alliance, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. His administration is expected to strengthen India's position as a counterbalance to China. This alignment was evident during Trump's first term, characterized by the initiation of a strong Indo-Pacific strategy with India as a central ally. This strategy is crucial for India, which has been entangled in territorial and economic disputes with China, especially along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas. India's role in counterbalancing China's influence is anticipated to be pivotal to U.S. policy, likely enhancing collaboration within frameworks such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with Japan and Australia. 2. Enhanced Defense and Security Ties During the Trump administration, defense cooperation may achieve new milestones. Trump's preference for high-value defense agreements may facilitate India's acquisition of advanced U.S. technologies, thereby aiding the modernization of its defense infrastructure. Joint military exercises may increase in scale and frequency, thereby improving India’s preparedness and promoting interoperability between Indian and U.S. forces. A renewed emphasis on defense partnerships may enhance India’s indigenous defense production capabilities via technology transfers and joint ventures, similar to agreements established during Trump’s prior term, including the sale of advanced helicopters and other defense equipment. 3. Revitalized Trade Relations Trump's transactional trade approach could be advantageous for India if bilateral trade negotiations are initiated between the two nations. India has encountered trade tensions with the U.S. regarding tariffs; however, Trump's emphasis on individual trade agreements may enable India to obtain more favorable conditions, particularly in the sectors of technology, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. This strategy may facilitate the expansion of markets for India's agricultural products, enhancing exports and supporting the Indian economy. The balance will be crucial, as the U.S. may pursue concessions in specific sectors. 4. Enhanced Energy and Technology Cooperation Trump's pro-energy policies are expected to enhance collaboration in the energy sector, allowing India to increase its LNG imports and thereby mitigate its energy deficit. The administration may promote investment in India's expanding technology sector, particularly in essential domains such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. These collaborations align with India's objectives of technological advancement and digital transformation. 5. Counterterrorism and Security Cooperation The Trump administration's strong position on counterterrorism may benefit India, which has faced challenges related to cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan. Trump's support could intensify pressure on Pakistan to confront terrorist organizations operating within its territory. Improved intelligence-sharing between the two nations may bolster India's capacity to address regional security challenges, particularly regarding threats from groups active in Kashmir. 6. Improved Diaspora Relations Trump's acknowledgment of the contributions made by the Indian-American community may enhance relations between the two countries. Relaxing H-1B visa restrictions could enable the entry of skilled Indian professionals into the U.S., thereby increasing remittances to India. Trump's favorable stance towards the Indian community has garnered significant support in India, and improved relations with the diaspora are expected to bolster India's soft power in the United States. 7. Support for Religious Minorities in South Asia In recent declarations, Trump has expressed his backing for Hindu minorities encountering difficulties in Bangladesh, a matter that has struck a chord with numerous individuals in India. Should his administration choose to extend support for the protection of religious minorities, it could effectively address the concerns of Hindus and other minority groups in the neighboring regions of India, thereby reflecting a cohesive commitment to the principle of religious freedom. Potential Challenges for India While the prospects appear promising, the reemergence of Trump may also introduce considerable obstacles. His frequently erratic and transactional approach to diplomacy, coupled with his 'America First' doctrine, may not consistently correspond with India's strategic objectives. 1. Paroxysm in Foreign Policy Trump's approach to foreign policy can be very transactional, frequently putting immediate financial gain ahead of long-term strategic partnerships. His snap decisions have left allies reeling, as evidenced by the sudden withdrawal from Afghanistan. Such uncertainty could make long-term strategic objectives, such as attempts to balance China and participate positively in the Quad, more difficult for India, which prioritizes stability in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. 2. Strained Trade Relations Trump's protectionist policies may result in trade friction. Critiques of trade imbalances with partners, such as India, may lead to heightened tariffs or more stringent regulations. Stricter trade policies may present significant risks to India's IT and pharmaceutical sectors, which depend heavily on U.S. markets, potentially restricting market access and impacting economic growth. 3. Restrictive Immigration Policies Trump has praised Indian contributions to the United States; however, his position on immigration, particularly regarding H-1B visas, poses a potential issue. The enforcement of stricter regulations on work visas may negatively impact the Indian workforce in the United States, influencing remittances and India's expanding influence via its diaspora. Policies designed to limit immigration may hinder opportunities for Indian professionals and students. 4. Reduced U.S. Engagement in South Asia A Trump administration prioritizing a reduction in U.S. engagement in global conflicts may create a power vacuum in South Asia, which could advantage entities opposed to Indian interests. This encompasses Pakistan, where diminished U.S. influence may encourage cross-border terrorism. India prioritizes regional stability, and a reduced U.S. presence may intensify security challenges in Afghanistan and surrounding areas. 5. Environmental and Climate Concerns Trump's prior withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and his pronounced focus on fossil fuels raise significant concerns for India, a nation susceptible to the effects of climate change. A diminished U.S. commitment to global climate initiatives may jeopardize collective efforts to address climate issues, thereby impacting India's ambitious goals for renewable energy and environmental sustainability. 6. Increased U.S.-China Tensions Trump's assertive approach toward China could heighten regional tensions, potentially compelling India to adopt a clear position. India's cautious approach towards China is influenced by the potential destabilization of the region due to an intensified U.S.-China rivalry, which could affect trade owing to India's economic and strategic interdependence with China. Conclusion India faces both opportunities and challenges as a result of Trump's potential comeback to the presidency. Even though his policies might help India fight China, improve defense cooperation, and build relationships with the Indian diaspora, his transactional, trade-centric style and propensity for abrupt changes could strain the two countries' relationship. India must carefully manage this relationship, striking a balance between the real advantages of a U.S.-India partnership led by a transactional leader and its strategic autonomy. The ability of Trump's administration to successfully combine its deal-driven, pragmatic approach with the stability required for a robust, long-term U.S.-India alliance will ultimately determine whether his presidency is a 'game changer' or a diplomatic challenge for India. To ensure that it can reap the rewards of this partnership while defending its national interests, India's diplomatic flexibility will be crucial.

Notre Dame Bells Ring For First Time Since Devastating Fire 5 Yea...	By Madalaine Elhabbal The bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have rung for the first time since April 2019, when a devastating fire broke out in the spire and roof of the historic French church. Notre-Dame of Paris passed the major milestone today at about 10:30 a.m., just one month away from its highly anticipated reopening on Dec. 8. Housed in the northern belfry of the cathedral — which had been partially destroyed by the fire — the bells rang out one at a time, then sounded out together, according to AFP. Though authorities have not determined whether the fire was an accident, an initial investigation found that it could have been caused by an electrical malfunction. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately announced his intention to repair the cathedral within five years and even called for alternative contemporary proposals to reconstruct the church. For a brief period, debates swirled over whether the French government would sanction such an update instead of preserving Notre Dame’s original character. However, the French Parliament soon passed a bill stipulating that reconstruction efforts must 'preserve the historic, artistic, and architectural interest' of the historic cathedral. Macron officially declared a year later, in 2020, that the reconstruction would seek to resemble the original structure in the interest of finishing the project ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Notre Dame Cathedral was built between the 12th and 14th centuries. Its spire was first completed in the 13th century but was ultimately replaced in the 19th century on account of damage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawGs9DXMsZ1pc	2024-11-08T17:08:39-08:00	
UN Accuses Israel Of ‘Deliberate’ Attack On Peacekeeping Position...	By Ephrem Kossaify The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon on Friday said two Israeli excavators and a bulldozer destroyed part of a fence and a concrete structure in one of its positions in Ras Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon added that in response to its 'urgent protest,' the Israel Defense Forces denied any activity was taking place inside its position. UNIFIL is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation line with Israel, an area that has seen more than a year of fighting that turned into fierce clashes since last month between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters. Israel claims that UN forces provide cover for Hezbollah, and has told UNIFIL to evacuate peacekeepers from southern Lebanon for their own safety. But UNIFIL said the incident, which took place on Thursday, 'like seven other similar incidents, is not a matter of peacekeepers getting caught in the crossfire, but of deliberate and direct actions by the IDF.' UNIFIL issued a statement warning that 'the IDF’s deliberate and direct destruction of clearly identifiable UNIFIL property is a flagrant violation of international law and resolution 1701.' It called on the IDF and all other actors to honor 'their obligation to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.' UNIFIL also expressed concern over the destruction and removal this week of two of the blue barrels that mark the UN-delineated line of withdrawal between Lebanon and Israel (the Blue Line). Peacekeepers said they directly observed the IDF removing one of them. 'Despite the unacceptable pressures being exerted on the mission through various channels, peacekeepers will continue to undertake our mandated monitoring and reporting tasks under resolution 1701,' UNIFIL said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIfoP8GGySvr	2024-11-08T17:04:25-08:00	
Beyond Deep Learning: Advancing Affective Computing With Diverse ...	Affective computing, a field focused on understanding and emulating human emotions, has seen significant advancements thanks to deep learning. However, researchers at the Technical University of Munich caution that an over-reliance on deep learning may hinder progress by overlooking other emerging trends in artificial intelligence. Their review, published in Intelligent Computing, a Science Partner Journal, advocate using a variety of AI methodologies to tackle ongoing challenges in affective computing. Affective computing uses various signals, such as facial expressions, voice and language cues, alongside physiological signals and wearable sensors to analyze and synthesize affect. While deep learning has significantly improved tasks like emotion recognition through innovations in transfer learning, self-supervised learning and transformer architectures, it also presents challenges, including poor generalization, cultural adaptability issues and a lack of interpretability. To address these limitations, the authors outline a comprehensive framework for developing embodied agents capable of interacting with multiple users in many different contexts. A key to this vision is the assessment of users’ goals, mental states and interrelationships for the purpose of facilitating longer interactions. The authors recommend integrating the following nine components, which they describe in detail, to improve human-agent interactions: 1. Graphs that map user relationships and context. 2. Capsules that model hierarchies for understanding affective interactions. 3. Neurosymbolic Engines that facilitate reasoning about interactions using affective primitives. 4. Symbols that establish common knowledge and rules for interaction. 5. Embodiment that enables collaborative learning in constrained environments. 6. Personalization that tailors interactions to individual user characteristics. 7. Generative AI that creates responses across multiple modalities. 8. Causal models that differentiate causes and effects for higher-order reasoning. 9. Spiking neural networks that enhance deployment of deep neural networks in resource-limited settings. The authors also describe several next-generation neural networks, resurgent themes and new frontiers in affective computing. Next-generation neural networks are advancing beyond traditional deep learning models to address limitations in capturing complex data structures, spatial relationships and energy efficiency. Capsule networks enhance convolutional networks by preserving spatial hierarchies, improving the modeling of complex entities, such as human body parts, which is vital in healthcare and emotion recognition. Geometric deep learning extends deep learning to non-Euclidean structures, allowing for a better understanding of complex data interactions. It has been particularly useful in sentiment and facial analysis. Mimicking the threshold-based firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks offer a more energy-efficient alternative for real-time applications, making them suitable for environments with limited resources. Traditional AI concepts, adapted to new contexts, can improve affective computing applications. Neurosymbolic systems show particular promise, combining the pattern recognition of deep learning with symbolic reasoning from traditional AI to improve the explainability and robustness of deep learning models. As these models enter real-world settings, they must conform to social norms, enhancing their ability to interpret emotions across cultures. Embodied cognition furthers this goal by situating AI agents in physical or simulated contexts, supporting natural interactions. Through reinforcement learning, embodied agents can achieve better situatedness and interactivity, which is especially beneficial in complex fields such as healthcare and education. In addition, three substantial ideas have emerged in affective computing in recent years: generative models, personalization, and causal reasoning. Advances in generative models, especially diffusion-based processes, enable AI to produce contextually relevant emotional expressions across various media, paving the way for interactive, embodied agents. Moving beyond one-size-fits-all models, personalization adapts responses based on user personalized characteristics while maintaining data privacy through federated learning. By incorporating causal reasoning, affective computing systems can not only associate but also intervene and counterfactualize in emotional contexts, enhancing their adaptability and transparency. The future of affective computing could hinge on combining innovation and a variety of AI methodologies. Moving beyond a deep learning-centric approach could pave the way for more sophisticated, culturally aware, and ethically designed systems. The integration of multiple approaches promises a future where technology not only understands but also enriches human emotions, marking a significant leap towards truly intelligent and empathetic AI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIkRYL6TkpJg	2024-11-08T17:02:11-08:00	
Nanoparticle Bursts Over The Amazon Rainforest	During the wet season in the Amazon rainforest heavy rainfall frequently occurs during the afternoon. For clouds and precipitation to develop, tiny airborne particles known as cloud condensation nuclei are required for water vapor to condense and form cloud droplets. But what are the origins of these cloud condensation nuclei? An international research team from Germany, Brazil, Sweden, and China now showed that rainfall regularly induces bursts of nanoparticles that can grow to form cloud condensation nuclei. The scientists analyzed comprehensive long-term measurements of aerosol particles, trace gases, and meteorological data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, ATTO, which is equipped with sophisticated instrumentation and measurement towers that are up to 325 m high. The observatory is located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil, about 150 kilometers north-east of Manaus, and jointly operated by scientists from Germany and Brazil. Luiz Machado, first author of the study now published in the journal Nature Geoscience, explains: 'Rainfall removes aerosol particles and introduces ozone from the atmosphere into the forest canopy. Ozone can oxidize plant-emitted volatile organic compounds, especially terpenes, and the oxidation products can enhance the formation of new particles, leading to temporary bursts of nanoparticles.' Nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy The researchers discovered that nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy and decrease with increasing altitude. 'This gradient persists throughout the wet season, indicating continuous particle formation in the canopy and an upward flux of newly formed particles that can grow by further uptake of low volatile molecules and serve as cloud condensation nuclei', adds Christopher Pöhlker, co-author and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. Among the low volatile molecules involved in the formation and growth of natural nanoparticles in the atmosphere are oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds that are formed upon oxidation of isoprene, terpenes, and other volatile organic compounds, which are naturally emitted by plants and oxidized by ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the air. Earlier studies had detected new particle formation in the outflow of convective clouds in the upper troposphere and suggested a downward flux rather than an upward flux of newly formed nanoparticles. 'Our findings imply a paradigm shift in the scientific understanding of interactions between the rainforest, aerosols, clouds, and precipitation in the Amazon, which are important for regional and global climate', concludes Ulrich Pöschl, co-author and director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawF5SL3YbcQ6R	2024-11-08T16:57:25-08:00	
Off-The-Shelf Thermoelectric Generators Can Upgrade CO2 Into Chem...	Readily available thermoelectric generators operating under modest temperature differences can power CO2 conversion, according to a proof-of-concept study by chemists at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The findings open up the intriguing possibility that the temperature differentials encountered in an array of environments—from a typical geothermal installation on Earth to the cold, desolate surface of Mars—could power the conversion of CO2 into a range of useful fuels and chemicals. 'The environment on Mars really got me interested in the long-term potential of this technology combination,' says Dr. Abhishek Soni, postdoctoral research fellow at UBC and first author of the paper published in Device. 'This is a harsh environment where large temperature differences could be leveraged to not only generate power with thermoelectric generators, but to convert the abundant CO2 in Mars’ atmosphere into useful products that could supply a colony.' Thermoelectric generators produce electricity by being attached to places with two different temperatures—in this case, a hot plate and an ice bath in the lab. The research team determined when the temperature difference between the two faces was at least 40 °C, standard model thermoelectric generators provided enough steady current to power an electrolyzer that converts CO2 to CO. Close to home, a refinement of the technology could be attached to geothermal installations. 'Our results in the lab indicate the temperature difference between hot geothermal pipes returning from underground and the relatively cooler surface temperature is enough for thermoelectric generators to power a convertor,' says Dr. Soni. The vision for Mars would be a bit more extreme. Any biodome on Mars would need to be maintained at room temperatures. Thermoelectric generators clamped over a dome’s surface would leverage the difference between indoor temperatures and the frigid temperatures outside to generate power. That power could in turn be used to drive CO2 conversion into useful carbon-based products like fuels and chemicals. The Martian atmosphere is 95 per cent carbon dioxide, and temperatures range from 20 °C to -153 °C. 'This paper shows a fun way to make carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals,' says Professor Curtis P. Berlinguette, principal investigator at UBC. 'We’ll need plastic on Mars one day, and this technology shows one way we can make it there.' Next steps will be to see how the thermoelectric generators work with our electrolyzer in the real world, here on Earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawCioGVfn5rsF	2024-11-08T16:54:46-08:00	
BRICS Suits Putin But Is No Friend Of Israel – OpEd	From October 22 to 24, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, as host of the 2024 BRICS summit, welcomed 36 world leaders to Russia. This conference marked the first gathering of the BRICS group after its expansion to include, alongside the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), four new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Other countries attended as partners or aspiring new members. The expanded body brings together countries representing approximately 41% of the global population and 24% of the global GDP. BRICS aims to promote cooperation among major emerging economies and increase their economic and political influence. Its primary purpose is to provide an alternative to Western-led institutions like the G7 economic grouping. It seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar in international trade. The group's aims conform precisely to Putin’s domestic and international aspirations, which he does not seek to conceal. At an open meeting on October 22, 2022 he said: ''The unipolar world is being relegated into the past…The West is unable to rule humanity single-handedly, and the majority of nations no longer want to put up with this…. A future world arrangement is taking shape before our eyes.' BRICS is the perfect instrument for assisting Putin reach his goal. Given the inclusion of Iran and South Africa in its membership, the viscerally anti-Israel stance it has adopted is not, perhaps, surprising. The summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan, so the statement issued on its conclusion is titled the Kazan Declaration. In it, the BRICS leaders devote 8 of its 35 paragraphs to denouncing Israel in one way or another. In paragraph 30, for example, without any reference to the horrifying events of October 7, 2023, or even one mention of the word Hamas, they express 'grave concern' at the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which they ascribe to 'the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure.' They call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages and detainees 'from both sides', drawing no distinction between civilians illegally seized, and people imprisoned for their crimes. Providing no evidence to support the charge, they denounce 'Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations'. Unsurprisingly they approve of the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in 'the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel.' They call for a two-state solution based on what they term the 'borders of June 1967,' and for the State of Palestine to be granted full membership in the United Nations. In paragraph 31 the Declaration turns to Lebanon. Here BRICS members, without once mentioning Hezbollah or making any reference to its ceaseless bombardment of northern Israel starting on October 8, 2023, 'condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts.' They move on to condemn, among other things, what they term 'the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024,' which, they claim, 'resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians.' They make no mention of the fact that the devices in question had been issued only to Hezbollah members and certain other VIPs like Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. The Kazan Declaration makes it clear that BRICS turns a blind eye toward terrorist activity aimed at eliminating Israel and its people, and has nothing but unreserved condemnation for the steps Israel takes to defend itself. The summit was undoubtedly a personal triumph for Putin. Ostracized and sanctioned by the West, here he was able to straddle the world stage, host to a large gathering of global leaders. At Kazan Putin demonstrated that he has been rehabilitated personally by a large section of the world, and that an alternative to Western dominance is a real possibility. The topics discussed included how emerging economies could cooperate more fully across a variety of fields. In addition it set the ball rolling on one of Putin’s pet projects – a new international payments system that would undercut the dominance of the US dollar. The magazine Newsweek believes that the overarching ambition of BRICS leaders such as Putin and China's President XI Jinping is to accelerate and bolster the shift away from America as the sole superpower, and toward a multipolar world that counterbalances the US and its Western allies. It points out that the Russian economy has managed to readjust following the sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has done so with the help of its key partner China, aided also by Iranian weapons supplied for use in Ukraine. Putin is now seeking to expand trade with India through a strategic partnership, particularly in the areas of energy resources and defense. 'These partnerships,' says Newsweek, 'are Putin's multipolar vision in practice, undermining the US-led West's ability to exercise its power and enforce its desired global norms through sanctions and other economic and diplomatic levers at its disposal.' His overall aim is to dismantle the US-led transatlantic and global order so that Russia can exercise greater power regionally and internationally Allied to the bid by BRICS for economic, financial and political independence from the West is a rejection of the principle, staunchly upheld by the US and most of the free world, that Israel has the right to defend itself against the genocidal and illegal terrorism of Iran and its axis of evil. In fact, with Iran and South Africa as leading members, it is doubtful if BRICS as an organization regards Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Iranian-supported militias in Iraq and Syria as terrorist bodies at all. It is this myopia that underlies its root and branch condemnation of Israel. However Israel need not submit to being blackened and isolated. A closer look at the list of BRICS members reveals the presence of Abraham Accord partner, the UAE, while hovering in the wings, invited to join but as yet uncertain, is Saudi Arabia. Other countries enjoying good relations with Israel, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, are also possible new members. Putin himself has a nuanced attitude toward Israel – a position that could be affected by the result of the forthcoming US presidential election. Self-interest could well override any demand by Iran, South Africa or Turkey (another possible new member) for a permanent anti-Israel stance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcd7av1bCIhtehjVBWmRX44	2024-11-08T09:17:01-08:00	
Russia, China Figure Out Trump’s Landslide Victory – OpEd	One great paradox of our era is that the robustness of American democracy has come to be measured in coffee spoons in terms of the country’s archaic system of electoral college votes. The result is, foreign observers lacking a sense of the forces of history miss the woods for the trees. The ancient Greeks who invented democracy never thought of an electoral college system. The word democracy came from two Greek words that mean people (demos) and rule (kratos). Don’t miss the bigger truth that Donald Trump’s landslide victory is highly consequential. Trump was on comeback trail, something that happened only for the second time in American history. He was fighting against very heavy odds including real threats of assassination by unknown forces whose identity still remains a mystery, and in circumstances enveloped in darkness that is impossible to penetrate. He estimates that he is entirely beholden to God’s will. And he went on to secure a mandate that is so comprehensive that no caveats can be attached to it — securing a majority of votes (first time this is happening in 20 years) as well as winning a grand slam in the key swing states and counties too, plus walking away with an impressive Republican Party majority in the Senate that can only be seen as a reflection of the 'Trumpmania' sweeping America from coast to coast. If that isn’t a wave, what is it? Kamala Harris lost no time to understand its meaning and graciously accepted the nation’s will. The Guardian, no friend of Trump, reported today, 'The results show that America has firmly swung back to the Republicans. The Democrats won 2020 by expanding their share of votes across the country, but 90% of counties swung back to the Republicans in 2024.' The Russian President Vladimir Putin felt compelled, finally, to change his mind and 'offer my congratulations on [Trump’s] election as president of the United States.' All that rancid talk in Moscow about 'apocalypse now' for American democracy is petering out. And the dull roar of a retreat is vaguely audible in Putin’s turnaround to a conciliatory tone during a major speech at Sochi yesterday. Putin who maintained that he wouldn’t be congratulating Trump probably took the cue from Beijing. The night before Putin spoke on Thursday evening, Chinese President Xi Jinping had sent a formal congratulatory message to Trump on his election victory underscoring that 'history tells us that both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Xi wrote, 'A China-U.S. relationship with stable, healthy and sustainable development serves the common interests of the two countries and meets the expectations of the international community. It is hoped that the two sides will, in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era to the benefit of the two countries and the world.' These incipient signs of a new dawn breaking in big-power politics could well turn out to be the salience of the new Trump Administration’s foreign policies. Who knows? Beijing senses that the US is reemerging credibly as a flag carrier and a decent burial of the American dollar is nowhere in sight — BRICS or no BRICS. In comparison, alas, Moscow’s hyperbolic rhetoric was that the US election tolls the death knell of Democracy in America and that the country may even disintegrate: 'For the [USA] republic itself, dark forebodings abound. Some warn that unchecked discord could rend the union asunder, casting the states as enemies sworn to conquer one another, much as kingdoms of old clashed on blood-soaked fields. Political battles, once confined to speeches and votes, may soon take the form of steel and fire, with regions seeking dominance or defense of their way of life. In such a landscape, the banners of free states could be raised high, each upholding its own 'God-given' reign, even as they march against one another.' This was absurdity carried to the extreme, and it appeared in a Kremlin-funded publication on November 3! Again, the Foreign Ministry’s statement in Moscow in the afternoon of November 6 even as the news was appearing on Trump’s victory was simply appalling — defensive like a porcupine’s behaviour in times of stress raising its quills with body shivering, clattering its teeth and producing an unpleasant odour to warn predators not to approach. But here, again, Putin, fortunately, had other thoughts on his mind and made amends just in time. On the other hand, China is pinning hopes that a strong president in the White House may be a good thing to happen, as the neocon shibboleths get discarded, and with a mind steeped in intuitive cognition and realism, Trump is in a position to take difficult decisions. If that happens, of course — veering toward a non-confrontational trajectory in the Sino-American relationship that has seamless potential to create synergy for Trump’s MAGA movement as well as China’s peaceful rise — it becomes a 'win-win' for all sides and humanity as a whole. Four decades ago, in fact, Trump had espoused to newly-elected Ronald Reagan precisely such a detente with the Soviet Union in a full-page paid write-up in New York Times and even offered to be a presidential envoy to make it possible. The heart of the matter is Trump 2.0 remains an enigma. Importantly, he is being presidential after a four-year internship in DC from 2016 to 2020. But there is no question that Trump will assert his presidential authority. He has no more heights to conquer in a tumultuous career, which makes him, like Shelly’s skylark, 'an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.' Robert Kennedy Jr, is on record that 'I spent two days with [Trump] recently and he was saying things that were kind of shocking to me…The level of change that he wants to make in our government, I think is going to be unprecedented… He wants a revolution and I think he’s going to get one.' The 11 words that shook the world in Trump’s victory speech was undoubtedly, 'I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars.' Indeed, China is taking Trump’s victory very seriously — rationally, positively and with cautious optimism. Conceivably, Beijing draws comfort that aides like Tesla CEO Elon Musk may provide a sense of proportion to Trump’s policymaking. Certainly, Trump cannot hope to turn back the tide of historical forces and restore US hegemony. Being a civilisation state, China has its own concepts of time and space. The Chinese economy is nowhere near collapse. And it is unrealistic to wage a technology war and impose global standards vis-a-vis a vast economy like China’s, which has reached high levels of research and innovation backed up by industrial production on a scale surpassing the entire western world’s put together. The 1970s analogy of the US breaking Japan’s will and compelling it be a subaltern forever doesn’t hold good today. Then, there is the spirit of the times that must be noted: the CEO of the official government think tank in New Delhi NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) — erstwhile Planning commission — has just spoken out that India should seek membership of the RCEP(Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) where China has a lead role, to tap into the potential of the free trade bloc comprising the 10-member ASEAN group plus their six FTA partners China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

NATO Statement On The Democratic People’s Republic Of Korea	Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Ukraine associate themselves with this statement NATO Allies strongly condemn the decisions by the leaders of the Russian Federation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to dangerously expand Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. In addition to the DPRK’s already substantive support to Russia’s war effort, through the provision of millions of rounds of ammunitions and ballistic missiles, the thousands of combat troops deployed by the DPRK constitutes a dangerous expansion of its ongoing support for Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. The deepening military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK deeply impacts Euro-Atlantic security, with implications also for the Indo-Pacific. Increasing military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a breach of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including 2270 (2016), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009). This is particularly egregious given Russia’s status as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. We call on Russia to return to compliance with these resolutions and to uphold its international obligations. Russia’s statement on 26 September asserting that the denuclearisation of the DPRK is 'off the table' is unacceptable, as it undermines the global non-proliferation regime, directly contradicts relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and further exacerbates regional tensions. The Russian statement forms part of its wider effort to undermine the global non-proliferation regime and to dismantle UN sanctions. We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression, and condemn all those who are facilitating and thereby prolonging Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. NATO will continue to work with its partners, in particular in the Indo-Pacific, to promote peace and stability, and prevent Russia and those facilitating its war effort from undermining regional and global stability. Allies continue to enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence against all threats and challenges, in all domains, and in multiple strategic directions across the Euro-Atlantic area. Allies remain as resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail. Allies and partners continue to step up vital political, military, financial, economic, and humanitarian assistance as Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Allies are determined to support Ukraine in building a force capable of defeating Russian aggression, in line with the pledge of long-term security assistance for Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsTiYE-5VYhRG	2024-11-08T09:14:32-08:00	
An Assessment Of Israel’s War As Peace Efforts Grind To A Halt – ...	A year has passed but the war in the Middle East has not slumped. Israel’s many fronts war seems only to be expanding with the direct intervention of Iran. As peace efforts have been sidelined, Israel’s war strategy has been caught adrift, especially with a besieged front in Gaza. At the outset, Israel has mostly withdrawn from the Gaza strip although it has kept a sizable presence in strategic areas such as the Philadelphi corridor among other high grounds, this is fundamentally to prevent any regrouping of Hamas fighters. The Rafah crossing is equally vital for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) since large quantities of infrastructure and material supplies have been funneled through that infamous crossing. Yoav Gallant has publicly acknowledged that Hamas’ military capabilities have been downgraded severely. One of Israel’s core rallying points for the October 7 retaliation was the complete disintegration of Hamas’ military wing coupled with its political arm insomuch that it could never establish an authoritative presence in Gaza. This is confirmed by the continuous bombings in Beit Lahiya a municipality in northern Gaza and the Jabaliya refugee camp despite exterminating Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the ignominious October 7 massacre. In Lebanon, the IDF’s strategy has been to target Hezbollah affiliated sites in and around Beirut while the ground forces are carrying out clearing operations. A relatively small number of Israeli troops are fighting along the border. Whether the IDF will make the grade in pushing Hezbollah beyond the Litani River is still early to predict however in 2006, they were unable to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, attacks from the West Bank are growing in number and lethality whilst the internal security agencies within Israel have contained the threats. Within Israel, there were internal dissensions at play considering what Israel’s Defence Minister had to say about the trajectory of the war. Yoav Gallant wrote a letter to top military officials and cabinet ministers including Benjamin Netanyahu about the direction the war is heading; the Defence Minister has opined that the ongoing war seems aimless. According to former CIA Director David Petraeus, the strategy of 'clear and leave' employed by the IDF is not a viable option. This strategy has certainly worked for Israel in the short-term especially, after the death of key leaders and commanders. But ideally, the approach should have been 'clear, hold, and build' but it is too late for that since the quantum of depredations and destitution in Gaza has crossed epic proportions. In the backdrop of these myriad developments, negotiations are rife in the back channels of war between the US, Lebanon, and Israel as reports of a draft agreement under discussions is slated for 60 days. The onus of this agreement has been entrusted to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) who are required to gradually deploy 10,000 troops as both Hezbollah and the IDF cease attacks, while the US alongside the UN, Europe, and regional states would ensure a 'Monitoring and Enforcement Mechanism' to supervise ceasefire violations including sanctions packages. The ultimate objective is to steer this agreement towards enforcing the UN Resolution 1701. However, this truce effort has been rejected as Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that 'agreements, documents, proposals are not the main point', thus crushing any prospects for brokering a ceasefire settlement. Another ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US was aborted. They had designed a cessation-of-hostilities agreement backed by the US advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza. It has several stages. First, a prisoner swap is to be implemented under which the following criteria has to be applied i.e., the IDF has to gradually withdraw and Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Second, Hamas should release all remaining hostages and Israel should follow suit by releasing a number of Palestinians alongside the withdrawal of all soldiers from Gaza. Third, the end of the blockade and the exchange of dead bodies has to be undertaken. A fourth option beseeches that Hamas should not rearm. Lately, a senior Hamas official Khalil al Hayya has outright rejected a proposal for their safe passage from Gaza so that the hostage deal could be resolved. The reticence shown by Hamas indicates two possible scenarios: on the one hand, Hamas will continue their fight against Israel while on the other, they will prima facie look for avenues to form a government in Gaza. Indeed, Hamas is seeking to build a national unity government in coalition with the Palestinian Authority (PA) clinging on to the idea of a vacuum in the post-war reconstruction of Gaza. As peace efforts in the Middle East grind to a halt, the options for de-escalation appear distant. First, the destruction of Gaza will have ramifications in the long-term as anger against the Israelis is mounting; many disgruntled youths would in all likelihood join Hamas and other militant clusters against Israel. Second, there is no alternative vision to reconstruct Gaza on humanitarian grounds which could perhaps solicit the support of the Arabs if the Israeli government resorts to such a course. Nevertheless, to expect such a directional change in the war from either side is preposterous. Third, Tel Aviv would certainly hold on to vital corridors such as the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah crossing if future attacks are to be prevented. Fourth, the Biden administration, belatedly, had tightened the noose on Benjamin Netanyahu just before US elections on pertinent issues. Washington pressed for a 30 days timeline under which Israel had to help improve the living conditions in Gaza— allowing aid into Gaza including 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza and to provide access to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which was recently barred by the Israeli Knesset. Finally, the return of Donald Trump to the White House could perhaps a) tighten the noose on Iran and its proxies although that does not preclude the latter would cease to threaten Israel; b) Trump’s foreign policy could facilitate the probable annexation of the West Bank by Israel at the expense of the Palestinians and c) Netanyahu’s discretion in total war against Hamas and Hezbollah may be curtailed by a strong US President. However, until Trump assumes office, Israel’s objectives in Gaza, its ground operations in Lebanon would persevere in full swing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsZzOW6M4lkqH	2024-11-08T09:13:27-08:00	
Operation Iron Swords: Israel’s Long Game In The Middle East – Op...	Pundits in International Affairs comment that after one year of military exhaustion, Israel’s Operation Iron Swords has made some twisted dynamics in the Middle East as an unmitigated disaster in which both Israel and its foes are equally wounded. For Hamas, the death of its leaders one after another caused a disastrous effect as it may take years for them to revive their organizational apparatus. Israeli’s jubilation over crushing the key leaders in both Hamas and Hezbollah is not long-lasting as their escalation with Iran is symbolic of a new regional conflict, which can undermine the international order. The contention often heard from the commenters in the global affairs is that Israel lacks the long term strategic ability of transforming its massive military victories into a durable political one as Tel Aviv is losing its international partners due to violating the proportionality in the military operations in Gaza and Lebanon . From a vantage point of view, all these arguments are good enough as ingredients for a scholarly soup as the realist position in the war in the Middle East has taken strides in favour of Israel by the strategic victories that the IDF acquired. Iranian entry into the theatre of the Middle East has been sometimes depicted as a turning point, but Tehran and its proxies show less advancement over the Israeli operations in Lebanon indicating the military superiority of the latter. The only significant threat posed by Iran towards Israel lies in deploying its proxies outside the centre of gravity against the Israeli targets. For example, the recent alleged threat reported in Sri Lanka on Israeli tourists visiting the island’s East Coast referred to Iranian agents.One might speculate if Israel has achieved its strategic ambitions from Operation Iron Swords, how would Tel Aviv turn them into a political reality, which would consolidate Israel’s position in the Middle East? In order to address such a question, it is essential to understand whether Israel accomplished what it yearned for after the 7th of October. Here are Israel’s declared strategic and political goals in Operation Iron Swords: In Gaza: 1) To eliminate Hamas’s military power and force the collapse of its rule, with the object of bringing about a situation in which there is no longer any security threat from the Gaza Strip; and 2) to create conditions for the return of the hostages. In Lebanon: To return the residents of the Israeli north to their homes by destroying and pushing Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. A much more ambitious overarching goal that Israel desires to achieve is to form a new regional security reality bolstering the formidable position of Israel. In achieving this target, Israel aims to dismantle the Iranian proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah that loom before the Israeli boarder causing a severe existential threat and it may not be an exaggeration to contend that Iran will be much weaker without the consistency of these two forces. Country’s dwindling economy which has been stagnated for years is another additional burden for Tehran which reduces its ability to sustain in a long term war against Israel . As American strategic guru Edward Luttwak cleverly argued Iran’s export revenue which earned nearly 80% from oil has been spent on imported components and supplies consumed by the domestic Revolutionary Guards, with its 125,000 troops and a naval force. This includes the imports of Chinese and North Korean missile and rocket components, as well as the foreign-currency costs of the entire nuclear programme which proceeds at a very large scale. The oil export process is mainly located in the Khark island within 1500 km proximity of Israeli airbase. In the UN general assembly, Netanyahu hinted that Israeli’s long arms can extend to Iran’s oil resources, which can certainly collapse Iran’s wounded economy. All in all, from the Iranian front a threat posing against Israel is not much inimical as Israel’s military machinery stands stronger as a lethal threat to Tehran. The challenges loom before Israel in Gaza seem to be more complex regardless of Israel’s military victories over Hamas, in which the latter has been devastated both logistically and numerically. Israel’s dilemma with Gaza is the fact that if it decides to distribute humanitarian aid among Gazans, Israel will become the de facto force ruling Gaza which Tel Aviv does not want. But, this can lead to accelerating the authority of Hamas again even after its eclipse. The history of Hamas since its inception has shown that it contains the ability to relish major blows as the Hamas ideology that its founders nourished remains unaffected. Yet on the strategic front the achievements that Israel earned from its operation Iron Swords elevate Tel Aviv’s status into a powerful position which they did not hold in the region before the 7th of October. Mainly its ability of freeing itself from the threat paranoia from Hezbollah in Lebanon is a deterring factor that fortifies Israel. Overall, Israel seems to have tighten its grip over Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran with the aim of securing its position in a long game, which may alter the security architecture of the Middle at unprecedented level. The other paramount factor adding one more brick to Israel is Trump’s return to the White House for his second term, which has already made many right-wing Israelis jubilant. Considering how the Trump administration supported Israel between 2017 to 2020, it appears to be reasonable to see these latest changes in Washington as catalyst factors changing the chain of events in the Middle East. From the act of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem to the successful completion of the Abraham Accords in 2020, Trump’s actions appeased Tel Aviv. In return, Israel backed out of the plot to assassinate Iranian General Soleimani in January 2020, which frustrated Trump and even became a point of discussion during the presidential election. Despite the troubling memory of Israel’s broken promise, Trump’s second term is likely to be favorable to Tel Aviv, as he would oppose bringing the Palestinian Authority to Gaza or moving earnestly toward a two-state solution. With the military victories earned by IDF for past few months, Israel can begin a fresh start when Trump enters the White House on the 20th of January. It can also be presumed that Trump may support Israel to launch pre-emptive strikes on Iran nuclear reactors as an emulation of what Israel achieved against Iraq in 1981, which completely wiped out Saddam Hussain’s nuclear ambition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsRF0AU-gMurN	2024-11-08T09:12:00-08:00

Hegemonic Masculinity As A Political Strategy For Donald Trump’s ...	Donald Trump's historic success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election can be significantly linked to his representation of hegemonic masculinity, which resonate with traits such as strength, authority, and assertiveness. Trump's political identity and campaign strategies, characterized by resilience, assertiveness, and a defiance of established norms, struck a chord with voters who felt marginalized by evolving gender dynamics and progressive social movements. Through his rhetoric and media portrayal, Trump leveraged these gendered power dynamics, solidifying the appeal of hegemonic masculinity as pivotal to leadership and political achievement in modern America. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election appears to be significantly influenced by narratives intricately linked to established gender power dynamics, especially the notion of hegemonic masculinity. This sociological framework, which denotes the prevailing form of masculinity within a society, significantly influences political ideologies, the attractiveness of candidates, and the results of elections. Donald Trump’s persona, political style, and strategies during the campaign illustrate the substantial impacts of hegemonic masculinity traits on his electoral success. Therefore, the hegemonic masculinity, left indelible imprints within the political sphere, its expression in Donald Trump’s political persona, and its significant impact on his achievements in the 2024 election. Understanding Hegemonic Masculinity Hegemonic masculinity, a concept initially articulated by sociologist R.W. Connell in the 1980s, denotes the culturally prevailing ideal of masculinity that is regarded as the standard within a particular society. It is defined by attributes such as physical strength, dominance, aggression, emotional stoicism, competitiveness, and sexual virility. These characteristics are frequently regarded as the standard for defining a 'true man' within a specific cultural context. Hegemonic masculinity functions as a systemic power framework rather than merely an individual identity, reinforcing patriarchal norms while simultaneously marginalizing those who deviate from traditional gender expressions, such as femininity, homosexuality, and various forms of gender diversity (Connell, 1995). The concept of masculinity is dynamic; it is shaped by social constructs and differs across various cultures and historical periods. Nevertheless, specific elements consistently persist, such as the oppression of women and the disparagement of alternative masculinities that diverge from this dominant standard. Within this context, political candidates—particularly male politicians—tend to portray themselves in a manner that aligns with the anticipated traits of strength, control, and dominance linked to prevailing masculine ideals. The Role of Hegemonic Masculinity in Politics In the political sphere, hegemonic masculinity significantly influences how the public perceives leaders and assesses their effectiveness. Political leaders who embrace this ideal frequently attract significant support from voters, especially those who equate masculinity with robust leadership. In a country such as the United States, where political discussions frequently revolve around power dynamics, strength, and authority, the influence of hegemonic masculinity can profoundly affect voter behavior, ultimately shaping electoral results. The concept of hegemonic masculinity in the realm of politics is complicatedly connected to the nuances of political discourse, the formulation of campaign strategies, and the representations found within media portrayals. It shapes the perception of candidates regarding their leadership capabilities, negotiation skills, and ability to tackle challenges effectively. Voters frequently gravitate towards candidates who embody conventional masculine characteristics—those who present a strong stance on matters such as crime, national security, and foreign policy, while embracing positions that resonate with ideals of strength and authority. The phenomenon has been particularly pronounced in the context of Donald Trump, who has adeptly utilized the notion of hegemonic masculinity to craft a persuasive narrative surrounding his political persona. The focus of his campaign consistently highlights themes of resilience, tackling both domestic matters (like immigration and crime) and international challenges (including trade and military strategy). Trump’s emphasis on 'law and order,' his pledges to restore the nation’s stature, and his confrontational stance towards the media and political elites have established him as a prominent embodiment of assertive masculinity in the American political landscape. Donald Trump's 'America First' policy is closely aligned with hegemonic masculinity, especially in its approach to conventional security threats. This policy underscores national strength, military superiority, and unilateral decision-making, presenting a vision of America as a preeminent global power, aligned with the principles of hegemonic masculinity—strength, control, and aggression. Trump’s emphasis on military strength, border protection, and economic independence underscores the concept of American masculinity as inherently robust and self-sufficient. His rhetoric frequently frames America as requiring a restoration of its supremacy, addressing external threats—such as terrorism, China, and illegal immigration—through assertive, 'tough' measures, reminiscent of the conventional masculine characteristic of aggression. Donald Trump’s Hegemonic Masculinity Donald Trump's political identity is closely associated with the representation of hegemonic masculinity, a concept that highlights characteristics such as strength, control, aggression, and dominance. Trump's identity as a leader has consistently centered on these masculine ideals, which are firmly rooted in conventional American concepts of power. His political rhetoric, frequently marked by bold statements and a lack of concern for conventional decorum, positions him as the quintessential 'tough' leader who boldly confronts established norms and asserts his authority. The characteristics of hegemonic masculinity strongly connect with white working-class male voters who experience a sense of alienation due to changes in gender roles and power dynamics within society. Trump's hegemonic masculinity approach has played a crucial role in his political achievements, framing him as a champion of conventional values in opposition to what he and his followers perceive as the feminization or dilution of American society. His portrayal as a formidable and pragmatic leader capable of commanding respect has positioned him as an emblem of strength, resonating with voters who perceive in him a dismissal of contemporary political correctness and a commitment to decisive action in both domestic and international affairs. His confrontational approach to political adversaries, especially women, solidifies his portrayal as a commanding male presence in a sector historically led by men, thereby reinforcing the notion that authority is to be established through force and dominance. Trump's leadership approach, characterized by a steadfast assurance in his capacity to command the political arena and global affairs, serves as a distinct representation of dominant masculinity. His political decisions, including the emphasis on military strength and a strong focus on immigration control, reinforce his position as a representative of conventional, patriarchal masculinity. In this context, Trump's appeal is anchored in his portrayal as a dominant leader, a persona that continues to resonate with significant portions of the American electorate. Election Campaigns During the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election campaign, Trump's rhetoric and public appearances were meticulously designed to resonate with his voters’ perception of hegemonic masculinity. Through his speeches and social media communications, Trump highlighted his assertiveness, confrontational nature, and unapologetic stance—traits that strongly appealed to his voters. Unlike the typically measured and diplomatic strategies employed by other candidates, Trump's campaign was characterized by assertive and confrontational rhetoric. The employment of 'fight' imagery, including phrases like 'take back America' and 'drain the swamp,' resonated with voters’ aspirations for a leader capable of asserting authority and countering perceived threats to the nation’s stability. This form of rhetoric aligns with the broader cultural narrative surrounding hegemonic masculinity, portraying the ideal leader as someone who remains resolute in adversity and is prepared to tackle challenges directly. Trump leveraged his unique persona to set himself apart from his rivals, especially those affiliated with conventional political establishments. His self-presentation as an outsider—unconstrained by the norms of Washington politics—bolstered his image as a robust figure capable of confronting the political elite. By presenting himself as the advocate for 'ordinary Americans' in the face of perceived threats from immigrants, foreign adversaries, and progressive social movements, Trump’s campaign effectively leveraged themes of dominance and defiance against external pressures. Furthermore, Trump's media strategy played a pivotal role in the manifestation of hegemonic masculinity throughout the campaign. He leveraged his media presence to enhance his reputation as a bold leader unafraid to express his views, frequently at the expense of conventional political decorum. This bold expression of masculinity was positioned as a strength rather than a drawback, resonating with a portion of the electorate that felt disconnected from what they viewed as the gentleness or fragility of the political establishment. Trump’s Victory The outcome of the 2024 election in favor of Trump can be partially linked to the prevalent endorsement of traditional masculine ideals among a considerable segment of the American voting population. The acceptance of this phenomenon is not uniform; however, it is notably pronounced within specific demographics, including white working-class voters, evangelical Christians, and rural communities. These groups, perceiving a decline in their cultural and economic influence amid evolving social dynamics, frequently interpret Trump’s endorsement of traditional masculinity as a means of countering this perceived erosion. The concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Trump's capacity to rally his supporters. A significant portion of his electorate perceived that their identities as men were being sidelined by modern social movements advocating for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminist initiatives. Trump's rhetoric frequently featured anti-feminist undertones and direct appeals to male voters, effectively reinforcing a sense of solidarity among those who perceived a threat from the feminist movement and evolving gender norms. By presenting himself as a champion of traditional masculinity, Trump successfully brought together a substantial segment of the electorate that felt disconnected from the changing dynamics of gender roles. In the framework of the 2024 election, the appeal of Trump's brand of hegemonic masculinity transcended personal identity, serving as a calculated political strategy that enabled him to convey strength and authority on issues that profoundly connected with his supporters. Trump's success in the 2024 election transcends the boundaries of his political platform or economic policies. This outcome represents a triumph for a specific interpretation of masculinity that prioritizes strength, authority, and opposition to advancing social movements. This portrayal of masculinity is one that Trump has consistently represented throughout his career and one that continues to connect with a substantial portion of the American electorate. Conclusion Ultimately, the concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Donald Trump’s success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the embodiment and promotion of characteristics linked to dominant masculinity—such as strength, aggression, and control—Trump successfully shaped a political identity that resonated with a significant portion of voters who regarded these traits as vital for effective leadership. Through his campaign rhetoric, media strategies, and public persona, Trump established himself as a champion of hegemonic masculinity during a time of societal evolution, leveraging anxieties surrounding cultural decline and shifts in gender norms. The 2024 election illustrated that hegemonic masculinity remains a significant influence in American politics, affecting both voter preferences and the fundamental characteristics of political discourse. The connection Trump established with his voters through the framework of masculine power played a crucial role in his electoral success, highlighting the persistent impact of gendered power dynamics within the political landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLOcLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-08T09:05:54-08:00	
Reflections On The US Election – OpEd	Not surprisingly, the mainstream media are in disbelief over the results of the presidential election. That’s because they live in an intellectual ghetto. Instead of just talking to each other, it would be so nice if they actually spent time talking to those who work in housekeeping, the cafeteria, maintenance and security. Will they change now that they have been proven wrong? Not at all. They are hopelessly incapable of changing, though they love to say that the public has a hard time accepting change. Not so. They do. Does money count in elections? Not as much as many think. Harris raised over $1 billion and wound up $20 million in debt in the final week. Trump spent half as much, over $400 million. In the few weeks before the election, Bill Gates gave Harris $50 million, and Michael Bloomberg followed with another $50 million. George Soros topped them both. Do celebrities matter? They may if they occasionally show up for a rally or fundraiser. But Harris went overboard, bringing in Oprah, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Jennifer Lopez et al. She also went on Saturday Night Live before the election. This actually hurt her. Why? She was already seen as a lightweight, the word-salad queen, so being surrounded by celebrities only fed the perception that she was not a serious person. Why were so many of the polls wrong? Because most of them never corrected for the Trump supporters who simply won’t speak to them. They don’t trust them, and, importantly, they know it is not popular in many circles to admit being for Trump. The pollster that was the most accurate was J.L. Partners. Based in the U.S., it was founded by pollsters for the British Prime Minister; it published its results with the Daily Mail, a conservative U.K. publication. It was one of the few that got it right: it said in the run-up to the election that Trump had a 54 percent chance of winning. McLaughlin & Associates also did a good job. Pollsters often ask the wrong questions, or they don’t dig deep enough. For example, the media kept reporting that Trump’s unfavorability rating was significantly higher than Harris’. On election day, Nate Silver, who runs an influential survey site, reported that Trump’s unfavorability score was 8.6 points higher than his favorability score. For Harris, her unfavorable rating was 2.0 points higher than her favorable rating. A more important question is how the public views the candidates on their leadership abilities and their ability to get things done. A month before the election, Gallup found that when it comes to who is a strong and decisive leader, Trump outscored Harris 59 percent to 48 percent. On their ability to get things done, Trump won 61-49. Exit polls on election day found that his numbers increased significantly on related measures. In other words, an election is not a popularity contest. It is about issues and who is the most likely to govern effectively. Billy Martin, who coached the New York Yankees, was hard to deal with. Bobby Knight, who coached the University of Indiana basketball team, could be obnoxious. Bill Belichick, who coached the New England Patriots, was surly. Unlikeable though they were, they were also great leaders who knew how to win. Ergo, while Trump’s persona may strike many as offensive, few question his ability to get things done, and that is what counts in the end. Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats in October that Harris was not getting her message out. This misses the point. She had no message. That was her problem. Being against Trump is not a message—it’s a feeling: it doesn’t tell voters what policies you want to implement. Admittedly, she was put in a delicate position. Joe Biden dropped out after the debate in June because the media could no longer pretend that he wasn’t mentally challenged. They covered up for him for years, but could do so no longer. Harris never faced a challenger—she was anointed—and proved incapable of separating herself from his policies. More than anything else, it was the politics of extremism that did her in. Flooding the economy with funny money drove prices sky high Allowing millions of migrants to crash our borders and then be rewarded with better services from the government than are afforded homeless veterans angered millions Playing catch and release with violent criminals was indefensible Forgiving student loans for the middle and upper classes while making the working class pay for them was infuriating Promoting policies that allow children to change their sex behind their parents’ back was mindboggling Allowing boys to compete against girls in sports and shower with them was morally bankrupt Allowing the FBI to spy on Catholics was malicious Inviting foreign aggression was irresponsible These policies did Harris in. For the most part, the American people do not want extremists on the right or the left in office. Thank God for that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLGNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-11-08T09:04:02-08:00	
Overpopulated India Leading To Social Tension And Unrest – OpEd	Chief minister of Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has triggered widespread concern with his recent statement that families should have more children than at present. The Chief Minister of Indian state of Tamil Nadu has also said that each family should have sixteen children. Such views of two chief minsters have shocked the discerning people in India and as a matter of fact, several people think that these are careless and thoughtless remarks. It is well recognized that India is now a over populated country with one of the highest population density amongst all countries in the world. The views of the two chief ministers go completely against the national consensus on two child norm. It is extremely difficult to understand why such statements were made by these two chief ministers, who ought to know better. India's alarming population growth & likely scenario in future The Indian population which was around 35.9 crore in 1950 have now surged to around 144 crore in 2024. Population is likely to increase at not less than 0.8 % per annum, if the present trend were to continue , particularly since population is still increasing and also that average life span pf people is increasing and longevity is now around 65 years, which has much improved compared to earlier period. Indian population is likely to touch more than 170 crore people by the year 2050. India's population density India's population density has steadily increased over the years from 428.19 people per square kilometre in 2021` to 438.58 people per square kilometre in 2024. India has one of the highest population density in the world amongst all countries. Growth in economy and job opportunities unlikely to match the population growth The Indian population level and population density has already reached an alarming level and the adverse impact is already evident. In spite of impressive growth of Indian economy and progress in industrial, agricultural and services sector particularly during the last ten years, significant section of Indian population still remain below poverty line or just above poverty line. In other words, the economic growth is unable to catch up with the population growth. With the population increasing, it is necessary to create adequate employment opportunities for people at different skill level. Any view that in tune with the future population growth, generation of large number of jobs at different level and promotion of skill amongst the people as required by the level of population can be created is an Utopian expectation. This would be particularly so, since the emphasis in the various projects that contribute to economic growth, would be on greater automation, less manpower requirement and more so in the context of recent developments such as artificial intelligence. Future technological changes would result in less manpower requirement for various tasks. Such view amount to wishful thinking and certainly not based on ground realities in India. It is easily said than done. Increasing level of population and inability to keep the people engaged by providing employment adequately is bound to cause social tension and unrest. It is said that the idle brain is the devil's workshop. So-called demographic dividend It is vaguely said that growing population would provide demographic dividend for India. This statement is incorrect and would prove to be wrong , as demographic dividend can be availed only if jobs would be made available to the population at different skill level.It is extremely difficult to get the possible demographic dividend as it is already evident now with the level of unemployment in the country. India may become large exporter of migrants The future trend in the densely populated India is likely to be that more and more people from India would be seeking jobs abroad and seek migration to other advanced countries. They would be forced to do so , due to lack of job opportunities in India with the steady growth in Indian population level and population density. It is quite likely that in the coming years , several advanced countries would feel concerned about the growing entry of migrants from India , which may disturb the demographic balance in the countries and probably create social issues and tension. Such migrants entering the advanced countries would become unwelcome people. India's population carrying capacity Factors to be considered: • Level of economic growth already achieved and growth likely to be achieved in the coming years. • Land size of India.• Availability of natural resources • Likely water scarcity.• Ability to create jobs in large number to meet the need of increasing population.• Unsustainable urban migration due to lack of job opportunities• Waste generation and consequent environmental issues. India has to strive to reduce the population density by bringing down the population level in a gradual and painless manner over the next few years. Taking a holistic view, it can be said that the optimum population for India is around one hundred crore people. If and when India were to achieve this level of one hundred crore population, India would certainly emerge as one of the most prosperous countries in the world. Strategies There is a need for the strong compaign, as in the last several years, the campaign to check population growth has not been conspicuous and not visibly seen. On the other hand, the country has been brain washed with the view that population growth is unlikely to be a threat, as birth rate is tapering down and fertility rate in several states in India have already reached replacement level of 2.1 and economic growth would be sustained. Common man has not been told in clear terms about the grave issues that would arise due to further increase in Indian population, which may increase by another 40 crore in the coming years before stabilizing. This would be an unbearable burden on the nation. Empowerment of women Empowerment of women and creation of awareness amongst women about the need for population control is the primary requisite. This can be done only by vigorous public campaign. Need for one child policy for some period India has to frame one child policy per family, which China implemented successfully, in spite of the fact that China's land area is much larger than that of India and China's density of population is lower than that of India. China has brought down the population growth level within acceptable limits by one child policy and is now stabilizing the population by appropriate measures. Of course, China adopted dictatorial methods, which India cannot do in view of India's highly desirable democratic structure. The only way out is that one child policy must be implemented by persuasion and by disincentivising more than one child family. Fix population sustainability index Since the extent of population growth is different in different states, population sustainability index has to be fixed for each state. This policy should fix a specific population target for each state, which is necessary for the nation at this juncture. Ban polygamy Any man marrying more than one woman should be banned by law, to curtail the population increase and to protect the dignity of women. Prognosis Central and state governments should realise that India has not time to lose and India's future stability can be ensured only by achieving affordable population level, which could be several crores less than the present level.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLBJBvza5r3Ie	2024-11-08T09:02:26-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) And The Path To Pakistan’s Econom...	Pakistan, like many developing countries, faces numerous challenges in revitalizing its economy. However, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and an increase in exports are two powerful catalysts that can significantly contribute to the country's economic recovery. These elements are not only instrumental in revitalizing sagging economies but also in setting a nation on the path to sustained economic development. The inflow of FDI signals investor confidence in the revival of Pakistan's economy, while boosting exports generates foreign exchange to finance essential imports and promotes industrial development, leading to job creation. FDI is one of the most effective ways to rejuvenate an economy, particularly in countries like Pakistan, which are grappling with financial instability and limited resources. The arrival of foreign investment not only provides capital but also helps improve technological infrastructure, fosters innovation, and creates jobs through projects initiated by foreign investors. Importantly, it sends a positive message to the global market about the country’s economic potential, encouraging other international investors to consider the local market. Pakistan has witnessed increasing foreign investment from key players in the Middle East and Asia. Countries like China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have committed to injecting capital into various sectors of Pakistan's economy. The recent visits of high-profile delegations underscore this growing confidence. In August, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Pakistan, during which 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed, emphasizing cooperation in security, education, agriculture, and the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This phase is expected to bolster connectivity and boost economic ties between the two nations. Saudi Arabia, too, has pledged significant investment in Pakistan. A Saudi delegation led by Investment Minister Khalid Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Falih visited Pakistan recently, committing to a $2.8 billion investment. This is an increase from the original $2.2 billion pledged during the previous visit. This is in addition to the $5 billion commitment made by Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz during a past visit. The UAE also recently announced a $10 billion investment in Pakistan, while Qatar committed to investing $3 billion. These pledges were made through the platform of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which aims to streamline and expedite foreign investments in Pakistan. Azerbaijan, too, is contributing to the cause, with a $2 billion investment commitment. These developments are significant indicators of the global community's confidence in Pakistan's economic future, given that these investments are contingent upon sustained economic recovery and growth. Alongside FDI, an increase in exports plays a vital role in revitalizing Pakistan’s economy. Exports generate the much-needed foreign exchange to support the import of vital goods, such as oil, machinery, and raw materials for industrial production. Moreover, as exports grow, so does the country’s industrial sector, which in turn enhances job opportunities and stimulates economic activity. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) highlights a positive trend in exports. In the first quarter of the year, Pakistan’s exports reached $7.495 billion, marking a 7.82% increase compared to the same period last year. The textile and footwear sectors have shown particular growth, with footwear exports rising to $45.136 million in the first quarter, compared to $41.192 million in the same period last year. This increase in exports not only boosts the economy but also enhances Pakistan’s trade relations with other countries, further diversifying its economic partners. Pakistan’s bilateral trade with Uzbekistan also underscores the growing export potential. In 2023, Pakistan and Uzbekistan signed a $1 billion deal to increase trade between the two nations, with plans for further discussions to maximize the benefits of this agreement. Such collaborations are critical for Pakistan, as they open up new avenues for trade and help reduce the country’s dependency on traditional export markets. The impact of the government’s economic policies is also evident in the industrial sector. Major projects in sectors like power generation, mining, and electric vehicles (EV) are gaining momentum, providing a glimpse of a promising industrial future for Pakistan. Hub Power Company Ltd, Pakistan's largest independent power producer, is expanding into lithium mining, battery manufacturing, and electric vehicle production under the SIFC. This move will cater to the growing global demand for rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones, laptops, and automobiles, thus positioning Pakistan as a key player in the emerging EV industry. Additionally, the government is developing a 15,000-acre industrial park on Pakistan Steel Mills land as part of a broader strategy to establish nine special economic zones under CPEC. These zones are expected to attract foreign investment and contribute to Pakistan’s industrial growth by providing infrastructure and facilitating production in key sectors. The economic recovery in Pakistan is not just a product of foreign investments and export growth but also of positive macroeconomic indicators. Inflation has dropped below 7%, and interest rates are on a downward trajectory, with the State Bank of Pakistan reducing the policy rate from 17.7% to 15%. Foreign exchange reserves have crossed the $10 billion mark, and remittances have shown an encouraging rise. The stock market is also performing well, with the KSE 100 Index surpassing the 91,000 mark for the first time. International financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF have also expressed optimism about Pakistan’s economic prospects. The World Bank expects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 2.8% in FY25, while the IMF has acknowledged the country’s improved policymaking, noting that inflation has reached its lowest level in three years, and international reserves have more than doubled. However, the path to sustained economic growth is contingent upon political stability. While economic recovery is underway, political uncertainty remains a threat. The opposition party, PTI, has been actively creating disruptions and undermining the government’s efforts, which could derail the economic recovery. Political stability is critical to maintaining investor confidence, and any disruption could negatively impact the growth momentum. Foreign Direct Investment and an increase in exports are two crucial pillars that can help Pakistan overcome its economic challenges. The commitment of key countries like China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar to invest in Pakistan reflects growing international confidence in the country’s economic revival. Furthermore, the rise in exports and positive industrial developments signal a hopeful future. However, political stability is essential to ensuring these gains are sustained and that Pakistan remains on a path toward sustained economic development. Political parties, particularly PTI, must recognize the importance of unity and work together to promote the country’s interests above political rivalry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfu6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-08T09:00:12-08:00	
Evaluating The Security Impact Of Pakistan’s Taliban Outreach Pol...	Imran Khan’s long-standing support for dialogue with the Taliban and similar factions has had considerable implications for Pakistan’s security. Initially, Khan’s advocacy for peace negotiations with groups such as the TTP was seen as a bold move to curtail violence in Pakistan. However, as terrorist attacks rise across the country, critics argue that his policies have inadvertently emboldened these factions, risking the safety of Pakistani citizens and challenging the state’s ability to control extremist activities. Khan’s Stance on the Taliban Since his days as an opposition leader, Imran Khan has called for a reconciliatory approach toward the Taliban, emphasizing that dialogue over military action could address the grievances fueling their activities. He has, on multiple occasions, publicly sympathized with the Taliban’s anti-Western rhetoric, earning him the moniker 'Taliban Khan' in some circles. Khan contended that peace could be achieved through understanding rather than confrontation, a perspective that, while appealing to some, overlooked the deep-seated ideological motives driving groups like the TTP. Policy Shortcomings and the Surge in Attacks Following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan has experienced an upsurge in attacks. Statistics indicate that militant activities have nearly doubled since the U.S. withdrawal, with the TTP and other groups feeling emboldened by Khan’s overtures. Security experts argue that Khan’s approach has fostered a perception of Pakistan as willing to compromise with extremists, thereby diminishing the deterrent effect that a firm counter-terrorism stance would provide. This pattern suggests a crucial oversight in Khan’s approach: by extending a hand of reconciliation without stringent conditions, he inadvertently allowed extremist factions to regroup and strengthen. The TTP, for instance, capitalized on the peace negotiations to consolidate its networks, increasing its operational capacity and resources. As a result, Pakistani citizens are now facing one of the worst waves of terrorism in recent history, with attacks targeting public spaces, government offices, and border areas alike. Implications for Regional and International Relations The repercussions of Khan’s policies are felt beyond Pakistan’s borders. Countries in the region, particularly Afghanistan, India, and Iran, have voiced concerns about the spillover effects of Pakistan’s leniency toward extremist factions. The recent statements by the Taliban, urging Pakistan to engage in dialogue with Imran Khan’s supporters, reflect an uneasy dynamic. They raise questions about Pakistan’s autonomy in decision-making and its influence over cross-border militancy. From an international standpoint, Khan’s reconciliation policies could have broader diplomatic implications. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has maintained pressure on Pakistan to strengthen its counter-terrorism financing frameworks, and any perceived leniency risks further scrutiny. International actors expect Pakistan to demonstrate a clear stance against extremism, and policies that suggest otherwise can harm Pakistan’s economic and diplomatic ties. Public Disillusionment and Calls for Change The public response within Pakistan has been mixed but increasingly critical. Many Pakistanis question the wisdom of accommodating groups responsible for years of violence and instability. Families affected by terrorist violence, as well as members of the security forces, have voiced their disapproval of any policy that appears to grant legitimacy to these groups. This growing disillusionment poses political risks for Khan and his party, as citizens become frustrated with a security approach that appears to prioritize appeasement over safety. Historical Context and Lessons Pakistan’s previous peace deals with militant groups reveal a troubling pattern. In past agreements, such as those in Swat and Waziristan, extremists exploited the periods of ceasefire to bolster their ranks and resources. Instead of leading to sustainable peace, these deals often resulted in a renewed surge of violence once the factions had regained strength. Khan’s policies, which echo this strategy of reconciliation, appear to be repeating these mistakes, as militant groups use negotiations as a cover to advance their agendas. Conclusion Imran Khan’s outreach policies toward the Taliban and TTP, while grounded in a desire for peace, have ultimately weakened Pakistan’s security framework. The country now faces an increased threat of terrorism, amplified by factions that see Khan’s policies as an invitation to escalate their activities. Moving forward, Pakistan needs a more stringent approach that unequivocally opposes terrorism. Only through a consistent and uncompromising counter-terrorism strategy can Pakistan hope to safeguard its citizens and restore public confidence in its security apparatus.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfrP2pTsu94SY	2024-11-08T08:58:38-08:00	
Fantasies Of Free Market Under Capitalism – OpEd	The concept of the 'free market' under capitalism is often promoted as an emblem of individual consumer choice and a driver of national economic growth and development. The priests of capitalism view the free market as the most effective and efficient mechanism for resource allocation, framing it as a key engine of economic progress. However, in practice, the free market is neither free nor fair for producers and consumers. Instead, it is largely controlled by capitalist interests. This idealised notion of a free market under capitalism becomes a mechanism that separates producers from consumers, establishing independent pricing structures designed to generate super-profits—often at the expense of working people. In a capitalist system, 'free market' implies that the state, government, and working masses—as both producers and consumers—cannot interfere in the market’s operations. Instead, market forces alone control prices, production, supply, demand, distribution, and consumption. Within this framework, the purchasing power of consumers and the productive capacities of producers determine individuals' perceived worth. Price, rather than intrinsic value, dictates everything in a free market. As a result, it is often fictitious desires, rather than genuine human needs, that shape the culture of the capitalist free market. The belief in the free market as an ideal under capitalism, championed by the Chicago School, has not only distorted economics as a discipline but has also eroded the social and moral foundations of the market once based on trust between consumers and producers regarding price, quality, and value. Capitalism’s version of free market undermines this trust, rendering market interactions impersonal, where consumers and producers are unknown to each other. Furthermore, neither symmetric nor asymmetric information is adequately accessible to producers and consumers concerning demand, supply, and pricing. As a result, the notion of perfect competition in the so-called free market under capitalism becomes a myth. Ultimately, it is the arbitrary nature of this free market that defines the system. Governments provide both legal protection and security for the so-called free market under capitalism, allowing it to operate with minimal risk. When the free-market faces crises, the state and government step in to rescue it. The rules and regulations of the free market are neither neutral nor natural; rather, they are designed to protect the interests of the capitalist classes. Market forces establish their own rules to maintain dominance over economic activities, backed by the approval of the state and government. Thus, there is no inherent virtue in an unfettered 'free market'; it is a capitalist project and a tool of exploitation of consumers and producers, legitimised by state and government. The free market serves as a tool for transferring resources and wealth from the masses to a small, capitalist elite. It functions as a system for profit accumulation, aimed at expanding capitalism and benefiting capitalists. Today, the fundamentalist belief in the free market and its absolutist nature act like an opiate for policymakers, driven either by ignorance or a conscious choice to overlook the market's history, social origins, and moral foundations. The capitalist voices like George Soros describe the free market as a system in which 'the doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism holds that the common good is best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest.' In reality, however, there is little common ground between capitalists and the working masses, who are both producers and consumers. The free market does not offer genuine economic freedom to consumers or producers; instead, it is the antithesis of freedom and choice for both groups. It imposes control over production and consumption by manipulating the processes, institutions, and structures of the free-market economy and its culture. The free market has failed to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. As a process, a project, and an institution, it has not succeeded in delivering and distributing resources, products, and services according to genuine human needs and desires. Free market has accelerated different forms of inequalities and undermined all attempts to achieve equality. It is time to reclaim the social and moral foundations of the market, where both consumers and producers are truly free to produce and consume. Saving the free market from capitalism and its proponents is essential. Free producers and free consumers can only establish free and fair market that works based on human trust and values of human needs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfg_-DYCn0U0V	2024-11-08T08:56:52-08:00	
How A Swiss-Led Global Network Fosters Greater Access To AI – Ana...	Switzerland is spearheading a global initiative to promote equal access to artificial intelligence (AI), regardless of a country’s economic strength or political power. Three pilot projects demonstrate the power of pooled international resources to boost AI research into some of the world’s most pressing problems. By Matthew Allen AI is widely acknowledged as a breakthrough technology that can power rapid advances in many areas of scientific research, from weather predictions to medicine and energy. But there is also a danger that resource-rich countries and companies could monopolise the new generation of powerful computers. While perceived as slow to adapt national laws to govern the use of AI domestically, Switzerland has now earned praise on the international stage for promoting the sharing of AI expertise and experience worldwide. The Swiss-led initiative, called the International Computation and AI Network (ICAIN), aims to matchmake scientific projects in developing nations with the most cutting-edge supercomputers and the world’s best AI know-how to create a level playing field. 'We observe a huge power imbalance,' Katharina Frey, deputy head of digital foreign policy at the Swiss foreign ministry, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'There are a handful of companies worldwide capable of developing large-scale models, while the majority of the world does not have access to this level of computing power.' Pushing back against inequality Besides the Swiss foreign ministry, the founding members of ICAIN also include the federal institutes of technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and Lausanne (EPFL), the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems, Data Science Africa, plus supercomputer centres in Switzerland and Finland. 'It is important that ICAIN is pushing back against inequality of access to AI,' said Ciira Maina, chair of Data Science Africa. 'Big tech is in itself not a bad thing – we all use the products. But it’s important to have a varied ecosystem in place.' Launched in January, ICAIN supports two science projects in Africa and an AI initiative with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Each project is granted access to supercomputers and leading academic AI experts. The ICAIN network closely follows a United Nations call for equal access to AI. In a September report, the UN singled out ICAIN as an example of how global resource-sharing AI networks can promote sustainability goals. 'Advanced economies have both the capability and duty to facilitate AI capacity-building through international collaboration,' the report reads. In the context of ICAIN, what are the practical implications of this? According to Maina, who’s also a professor of electrical engineering and data science at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya, international collaboration can boost African research into weather predictions and identifying crop diseases. 'Bringing on board more computing power is an exciting new ingredient because it means we can do this research on a larger scale,' said Maina. 'ICAIN has unlocked high-quality expertise and access to high-level computers.' Protecting sensitive data AI is able to crunch more data in machines that can be trained to 'think' for themselves, learning as they go along. This leads to a higher rate of computation and a greater variety of solutions to problems. This computational bounty could also prove beneficial to the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC. The ICRC relies on vast amounts of case files and field notes obtained from their workers on the ground, supplemented by data from satellites, for example. The ICRC hopes that Large Language Models – AI systems trained to understand and interpret large volumes of data – can make better sense of the continuous flow of ever-changing data that derives from chaotic situations, allowing it to better plan and mobilise operations. 'We see how AI is reshaping warfare and the direct impact this has on civilians in conflict zones,' said Blaise Robert, who advises the humanitarian organisation on AI. 'AI also presents important potential to improve the way we deliver humanitarian aid.' Swiss initiative It is also important to the ICRC that ICAIN allows it to retain complete control over sensitive data. 'Retaining the trust of the people we talk with in sensitive situations depends on our capacity to maintain the confidentiality of that dialogue,' said Robert. 'It’s very important that the ICRC keeps very tight control of its data. We need to be certain we are not dependent on certain actors who could later bring negative operational consequences.' Maina from Data Science Africa praised Switzerland for taking the initiative to get ICAIN off the ground. 'Many people have been talking about the AI inequality problem, but sometimes it takes leadership to bring the right people together in the same room to solve problems collaboratively,' he said. 'We have started with a seed that can hopefully fuel more global interaction and bring new partners on board.' Switzerland may have initiated ICAIN, but the Swiss foreign ministry says it has no desire to control its operations and continued growth into other regions of the world. The plan is to create an independent legal entity in Switzerland that will manage the matchmaking between scientific projects and AI resources. Sustainability and justice Details of the association are yet to be released but the idea is to free the body from any suggestion of political interference by countries. 'We absolutely need initiatives that aim to create alternatives to the current political economy behind AI, which is dominated by a handful of enormously big global companies,' Angela Müller, head of policy at the NGO Algorithm Watch Switzerland, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'ICAIN should not limit itself to focusing on how we can use more and more AI to promote sustainability or justice, but also on how we can make AI itself more sustainable and just,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWco__jhnAERvcgjojmG4DSc	2024-11-07T16:50:14-08:00	
Fighting The Rat Menace In Cities: The NYC Experiment – Analysis	By Ramanath Jha Recently, New York City’s (NYC) proposed experiment with rodent contraceptives to combat rats became global news. The step was labelled by the city mayor as a 'new paradigm in urban rat management.' The city council recently approved the deployment of ContraPest, a type of rodent birth control tool, to be tested in limited areas of the city. Its developer, US biotechnology company SenesTech, claims that it provides a humane and sustainable choice for long-term rodent management. Based on the success of the city’s trial, a new approach might be taken to deal with NYC’s about 3 million rats. If successful, this experiment could mark a departure from traditional methods of rodent control. Rats have been known to co-exist with humans in cities for centuries. They have also been a nuisance in cities all over the world. They are a risk to human health and a danger to built structures, electrical cables, and parked cars. They could result in a major loss of food grains stored inside granaries. The World Health Organization (WHO) for instance, estimated that rat control measures in Mumbai alone could save enough food to feed 90,000 people annually. Studies conducted in India indicate that 2.5 percent of all food grains stored in India are lost to rodents. A conservative analysis estimated that between 1930 and 2022, rats caused a loss of US$ 3.6 billion to the world’s economy. Rats contaminate food and animal feed, introducing unwelcome parasites such as fleas, lice and ticks into the human habitat. They can cause allergies, rat bite fever, scrub typhus, leishmania and plague. At times, their activities could lead to salmonellosis (food poisoning). The COVID-19 pandemic, forced rats to discover new food sources. Rodentologists estimate that hundreds of thousands of rats were killed during the pandemic. But as businesses and eateries have become operational and returned, the resilient rats have rebounded, and their population has grown in cities across the globe. Furthermore, climate change, which brought longer periods of warm weather, has given them more time for breeding. Dealing with rats has not been easy. They are tenacious, highly adaptable, and prolific breeders. NYC has tried various methods in the past to tackle the menace. In 2023, the city council passed a new law that required contractors of construction projects to shoulder rat extermination costs. The law emphasised prevention over reaction and laid down strategies for rat control, which included conducting regular inspections, identifying potential rat entry points (gaps in walls or floors) and sealing them, discovering signs of infestation early and eliminating them, adequately storing garbage and ensuring its safe disposal. Additionally, NYC has altered the trash take-out times for businesses and residents to prevent garbage from staying out too long on the streets, allowing rats to fester. The city now requires food-related businesses to dispose of their waste in secure containers instead of trash bags. To incentivise households, NYC also decided to replace the residents’ trash bins with larger cans at the cost of US$ 3.4 million. Rats in Indian cities Indian cities have had large rat populations for a long time and controlling rats has been an age-old responsibility of Indian Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The task has been traditionally assigned to the Pest Control Officer of the Public Health Department. Mumbai was especially vulnerable to the dangers of a plague on account of it being a port city. The city’s infamous plague attack at the end of the 19th century killed 200,000 people. During the plague threat of 1994, Mumbai used the plague vaccine prepared by the Municipal Rat Destruction Unit at the Haffkine Institute to bring the epidemic under control. Wards of the city were divided into ‘rat labour boundaries,’ assigned to beat officers for inspection and prevention. The most common methods for rat destruction were physical and chemical. Additionally, night rat killing was a unique method of rat control that was exclusively used in Mumbai. Delhi, too, has a massive rat population, mainly residing underground, adroitly finding shelter in sewerage networks, water pipes, fibre optic and gas pipelines. Delhi’s rats have thus been able to develop a complex underground network of rat colonies. Kolkata has also been battling rats which have been found to tunnel through the concrete foundations of flyovers and nibble away at vital underground sewage and cable lines. They have been seen in slums, eateries and historical colonial buildings. Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been seeking advice from other ULBs and exploring measures to combat the growing rat population. In Patna, rats were found to have burrowed under the railway platform causing its collapse. The library of Patna University was at one point closed to deal with rats that had taken over a section of the book shelves. Although some cities around the world have claimed to have successfully controlled rodent growth, in most places, rats have managed to survive and continue to operate as usual. Rat control complexities Over the years, different rodent management measures have come into use. Trapping rats has been one of the earliest used methods. Use of rodenticide has also been common. However, rats are known to develop a resistance to them. The use of rat poison has not been favoured by experts since it often ends up bio-accumulating in the food chain. Encapsulated bait formulations have been observed to have reasonable success. These, however, run the danger of risk to non-target. Chemical control, according to rodentologists, is the most effective known method for rodent management in urban conditions. However, even this has had limited effectiveness. Even though city rats are widely prevalent and pose a huge threat to city infrastructure as well as the health of citizens, they are among the least studied wildlife in urban environments. As a consequence, very little is known about their ecology. This disinterest in rodent research exists despite the broad concession that traditional methods of rat control in the urban landscape have not produced the desired results. The ongoing speed of human urbanisation, compounded by the effects of climate change, is leading to a proliferation of rat-related risks. Further, urbanisation in countries like India, along with heavy densification of its cities will inexorably lead to conditions that will substantially support the multiplication of rats. Studying urban rats has also been fraught with difficulties because rats inhabit spaces owned by both public and private entities, which poses problems with entry and a hindrance to the prolonged observation of rat behaviour. A suitable urban rat research site, that is a mix of public spaces, commercial and business sites, as well as residential areas, which can allow for a comprehensive study over a long enough period to generate robust science, is difficult to obtain. This problem is directly attributable to some notable knowledge gaps that continue to accrue in the rat ecological literature. However, there have been recent successes achieved in fertility control studies through immuno-contraceptives. What is now required is testing their effectiveness in a live situation. Here, NYC has taken the lead by designating city areas where contraceptive delivery will take place. This step towards rodent control could prove invaluable in the cities’ fight against rats. If this experimentation is successful, it may open up a new methodology that can provide an effective mechanism for rodent control globally.

Material World: How Europe Can Compete With China In Race For Afr...	By Sarah Logan Critical juncture Despite heightened focus in the West about dependence on China – and high-level efforts to recalibrate these relations at the strategic level – Europeans’ economic reliance on China has continued to grow in recent years. EU imports from China reached €515.9 billion in 2023, across a wide array of products, many of which are vital to advanced economies. At the heart of these entangled relations is European states’ and economies’ dependence on China for the critical raw materials (CRMs) needed to produce green energy technologies, including solar modules, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and permanent magnets for wind turbines. The central importance of these technologies today risks leaving Europe heavily reliant on other countries for their supply – an acute challenge when production is highly concentrated in China as strategic competition intensifies between China and the West. To respond to this situation, the European Union has vowed to diversify its energy sources and build out CRM supply chains and processing capabilities that are unconnected with China (ex-China). The bloc has introduced an array of policies aimed at achieving this. 'De-risking' supply chains is the way the EU terms its efforts to reduce its economic reliance on China. This de-risking approach encompasses the green energy technologies critical for the EU’s decarbonisation and energy security, as well as a range of other technologies, including in the military field. Managing European exposure to China in different domains is vital not only for Europe’s energy security, but also for the EU to retain and enhance its geopolitical and geoeconomic strength in a rapidly changing world. In its quest to access ex-China CRMs, the EU has turned to resource-rich African countries it regards as politically friendly. In the last two years, it has signed strategic partnerships to develop sustainable CRM value chains with several African countries, and it is supporting the development of an economic corridor in southern Africa. The EU hopes such agreements will unlock opportunities for European participation in CRM supply chains in these African countries. Despite these ambitious policies and the strategic partnerships signed to date, Europeans are struggling to overcome market forces to break their dependence on China. Other players, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, are also entering CRM mining and processing and are focusing on Africa in particular. Time is fast running out for Europe to win access to the CRMs it needs. The sluggish progress indicates a wide gap between ambitions and reality, especially regarding CRM projects in Africa. It is essential that Europeans understand this disconnect and consider how to address it. This policy brief aims to support this understanding and propose solutions. It begins by situating EU efforts within the evolving global CRM landscape. The paper examines the EU-Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains in order to show what it will take to increase European participation in ex-China CRM supply chains in African countries. This agreement illustrates the ways in which political factors may have influenced the EU’s selection of third country partners more than the commercial reality of a country’s CRM opportunities. At the same time, market dynamics and commercial viability challenges continue to deter European private sector involvement in CRMs in Africa. The paper suggests ways Europeans can begin to turn this state of affairs around. Most urgent is the need to innovate with new financial mechanisms offered by the EU and member state governments, which have so far failed to motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in African countries. If the EU is to succeed in its stated mission, it will need to provide greater financial support to better align European private sector interests with the bloc’s own energy security and de-risking objectives. This will come at a cost. But it is the price it must pay if the EU is to reduce its dependence on China and others. The global race for CRMs The EU has introduced a number of key policies to reduce its supply chain dependence on China. These include the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), which aims to secure a sustainable supply of CRMs for European industry and remove import dependencies on any single country. The Net-Zero Industry Act seeks to enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of European manufacturing of net zero technologies. The EU has also joined the Minerals Security Partnership, a group of countries (excluding China) that seeks to develop diverse and sustainable CRM supply chains. Additionally, the EU launched the Global Gateway initiative, which aims to mobilise €300 billion between 2021 and 2027 to boost European investments in energy, transport, and digital infrastructure in countries across the world. The Global Gateway is of particular importance to the EU’s engagement with African countries, given its explicit focus on external partners. The EU hopes the initiative will enhance the relationship between the two continents. Africa has emerged as a key battleground in the scramble for access to CRMs. The continent possesses around one-third of the world’s mineral resources, including significant deposits of cobalt, copper, lithium, graphite, and a range of rare earth elements. CRMs are vital for the production of a wide range of technologies, including green energy technologies such as solar modules, EV batteries, and permanent magnets. Military uses include beryllium needed for fighter jets and targeting and surveillance systems, and semi-conductors, which are critical to missile guidance systems and encryption technology. As the world decarbonises and increasingly switches to green energy, demand for these minerals is set to soar. The production of some of these minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, and graphite, will need to rise by up to 500 per cent by 2050. This feat cannot be achieved without the supply of Africa’s CRMs. In pursuit of its goals, the EU signed strategic partnerships with Namibia in November 2022, the DRC and Zambia in October 2023, and Rwanda in February 2024. It is also party to the multi-stakeholder agreement for developing the Lobito Corridor, a railway and economic corridor joining Zambia, the DRC, and Angola, which is a logistics route enabling access to the CRMs of these African countries. Despite the EU’s ambitious policies and strategic partnerships, European companies have been hesitant to venture into CRM supply chains in these African countries. In fact, since the advent of de-risking as an approach, little has actually materialised by way of projects. This points to a major disconnect between the EU’s geopolitical and geoeconomic agenda and the interests of the European private sector. This is a key challenge given that the EU is extremely dependent on European companies to deliver on its de-risking goals. As EU efforts falter, other geopolitical powers are working to obtain African mineral resources in pursuit of their economic and energy security. For example, Emirati companies have recently purchased stakes in a number of mines in Zambia and the DRC. Turkey is making inroads into African mining, including in Sudan and Niger. Recently, India has also initiated discussions with some African countries around CRM mining opportunities, with exploration activities planned in Zambia. Even like-minded allies are geoeconomic competitors for Europe in this area, also aiming to build out their own CRM supply chains. Notably, the United States is drawing some investment away from European manufacturing in solar and EV supply chains, for example, through the attractive subsidies offered under its Inflation Reduction Act, which comprise an estimated 20 to 40 per cent of unsubsidised costs for solar modules and a $7,500 tax credit for EV batteries. This financial support has persuaded manufacturers to locate themselves in the US rather than in Europe, taking production capacity, job opportunities, and CRM supply chains with them. How China’s dominance grew To work out what Europeans need to do to get ahead of their geoeconomic competitors, a deeper understanding is required of how China in particular got to where it is today. In short, China appears to have spotted the strategic importance of CRMs at least 20 years ago. It has succeeded in gradually expanding both its mining operations in Africa and processing capacity back in China. Over time, China has moved up the value chain to manufacture more sophisticated technologies. Moving in as Europeans retreat For many decades, European mining companies were leading players in African mining. However, European operations in Africa declined steeply over the last 10 to 15 years, coinciding with the end of the commodity super cycle, an extended period during which prices had remained above their long-run trend. The high commodity prices of the super cycle period were driven by demand outstripping supply – these high prices encouraged greater mining investments which, in turn, led to higher supply and eventual collapse in prices as supply overtook demand. Mining companies and their financial backers, who had extended themselves when commodity prices were high, found themselves unable to fully recoup their investments once prices dropped. Around this time, international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards also grew in importance, driven by a range of governmental, business, and civil society initiatives. European countries became signatories to many of these efforts, placing new expectations on European companies to adhere to ESG standards, including those encapsulated in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. Bringing mining operations into quick compliance with ESG standards in more undeveloped environments was not straightforward, as mining is a relatively ‘dirty’ industry and is costly to pursue in a responsible manner. To illustrate: complying with ESG standards involvessafeguarding biodiversity, lowering carbon footprints, rehabilitating land after mine closure, implementing community engagement activities (such as providing clean water and health services), and committing to responsible resource use, transparent reporting, and good governance practices, among other things. ESG compliance often increases operational costs in the short term, requiring additional resources for these efforts. This new state of affairs initially rendered European companies uncompetitive compared to others that were not similarly expected to comply with ESG standards. European public and private finance for mining also waned, with banks having little interestin the sector amid challenges around ESG compliance and after the losses occasioned by the end of the commodity super cycle. As European mining operations in Africa declined, Chinese companies were aggressively increasing their mining interests on the continent. This was facilitated in part by minerals-for-infrastructure deals under China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Unconstrained by ESG standards, Chinese mining companies enjoyed greater freedom to strike deals with African governments on accessing mineral resources. China has since grown its control in the African mining sector, particularly in valuable CRMs such as cobalt, copper, and lithium in the DRC, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Like Europe before it, China exported Africa’s resources in raw form for processing back home. This allowed it to use its cheaper electricity and labour, as well as notable state supportand more relaxed approach to ESG standards within China, to build out CRM processing capabilities at home. Within a matter of years, China began to develop economies of scale that further reduced processing costs and allowed it to refine CRMs more cheaply than anyone else. Even metals and minerals mined in the EU, such as lithium, are commonly processed in China, at a lower price, and with the risk of environmental damage removed from Europe. For a number of years, the mining and initial processing of CRMs in China suited European firms well enough – after all, these were often hazardous activities with low profit margins. European companies seized the opportunity to concentrate on higher value phases of processing and manufacture. Over time, however, China came to control 60 per cent of global CRM production and 85 per cent of processing capacity. Chinese manufacturers also started working their way up the value chain, leveraging their greater access to CRMs and lower manufacturing costs to establish a system that now poses both a supply chain risk and competition risk for Europe. China appears to have had a comprehensive strategy in the CRM sector long before others recognised the crucial importance of these products. China has decisively strengthened its hold on the manufacture of the green energy technologies that are now in high demand globally. Europe today sources 90 per cent of its solar modules from China, and European-manufactured solar modules are heavily reliant on imported components and materials from China. China achieved this through its lower production costs, as well as creating a supply glut of cheaper products that have depressed prices and undercut production elsewhere. European solar producers are unable to compete on price with Chinese manufacturers. As a result, around half of the EU’s solar production capacity is at risk of being shuttered. This is not only bad for European industry, it also threatens to further entrench Europe’s dependence on China. China similarly controls 80 per cent of the global market for battery cell production, in which it leads on cost by a substantial margin. Overcapacity in battery manufacturing in China was already three times that of domestic demand in 2023 and may rise to more than six times by 2025; oversupply has collapsed prices and severely impacted on European producers. With batteries comprising around a third of the cost of EVs, and with labour and electricity costs markedly higher in Europe, European car manufacturers cannot compete with their Chinese equivalents on cost, particularly when some Chinese firms also benefit from unfair subsidisation. Consolidation in China European efforts to reduce this reliance on Chinese CRMs and green energy technology supply chains are made more challenging by the particular market dynamics of CRMs. Understanding these market dynamics is necessary for considering Europe’s de-risking options. Importantly, the markets for CRMs are smaller than those for industrial metals, both in terms of volume and value of commodities, with some CRM markets amounting to only a few billion dollars annually. The pricing of CRM products can be opaque, with prices often agreed through confidential bilateral agreements or by vertically integrated Chinese companies that both mine and process CRMs. In some instances they may also be the buyer of the refined CRMs, while receiving some form of state support. A further complication is that a number of CRMs are by-products in the processing of other primary products, so their supply may be tied to the price of the primary product. This can increase price volatility and means that increased demand for CRMs does not necessarily lead to increased supply in the short term. Refining encompasses a complexity of different processes required for different CRMs, producing a range of refined products with varying specifications depending on potential uses and users. Many refining processes are highly carbon-intensive and can be very environmentally damaging. Crucially, processing requires a certain scale to be economically viable and not all mines – or, indeed, countries – produce CRMs in sufficient volume and of sufficient quality to make local processing economically viable. The smaller volumes of raw minerals, as well as the complexity and low profitability of refining, mean that processing often needs to be consolidated to be more viable. These dynamics helped facilitate China’s domination of CRM processing. Further processing beyond the initial refining stage is more advanced and includes the manufacture of precursor cells and other components from intermediary inputs. It requires easy access to a variety of intermediary inputs, as well as scale to be economically viable. The co-location in China of different CRM supply chains has undoubtedly facilitated the lower-cost manufacture of technologies such as solar equipment and EV batteries, enabling China to gain considerable market share. Additionally, manufacturing activities taking place in other countries still rely on China for at least some necessary components. Establishing their own access to CRMs and building out processing capabilities will be a monumental task for Europeans. Imposing dutieson Chinese EV imports into Europe will help protect some European manufacturing. But achieving further gains will require Europeans to either directly participate or otherwise invest in every step of the CRM supply chain – mining, refining, and further processing. Understanding what this would involve can help inform the design of the financial and other mechanisms needed to shift European private sector actors to (re-)enter CRM supply chains in Africa. Partnering with Namibia The EU sees Namibia as a partner with a shared commitment to enabling the global green transition. The EU and Namibia signed a strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains and green hydrogen two years ago. Enough time has now elapsed to assess the agreement’s impact on European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector – and, therefore, its contribution to Europe’s de-risking objectives. The conclusion is that there is some way to go. Despite the strategic partnership and some new activities, there is still no presence of EU companies in Namibia’s CRM value chains. An attractive partner Compared to other sub-Saharan African countries, Namibia offers remarkable political stability and an investment environment that is increasingly conducive to foreign investment. It has abundant land, a very small population of around 2.5 million people, and a population density of only 3.7 people per km2. Export infrastructure and skilled labour exist, although they need further development if CRM mining and processing activities in the country are to be scaled up. Additionally, it has a notably long coastline and easy access to global shipping routes. High electricity costs and scarcity of freshwater pose notable obstacles to expanding CRM mining and processing in Namibia. In 2020, electricity imports were needed to meet around 60 per cent of demandin Namibia. This high dependency on imports, together with cost-reflective tariffs and margins for regional electricity suppliers, meant that Namibia had the most expensive grid-provided electricity prices in southern Africa for commercial electricity consumers, at around 2.40 NAD (around €0.14) per kWh in 2022 (although commercial consumers using off-grid options such as diesel generators in other southern African countries undoubtedly face substantially higher electricity costs). However, Namibia has world-class solar and wind resources and, leveraging its abundant land, numerous renewable energy power projects are under way. More capacity expansion is planned and is projected to reach 230 MW of solar and 149 MW of wind by 2035. Deployment of solar plants is already lowering the cost of electricity in Namibia and will make desalination of seawater cheaper in instances where this is needed. This will help overcome the country’s current electricity and freshwater constraints. The government also intends to leverage these renewable energy resources to establish a burgeoning green hydrogen sector, which could power CRM mining and processing in the country. At a time when many other southern African countries are struggling with limited and unreliable electricity supply, Namibia is on a trajectory of making electricity both more plentiful and cheaper. Namibia is thus set to become an attractive location for green processing and manufacturing activities – including potentially in ex-China CRM value chains. Critical raw materials in Namibia While Namibia’s broader investment environment is attractive, its CRM potential is more muted, although this is evolving as more mineral exploration takes place. Namibia has a history of mining, particularly in diamonds and uranium, and produces a number of CRMs, including lithium, graphite, copper, and rare earth elements. It has some local processing capacity in copper smelting and zinc processing. Uranium is currently the only CRM for which Namibia is a notable global supplier – it is the world’s third largest producer of uranium. The country’s two most productive operational uranium mines, Rössing and Husab, are majority-owned by Chinese companies. Uranium mining in Namibia has not always been profitable, but its strategic importance for nuclear power reactors in China and China’s long-term investment policy have enabled its continued production. China’s ability to prioritise access to critical minerals over project profitability is a key factor, highlighting the limitations of Europe’s market-based approach to CRM access to date. Namibia has several existing lithium mines but, to date, the country has been a relatively small global supplier of lithium. The quality of currently mined lithium is far below the global 6 per cent standardneeded for production of battery-grade lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, thereby earning a lower price per tonne. Low lithium prices in recent years have led to the temporary closure of some of Namibia’s lithium mines. However, recent exploration activities appear to have uncovered new lithium finds of a higher ore grade, raising the likelihood of more profitable lithium mining in the country, should lithium prices recover. Namibia also has deposits of heavy rare earth metals such as dysprosium and terbium, which are used in the manufacture of permanent magnets. Namibia’s Lofdal deposit is considered to be one of the largest heavy rare earth deposits outside China. The country’s rare earth projects are largely still in the exploration or feasibilityphases. In addition to Chinese mining companies, Australian and Canadian mining companies are also active in lithium and rare earth element mining in Namibia, especially in exploration activities. But once they have identified commercially viable mineral deposits, they have often sold mining projects on to Chinese firms for development.[1] In an effort to force greater local beneficiation, in June 2023 the Namibian government banned the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. This move follows similar measures elsewhere, including in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Mining licences now require mining companies to undertake at least initial processing of these raw minerals locally – but it is unclear whether local processing of these minerals is either commercially viable or technically feasible. The new requirement to undertake local processing comes amid a sharp slump in prices. By September 2024, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide prices had lost almost 90 per cent of their value since late 2022. This makes the proposition for local beneficiation of lithium particularly challenging at this time. The sharp decline in lithium prices has prompted Zimbabwe, for example, to soften its stance against requiring local processing of lithium in the current climate. It may be necessary for Namibia, too, to rethink this requirement in the short term. Similarly, prices for dysprosium and terbium have collapsed since their five-year high in early 2022 and mid-2022, respectively, with the price slump driven by oversupply within China and reduced demand for magnets amid an effort to lower production costs. Despite the current unfavourable market, a Chinese company is reportedly currently constructing a lithium refinery in the country.[2]This is a notable step for local processing in Namibia. Rather than confirming the commercial viability of local processing, however, this may merely indicate how much China is willing to pay for access to lithium. China’s ability to undertake local processing, potentially in the absence of commercial viability, furthers its own strategic goals. It also demonstrates goodwill towards the Namibian government, likely raising its political and economic leverage with them. China taking the first initiative with local lithium refining in Namibia unfortunately may also deter European companies from establishing local processing activities, as it is far from clear whether the country’s lithium production could support more than one refinery, at least in the short and medium term. Subsequent market entrants would struggle to secure lithium ore supply if the first-moving Chinese refinery has locked in supply through long-term agreements. The processing of rare earths is even more challenging. These elements are found in very low concentrations, and extraction and separation can pose serious environmental risks as radioactive residues are released, which can contaminate the air, water, and soil. Around 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste are produced for every one tonne of rare earths, necessitating extensive waste management. Specialist expertise is also needed for processing rare earths but this is relatively scarce outside China. These difficult dynamics need to be borne in mind as Namibian policymakers seek to enforce local beneficiation of rare earth elements – and must also be considered by European stakeholders as the EU pushes for greater de-risking from China. In an effort to comply with the mandate for local processing, an alliance of three rare earth mining companies from Canada and Namibia is undertaking a feasibility study to explore the viability of developing a joint separation plant in Namibia. This plant would separate rare earth elements from concentrates of mixed rare earth oxides. A collaborative effort is necessary to try to meet the significant upfront cost of plant construction and minimum critical mass of ore needed for processing operations, which exceed what each developer would be able to deliver individually. Processing rare earths in Namibia will be very challenging, and the viability of this ex-China local processing will undoubtedly also be undermined by China’s ban on the export of technologies needed for the extraction and separation of rare earth elements. The ban aims to hamstring ex-China processing and retain China’s near-total dominance of rare earth element processing. It will be a costly proposition for European companies to enter projects for local processing of lithium and rare earth elements. This reality is not sufficiently reflected in the EU’s commitments to support local value addition in CRM value chains in African countries. The unintended outcomes of European policy in Namibia The EU’s strategic partnership with Namibia was the first that the bloc signed with an African country. It was motivated by the need for Europe to diversify its energy sources, including towards renewable energy, and Europe perceiving Africa as a close neighbour with common values and interests. Regarding Namibia specifically, the EU hopes to collaborate on green hydrogen development and to gain access to CRMs in Namibia, with the view to building out European CRM supply chains. This would boost Europe’s industrial capacity and de-risk its energy system from China. In turn, Namibia aims to use its CRM resources to increase local value addition, job creation, skills development, and technology transfer, and to support industrialisation and higher domestic revenue mobilisation and foreign currency earnings. Namibia is also keen to diversify its investors and dilute its reliance on China.[3] European interest in its CRM sector would present Namibia with an opportunity to leverage competition for better deals. The scene is thus set to translate the strategic partnership into gains for both Namibia and the EU. However, while European mining companies have the capabilities to mine CRMs, none are currently active in Namibia. Nor have they shown any appetite to participate in mining operations in the country since the signing of the strategic partnership. Several factors may be dissuading them. The cost and difficulty of ESG compliance in mining activities is a barrier. [4] European finance shies away from these projects with concerns around the challenges of local processing predominating among investors amid calls for increased local beneficiation of minerals in African countries. As noted, Namibia’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium and rare earth elements means that mining licences now require at least initial local processing of minerals. In terms of whether local processing leads to improved outcomes for the host country, evidence from previous export bans, including in Tanzania and Zambia, is not encouraging. There, the result appears to have been decreased local production of both processed and raw materials. This suggests foreign investors’ coolness towards mining operations in countries where local processing is required. If European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector is to be established in this landscape, two key elements are needed: first, the European private sector must be sufficiently commercially interested in available opportunities. The EU and its member state governments cannot themselves participate in CRM supply chains – in mining or processing or even as significant buyers of ex-China CRM products. Rather, they need the European private sector to drive these participation efforts. Second, European mining companies would need to outmanoeuvre others to secure these opportunities, notably through making a superior ‘offer’ to African governments than competitors’. The European offer would need to exceed that of China in particular. Whether European companies can be persuaded to participate in Namibia’s CRM supply chains depends on the economic attractiveness of projects. CRM supply chain opportunities are deeply location-specific in terms of their viability, which can vary depending on the size and quality of mineral deposits and the presence of enabling infrastructure, including transport infrastructure, reliable and affordable electricity, and sufficient water for mining and processing activities. A predictable and enabling regulatory environment, a workforce with the necessary skills, and easy access to global shipping routes are also key factors. Namibia is appealing across several of these factors, but the lack of extensive mineral exploration in the country and limited knowledge around the commercial viability of local processing remain barriers. They also bring into question the basis for the EU’s selection of external partners and the realism of commitments made to partner countries under the strategic partnerships. Europe’s ‘offer’ to Namibia is encapsulated in the strategic partnership itself; two commitments made in the agreement have particular relevance. First, the EU has undertaken to adhere to international ESG standards in projects in Namibia. Second, it has promised to support the establishment of local processing of CRMs. These commitments are attractive to Namibia, with the latter commitment now also reinforced by the Namibian government’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. The EU’s commitment to Namibia reflects its interest in the sustainable development of Namibia’s CRM supply chains – but, as noted, only companies can actually do the work that makes these commitments a reality. The EU and Namibia agreed a roadmap for implementing the strategic partnership in November 2023; it outlines an ambitious list of activities for the 2023 to 2025 period. The roadmap includes activities such as capacity building for geological surveying and undertaking a pre-feasibility study for lithium processing in Namibia. These activities are currently ongoing.[5] Most roadmap activities, including these examples, are aimed at improving the local environment for developing CRM value chains in general – which benefits all actors active in Namibia’s CRM supply chains. Given that European companies are not present in the CRM sector in Namibia, the EU’s contributions are currently improving the environment only for other actors, including China. Nevertheless, by enabling the operations of more actors, these efforts may indirectly contribute to diluting China’s control in some value chains. This may be acceptable from the EU’s perspective if supporting Namibia’s sustainable development was the purpose of the partnership. But Europe’s de-risking from China was an important objective for the EU. It is therefore a point of concern that not only are European companies not benefitting from such activities, but the EU’s efforts may in fact be indirectly undermining its own de-risking objectives by helping Chinese companies and others to strengthen their access to CRMs.[6] At the same time, the EU needs to be seen to be delivering on commitments made under the implementation roadmap in order to maintain its relationship with Namibia and preserve its credibility with other African countries. Europeans are therefore stuck in a lose-lose situation with roadmap implementation unless they can cultivate European private sector participation in Namibia’s CRM supply chain, and quickly. To address this, they must renew efforts to achieve European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector. This would ensure the strategic partnership contributes to Europe’s de-risking efforts. Namibia is an easier prospect in many ways than Zambia or the DRC, given its enabling environment and existence of ex-China CRM supply chain opportunities, such as the operation of Australian and Canadian mining companies. It is vital that the EU is able to make its strategic partnership work for European interests, or it will not bode well for efforts in other countries. The difficulty in getting traction on European investments in Namibia highlights the limits of what EU efforts can achieve without European private sector participation. It also raises the need for the EU to reconsider how it deploys its resources in furtherance of its own de-risking objectives. Specifically, resources could make more of an impact if they were targeted directly at incentivising European companies to enter CRM supply chains – rather than providing all-sector support. More focus on market economics and less traditional development policy is needed. Lining up buyers for ex-China CRMs For European participation in mining or local processing in Namibia to contribute to de-risking, it will also be necessary to keep all further processing of these CRM products outside of Chinese value chains. If products enter Chinese processing or manufacturing supply chains later, it will negate European de-risking efforts in mining and local processing phases. Achieving this starts with finding ex-China buyers for these refined CRMs. Buyers will need to satisfy at least three key criteria to ensure that supply chains remain ex-China and contribute to Europe’s de-risking objectives. Like-minded allies that the EU wishes to work with on CRM access would likely have a shared view on these criteria, potentially creating scope for cooperation. First, buyers will need to be European or from a friendly third country that will later sell components or final products manufactured with ex-China CRMs to Europe, thereby enabling Europe to diversify its supply chains. This would need to be stipulated in contracts, with necessary conditions passed on to every actor in the supply chain until products reach Europe – although this is a complex and difficult arrangement to enforce in practice. Second, buyers will need to be willing to pay a premium for the ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs refined in Namibia. These products will be more expensive than their Chinese equivalents, due to smaller economies of scale and higher production costs, at least in the short term. Third, buyers must be willing to purchase refined CRMs and undertake further processing of these products into intermediary inputs and components themselves, rather than sourcing already-processed components and final products from China. This requires European companies to build out CRM processing capacity along the supply chain. Finding buyers that meet these criteria will be very challenging. For example, there is currently only one facility in the EU capable of separating rare earths for magnet production, with a second plantpotentially being operational by 2025. European buyers are also not yet willing to pay a premium for ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs, as much as they may like the idea of responsible sourcing.[7] Price still matters more to European buyers than where CRM products come from, although many European customers are increasingly concerned about the vulnerabilities created by their high reliance on China and are actively looking for alternative suppliers. Policy instruments can be used to help shift European procurement away from China’s supply chains to an extent, such as application of import charges under the carbon border adjustment mechanism or duties on EVs imported from China. Nevertheless, there are limits to what costs European buyers can be expected to absorb where price differentials between Chinese and ex-China products are high. Additionally, European companies have situated themselves at the higher end of the value chain. They need to buy components rather than lithium carbonate, for example, for their manufacturing operations. Little incentive exists for European companies to move to lower rungs of the value chain when cheaper, already-manufactured components and products from China are available. For European companies to build out processing capacity in parallel to China will be costly and will take time – posing a challenge to urgent decarbonisation demands. Underlying these challenges is the further threat that, in an effort to reinforce its CRM supply chain dominance and strengthen its geoeconomic position, China may use its supply chain domination as a tool of retaliation. It could ban the export of CRM products to certain countries, or it could intentionally trigger a supply glut of any CRM product at any time in order to depress global prices and collapse the profitability of ex-China operations. The global impact of a supply glut is already seen with the ongoing collapse in lithium and rare earth prices. Western geoeconomic measures towards China may be met with retaliation that could send European companies active in ex-China CRM supply chains into financial distress or bankruptcy. Given these challenges, it is evident that financial mechanisms are needed to improve the commercial viability of ex-China CRM opportunities and to persuade European companies to participate in ex-China CRM supply chains. What Europeans should do Improve support mechanisms for European companies The EU has introduced various policies and initiatives with the goal of supporting European companies operating in CRM supply chains, including in projects located outside the EU in friendly third countries. To access benefits, projects generally need to be attributed with Strategic Project status. Under the CRMA, for example, applicants for Strategic Project status must submit to the European Commission a range of supporting evidence to demonstrate that the project will strengthen the EU’s supply of CRMs, is technically feasible, will comply with ESG standards, and will undertake local value addition if in a third country. They must share a business plan that shows, among other things, the financial viability of the project, including secured funding and offtake agreements. Applications must be submitted for consideration ahead of board meetings, which may be held quarterly or biannually. Projects given Strategic Project status can receive assistance from the CRM Board to identify potential funding sources, including private investors, the European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, international finance institutions, and programmes and initiatives of member states and the EU (including the Global Gateway). The CRMA does not itself make new funding sources available, so financing options are limited to what other sources of funding can offer. The act also promises to facilitate offtake agreements, with the European Commission undertaking to establish a bidding process that could match buyers and sellers of CRM products based on the volume and quality of CRMs being sought or sold, intended price at which to buy or sell, and desired duration of the offtake agreement. Most of these mechanisms are very recent and their impact on incentivising European participation in CRM supply chains in Africa is yet to be seen. Indeed, the first application round for Strategic Project status under the CRMA closed in August 2024, with 170 applicationssubmitted. It is not yet known whether any of these applications pertain to possible CRM projects in Namibia or the other African countries with which the EU has signed strategic partnerships. Some challenges are, however, apparent. For example, CRMA Strategic Projects can only receive advice on potential funding sources and the proposed bidding process for CRM offtake can only attempt to match buyers and sellers. This makes receiving financing and offtake facilitation potentially both uncertain and not very time sensitive. This will be a challenge for European companies looking to take quick advantage of an emerging opportunity, particularly when competitors are able to move faster. Projects must also be at a sufficiently mature stage, requiring them to have progressed to that point in the absence of Strategic Project benefits. This excludes projects that could have reached viability if financial support from the EU had been available at an earlier stage. Additionally, the European Commission’s efforts to match buyers and sellers of CRM products will be complicated by the non-standardisation of these products, as CRMs must be refined to particular buyer specifications and few companies purchase the same kinds of raw materials. CRM products do not lend themselves to bulk procurement, creating a very different scenario to, for example, development of joint procurement platforms for green hydrogen or natural gas, which are homogeneous products. The EU pinned much hope on its strategic partnerships with African countries increasing its access to CRMs. Yet the lack of European private sector participation means this is access is failing to materialise. Will the CRMA Strategic Projects approach be more effective? This will depend on whether the benefits extended to these projects succeed in aligning private sector interests with the EU’s ambitions. This seems unlikely in the current market circumstances. Incentivise the private sector The level of financing required for European companies to get in front of competitors in CRM mining and processing in Africa far exceeds the funding the EU and other European partners have made available to date. While other powers are speeding ahead, leveraging significant available resources to aggressively pursue opportunities, the cost of catching up is growing for Europe. In addition to those already adopted, the EU will need to devise the following forms of support. First, European companies participating in either mining or local processing need some form of price protection. This could be provided by European public financial institutions extending guarantees to producers to establish a minimum price (floor) and maximum price (ceiling) for ex-China products. This would remove some price volatility – on the upside as well as the downside – protecting producers against price drops by China while facilitating more long-term offtake agreements made possible by greater price certainty. Second, greater deployment of political risk insurance is needed to support European companies entering more difficult contexts. This would protect companies against the risks arising from arbitrary actions by the host government, including expropriation, confiscation, and selective discrimination. Such risks are comparatively high in the mining sector. The European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are able to provide political risk insurance, as are several European development finance institutions. More extensive use of these facilities is needed, with the institutions providing these products scaling up resources dedicated to them. Third, measures to reduce Europe’s electricity costs will be vital to enable greater processing capacity to be developed in Europe. European electricity costs are currently two to three times higher than those in the US and China, which poses a significant barrier to expanding processing capabilities in Europe. Reducing electricity costs in Europe will take concerted efforts from a number of actors, including private sector investments in renewable energy supported by incentives from the EU and member state governments. Finally, the EU and member state institutions will need to develop better consultation platforms with the European private sector to understand their concerns about entering CRM supply chains in Africa, what they could be incentivised to do, and what support it would take. This understanding should inform the nature of the support extended to European companies active in CRM supply chains in Africa, thereby ensuring that de-risking initiatives are more effective. Geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions cannot wish away market dynamics and the need for the commercial viability of projects. However, well designed policies that target clear interventions can help overcome these factors. Turning the needle on CRM project viability in Africa is essential if European companies are to pursue these opportunities. This will come down to the nature and scale of support extended to European companies. It will undoubtedly be costly to develop incentives that can motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in Africa and deploy them at some degree of scale. But Europeans cannot afford not to act if they are to address this vital aspect of de-risking. Not only is their energy security at stake, but so is the EU’s future political, economic, and military strength.

US Drought Conditions Reduce Hydropower Generation, Particularly ...	In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we forecast that electricity generation from U.S. hydropower plants in 2024 will be 13% less than the 10-year average, the least amount of electricity generated from hydropower since 2001. Extreme and exceptional drought conditions have been affecting different parts of the United States, especially the Pacific Northwest, which is home to most U.S. hydropower capacity. As of the end of September, 72.6% of the continental United States was experiencing dryer-than-normal to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. By the end of October, this value increased to 87.2%. Multiple regions are affected by drought conditions, but the effects on hydropower generation are more obvious in the Pacific Northwest. For example, a recent study conducted by the University of Alabama found that hydropower generation in Washington state is one of the most susceptible to droughts in the country, ranking right below California based on data from 2003 to 2020. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook and Electric Power Annual; U.S. Drought Monitor Drought impacts this year The Pacific Northwest’s Columbia River is the fourth-largest river in the United States by volume. Its watershed, the Columbia River Basin, covers large parts of four states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The basin is home to some of the largest hydropower dams in the country, such as the Grand Coulee with a net summer capacity of 6.7 gigawatts (GW) and Chief Joseph with 2.4 GW of capacity. As early as April of this year, the Washington State Department of Ecology declared most counties in the state under drought. The department takes this step when water supply in the state is less than 75% of normal. In Oregon, two counties declared a drought emergency this summer, first in June in Jefferson County and then in September in Lake County. The Dalles Dam located between Oregon and Washington, with a total net summer capacity of 1.8 GW, is considered a good indicator of water supply conditions in the upper Columbia River. At the end of September, water supply at The Dalles Dam was at 74% of the 30-year normal for the summer months (April through September), according to the Northwestern River Forecast Center. Hydropower generation peaks in the summer months in response to seasonal peak demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Basin Outlook Reports, reservoir storage at the end of September was 48% of capacity in Oregon, 67% of capacity in Washington, 76% in Montana, and 60% in Idaho. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Electric Power Monthly On a monthly basis in 2023, across Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, hydropower generation has been close to or below the lower end of the 10-year range, except for a brief spike in May due to a heatwave. In Washington and Oregon, hydropower generation in 2024 was mostly higher than in 2023, especially during the summer months. In Idaho and Montana, hydropower generation in 2024 was below 2023 levels from April through August. Drought effects in the Northwest according to STEO In the STEO, we forecast electricity generation for electricity market regions instead of state geographical boundaries. We expect hydropower generation in the Northwest electricity region, which includes the Columbia River Basin and parts of other Rocky Mountain states, to total 101.8 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2024, a 23% decrease from the 10-year average of 132.8 billion kWh and a 1% decrease from 2023.

Who Was Joe Overton Of Overton Window Fame? – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed On October 28, 2024, on his social media platform 'X' (formerly Twitter), the well-known entrepreneur Elon Musk asked this question: 'Ever wondered about the Overton Window?' His query was accompanied by a 'retweet' of a post by Jash Dholani, who included a photo of Joe Overton and stated that the 'Window' concept that bears his name is 'the best mental model for understanding how political change ACTUALLY happens.' This was just the latest Overton Window reference. They surely number now in the tens of thousands, from all over the world. A few years ago, the concept required an explanation, but it is now so ubiquitous, so much a part of our political lexicon, that it’s routinely used as though everyone knows (or should know) what it’s about. It has its own Wikipedia page, as does Joe himself, and Joe’s Window was the focus of a New York Times article in 2019. Any search engine brings up countless citations of it. Simply put, the Overton Window posits that at any given moment, politicians can only operate and get re-elected when they take positions within a narrow framework shaped by prevailing public opinion. Shift the window by changing popular ideas, and you can thereby make what’s politically unpalatable today into a mainstream view tomorrow. If you are unfamiliar with it, or want some examples of it in action, click on these links and learn more from Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy, where Joe first formulated the idea: An Introduction to the Overton Window of Political Possibility ‘Now it’s simply referred to as the Overton Window, as if everyone knows what it is’ The Overton Window of Political Possibility Joe Overton was a humble man, but I assure you he would be both proud and amazed that his name, barely two decades after his untimely death in 2003 at the age of 43, is approaching the status of a household word. But how many people could tell you who Joe was? What was he like? The world should know more about the man whose name is invoked so often in political and social discussions these days, and I may well be the most qualified living individual to tell you about him. Why? Joe was my best friend, and both of us said so often while he was alive. I was Best Man at his wedding when he married Helen Rheem in March 2003, just three months before he was killed in an ultralight plane crash on June 30. He and I journeyed to 21 countries together, including China, Poland, and Singapore. We even undertook a dangerous, clandestine visit to Mozambique in 1991, where we lived for two weeks with anti-communist rebels during the country’s civil war. As president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, I hired Joe in March 1992 and soon thereafter promoted him to senior vice president. Along with my successor and Mackinac’s current president, Joe Lehman, and a superb staff, we built the operation into one of the most effective state policy-focused think tanks in the country. And in 28 'leadership conferences,' we trained more than 600 staff and executives from other 'free market' organizations from dozens of countries. So yes, I knew Joe very well, and I still think of him almost every day. Joe Overton Born on January 4, 1960, Joe was a native Michigander. From 1965 until his passing in 2003, he lived in the town of Midland. I moved there from my home state of Pennsylvania to teach at Northwood University in 1977, but it would be another decade before I met Joe. In September 1987, we were introduced not in Michigan but at a conference in Seattle, Washington. I told him that in December, I would be opening an office of a new think tank in our town of Midland because I had just accepted an offer to serve as its first president. He was an electrical engineer and project manager at the Dow Chemical Company, as well as a staunch libertarian. He immediately volunteered to help us at what would become the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. He knew engineering, but his passion was freedom and free markets. By 1992, our fifth year of operation, the Center was becoming influential in Michigan and even beyond. A new governor, John Engler, had put many of our policy recommendations into law. I asked Joe if he would relinquish his job at Dow, change his career completely, and come to work full-time at Mackinac. He said yes on the spot and never looked back. I remember telling Joe, 'Your first task is to put in place the nuts and bolts of sound management of our operation, freeing me up to pontificate and raise money.' His engineering and management background coupled with his love of liberty proved to be a potent combination. It helped attract top talent and ensured we got maximum bang for our donors’ bucks. We grew from four employees to more than 30 under Joe’s watch. I was on the road much of the time—at news conferences, speeches, and donor meetings—but I never worried for a moment about what was happening back at the office. In our tenth year, Joe even supervised a major construction project: the transformation of an old, abandoned Woolworth department store in downtown Midland into Mackinac’s new headquarters. It was just a block away from our original office, so it was easy for Joe to spend time every day on the new site. His motto during this time was, 'You expect what you inspect,' meaning he felt obligated to monitor every step of the construction process. He even contributed ideas that later won us some notable design awards. Oh, and by the way, he somehow found time during these busy years of the Mackinac Center’s growth to go to law school. He earned his J.D. degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, and passed the bar exam on his first attempt. Whether in organizational management, construction, or political philosophy, Joe was that rare kind of person who understood both the big picture and the intricate details that composed it. He was fond of telling a story of three workers laying bricks at the site of a new cathedral. A man walks by and asks one worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker answered, 'Laying bricks.' The man walks a little further and asks a second worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker responded, 'Building a wall.' When the man approached the third worker with the same question, the worker said, 'I’m constructing a cathedral.' All three bricklayers were doing precisely the same thing, but it was the third one who truly grasped the significance of the project, though the task of the moment could seem rather menial. Joe saw everything we did at the Mackinac Center—even taking out the garbage—as 'building a cathedral.' And largely because of his obvious competence and admirable persona, that’s the way we all thought of it. To Joe, the most important policy issue of our time was school choice. He saw it as a civil right, a righteous cause worth every effort we could muster. Children belong to parents, not to the State, he believed. Joe devoted much of his professional career and most of his personal time to advancing that cause. He even devised a 'Universal Tuition Tax Credit' that, by variations, is on the books now in multiple states. More than anything else, what I learned from Joe in our 16 years of friendship was the importance of personal character. He possessed it by the boatload. He was a Christian, above all else, and he lived his faith and its teachings as well as anyone I have ever known. In an essay for these pages a few months after he died, I wrote: Through his example, his mere presence in a room would raise everyone’s standards of speech and conduct. As a consummate administrator he taught us the importance of continuous organizational improvement through Total Quality Management. He was able to do that effectively not just because he knew the nuts and bolts of the subject, but because he practiced it in his personal life as well. I heard him say many times, 'You cannot impart what you don’t possess.' Joe Overton was the straightest straight shooter I’ve ever known. Not a speck of deception, guile, conceit, or hidden agenda in him. He said what he meant and meant what he said, always. You never, ever had to wonder if he was telling you the truth. He kept his word as if it was an indispensable and inseparable physical appendage like an arm or a leg. Like so many others, I came to place total, unqualified trust in him. So did others who came to know him. Never underestimate the importance of truth and trust to a free society; if we cannot deal with each other on those terms, we will resort to the ugliness of brute force and political power. …Over and over again, people were attracted to his work because of the sterling character of his persona. Friends marveled at his consistency and self-discipline. They were impressed that he not only preached the virtues of civil society; he practiced them in his own life through endless volunteer efforts, quiet philanthropy, and ceaseless counsel to those who needed good advice. One of Joe’s hobbies was flying. He owned two ultralight aircraft—one was a two-seater, the other built for one. On the afternoon of June 30, 2003, he asked me if I wanted to go up with him that evening in the two-seater. I declined because of a summer cold. So, he went up by himself in the other one. I was sound asleep when my phone rang later around midnight. It was Joe’s brother Scott (1965–2016). 'Larry,' he said in a voice choked with emotion, 'Joe was killed this evening when his plane suddenly lost altitude and fell to the ground.' I was more than a little stunned with disbelief. I was struck to the bone by the awful feeling that the world had lost an extraordinarily good man, that the liberty movement had lost a widely admired and irreplaceable leader, and that I had lost the best friend I ever had. To this day, I have never experienced personal trauma as deep as what I felt at Joe’s death. At the Mackinac Center in the weeks after the crash, we were deluged with unsolicited tributes to Joe. As well as I thought I knew him, there was so much more to the man than any of us knew. In keeping with the Christian calling, it turned out that Joe, in ways big and small but always quiet, was helping somebody all the time. The testimonies we published by the hundreds on the organization’s website were mind-blowing: 'He saved our marriage.' 'He gave me a check to get through a tough time.' 'He went out of his way to give me a hand.' The man I thought was outstanding in every way was more exceptional than I ever imagined. Twenty-one years since he died, I still shed tears when I pause to remember him. So the next time you hear of the 'Overton Window,' please understand that the concept itself is valuable and appealing, but the man behind it deserves to be remembered every bit as much.

National Elections Expose The Sham That Is Centralized ‘Democracy...	By Ryan McMaken The 2024 election is over, and in some states, big majorities voted for the winner Donald Trump. In Wyoming, Trump won 72 percent of the vote. In fact, more than 60 percent of the voting population went for Trump in 13 states. Fortunately for the majorities in those states, they’ll get the president they voted for. However, the outcome would have been different if fewer than a million people—in a nation of 330 million—had changed their votes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan. Then, Kamala Harris would now be the president-elect. She would have won even though the voters of more than a dozen states had lopsided majorities in favor of Trump. Moreover, Kamala could have won even though there was far less enthusiasm on her side. That is, only a single state, Massachusetts, had a voting majority of more than 60 percent for Kamala Harris. Even If You Win, You Lose We could come up with many similar examples in the past 24 years. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney won 60 percent or more of the vote in nine states. 72 percent of the voters went for Romney in Utah. But, in the end, those supermajorities meant nothing, and the people of Utah, Oklahoma, Alabama, and several others—who had voted nearly 2 to 1 for Romney—got Barack Obama as president. In 2020, by the way, more than 60 percent of the voters in ten states voted against Joe Biden. These facts should be remembered the next time that some pundit or politician tries to tell us that democracy is 'the voice of the people' or 'the will of the majority.' The question that has to be asked is 'which majority?' and 'which people?' Indeed, for the people of Utah in 2012 or Massachusetts in 2024, the president that rules over those states was chosen by people who don’t live in those states. Even if 100 percent of the voters in a state vote against a certain candidate, they could still end up with that candidate as president based on the votes of people living somewhere else. Moreover, given that many states don’t have voter ID, it stands to reason that even a large majority of your state votes for a certain candidate, foreign nationals in some other state may ultimately make the decision for you. It’s difficult to see how such a method expresses 'the will of the majority' when a tiny majority or plurality nationwide so often nullifies overwhelming majorities in a multitude of US states. On a legalistic level, of course, the courts tell us this is all how it is supposed to be. In presidential elections, it simply doesn’t matter what your local majority says. The only majority that matters is the national majority. This is true even if we take into account the electoral college, which is nothing more than a formula for weighting the national majority vote. It bears noticing, however, that these national majorities are often not even majorities. In 1992 and 1996, for example, Bill Clinton won the race with 43 percent and 49 percent, respectively. And, when a candidate does manage to win a majority, it is usually very slim. Not since 1988 has any presidential candidate managed to get even 53 percent of the popular vote. The closest anyone got was Obama in 2008. Most presidential races since 1948 have been decided by a majority of 51 percent or less. The Rules Are Broken in the Age of the Modern Unlimited Presidency In spite of all this, those who can’t think beyond the status quo—both leftists and conservatives—will simply say 'rules are rules.' They’ll go on to insist that we must blindly follow the rules no matter what. In truth, however, these 'rules' were not ratified by any living person, and they were created in an age when the US president exercised very few domestic powers. In the early nineteenth century, presidents could do virtually nothing domestically without Congressional approval, and even those powers were few. Nowadays, however, presidents exercise vast power within the borders of every single US state. Yet, the current system is based on the idea that even if whole regions of the country vote overwhelmingly against a president, they are still forced to submit to four years of that president’s rule-by-decree, which is what every presidency now is in our post-legislative age of Rule by Executive Order. Yes, this system is based on 'the rules,' but in the world of politics, rules only work until they don’t. Ask the British in 1776 or the Soviets in 1989. You’re Never Allowed to Leave The absurdity and injustice of this system is further illustrated by the fact that no matter how much your state’s majority might object to the federal president or his policies, no state or part of a state is allowed to exit the system. Ever. If a two-thirds majority in your state votes against the federal administration again and again, well, that’s too bad, you’re never allowed to leave. You’ll just have to sit back and take whatever the executive branch decides to dish out. But, hey, you always have your small handful of members of Congress to make little speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. None of this will ever do anything to protect your state’s population from federal policies—no matter how contrary these might be to your local economic interests and institutions. But, 'rules are rules.' No private, non-state organization would ever function in such a fashion. Imagine telling the owners of a public company that no matter how much the management behaves contrary to various investors’ wishes, those investors are never allowed to sell their shares and leave the organization. Imagine telling members of any dues-paying organization that no matter how much the leaders screw over the members, they are never allowed to stop paying dues. Yet, this is how the 'rules' work in America. No matter how much the central government might ignore, abuse, and generally govern against the majority of the voters in your state, you are never allowed to leave. You are never allowed to stop paying taxes to support the very people who couldn’t care less what you think. The only way out requires that we stop caring what the rules say. The answer lies in decentralization, secession, and the dismantling of the political system that allowed Obama and Joe Biden to shove their policies down the throats of supermajorities that voted against these presidents again and again. The re-election of Donald Trump does not fundamentally change any of this. Even if Trump were to turn out to be some kind of anti-establishment dream candidate in his second term, the 2028 election is just a few years away. On the other hand, to accept the status quo is to continue allowing federal technocrats a thousand miles away to literally dictate federal policies to your community. Unfortunately, like prisoners suffering from Stockholm syndrome, many will elect to continue supporting the central regime because the 'rules-are-rules' propaganda has worked very well.

Why Trump Routed The D.C. Establishment, Again – OpEd	After the media complained nonstop for months about Donald Trump offering a dark message on the presidential campaign trail, a New York Times headline bewailed his election victory on Wednesday morning: 'America Hires a Strongman.' So anyone who cast a ballot became the moral equivalent of a mafia don hiring a hitman? The Times news analysis lamented, 'This was a conquering of the nation not by force but with a permission slip. Now, America stands on the precipice of an authoritarian style of governance never before seen in its 248-year history.' Well, at least never-before-seen by journalists whose knowledge of history does not extend back beyond Taylor Swift’s first best-selling album. The notion that Trump was a unique threat in American history entitled the media to ignore all the civil liberties abuses of the Biden-Harris administration. Coincidentally, that spared many reporters and editorial writers the difficulty of comprehending the policies which they tacitly endorsed. The media betrayed freedom of speech—at least for Americans who do not have a journalism degree. Biden administration officials conducted potentially 'the most massive attack against free speech in United States history,' a federal judge concluded, and a federal appeals court condemned Team Biden for 'suppressing millions of protected free-speech postings by American citizens'—mostly by conservatives and Republicans. But most of the media was the Sherlock Holmes’ 'dog that didn’t bark' when federal agencies browbeat social media companies with endless demands to muzzle and blindfold average Americans. Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance raised the censorship issue during his debate with Gov. Tim Walz, but it got little or no traction beyond his spiels. Instead, censorship was championed by the media in recent years as part of a holy crusade against 'misinformation' (i.e., facts that are damned inconvenient for the ruling class). Did progressives discover a hidden asterisk to the First Amendment that nullifies constitutional rights for anyone who jokes about covid vaccine mandates? Because it was a self-evident truth that 'Orange Man Bad,' most reporters and pundits exerted little or no effort to comprehend or expose Biden administration follies and frauds. Almost all the media campaign coverage ignored the risk of World War III thanks to the Biden-Harris escalation of the Ukraine-Russia war. Why was there no controversy about Biden providing F-16 jets to Ukraine—potentially enabling Ukraine to attack practically anywhere in Russia with US bombs? Or did the media believe they had a moral duty to blindly support Ukraine because its president—unlike Putin—supports transgender rights? Journalists who retained jobs at top papers continue to be paid very well. On the Friday before the election, the feds released the worst jobs report since the covid lockdowns, confirming a net loss of private jobs. A few hours after that report hit the wires, a Washington Post headline chirped: 'The economy is strong heading into Election Day. Will it matter?' The article’s subhead assured readers: 'The last batch of economic numbers before the election are in, and they’re looking pretty good. So why aren’t voters feeling them?' Presumably because voters were fools or liars and refused to admit how Washington is making their lives wonderful. Most pundits dismissed or disdained people who complained about how the 20+ percent inflation of the Biden era harmed their families. The average mortgage payment has almost doubled since Biden took office—pricing millions of Americans out of their first home—but that was apparently an illegitimate consideration on Election Day. As Mises Institute fellow Tom Woods noted, leftists 'are now mocking people who are concerned about price inflation by using the expression ‘burger too expensive.’' I predicted in the New York Post in early 2022 that inflation would politically bankrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats and plenty of voters agreed on Tuesday. The Harris campaign believed that perpetually championing the right to abortion would guarantee them more than enough votes from women. But it turned out that 'women buy milk and eggs more often than they get abortions.' That fact of life enraged many media commentators. As a female panelist on ABC’s The View asked other panelists on Wednesday morning: 'Why do you think that uneducated white women voted against their reproductive health freedoms, and why do you think Latino men voted in favor of someone who says he will deport a majority of his community?' Perhaps that panelist wasn’t aware that most Latino men in this nation are American citizens. Democratic Party poohbahs and their media allies could not have shown more contempt for the American people. Until his disastrous debate with Donald Trump in June, doddering President Biden was perennially defended as fit for another four years of ruling America. After Democratic Party bosses pushed Biden out the window, they pretended Vice President Harris was entitled to be the candidate even though she got zero votes in the primaries. Party bosses presumed that her candidacy’s 'coronation-by-Establishment' would assure victory thanks to Harris’s gender and race. And anyone who failed to fall in line could be denounced as sexist or racist. That explains why a senior Harris campaign official told MSNBC early on Election Day that 'we are optimistic that we are literally about to turn the page… and install Vice President Harris as the next President of the United States.' That 'identity push button' failed thanks to Harris’s astounding incompetence in interviews. As a journalist, I have interviewed many government officials and politicians over the years and learned to watch for tell-tale signs. From her first media interviews after her designation as presidential candidate, Harris radiated fear except when she was exuding dread. She turned down a chance to be interviewed by Joe Rogan, whose exchange with Trump garnered more than 37 million views. Instead, she went on a vapid 'Call Me Daddy' podcast run by a woman who usually talked about topics such as sex toys. A Slate columnist notedthat she was 'afraid that the host was going to ask Harris her favorite sex position.' Harris turned down the chance to meet with Time Magazine reporters and editors to discuss her views on policy. She never held a press conference. She felt no obligation to explain why she reversed her positions on fracking and other issues. Instead, she acted entitled to the presidency simply because of who she was—or perhaps because of her resume. She offered voters the strangest policy trifecta in presidential campaign history: 'joy,' 'positive vibes,' and 'Trump is Hitler.' The 2024 election was a defeat for Kamala Harris and progressive authoritarianism. But it would be naïve to equate Trump’s victory with the triumph of liberty. Trump’s bizarre view of tariffs as an economic magic wand could be disastrous for America and the world. Trump does not appear to recognize that the soaring national debt is a ticking time bomb that could detonate beneath the economy. There is a broad strand of Washington conservatives who are championing paternalist economic interventions, making the Republican Party look like it is morphing into the old-time Tory Party of England. But, unlike the downtrodden commoners of nineteenth century England, average Americans have not been taught to stay in their place—which helps explain why Trump defeated Harris. And that is the ultimate problem for zealots who believe lofty SAT scores give the Washington elite a divine right to run everyone else’s lives. PBS pundit Jonathan Capehart whined after midnight on election night that, because of Trump’s victory, 'I can’t help but wonder if the American people have given up on democracy.' A better synopsis of Tuesday’s results came from columnist Bridget Phetasy: 'I can sum it up. He’s not Hitler. I’m not racist. F**k you.'

India Charts Its IMEC Path To Global Trade Influence – Analysis	By Soumya Bhowmick During the G20 Summit in late 2023, an agreement was signed between India, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union to establish the India–Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC). This initiative is a strategic response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aims to position India as a pivotal player in global trade. The IMEC seeks to create a comprehensive infrastructure network connecting countries with a combined GDP of US$47 trillion, encompassing shipping lanes, railways, undersea cables and solar grids. This initiative holds great potential to bolster global trade efficiency and ensure energy security. But the IMEC faces several geopolitical, infrastructural and environmental challenges that must be addressed to ensure its success. While the IMEC holds great promise, its implementation is not guaranteed. The corridor is expected to run through geopolitically sensitive areas such as the Middle East, where conflicts, political instability and regional rivalries could pose significant risks. For instance, the war in Gaza has delayed the project’s progress. Infrastructure bottlenecks, such as the need for substantial upgrades to rail and port facilities in some participating countries, may also delay the expected efficiency gains. The reliance on intermodal transportation — combining rail, sea and road transport — could also create logistical complexities. While the IMEC aims to reduce shipping times by up to 40 per cent, the 30 per cent cost reduction claim remains debatable, since the intermodality involved in the IMEC could increase costs due to additional handling, transhipment and coordination requirements. The project’s success will depend on whether the corridor can maintain its promised efficiency despite these hurdles. The IMEC is not a direct alternative to China’s BRI, but it is part of the global response to counter China’s growing economic influence. Unlike the BRI, which has focused extensively on infrastructure financing in developing countries, the IMEC seeks to establish a network of high-efficiency trade routes by prioritising cutting-edge technology, green energy solutions and digital infrastructure. Crucially, BRI investments also have varied trajectories. While the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in Chinese investment in BRI projects in 2020, data from 2023 suggests a rebound in sectors such as green energy and technology. But IMEC’s focus on sustainable energy solutions and connectivity could make it an appealing alternative for countries looking to avoid the debt traps associated with BRI projects. The IMEC project has attracted attention for its ambitious green energy and infrastructure plans, but it must also deal with environmental and socio-political risks. Developing solar grids and hydrogen corridors is a significant step toward renewable energy, but the environmental footprint of constructing this massive infrastructure is a concern. While the corridor aims to promote clean hydrogen trade, questions also remain about the feasibility of large-scale green hydrogen production and transportation across long distances. Ensuring this energy source is produced using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels will require continuous technological advancements and investments. One of the IMEC’s significant contributions could be reducing the global economy’s reliance on critical maritime chokepoints like the Suez Canal. The corridor proposes an alternative route that could reduce congestion and improve trade resilience for India and its partners. But while the IMEC may offer an alternative route, it is unlikely to replace the Suez Canal entirely, given the volume of global trade passing through the latter. The IMEC may provide some relief, but the Suez Canal will remain vital in international trade due to its centrality and established infrastructure. The IMEC also plans to establish a 20,000 kilometre cable system — the Trans Europe Asia System — to bolster global communication networks. Given that 95 per cent of the world’s communication flows through undersea cables, this project is vital for improving the security of international data transmission. India’s involvement in the IMEC reflects its growing diplomatic prowess. The corridor offers India the opportunity to strengthen its geopolitical alliances with key countries in the Middle East, Europe and North America while simultaneously countering China’s influence in global trade. Similarly, by focusing on the IMEC’s economic and strategic benefits, India can consolidate its role as a significant player in global trade networks. The corridor will also serve to promote India’s Digital Public Infrastructure, a framework designed to enhance financial inclusion and streamline digital transactions. By integrating Digital Public Infrastructure into the IMEC, India could set new standards in cross-border digital trade and communication. The IMEC represents a significant opportunity for India to strengthen its position in global trade networks. It offers a comprehensive strategy to enhance regional cooperation and economic resilience by focusing on trade efficiency, renewable energy and digital connectivity. For the IMEC to succeed, participating countries must align on an actionable implementation plan that addresses these challenges head-on. Only by doing so can the IMEC realise its potential to drive global trade, secure energy transitions and offer a robust alternative to existing trade routes.

The CDC Planned Quarantine Camps Nationwide – OpEd	No matter how bad you think Covid policies were, they were intended to be worse. Consider the vaccine passports alone. Six cities were locked down to include only the vaccinated in public indoor places. They were New York City, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. The plan was to enforce this with a vaccine passport. It broke. Once the news leaked that the shot didn’t stop infection or transmission, the planners lost public support and the scheme collapsed. It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide if not worldwide. Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back. Features of the CDC’s edicts did incredible damage. It imposed the rent moratorium. It decreed the ridiculous 'six feet of distance' and mask mandates. It forced Plexiglas as the interface for commercial transactions. It implied that mail-in balloting must be the norm, which probably flipped the election. It delayed the reopening as long as possible. It was sadistic. Even with all that, worse was planned. On July 26, 2020, with the George Floyd riots having finally settled down, the CDC issued a plan for establishing nationwide quarantine camps. People were to be isolated, given only food and some cleaning supplies. They would be banned from participating in any religious services. The plan included contingencies for preventing suicide. There were no provisions made for any legal appeals or even the right to legal counsel. The plan’s authors were unnamed but included 26 footnotes. It was completely official. The document was only removed on about March 26, 2023. During the entire intervening time, the plan survived on the CDC’s public site with little to no public notice or controversy. It was called 'Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.' 'This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings. This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available.' By absence of empirical data, the meaning is: nothing like this has ever been tried. The point of the document was to map out how it could be possible and alert authorities to possible pitfalls to be avoided. The meaning of 'shielding' is 'to reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (‘high-risk’) and the general population (‘low-risk’). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or ‘green zones’ established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector, or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.' In other words, this is what used to be concentration camps. Who are these people who would be rounded up? They are 'older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.' Who determines this? Public health authorities. The purpose? The CDC explains: 'physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population' allows authorities 'to prioritize the use of the limited available resources.' This sounds a lot like condemning people to death in the name of protecting them. The model establishes three levels. First is the household level. Here high-risk people are'physically isolated from other household members.' That alone is objectionable. Elders need people to take care of them. They need love and to be surrounded by family. The CDC should never imagine that it would intervene in households to force old people into separate places. The model jumps from households to the 'neighborhood level.' Here we have the same approach: forced separation of those deemed vulnerable. From there, the model jumps again to the 'camp/sector level.' Here it is different. 'A group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together. One entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters). No movement into or outside the green zone.' Yes, you read that correctly. The CDC is here proposing concentration camps for the sick or anyone they deem to be in danger of medically significant consequences of infection. Further: 'to minimize external contact, each green zone should include able-bodied high-risk individuals capable of caring for residents who have disabilities or are less mobile. Otherwise, designate low-risk individuals for these tasks, preferably who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 and are assumed to be immune.' The plan says in passing, contradicting thousands of years of experience, 'Currently, we do not know if prior infection confers immunity.' Therefore the only solution is to minimize all exposure throughout the whole population. Getting sick is criminalized. These camps require a 'dedicated staff' to 'monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma. It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.' The people housed in these camps need to have good explanations of why they are denied even basic religious freedom. The report explains: 'Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.' Further, there must be some mechanisms to prohibit suicide: Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse. The biggest risk, the document explains, is as follows: 'While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.' (It should go without saying but this 'shielding' approach suggested here has nothing to do with focused protection of the Great Barrington Declaration. Focused protection specifically says: 'schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.') In four years of research, and encountering truly shocking documents and evidence of what happened in the Covid years, this one certainly ranks up at the top of the list of totalitarian schemes for pathogenic control prior to vaccination. It is quite simply mind-blowing that such a scheme could ever be contemplated. Who wrote it? What kind of deep institutional pathology exists that enabled this to be contemplated? The CDC has 10,600 full-time employees and contractors and a budget of $11.5 billion. In light of this report, and everything else that has gone on there for four years, both numbers should be zero.

The Plot Against Democracy – OpEd	In Philadelphia this past weekend, I met a number of people who’d given up on democracy. They railed about politicians who make promises they don’t keep. They spun conspiracy theories about the government. A number of those who answered the door told me that they weren’t going to vote. Then there were the grim young men who said, hell yeah, they were going to vote for Trump. They spoke of the Republican presidential candidate as if he were Tony Montana, the gangster played by Al Pacino in the film Scarface: violent, lawless, and powerful. Trump elicited respect laced with fear. According to his supporters, he’d stand up to America’s enemies abroad and be tough on crime domestically. Several said to me—with the usual preface of 'don’t get me wrong but…'—that a woman president would be too weak or 'mixed up by hormones' to do those necessary things. If you cross celebrity culture with gun culture and add a few dollops of testosterone, you get Donald Trump. Much has been written about the rise of the global far right (including by me). It’s important to understand that this global trend is not a type of politics. It is an anti-politics. The far right embodied by Vladimir Putin in Russia, Victor Orban in Hungary, Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, and others is determined to unravel democracy. They have contempt for elections. They revise, bend, or undermine the constitutional order. And they despise the civic engagement at the heart of thriving democracies. They crack down on dissent. They target protesters. They ruthlessly purge the 'enemy within.' This is what Donald Trump has promised to do this time around. The Republican campaign in 2024 relied on anti-government rhetoric, conspiracy theories, and violent innuendo (against FEMA, against the border patrol, against Republican politicians that didn’t toe the MAGA line) in order to do two things. These strategies drew the disaffected to the polls. And they pushed others not to vote: to give up on politics altogether. Rage and apathy are the two modes of right-wing politicking. This is a variation on Albert Hirschman’s famous 'exit, voice, and loyalty' distinction. The loyalists are voicing their anger, the apathetic are exiting, and the dissidents continue to organize in the hopes of avoiding the Russian scenario: an entire opposition in exile or jail. Other countries have managed to buck the trend. Even little Moldova was able to successfully beat back the anti-democratic, pro-Russian, billionaire-supported candidate in its presidential election last weekend. Brazil got rid of Bolsonaro. The French teamed up to stop Marine Le Pen at the polls. It can be done. Rich, prosperous, arrogant America failed to do so. Let’s face it: American politics, as we know it, is over. To be sure, it was always possible for American politicians to win with dirty tricks. But then there’d be a course correction of sorts: Nixon followed by Watergate, Trump 2016 followed by impeachment and electoral loss. That loss in 2020 should have been an inoculation against outlandish lies, threats, and manipulations. Instead, the Republican Party doubled down. It abandoned the few remaining guardrails governing the conduct of a campaign, which is a preview of how the next administration will skirt the few remaining guardrails it reluctantly observed in the waning days of its previous term in office. The political game is now fundamentally different. Forget 'ground game.' Forget strategic messaging. Forget polling. In other words, forget about those traditional methods of mobilizing political sentiment in a democracy. Never bring a knife to a gunfight, the pundits warn. The Democrats brought a computer to a gunfight. Those computer models of how to win an election now lie in ruins. A funereal pall has descended over half of America, and naturally there is a lot of finger-pointing in the wake of the Democratic Party’s loss of the presidency and the Senate. It was misogyny. It was Black men abandoning the Democratic Party. It was poor whites voting against their economic self-interest. It was the Electoral College, Elon Musk’s money, and Russian disinformation. It was Joe Biden’s decision to run again, and Kamala Harris’s failure to explain her positions clearly. It was all of that, of course. But it was also the failure of the Democratic Party to understand the rage coursing through the body politic. The Democrats failed to translate the economic gains of the last four years—the infrastructure bill, the watered-down version of the Green New Deal, the CHIPS Act—into populist language. Put another way, the ordinary gains of an ordinary political process did not prove inspiring because this is a post-political moment. And the Democrats were playing by the rules of the old era. Here’s an instructive story. A friend confessed to me before the election that he didn’t pay attention to politics. 'They’re both bad,' he said 'One’s a fascist, the other’s a communist.' 'Harris is a communist?' I said, surprised. 'That’s ridiculous. She’s just a run-of-the-mill politician, straddling the center. I could understand if you were criticizing Bernie Sanders as a communist. He, at least, is a self-professed socialist. He’s not a communist, of course, but at least he’s – .' 'Oh, Bernie?' my friend interrupted me. 'Oh yeah, I really like Bernie!' There are several lessons here. Even for the apolitical, the lies of Trump ('she’s a Marxist!') penetrated the population with the brutal repetitiveness of state propaganda. The level of political understanding in the populace is shockingly low (a fifth grader should be able to put Trump, Harris, and Sanders on a political spectrum). And Bernie’s populism transcends ideology. Like the Vermont senator, a successful political party must be able to channel anger as well as aspiration. As the opposition regroups, it’s useful to repeat some truisms. Character is forged in adversity. Previous generations have successfully fought fascism to rescue democracy. And democracy is all about learning lessons and moving forward (especially after slipping backward). It’s long been clear that this country needs a new politics. To use a shopworn phrase, let’s build back better—after this third and most devastating hurricane of the season. In his 2004 novel, The Plot Against America, Philip Roth imagined the alternative past of a fascist takeover of the United States. Charles Lindbergh, a pro-Hitler isolationist, wins the 1940 election with his slogan 'Vote for Lindbergh, or vote for war.' In office, he fulfills his promise by keeping the United States out of World War II. But when Lindbergh’s plane mysteriously goes missing, Roosevelt gets reelected to the presidency in 1942. The Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, and history resumes its well-known course. It’s a chilling book that resonates with today’s headlines. It was a reminder, well before the political rise of Trump, that it can happen here. But the current situation is different. This is not just a battle over the soul of America. This is a much larger confrontation. This conflict is being waged against Russia in Ukraine and against Israel in Gaza. It is being fought in polling places in democratic nations around the world. And it is being sustained by anti-authoritarian dissidents in streets, jails, and exile communities. Even as they wrap themselves in the American flag and the U.S. constitution, the American far right and its enablers are plotting against democracy itself. It didn’t look promising in 1940 either, in Roth’s alternative reality or in the actual history. So, let the finger-pointing end and a new era of creative and savvy political organizing begin.

The Sustainability Scam: How Self-Interest Ruins Good Ideas – Ana...	We must ensure ecocentric standards to reverse environmental and social injustices. We have laws to ensure children are born into a safe, sustainable, and unpolluted environment. These laws are also meant to empower future generations and guarantee birth equity. But far from ensuring that these rights are upheld, we disfranchise children at birth because they do not have a legal say in the actions of adults that impact their future. Our ill-advised desire to prioritize economic growth over children's futures has led to the climate crisis. It has also led to children being born into unequal conditions where they do not have equal access to welfare resources. This has resulted in the impacts of environmental degradation being felt unequally among different socioeconomic groups. Poor people, Indigenous groups, and people of color are, by and large, impacted more by the degraded environment than the wealthy and white segment of the population. This is the tragic legacy of environmental racism, which has been referred to as 'the new Jim Crow.' Those most affected by these injustices often have little or no say in shaping policies and laws, and their children eventually inherit this unequal system. In a capitalist, profit-driven economy, it is unsurprising that the corporate sector, driven by financial concerns above all else, is the biggest culprit in perpetuating these wrongs—particularly the extractive industries and industrial agriculture. The Misinformed Power Grab Most leaders—and the biggest beneficiaries of an unequal society—never came close to protecting children from the harm caused by the development model favored by the rich world. Instead, poor children grow up in a world to face the repercussions of a power grab by wealthy, primarily white, families. The first misstep of dissociating the connection between human rights and environmental sustainability was taken in 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was signed, establishing fundamental rights for all people. Twenty years later, in 1968, the United Nations held a conference in Tehran where some groups raised concerns about the impact of population growth (and, by extension, economic growth) on human rights. Despite these efforts, the concerns were never resolved, and the relevant changes were never incorporated into the UDHR. Fixing the Problem: Laws, Norms, and Reparations The UN's ill-informed, misguided policy decision has led to a socioeconomic system built on the disenfranchisement of children at the time of their birth. There is an urgent requirement to rectify this situation and secure their welfare. Firstly, reparations are needed. The wealth made through this process of disenfranchisement must be used to secure the future of newborn children who are entering the world. Those wealthy individuals and corporations that have benefited most from this disenfranchisement (and may have promoted ignorance by glossing over the actual impacts of economic growth) should be held especially responsible. Secondly, we must establish laws and norms that ensure that the rights and welfare of unborn children are accounted for in the democratic process and that human beings are not merely seen as a means to sustain and grow economies. We must shape a future where children are not born simply to become consumers or workers but as fully participatory citizens with agency over their lives, with the ability to choose and thrive instead of merely surviving. While Effective Altruism and other movements based on financial investments are often viewed by many nonprofits as effective ways to resolve these issues, reparations are the most effective and immediate way to fix problems facing us today if we want to restore the natural balance. If we skip this crucial step, it would be the equivalent of building a house with no foundation. The Sustainability Scam Sustainability has become a buzzword among environmentalists, CEOs, and politicians. Leaders often present themselves as guardians of a better future, bragging about eco-friendly projects and sustainable methods. However, a closer look exposes a darker aspect to these assertions. The rhetoric and reality frequently diverge significantly, with racial disparities, self-interest, and uneven growth undermining various projects' ostensible benefits. Nonprofits working toward social, economic, and environmental changes must also include family planning in their goals. They must first help ensure the shared, inclusive equity of children born into the world. That means giving all newly born human beings an equal capacity to self-determine the social and ecological influences that others have over them. In his 2018 book Winners Take All, The Elite Charade of Changing the World, Anand Giridharadas examines how the global elite's efforts to 'change the world' are only an attempt to retain the status quo. He argues that their actions to try and resolve problems are a bid to hide their role in creating the problems in the first place. Publishers Weekly called the book a 'damning portrait of contemporary American philanthropy.' But Giridharadas—and publications like the New York Times—have missed the biggest charade—the one mainly driving the suffering and death unfolding as temperatures increase. This 'sustainability scam' has at least two standards for activist campaigns that claim to be sustainable, green, humane, democratic, eco-friendly, etc. There is one standard for wealthy investors (and their children), who often fund organizations that promote these terms, hoping that their work might have an impact in furthering them, and a different standard based on birth equity. These standards are artificial, arbitrary, and designed to allow a particular form of economic growth that benefits some—mainly the white population—at a deadly cost to others. This first standard—anthropocentric and adopted in 1968 by the UN agencies bowing to wealthy families—does not require birth equity. It functions on unsustainable welfare as the primary currency or value. This first standard allows significant deviation from the ecosocial baselines and ecocentric standards that would have prevented the climate crisis. These real standards can be measured along at least eight metrics like restorative levels of greenhouse gas emissions and inclusive representative ratios that ensure a healthy, functional democracy. Deviation from these standards—based on self-determination or freedom and equitable share in democracy—has led to the climate crisis that is killing millions. Funders in the polluter nations facing significant climate liability fund various institutions—media, nonprofits, universities, agencies, think tanks, and celebrities—to spread disinformation to support the first standard. This allows wealthy families to treat inherited wealth and other privileges as something outside the realm of the democratic process, which they use to strengthen their positionality and growth to systematically disenfranchise the average voter. We are now at a place where they can use the wealth they made through the scam to attack the democratic process and try to step outside of it. An effort is underway at the United Nations that requires assessments of climate damages. This includes the need to 1) ensure that ecocentric standards are adopted to account for the actual harm being done by the crisis and 2) to treat these standards and the recovery of climate reparations as the first and overriding human rights, a right that preempts the government's authority to assign wealth contrary to it, and allows citizens to engage in preemptive acts of self-defense to protect themselves and their children. Inequitable Growth Policies As a fundamental right, people who are made vulnerable by the actions of others—like fenceline communities put in harm's way by petrochemical plants being built in their backyards—are owed compensation. As millions die in a climate crisis resulting from inequitable growth policies undoing most mitigation efforts, questions arise about how that happened and who should be held accountable. We can see the imbalance in how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts those who are least responsible for causing it. In 2022, Seth Borenstein and Drew Costley of the Associated Press reported that 'the data shows that the top carbon emitter over time, the United States, has caused more than $1.9 trillion in climate damage to other countries from 1990 to 2014, including $310 billion in damage to Brazil, $257 billion in damage to India, $124 billion to Indonesia, $104 billion to Venezuela and $74 billion to Nigeria. But at the same time, the United States' carbon pollution has benefited the U.S. by more than $183 billion, while Canada, Germany, and Russia have profited even more from American emissions.' This problem can no longer be ignored if we want to secure our children's future. We must work toward resolving the social and economic disparities, increasing access to welfare measures, and ensuring better resources for pregnant women and families. Ensuring Child Rights There is a minimum threshold of well-being for birthing a child, which is necessary for self-determination. We must take drastic measures to ensure all children have the resources to become self-determining individuals. This could involve seizing resources from well-defended enclaves of wealth. By doing so, potential mothers might be incentivized to plan for their children's future, knowing these resources would be available. Some will argue that reduced economic growth, for example, is too high a cost to pay for ensuring birth equity and access to the same welfare opportunities for all children, especially those from BIPOC communities. However, these minimum thresholds are essential in forming a just and equitable society. People who argue against these basic standards threaten who we aspire to be as a society. They are more interested in exploiting humans and the environment for their gains, rather than investing in a better future. They threaten our freedom. It's physically impossible to have a legally obligating 'we' that precedes all legitimate national constitutions without measurable birth equity. As the work done by the United Nations shows, no one gets to use authority and state violence to benefit at a cost to others without incurring significant risk. It is important to see beyond the lies perpetuated between 1948 and 1968 to make us think that national sovereignty is magically inherent. It has to be derived from the measurable sovereignty or self-determination of its subjects. The only way to ensure share equity is to entitle would-be parents to bring children into the world only after a certain threshold of planned conditions, measurable on the eight metrics, have been achieved. The wealth accumulated by exploiting nature, which led to the climate crisis, must be used to ensure these conditions. The United States prides itself on being a free nation but uses the concept of freedom that starts by exploiting the most vulnerable. There is no minimum threshold of well-being for future children and animals, as they are seen as a means to growing economies rather than individuals with rights who form integral parts of society. Converting democracies into unsustainable growth economies that enrich a few by diluting everyone else's equal and influential equity shares in our political system is a subtle form of oppression. It leads to millions dying as the growth triggers catastrophic heat waves. This eventually results in justified resistance movements to protest against the scam, where those at the top of the economic pyramid benefitted from a society that promised an inclusive democracy, which is instead based on shared inequity. 'While there is no 'optimal' human population, the evidence suggests that a sustainable global population of 3 billion is an optimistic number given that we long ago entered a continuously intensifying state of ecological overshoot, accumulating ever more massive amounts of ecological debt that must be paid down if we are to avoid the ongoing (and ever-worsening) climate catastrophe, ecological destruction, and the resulting human misery,' Dr. Christopher K. Tucker, chairman of the American Geographical Society, said in an October 2024 email. 'Adding 80 million additional people to the planet each year—the equivalent of 10 New York Cities or an additional Germany each year—is not a recipe for addressing this polycrisis,' he said. 'Fortunately, simply investing (heavily) in empowering strategies focused on women and girls worldwide can hasten the already inevitable demographic transition that would relieve the unrelenting pressure we have foisted on our planet—and help us meet our commitments to the next generation under the UN's 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child.' The wealthy need to pay the cost of creating an unequal system that benefits them instead of ensuring equal and inclusive participation by all citizens in that system. They profit from treating children as part of a labor force to build and grow economies, instead of securing their rights as part of human rights and the democratic process. Many involved in prioritizing birth equity have seen a pattern in how they react to it: they do not offer counterarguments to the idea that restoring nature through ecosocial birth equity must be the first and overriding human right but resort to tactics to evade the issue. These people share a common trait: They attempt to evade being held responsible for the deadly costs and lush benefits of their birth, developmental, and emancipatory positionality. Their phrasing varies from 'I'm just trying to save these specific animals' to 'I'm just trying to focus on this specific area of research.' That kind of siloed myopia ultimately destroysbiodiversity and causes irreversible environmental damage. True Sustainability Means Having Children in a Very Different Way These deceptive tactics undermine the promise of sustainability, allowing leaders to project a false image of environmental stewardship while continuing harmful practices. To achieve genuine sustainability, we must demand transparency, hold organizations accountable, and ensure that the benefits of sustainable development are distributed equitably. Addressing these systemic issues is the only way toward a sustainable and just future. Many willing to benefit at a deadly cost to others want to treat the birth of children as unrelated to their lives. It is not. It is the basis of all things: a commitment to our most fundamental aspirations. Do we care about each other or exploit each other? While economics has dominated the social sciences because humans predictably try to maximize their welfare, it is also clear that many people choose criteria for truth and value that reaffirm their birth and developmental positionality. That's a dangerous form of self-deception, but understanding its existence allows us to move beyond economics, beyond capitalism versus socialism, and toward unifying constitutionality. We can't change lives for the better if disproportionately influential people have the power to define what good is. Recognizing this fact is essential to hold those who evade our obligations to birth equity accountable—so that we all can work together to know what's right and work toward taking remedial steps to prevent further environmental damage. How could you know how much welfare you deserve if you are not involved in making the rules determining welfare? We can't create economic demand by violating neonatal rights. We can't ensure economic growth by preventing all citizens from being born and raised in town halls and participating in the democratic process. Using specific ecosocial thresholds to reform birth and development rights ensures an equal and influential role in rulemaking, thus limiting the influence others have over you to live in relative self-determination. Given the exponential difference between the wealth of Black and white children, massive reforms are necessary to achieve equity. Countries cannot legitimately undercut the sovereignty of their subjects by ignoring children's birth and development entitlements, using those children instead as economic inputs to create ecologically deadly growth. Nations and many powerful interests within them have, while responding to the 'baby bust' of falling fertility rates, openly admitted to doing this. Part of creating deadly growth is to offer tax cuts to women for having children. In the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, we learn that a basket weaver could not expect to succeed in the 'free' markets created by those colonizing his lands. But even Thoreau missed the fundamental value of nature in constituting the creation of power relations toward equity and freedom. Laws that protect the beneficiaries of any political system only derive their legitimacy by including and empowering future generations—in a measurable way—rather than exploiting them.

Moscow Opens Pandora’s Box With New Talk About Changing Ukraine’s...	On November 4, the post-Soviet Russia’s Day of National Accord, Yevgeny Pozdnyakov, a pro-Kremlin commentator for Vzglyad, published a commentary entitled 'Russia Will Have to Redraw the Borders of Ukraine' (Vzglyad, November 4). Pozdnyakov dismisses the idea that Ukraine should be allowed to exist in its borders established in 1991 because almost all neighboring countries claimed or even controlled part of its territory at one time or another and to this day do not respect those borders. To support this argument, he uses a tactic much favored by Russian commentators, citing Ukrainian authors rather than Russian ones to make his point that Ukraine’s current borders are meaningless. Pozdnyakov then suggests that in the future, Russia should work with other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, to change the borders. That would reduce a future Ukrainian state to a small landlocked country incapable of defending itself or being defended by others against Russian demands. This logic is likely being shared by some Kremlin officials, meaning that any 'land for peace' deal between Kyiv and Moscow will not end the conflict. Instead, after perhaps a brief breathing space, the Putin regime will continue its aggression against Ukraine with the aid of allies. With those successes in hand, Russia could then launch attacks on other neighbors such as the Baltic countries and Kazakhstan. In short, what may appear to some as a peace deal could trigger a broader war rather than prevent one. Pozdnyakov’s argument builds upon and modifies Moscow’s commentaries on border changes that were especially frequent at the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine in February 2022 (see EDM, March 29, 2022). At that time, Vladimir Vinokurov, a professor at the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Diplomatic Academy, took a very different view about border changes in Ukraine. Vinokurov suggested that Russia should oppose any changes in Ukraine’s Western borders because those could limit Russia’s freedom of action. Although, he conceded, if Kyiv made territorial concessions to Moscow, Hungary and Poland would likely make analogous demands for concessions themselves (NVO.NG.ru, June 2, 2022). After more than two years of fighting, however, Ukrainian resistance has prevented the Russian side from achieving its initial goals and Moscow appears to have concluded that it may ultimately need to involve other countries in the future if it is to achieve the much-diminished Kyiv. Pozdnyakov suggests in his article that not only would Hungary and Poland’s demands for concessions help Russia directly in that effort, but they would also normalize territorial expansion and, thus, reduce criticism of Moscow for engaging in it. In Moscow’s view, if everyone is involved or portrayed as being involved in territorial aggrandizement then Russia should not be singled out with sanctions and other restrictions. If that view prevails, far more wars of aggression will break out, possibly leading to a global conflagration. The borders of Ukraine, like those of many countries in the region, including Russia, have shifted throughout history. This historical context, however, does not validate Pozdnyakov’s conclusions, even though it is true that the evolution of the Ukraine-Russia borders of continued right up to the end of the Soviet period. (On that process, see my 'Can Republican Borders be Changed?' RFE/RL Report on the USSR, September 28, 1990, posted online at Window on Eurasia, May 21, 2021). Moreover, borders of districts within these union republics were also changed frequently, again to serve Moscow’s interests, and especially to prevent any challenges to the Soviet Union’s territorial division (Window on Eurasia, October 5). When the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, all 12 countries that had been union republics—the three occupied Baltic countries had left earlier—and the international community committed themselves to accepting the 1991 borders as legitimate. The independence of these countries had only become possible because of a provision in the Soviet constitution allowing union republics to secede. There was a conviction that doing anything else would cause more issues, making the transitions many hoped for impossible and even more dangerous than agreeing to the previously established Soviet borders. Those decisions, of course, did not prevent border disputes among and within the newly independent countries. The most prominent disputes before Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea include Moscow’s war against Chechnya, the conflict of Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh, and a series of disputes among Central Asian countries. These conflicts have attracted the attention of other countries, which have supported one side or the other, but rarely their direct participation. Moscow, until very recently when it recruited North Koreans to fight alongside the Russian military in Ukraine, has opposed any involvement of countries beyond the former Soviet space and see it as a direct threat (see EDM, October 30). Many of these countries, even when they very much supported one side or the other, fear that their involvement could spark an even more serious conflict between the Russian Federation and themselves (Window on Eurasia, May 26). Moscow’s counting on the possibility that East European countries might help it in Ukraine should not come as a surprise. Russian officials have always paid close attention to the ways Moscow can exploit ethnic minorities in adversarial countries. In the case of Ukraine, the Kremlin has long tracked the Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian minorities, of which there are approximately 150,000 each, and these groups’ attitudes in their ethnic homelands—even if those governments have been generally supportive of Kyiv. More recently, Moscow has paid particular attention to Hungary and the Hungarians in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia given the Orban government’s pro-Moscow position and Budapest’s own actions regarding the Hungarian minority in Ukraine (see EDM, June 20). It is entirely possible that the Kremlin may believe that offering Russian assistance to Hungary to regain portions of Ukraine could help Moscow wean Budapest even further away from Europe. Pozdnyakov’s article suggests that Moscow is increasingly attentive to these complicated ethnic relationships, something Western governments need to be aware of as well. Without proper care, any agreement the West encourages Kyiv to sign with Moscow could spark new and broader conflicts in the region and sow the seeds of a much larger and more destructive war.

Unusual Reasons Africa Wanted Trump To Win – OpEd	By Azu Ishiekwene I understand wealthy US citizens and conservatives of the evangelical hue rooting for Donald Trump. The rich believe he would loosen regulations and protect them and their businesses from excessive taxation. Conservative evangelicals believe he is the bulwark against wokeism, especially the ultra-liberal variety. And white folks want their country back. But Africans at home and in the Diaspora—what is their business supporting a guy who described their continent as a 'shithole' and has worn his anti-immigrant rhetoric on his sleeves? It didn’t seem to make sense that anyone who saw Trump 1.0 would ever dream or wish for the second version. But now, he’s back. He even has the Supreme Court and the Senate in his Red corner as of press time. With the media (especially the major networks) awash with polls indicating a dead heat up to zero hours, I became more interested in the pro-Trump sentiment among Nigerians. I also checked in with friends elsewhere on the continent, and the feedback surprised me. Trump, we want Some friends told me Trump is just the man the US needs to purge itself of its hubris and arrogance. Once upon a time, the US was a moral force for good worldwide. Its exceptionalism didn’t often require bullying others to make the point. It did many bad things during the Cold War, as did its arch-rival, the Soviet Union. But after that phase and with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many had hoped to see the emergence of a multipolar world, one in which, if you like, the lion and the lamb would lie side by side. But that was not to be. From Cuba to Venezuela, Libya to the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, and right up to the old sphere of influence of the USSR, the US stoked—and still stokes—a zero-sumness that hardly brooks 'live and let live.' Since then, the world has experienced fewer devastating wars, but it has wrestled with no fewer tensions of a new variety aided and abetted by technology. Same difference? Trump 2.0, these folks hope, will do at least two things for the world. It would further hasten the internal decay of the US by aggravating racial tensions and emboldening right-wing excesses. Two, Trump’s America First ultra-insularity and his off-the-fly foreign policy style will distance the US from its traditional allies and enable crazies around the world, like North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, to run amok. This sounded more like saying that if US voters were happy to be seduced by their worst selves, they deserve what they get. But that was not all. Some also wanted Trump’s victory as a stick to beat their leaders back home. On the eve of the election, Larry Madowo of CNN reported that Kenyans wanted Trump to win because 'with him, you know where you stand.' The report contrasted Trump’s style with Kenya’s political elite, who could hardly be trusted. Trumphobes The CNN report might also have been about Nigeria, where Trumphobes wanted him to win for a slightly curiously different reason. They think his anti-immigration policy will force Nigerians and their government to fix their own country. In the US, Nigeria has the highest diaspora population of Africa, 327,000 citizens, followed by Ethiopia, 222,000, and Egypt, 192,000. It didn’t matter much to the Trumphobes that Nigeria’s US diaspora sends home $20 billion yearly, an increasingly significant source of support for a distressed economy. What is at work is a reverse schadenfreude, which says that the fewer opportunities Nigerian immigrants have outside the country, the more seriously the government would be obliged to fix the country. Someone even said to me that the 'malicious support' for Trump was payback for the bad leaders that the US routinely propped and supported around the world, a list that included Saddam Hussein, Augusto Pinochet and Mobutu Seseko. Republican African record Some pro-Trump sentiments are, however, driven by facts. For example, Republicans have a far better record of engaging Africans than Democrats. The Republican Party opposed colonialism. Its support for African initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and efforts to combat AIDS contrasts with the Democrat’s preference for aid diplomacy. The hope is that Trump 2.0 will not be an exception. Here, Diasporans are not too far from their Black cousins in the US. A NAACP poll in September showed that one in four Black men under 50 supported Trump for president. Trump 1.0 showed tough love towards Africa, but it was on his watch, for example, that the US finally authorised the sale to Nigeria of the much-needed fighter jets for the prosecution of the war on Boko Haram, which President Barack Obama had blocked for eight years. On his part, President Joe Biden will only make a brief visit – his first to Africa in four years – to Angola on his way out of the White House. Better or worse? Trump’s overwhelming victory might mean one of two things for his presidency: The weight of the responsibility could humble him and increase the likelihood that he would be more restrained than before. On the other hand, it could also bring out the worst in him—that feeling that he never really lost in 2020, that he was cheated of victory as he claimed, that it’s now time to take his pound of flesh with a vengeance. We’ll have to wait and see. If Trump 2.0 means Africans who were not on the radar during the campaign will now have to look inward and find their way through an uncertain future, then so be it. Ukraine and Gaza Trump’s victory might hasten the end of the war in Ukraine and, hopefully, improve the protracted global supply chain crisis that has affected the supply of agricultural products and cooking oils to many African countries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky knows he cannot depend on Trump to bear the cost of a war that has, for all purposes, become a meat grinder. The war in Ukraine might end sooner than later. As for the Middle East, Trump. 1.0 moved the Embassy of the US from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite protests by the Palestinians and some Arab countries. If that means anything, it should suggest that Trump 2.0 will not walk on the eggshell of a two-state solution in his approach to the current war on Gaza. He’s flat-out pro-Netanyahu and big on oil deals with Gulf states. I make no pretence of my dislike of Trump’s politics. Nor do I have any illusions that his second term would be significantly different from his first, which left the world holding its breath dangerously for four years. But if he’s the man American voters have chosen to lead them, so be it. Unfortunately, what America does—for good or ill—affects the rest of the world whether or not we cast a ballot.

Zelenskyy Warns EU Leaders That Capitulation To Putin Is ‘Suicida...	(RFE/RL) -- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned European leaders that capitulation to Russia after it invaded Ukraine would be 'suicidal' for Europe, just hours after Kyiv and the Black Sea port of Odesa were rocked by an unusually intense wave of air strikes. Speaking at a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest on November 7, Zelenskiy renewed his appeals for more support for his war-torn country ahead of an informal EU summit the next day to be hosted by Hungary, which currently holds the 27-member bloc's rotating presidency. He also said he has already spoken with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump about how both the United States and Europe need to be strong for each other's benefit amid the 'many challenges' facing the world. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in his speech, which came two days after Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Speaking later at a news conference, he said he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the war quickly and that he had not discussed it with him. He said he believed Trump wanted to end the war quickly, but this did not necessarily mean it would happen. He also said talk of introducing a cease-fire without first agreeing security guarantees for Ukraine was 'very dangerous.' 'A cease-fire when there are no security guarantees...is a preparation for the continuation of the occupation,' he said. Trepidation has swept across Europe since the victory given Trump's oft-stated skepticism over U.S. military support for Ukraine.'The concept of 'peace through strength' has proven itself and is needed now. Showing weakness or selling out Europe's positions won't buy a just peace. Peace is the reward only for the strong,' Zelenskiy added. Zelenskiy was welcomed to the meeting by right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has maintained close ties with Putin and has spoken against EU sanctions on Moscow. Orban also has close relations with Trump. NATO chief Mark Rutte, in a pitch to secure Trump's support for Ukraine, told journalists upon arrival in Budapest that the sending troops by North Korea to aid Russia in Ukraine posed a direct threat to the United States. 'What we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China, and of course Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine,' Rutte said. 'At the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea, which is now threatening in future the mainland of the U.S., continental Europe,' he warned. 'I look forward to sit down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively,' Rutte said. North Korean troops are already fighting for Russia, according to Zelenskiy, who told reporters during the news conference that they already had sustained 'losses' on the battlefield. The gathering in Budapest came as Ukraine shot down 74 of the 106 drones that Russia launched early on November 7 at targets in nine Ukrainian regions -- Odesa, Mykolayiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Chernihiv -- while 22 others were lost after being jammed by Ukrainian electronic warfare systems. Russian strikes early on November 7 sparked fires and caused damage in five districts of Kyiv, which was under Russian attack for eight hours, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported on Telegram.Drone debris fell in the the districts of Pechersk, Holosiyivskiy, Solomyansk, Obolonsk, and Podilsk, Klitschko said, adding that two people were injured by falling drone debris.Klitschko reported that the upper floors of a multistory building in Pechersk were burning and residents were being evacuated.In Odesa, a high-rise apartment building was damaged and one man was injured by falling debris after Ukrainian air defenses shot down Russian drones over the Black Sea port, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported.Telegram channels published a video of a fire on the first floor of a nine-story building in Odesa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olqrlxG7vNvOO	2024-11-07T15:36:49-08:00
