Iraq Stuck Between Israel And Iran As Tensions Rise – Analysis	Iraq’s leaders have a lot on their minds, stuck between Israel and Iran as the two countries veer closer to open conflict. Iraq is still recovering from the reign of Saddam Hussein, the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, decades of sanctions that followed the 1991 invasion of Kuwait, liberation by the U.S.-led 'coalition of the willing' in 2003, a post-invasionreconstructionthat wasted much of the $60 billion spent, and the Islamic State insurgency of 2014-2019. The U.S.-ledsanctionscampaign against the Saddam Hussein regime disrupted the Iraqi economy, causing inflation to skyrocket, unemployment numbers to hit record levels, a dramatic fall in living standards, the collapse of the infrastructure, and a serious decline in the availability of public services. But it was OK, asMadeleine Albright(then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) informed Americans, 'we think the price is worth it.' All that, plus Saddam’s crimes against his own people for almost 25 years, weigh on Iraq’s as they navigate to a peaceful, prosperous future. And there are other issues to vex Baghdad. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and most Iraqis want them to leave. (In 2020, Iraq’s parliament passed a resolution demanding the expulsion of U.S. troops after the U.S. killed Iran’s Quds Force commander, Qasem Soleimani, and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.) The governments recently announced an agreement on the Americans’ departure, though the U.S. refuses to explain how many troops will remain in Iraq and what they will be doing. The story put out for public consumption is that the goal is the 'enduring defeat' of the Islamic State (IS), so will the U.S. try to declare the Islamic State is still a threat to delay withdrawing in order to support Israel against Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iraqi militias, and bolster Washington’s clients, the Iraqi Kurds? And the Americans aren’t the only uninvited guests: Iraq hosts around300,000 refugeesand asylum seekers, mostly Syrian Kurds, and over 1 million Iraqis remain internally displaced by Islamic State insurgency. The U.S. still influences Iraq by requiring asanctions waiverfor Iraqi purchases of electricity from Iraq, and it recentlybannedall foreign transactions in Chinese Yuan. Washington still controls the disbursement of Iraq’s dollar-denominated oil revenues from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a final gesture of disrespect, the U.S. made a monthly disbursement of dollars to Iraq and at one pointrationed dollars, claiming it was necessary to prevent smuggling and money laundering, though the move immediately devalued the Iraqi Riyal. The Iran-influenced militia, the PMF, is now part of Iraq’s government, but that hasn’t stayed America’s hand when it decides to kill a PMF leader. Washington damaged itself in Iraq by killing PMF leadersAbu Mahdi al-Muhandisin 2020, andMushtaqTalibal-SaidiandMushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawariin 2024. Baghdad had moved the PMF, once a private militia, into the government in 2016 (no doubt with American encouragement), so the killing of PMF leaders, who were government officials, likely increased local support the PMF and weakened Iraqi leaders, the same leaders the U.S. then expects to stand up to Iran and purge the militias. This is about as realistic as the White House eradicating every trace of the Sinaloa Cartel from the U.S. In both countries, those groups survive, and thrive, because they have some popular support, but also because government agencies and powerful people in both countries benefit from their activities. The Pentagon produced no 'ticking bomb' rationale for the 'self-defense' attacks that it always describes as 'appropriate and proportionate,' and would have shouted it from the rooftops if there was. The Pentagon killed the PMF leaders because it could, and as a way to eliminate potential future problems in the future, ignoring the here-and-now problems it caused for Baghdad. A recentdrone attackon Israel launched from Iraq killed two Israeli troops and injured 24. Iraqis are concerned aboutIsraeli retaliation, but this is a good opportunity for the U.S. to tell Israel to stand down, and to pass information on the attackers to Baghdad so it can demonstrably clean house. Allowing Israel to strike Iraq will weaken Iraqi leaders when Washington should be doing what it can to strengthen them; standing idly by when its Israeli client attacks another country with impunity will only hurt U.S. interests. Israel is planning toattack Iranin retaliation for Iran’s retaliation to Israel’s killing its allies in Hamas and Hezbollah and Iranian military officers, the attack on itsconsulatein Damascus, Syria. And, hopefully, to slow Iran’s nuclear program. The most direct routes are through Iraq and Saudi Arabia but Iraq’sforeign ministersaid the expansion of war to Iran via Iraq’s airspace is 'unacceptable.' Washington generally has a permissive attitude to whatever Israel wants to do, so if the attackers cross Iraq the assumption will be that the Americans approved, or did not disapprove, of the attack on Iran. This will dilute support for the U.S., weaken U.S.-friendly politicians, and strengthen the hands of Moscow and Beijing, who won’t mind seeing the Americans entangled in the expansion of the Israel-Palestine civil war into a regional conflict (and Russian and Chinese oil investors in Iraq won’t mind the price spike.) Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani, visited the White House in April 2024 and his focus was the economic relationship between the U.S. and Iraq, especially because about60 per centof Iraq’s population is under the age of 25, and high youth unemployment (or under-employment) is a drag on the economy and a recruiting opportunity for Iran and the Islamists. When Americans think of Iraq in economic terms it’s all about the oil, but in November 2023ExxonMobil, America’s biggest oil company, exited Iraq with nothing to show for a decade-long effort. (PetroChina took over ExxonMobil’s role and now owns the biggest share in theWest Qurna 1 oilfield, one of the world’s biggest with estimated recoverable reserves of over 20 billion barrels.) The departure will lower the expectations of other U.S. companies, but Sudani wants to revitalize economic ties with America. Russia has investedover $19 billionin the Iraq energy sector with LUKOIL, Gazprom Neft and Rosneft the top investors. In early 2024, Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant, was awarded the development contract for theNasiriyah oil field, which holds an estimated 4.36 billion barrels. Iraq is balancing between Russia and China to avoid becoming a client state, and American investment would increase Baghdad’s autonomy, but that’s assuming Washington doesn’t intend to do the same as Moscow and Beijing. In the absence of U.S. investment, Iraq may still be able to fund a diversified economy with oil income and that be less efficient than non-energy foreign direct investment, but Iraq has to make up for lost time since 1980, when Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Iran, and can’t afford to delay. U.S.-Iraq tradehas room for growth. In 2022, the U.S. exported $897 million in goods, the top product being automobiles. Iraq, in turn, exported $10.3 billion in goods, most of it crude oil. A key economic objective of Iraq is the $17 billionDevelopment Road, an overland road and rail link from the al-Faw port on the Persian Gulf to Europe via Turkey, that will host free-trade zones along its length. This initiative is designed to shorten travel time between Asia and Europe, potentially competing with Egypt's Suez Canal. The project is expected to enhanceIraq's geopolitical position, promote regional stability, and reduce the country's reliance on hydrocarbons by providing financial returns through increased trade. However, it faces challenges such as financing, implementation, corruption, and potential insecurity. The Development Road may benefit from connecting to other transport projects in the area: theInternational North–South Transport Corridor, the ship, rail, and road route for moving freight between India, Russia, Iran, Europe, and Central Asia; and theMiddle Corridor, an alternative to the Northern Corridor through Russia, which connects Southeast Asia and China to Europe via Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Though the projects may be complementary, they may also compete for funding so no project is fully realized and each sees only minor improvements in the host country's infrastructure. The U.S. president and the Iraqi prime minister should consider the shape of the future U.S.-Iraq relationship, which has to now been securitized, first by the Cold War, then the invasion of Kuwait and the resulting sanctions campaign, the U.S.-led invasion, and finally the Islamic State insurgency. The 2003 invasion weakened the Iraqi state and invited greater Iranian influence which the U.S. should help Baghdad dilute, though the two countries share a common religion and some tribal areas straddle the Iraq-Iran border, so Baghdad and Tehran will probably always be too close for Washington’s liking. Where Iran is concerned, in Washington, DC it’s always 1979. America’s leaders’ challenge is to understand the concept of 'sunk cost,' which means the approximately4,500 U.S. military deaths, and the $2.1 trillion spent (mostly borrowed) in a war of choice is no reason to linger in Iraq, though the 'enduring defeat' of the IS may give the project a new lease on life. Iraq is the best modern example ofThe Meddler’s Trap, 'a situation of self-entanglement, whereby a leader inadvertently creates a problem through military intervention, feels they can solve it, and values solving the new problem more because of the initial intervention. …A military intervention causes a feeling of ownership of the foreign territory, triggering the endowment effect.' The U.S. and Iraq need to move from a security relationship to an economic relationship, and for Iraq to be a full partner the Americans may have to surrender their stranglehold on Iraq’s oil revenues, which gives the U.S. outsized influence with a key member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. If Washington is reluctant to do business, Iraq can always explore joining BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), though it will have to present the organization with a rationale other than 'We have hydrocarbons,' which the current members, that include Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have in abundance. Iraq is a member of the China-ledAsian Infrastructure Investment Bankwhich may be a source of assistance to diversify its economy and infrastructure to make it more attractive to BRICS, or it may get more attention from China if Beijing senses Washington is bedeviled by a lack of imagination. Iraq joined China's Belt and Road Initiative in 2015 and has received approximately $10.5 billion as of 2021, with investments focusing on energy projects, infrastructure development, and construction. The U.S. can help Iraq navigate its way to a prosperous future for Iraqi youth, but both countries will have to distance themselves from Jerusalem and Tehran because indulging those two often promotes self-harm instead of cooperation and opportunity.

US Announces Additional $400 Defense Aid Package To Ukraine Durin...	The United States has allocated a new defense aid package to Ukraine totaling $400 million. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced this during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. This package will include ammunition, military equipment, and weaponry. The Secretary assured that support under the security agreement between the United States and Ukraine will continue. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the military assistance package and for all the support the U.S. has provided since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion. 'I thank the American people and President Biden. I am also grateful for the bipartisan support: we greatly appreciate everything that has been done since the start of this war. Thank you for the recent meeting in Brussels within the framework of the Ukraine – NATO Council. It was an opportunity to establish direct dialogue with the defense ministers of allied countries, and after that, there was a strong meeting at the G7 defense ministers' level,' the President said. He noted that during a recent phone conversation with President Joe Biden, they discussed the Victory Plan, preparations for the winter period, Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, and options for bolstering them. This announcement is the Biden Administration'ssixty-eighth tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine since August 2021. This Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which has an estimated value of $400 million, will provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including: munitions for rocket systems and artillery; mortar systems and rounds; armored vehicles; and anti-tank weapons. The capabilities in this announcement include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems and rounds; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Satellite communication equipment; Small arms and ammunition; Grenades and training equipment; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Equipment to protect critical national infrastructure; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDE3v2dZmQm4T	2024-10-21T09:59:03-07:00	
Austin Visits Ukraine In Show Of US Support	U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Monday to Ukraine in a show of support for Ukraine’s military and to meet with Ukrainian leaders. The Pentagon said in a statement that Austin will also 'deliver a speech that will highlight how Ukraine has skillfully fought back against Putin's war of choice, U.S. commitment to ensuring Ukraine's armed forces have the battlefield capabilities they need, and why Ukraine's fight matters for U.S. security.' Austin’s visit comes days after the United States announced $425 million in new aid for Ukraine, including munitions for air defense systems and artillery munitions. Russian drone attacks injured at least one person in Ukraine’s capital, officials in Kyiv said Monday. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram falling debris from drones shot down by Ukrainian air defenses damaged several residential buildings. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram that as many as a dozen Russian drones were involved in the attack, but that all of them were destroyed. Russian drones also targeted Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Governor Vitalii Kim said Monday on Telegram that air defenses downed three drones overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Monday it destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones launched in overnight attacks. Eleven of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, while another four were destroyed over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over Oryol. Officials in Kursk reported there were no casualties and no damage reported from the attacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDGR71TIEldhh	2024-10-21T09:58:09-07:00	
The Impact Of The Israel-Iranian Conflict On Southeast Asia: Econ...	The escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, while primarily centred in the Middle East, carry significant economic consequences for regions beyond the immediate conflict zone. One such region is Southeast Asia, where economies are deeply interconnected through global trade, energy, and markets. Southeast Asia’s reliance on oil imports, particularly from the Middle East, renders it vulnerable to disruptions in energy supply and global price fluctuations induced by the conflict. This essay posits that the intensifying Israel-Iran conflict could substantially disrupt Southeast Asia’s economic stability through rising energy costs, inflation, slowed growth, and market volatility, thereby necessitating strategic responses and economic diversification to mitigate these risks. The Role of Middle Eastern Oil in Southeast Asia’s Economy The Middle East plays a crucial role in satisfying Southeast Asia’s growing energy demands. Nations such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam heavily rely on imported oil to fuel their industries, transportation, and overall economic growth. The region’s dependence on oil imports from the Middle East is indicative of its vulnerability to geopolitical tensions, particularly those affecting the Strait of Hormuz. This narrow passage, through which nearly 20% of the world’s oil supply is transported, serves as a vital artery for Southeast Asian economies. Historically, fluctuations in global oil prices have had a pronounced impact on the economies of Southeast Asia. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent surge in oil prices, many ASEAN countries experienced rising inflation and stagnated economic growth. These events underscore the interconnectedness between Southeast Asia’s economic health and global oil price stability. Given this dependency, any disruption in Middle Eastern oil supplies—such as a military blockade or an attack—would significantly affect Southeast Asia’s energy costs, thereby contributing to inflationary pressures throughout the region. Disruptions to Global Oil Supply and Southeast Asia’s Economic Impact The Israel-Iran conflict presents a significant threat to global oil supply chains. Both nations' engagement in cyberattacks, drone strikes, and proxy warfare has rendered crucial Middle Eastern oil infrastructure more susceptible to sabotage or military action. Iran’s persistent threats to impede access to the Strait of Hormuz exacerbate the risk of substantial supply disruptions. Any conflict-induced closure or restriction of the strait would dramatically diminish global oil shipments, precipitating immediate spikes in oil prices. For Southeast Asia, this situation would result in escalating costs across various sectors. Energy-dependent industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and logistics, would face soaring operational expenses, which could reduce output and increase consumer prices. The manufacturing sector in Southeast Asia, a pivotal component of regional economic growth, would be particularly adversely affected by rising fuel costs, thereby diminishing its competitiveness in the global market. Additionally, inflationary pressures would undermine consumer purchasing power, dampening domestic consumption and subsequently slowing GDP growth throughout the region. Broader Trade Market Implications Beyond implications for energy costs, the conflict between Israel and Iran threatens to disrupt global shipping routes, further complicating trade dynamics in Southeast Asia. The Middle East serves as a vital hub for global trade, with critical shipping lanes traversing the region. Disruptions to these routes, whether resulting from military conflict or heightened security measures, could lead to increased shipping delays and elevated transportation costs. Southeast Asia, where trade is fundamental to economic prosperity, would experience far-reaching consequences from such disruptions. Higher transportation costs would elevate the prices of imported goods, exacerbating existing inflationary pressures. Moreover, delays in the delivery of essential raw materials and products could disrupt supply chains, particularly within the electronics and automotive sectors, where Southeast Asian nations play a crucial role in global manufacturing networks. The subsequent slowdown in production could impede economic growth both regionally and globally. Furthermore, the conflict has the potential to destabilize investor confidence in Southeast Asia. As geopolitical risks in the Middle East escalate, global investors may adopt a more risk-averse posture, resulting in capital outflows from emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. This could trigger currency devaluations, increased borrowing costs, and market volatility, further complicating the region’s economic recovery efforts in the post-pandemic landscape. Economic Vulnerability of Middle Eastern Nations and External Influences While Southeast Asia's vulnerability to the Israel-Iran conflict is considerable, the economic instability within Middle Eastern oil-producing nations may also have significant repercussions for the region. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which rely heavily on oil revenues, face substantial risks if oil production is disrupted. Reduced oil exports from the Middle East would diminish government revenues, thereby undermining their capacity to maintain economic stability. This situation could consequently affect trade relationships between Southeast Asia and these oil-exporting nations, as both regions grapple with the economic fallout. Furthermore, the involvement of external powers complicates the geopolitical landscape. The United States, with its longstanding presence in the Middle East, is likely to augment its military footprint in response to escalating tensions. In contrast, China, the largest importer of Middle Eastern oil, has a vested interest in preserving stability in the region. Given China’s significant economic influence in Southeast Asia, any efforts by Beijing to mitigate the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict could substantially shape the region’s energy security and trade dynamics. Conversely, Russia stands to benefit from higher global oil prices and may leverage the situation to reinforce its energy dominance, particularly in Europe. Strategic Responses and Recommendations To mitigate the economic risks posed by the Israel-Iran conflict, Southeast Asian nations must adopt strategic responses. First and foremost, the diversification of energy sources is essential. While Southeast Asia is increasingly investing in renewable energy and alternative fuel sources, these efforts must be accelerated to reduce the region’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Enhancing regional cooperation on energy security through initiatives such as the ASEAN Power Grid could contribute to a more stable and sustainable energy future. Additionally, Southeast Asia should fortify trade partnerships with other regions to diminish its exposure to geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Expanding trade agreements with partners outside of the conflict zone, such as Australia and East Asia, would provide greater flexibility in managing supply chain disruptions. Finally, coordinated diplomatic efforts to support global initiatives aimed at de-escalating the Israel-Iran conflict could help stabilize energy markets and protect regional economic interests. Conclusion The Israel-Iran conflict represents a substantial economic challenge for Southeast Asia, with the potential to disrupt oil supplies, elevate energy costs, and undermine market stability. The region's significant reliance on Middle Eastern oil, in conjunction with its critical role in global trade, renders it particularly susceptible to the economic repercussions of this geopolitical confrontation. To safeguard their economies, Southeast Asian nations must actively pursue energy diversification, enhance trade resilience, and engage in diplomatic initiatives to mitigate the associated risks. Failure to adequately address these challenges may lead to prolonged economic instability, with extensive consequences for regional growth and prosperity.

Weak Endeavours: The Meekness Of Australia’s Anti-Corruption Body...	The warning signs of the Australian National Anti-Corruption Commission’s ineffectiveness were there from the start. The enacting legislation that brought it into existence, for instance, limit public hearings to 'exceptional circumstances', a reminder that the authorities are not exactly happy to let that large expanse of riffraff known as the public know how power functions in Australia. Then came its first major decision on June 6. Pundits were on tenterhooks. What would this body, charged with enhancing the 'integrity in the Commonwealth public sector by deterring, detecting and preventing corrupt conduct involving Commonwealth public officials' do about referrals concerning six public officials from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme? The spiritually crushing automated debt assessment and recovery program, had, after all, been responsible for using, in the words of Commission report, 'patently unreliable methodology as income averaging, without other evidence, to determine entitlement to benefit'. From its inception as a pilot program in 2015 till its conclusion in May 2020, a reign of bureaucratic terror was inflicted on vulnerable Australians. The answer from Australia’s newly minted body was one of stern indifference. While the NACC was aware of the impact of the scheme 'on individuals and the public, the seniority of the officials involved, and the need to ensure that any corruption issue is fully investigated' the commission felt that 'the conduct of the six public officials in connection with the Robodebt Scheme has already been fully explored by the Robodebt Royal Commission and extensively discussed in its final report.' In other words, there would be no consequences for the individuals in question, no public exposure of their misdeeds, no sense of satisfaction for victims of the scheme that their harms had been truly redressed. In refusing to act on the referrals, the NACC had, in the words of former NSW Supreme Court Judge Anthony Whealy KC, now chair for the Centre for Public Integrity, 'betrayed a core obligation and failed to fulfil its primary duty.' An absurd spectacle ensued. The inspector of the NACC, Gail Furness, found herself being called upon rather early in her tenure to investigate the very entity that had been created to expose maladministration and corrupt conduct after receiving 900 complaints about the NACC’s own alleged corrupt conduct. In the mess of not pursuing the Robodebt officials, it also transpired that Commissioner Paul Brereton had delegated, rather than recused himself, from the process given a conflict of interest. By merely delegating the role of reaching the final decision to a Deputy Commissioner, however, Brereton had not entirely precluded his part in the drama. Two recent incidents confirm how the NACC is intended to (mal)function – at least in the eyes of Canberra’s secrecy-drugged political establishment. Far from being effective, the body’s role is intended as impotently symbolic, an annexure of the corruption consensus that rots at the capital’s centre. The first came in the defeated efforts of Senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie to introduce an amendment directing the NACC Commissioner to hold public hearings if 'satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.' As Pocock explained to the Senate, the committee process into examining the NACC Act revealed 'evidence from commissioners from state integrity commissions that … there should be a presumption towards having public hearings.' The current legislation, as shaped by Labor and the Coalition, was designed 'in a way that we have no real oversight of what is happening in the NACC.' And that is exactly how that same unholy alliance hoped matters would remain, with both Labor and the Liberal-Nationals voting down the amendment. In justifying that craven move, Labor Senator and Minister for Employment and Workplace relations Murray Watt held out feebly that the 'appropriate balance' between holding public hearings, and considering whether they might 'prejudice criminal prosecution, reputations, safety, privacy, wellbeing or confidentiality' had been struck. Any attentive student of secrecy in politics will be mindful that any balance between public interests and exceptional circumstances will always favour the pathway of least transparency. In Australia, public interest tests are almost always read down to favour opacity over openness. In keeping with the disease of closed power, the second matter concerned revelations by the NACC about certain operational details regarding Operation Bannister. The investigative effort was established to investigate whether a Home Affairs employee’s 'familial links' to contracted service provider and Paladin founder Craig Thrupp, had instanced corruption. Paladin Holdings has handsomely profited from the Australian taxpayer, raking in over half a billion dollars to manage the brutal Manus Island detention centre between 2017 and 2019. The senior executive in question, pseudonymised as Anne Brown, received $194,701.10 from Paladin for 'management and consulting services' in 2017. The money was transferred to her home loan account to assist full repayment, though she denied undertaking any work for Paladin or assisting them with the tender to Home Affairs in securing the contract. Browne’s partner, retired Home Affairs executive pseudonymised as Carl Delaney, directly aided Paladin in securing the lucrative tender. He joined Paladin’s board of directors in 2019 and was remunerated to the sum of $5,000 for his efforts. Thrupp also purchased another apartment for Brown and Delaney in the same complex worth $920,000, along with accompanying furniture. Two months later, it was rented back to Paladin for $1,000 per week, though eventually sold in 2020, with Brown and Delaney pocketing the proceeds. The question being investigated was whether the failure by Brown to disclose the aforementioned events (she thought she had no obligation to do so from April 2018 when she was on long-service leave pending retirement) had affected her suitability to hold a security clearance. These included the evolving nature of her relationship with Delaney and the money and property lavished on them from Thrupp. Even Commissioner Brereton acknowledged that 'she should have at least known that at least her relationship with Delaney ought to have been reported' though inexplicably thought the non-disclosure 'understandable' and not actuated by intent, dishonesty or corruption. The investigation had initially begun as a joint investigation by the Australian Commission into Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) and the Department of Home Affairs. It then fell to the NACC from July 1, 2023 to finalise matters. On October 9, the report by Commissioner Brereton was released. The allegation that Brown had abused her office as a Home Affairs employee 'to dishonestly obtain a benefit for herself or to assist Paladin to secure the garrison services contract is unsubstantiated.' She had not failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest between herself and Thrupp ('a close relative'), and her partner Delaney, in their links to Paladin, 'in accordance with Home Affairs procedures'. The report does not find Brown’s failure to report the 'change of her circumstances to Home Affairs and AGSVA [Australian Government Security Vetting Agency]' remarkable, as it 'does not appear to have been intentional'. Failure to do so was insufficient to 'bring it to the notice of the head of the relevant agency.' For a body that offered so much promise, the NACC has failed to impress. Instead of restoring trust in the public service and politics, the Commission has shown a lack of appetite to pursue its broader remit, preferring a stymying caution. The status quo remains, distinctly, intact.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDEy0Y_-Ca0MU	2024-10-21T09:53:33-07:00	
The Danger Is Real: The Deep State’s Plot To Destabilize The Nati...	If the three-ring circus that is the looming presidential election proves anything, it is that the Deep State’s plot to destabilize the nation is working. The danger is real. Caught up in the heavily dramatized electoral showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Americans have become oblivious to the multitude of ways in which the government is goosestepping all over our freedoms on adailybasis. Especially alarming is the extent to which those on both sides are allowing themselves to be gaslighted by both Trump and Harris about critical issues of the day, selectively choosing to hear only what they want to hear when it casts the opposition in a negative light. This is true whether you’re talking about immigration and border control, health care, national security, the nation’s endless wars, protections for free speech, or the militarization of the U.S. government. For starters, there’s the free speech double standard, what my good friend Nat Hentoff used to refer to as the 'free speech for me but not for thee' phenomenon in which the First Amendment’s protections only apply to those with whom we might agree. Despite her claims to being a champion for the rule of law, which in our case is the U.S. Constitution, Harris isn’t averse topolicing so-called 'hate' speech. In this, Harris is not unlike thoseon both the Right and the Leftwho continue to express a distaste for unregulated, free speech online, especially when it comes to speech with which they might disagree. Then there’s Trump, never a fan of free speech protections for his critics, who has been particularly vocal about his desire to see the military vanquish 'radical left lunatics,' which he has dubbed 'the enemy from within.' If it were only about muzzling free speech activities, that would be concerning enough. But Trump’s enthusiasm for using the military to target domestic enemies of the state should send off warning bells, especially coinciding as it does with the Department of Defense’s recent re-issuance ofDirective 5240.01, which empowers the military to assist law enforcement 'in situations where a confrontation between civilian law enforcement and civilian individuals or groups is reasonably anticipated.' This is what martial law looks like—a government of force that relies on the military to enforce its authority—and it’s exactly what America’s founders feared, which is why they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law: the U.S. Constitution. Responding to concerns that the military would be used for domestic policing, Congress passed thePosse Comitatus Act in 1878, which makes it a crime for the government to use the military to carry out arrests, searches, seizure of evidence and other activities normally handled by a civilian police force. The increasing militarization of the police, the use of sophisticated weaponry against Americans and the government’s increasing tendency to employ military personnel domestically have all but eviscerated historic prohibitions such as thePosse Comitatus Act. Yet sometime over the course of the past 240-plus years that constitutional republic has been transformed into a military dictatorship disguised as a democracy. Unfortunately, most Americans seem relatively untroubled by the fact that our constitutional republic is being transformed into a military dictatorship disguised as a democracy. The seeds of chaos that have been sown in recent years are all part of the Deep State’s plans to usher in martial law. Observe for yourself what has been happening right before our eyes. Domestic terrorism fueled by government entrapment schemes. Civil unrest stoked to dangerous levels by polarizing political rhetoric. A growing intolerance for dissent that challenges the government’s power grabs. Police brutality tacitly encouraged by the executive branch, conveniently overlooked by the legislatures, and granted qualified immunity by the courts. A weakening economy exacerbated by government schemes that favor none but a select few. Heightened foreign tensions and blowback due to the military industrial complex’s profit-driven quest to police and occupy the globe. This is no conspiracy theory. There’s trouble brewing, and the government is masterminding a response using the military. Just take a look at 'Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,' aPentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command. The training videois only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset, the way its views the citizenry, and the so-called 'problems' that the government must be prepared to address in the near future through the use of martial law. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution, about the rights of the citizenry, and about the dangers of locking down the nation and using the military to address political and social problems. The training video anticipates that all hell will break loose by 2030, but the future is here ahead of schedule. We’re already witnessing a breakdown of society on virtually every front. By waging endless wars abroad, by bringing the instruments of war home, by transforming police into extensions of the military, by turning a free society into a suspect society, by treating American citizens like enemy combatants, by discouraging and criminalizing a free exchange of ideas, by making violence its calling card through SWAT team raids and militarized police, by fomenting division and strife among the citizenry, by acclimating the citizenry to the sights and sounds of war, and by generally making peaceful revolution all but impossible, the government has engineered an environment in which domestic violence is becoming almost inevitable. The danger signs are screaming out a message The government is anticipating trouble (read: civil unrest), which is code for anything that challenges the government’s authority, wealth and power. According to thePentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. government is grooming its armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. What they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. The chilling five-minute training video, obtained byThe Interceptthrough a FOIA request and made availableonline, paints an ominous picture of the future—a future the military is preparing for—bedeviled by 'criminal networks,' 'substandard infrastructure,' 'religious and ethnic tensions,' 'impoverishment, slums,' 'open landfills, over-burdened sewers,' a 'growing mass of unemployed,' and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots. And then comes the kicker. Three-and-a-half minutes into thePentagon’s dystopian visionof 'a world of Robert Kaplan-esque urban hellscapes — brutal and anarchic supercities filled with gangs of youth-gone-wild, a restive underclass, criminal syndicates, and bands of malicious hackers,' the ominous voice of the narrator speaks of a need to 'drain the swamps.' Drain the swamps. Surely, we’ve heard that phrase before? Ah yes. Emblazoned on t-shirts and signs, shouted at rallies, and used as a rallying cry among Trump supporters, 'drain the swamp' became one of Donald Trump’s most-used campaign slogans. Now the government has adopted its own plans for swamp-draining, only it wants to use the military todrain the swamps of futuristic urban American citiesof 'noncombatants and engage the remaining adversaries in high intensity conflict within.' And who are these noncombatants, a military term that refers to civilians who arenotengaged in fighting? They are, according to the Pentagon, 'adversaries.' They are 'threats.' They are the 'enemy.' They are people who don’t support the government, people who live in fast-growing urban communities, people who may be less well-off economically than the government and corporate elite, people who engage in protests, people who are unemployed, people who engage in crime (in keeping with the government’s fast-growing, overly broad definition of what constitutes a crime). In other words, in the eyes of the U.S. military, noncombatants are American citizens a.k.a. domestic extremists a.k.a. enemy combatants who must be identified, targeted, detained, contained and, if necessary, eliminated. In the future imagined by the Pentagon, any walls and prisons that are built will be used to protect the societal elite—the haves—from the have-nots. If you haven’t figured it out already,we the peopleare the have-nots. Suddenly it all begins to make sense. The events of recent years: the invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakers. The government is systematically locking down the nation and shifting us into martial law. This is how you prepare a populace to accept a police state willingly, even gratefully. You don’t scare them by making dramatic changes. Rather, you acclimate them slowly to their prison walls. Persuade the citizenry that their prison walls are merely intended to keep them safe and danger out. Desensitize them to violence, acclimate them to a military presence in their communities, and persuade them that there is nothing they can do to alter the seemingly hopeless trajectory of the nation. Before long, no one will even notice the floundering economy, the blowback arising from military occupations abroad, the police shootings, the nation’s deteriorating infrastructure and all of the other mounting concerns. It’s happening already. The sight of police clad in body armor and gas masks, wielding semiautomatic rifles and escorting an armored vehicle through a crowded street, a scene likened to 'a military patrol through a hostile city,' no longer causes alarm among the general populace. Few seem to care about the government’s endless wars abroad that leave communities shattered, families devastated and our national security at greater risk of blowback. The Deep State’s tactics are working. We’ve allowed ourselves to be acclimated to the occasional lockdown of government buildings,Jade Helmmilitary drills in small towns so that special operations forces can get 'realistic military training' in 'hostile' territory, and Live Active Shooter Drilltraining exercises, carried out at schools, in shopping malls, and on public transit, which can and do fool law enforcement officials, students, teachers and bystanders into thinking it’s a real crisis. Still, you can’t say we weren’t warned about the government’s nefarious schemes to lock down the nation. Back in2008, an Army War Collegereport revealed that 'widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security.' The 44-page report went on to warn that potential causes for such civil unrest could include another terrorist attack, 'unforeseen economic collapse,loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.' In 2009, reports by the Department of Homeland Security surfaced that labelledright-wing and left-wing activists and military veteransas extremists (a.k.a. terrorists) and called on the government to subject such targeted individuals to full-fledged pre-crime surveillance. Almost a decade later, after spending billions to fight terrorism, the DHS concluded that thegreater threat is not ISISbutdomestic right-wing extremism. Meanwhile, thegovernment has been amassing an arsenal of military weapons for use domesticallyand equipping and training their 'troops' for war. Even government agencies with largely administrative functions such as the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Smithsonian have been acquiring body armor, riot helmets and shields, cannon launchers and police firearms and ammunition. In fact, there are now at least120,000 armed federal agents carrying such weaponswho possess the power to arrest. Rounding out this profit-driven campaign to turn American citizens into enemy combatants (and America into a battlefield) is a technology sector that has been colluding with the government to create a Big Brother that isall-knowing, all-seeing and inescapable. It’s not just the drones,fusion centers, license plate readers, stingray devices and the NSA that you have to worry about. You’re also being tracked by theblack boxes in your cars, your cell phone, smart devices in your home, grocery loyalty cards, social media accounts, credit cards, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, and e-book reader accounts. All of this has taken place right under our noses, funded with our taxpayer dollars and carried out in broad daylight without so much as a general outcry from the citizenry. And then you have the government’s Machiavellian schemes for unleashing all manner of dangers on an unsuspecting populace, then demanding additional powers in order to protect 'we the people' from the threats. Are you getting the picture yet? The U.S. government isn’tprotectingus from terrorism. The U.S. government iscreatingthe terror. It is, in fact, the source of the terror. Just think about it for a minute: Cyberwarfare. Terrorism. Bio-chemical attacks. The nuclear arms race. Surveillance. The drug wars. Almost every national security threat that the government has claimed greater powers in order to fight—all the while undermining the liberties of the American citizenry—has been manufactured in one way or another by the government. Did I say Machiavellian? This is downright evil. We’re not dealing with a government that exists to serve its people, protect their liberties and ensure their happiness. Rather, these are the diabolical machinations of a make-works program carried out on an epic scale whose only purpose is to keep the powers-that-be permanently (and profitably) employed. Mind you, by 'government,' I’m not referring to the highly partisan, two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. I’m referring to the corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country and calling the shots in Washington DC, no matter who sits in the White House. Be warned: in the future envisioned by the government, we will not be viewed as Republicans or Democrats. Rather, 'we the people' will be enemies of the state. For years, the government has been warning against thedangers of domestic terrorism, erectingsurveillance systemsto monitor its own citizens, creatingclassification systemsto label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist, andtraining law enforcement agenciesto equate anyone possessing anti-government views as a domestic terrorist. What the government failed to explain was that the domestic terrorists would be of the government’s own making, and that 'we the people' would become enemy #1. As I make clear in my bookBattlefield America: The War on the American Peopleand in its fictional counterpartThe Erik Blair Diaries,we’re already enemies of the state. It’s time to wake up and stop being deceived by Deep State propaganda.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDNHO0TwJO-yn	2024-10-21T09:51:42-07:00	
Indonesia Could Strengthen The Common Voice Of Emerging Economies...	Asian-Pacific countries are racing for the historic ascension unto BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), but Indonesia has categorically declined to broker its bid to join the association. As an association of emerging-market economies, it was established initially as RIC (Russia, India and China) almost two decades ago, in 2015, and was later enlarged with Brazil and South Africa. At the South African summit held in August 2023, the association witnessed the second wave of expansion with five more members: include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Under Russia's presidency, BRICS+ has attracted world-wide more than 30 countries with highly-potential interest which would enhance its geopolitical standing and expand its economic influence, especially in non-western markets in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Most importantly, BRICS+ is leveraging its geopolitical position to influence global affairs and pursuing a more balanced and diversified foreign policy. Some experts say, Russia is capitalizing on BRICS+ for its remote goals of fighting isolation and against western hegemony. As far back as 2012, Indonesia's interest in becoming at that time the newest member of BRICS was unswerving, even with wide-ranging debates on the future and efficacy of South-South groupings. In 2012, Indonesia's development statistics made the country a shoe-in for membership: it had the largest economy in southeast Asia and was a demographic giant with a population of 248 million people, making it the fourth most populous country in the world, ahead of even Brazil and Russia. China and India were still incomparable a decade ago. In terms of South-South cooperation, and in light of a redefined system of North-South dialogue within a gradually more multipolar world, Indonesia has its place among the top categories of states influencing how transnational global world develops. Furthermore, given the country's pragmatic foreign policy practices and long-term cooperation with countries of the region and beyond, Indonesia could strengthen the common voice of emerging economies via BRICS. With the potential entrance of Indonesia, BRICS would then need to redefine, or rather refine its status as (possibly) one of the most important inter-regional groupings of countries of the Global South. Another significant issue is the investment sector, on which developing or emerging economies rely heavily. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Indonesia, and Indonesian FDI flown into other, less strong economies across southeast Asia and beyond, could be further encouraged by BRICS membership, which would facilitate better trans-regional cooperation. For instance, it could pave the way for increased South-South cooperation in Africa, with a more substantial Indonesian role in project generation and financing. In addition to China's and India's growing presence and involvement in the African continent, Indonesia could play (a bigger role), particularly if we (acknowledge) the growing amount of official development assistance (ODA) emerging economies have granted Africa. Its domestic market is huge and the current economic boom can be attributed to its political stability and sound economic and monetary policies, which have attracted consistent FDI. In short, Indonesia is an economic power to be (reckoned) with and its decision to join the BRICS could have a huge impact in terms of the body's credibility. Indonesian membership will definitely solidify BRICS capital composition, and also bring on board extraordinary fiscal capability. On the one hand, Russia is set to re-emerge as a strong global power with a dominant role in central and western Asia, along with India and China. But India needs to sort out its internal rifts and neighbourhood problems first, while China is becoming a strong force to reckon with in Asia, Africa and Europe. China is definitely the (primary) growth-engine of Asia and is stepping up its influence in the global economy to match its ambitions. Indonesia, on the other hand, is more comfortably clustered with South Africa and Brazil as a regional power and an economic anchor-country for the southeast Asian region, but lesser on a wider global scale. Another possibility is the re-emergence of a politically stronger ASEAN, now that Burma (Myanmar) is opening up to its neighbours. In this context, the MIST countries – Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand – will become more relevant, if they can overcome their internal problems and play the regional integration card. On the eve of the Kazan's BRICS Summit, a new report said that Indonesia would likely decided on joining BRICS only in the next government term. According to the report, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi announced that the decision regarding the country's potential membership in the BRICS economic bloc would be made during the next government term under President-elect Prabowo Subianto. 'The decision will be made by the next government, but we will continue to provide inputs on BRICS to the President-elect,' Marsudi stated during a working meeting with the House of Representatives at the parliament complex, News.Az reports citing foreign media. Marsudi said she had spoken to Prabowo about BRICS shortly after being announced as the winner of the 2024 Presidential Election. 'Not long after the President-elect was determined, I had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Prabowo, and I briefed him about BRICS,' she remarked. She explained that Indonesia's visibility to become a member of BRICS depends on the economic benefits that can be derived from joining the alliance. 'Because BRICS is an organization for economic purposes. Therefore, we will try to see from the economic side first whether the benefits are there so we can decide (on whether) to join BRICS,' the foreign minister explained. An interesting new term is currently used to describe BRICS, referring to it as forming part of global majority. Some say its simply non-western association whose majority members are located in the Global South. Collectively, BRICS association already incorporates some 45% of the world population, while its trade turnover and share in the global economy has been growing steadily. South Africa Summit reports indicated that Indonesia was given an invitation to join BRICS during the 15th BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa, on August 22-24, 2023. Geographically located in Southeast Asia and Oceania, between the Indian and Pacific oceans, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country, with its economy the world's 16th-largest by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is considered a middle power in global affairs. In addition, Indonesia is a member of several multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8, APEC, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDA_iMPSw8ApS	2024-10-21T09:49:58-07:00	
Indonesia’s Assertive Foreign Policy Under Prabowo: Balancing Reg...	Under the leadership of Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia's foreign policy is anticipated to experience a more assertive shift in response to the evolving dynamics within Southeast Asia and the broader geopolitical landscape. Historically, Indonesia has adhered to an independent and active (bebas-aktif) foreign policy, characterised by non-alignment and active participation in multilateral diplomacy. However, the increasing complexity of regional disputes, the intensifying rivalry between the United States and China, and Prabowo's defence-focused background suggest a potential departure from Indonesia’s traditionally cautious approach. This emerging strategy may result in Indonesia adopting a more proactive role within regional security frameworks, modernising its military capabilities, and leveraging its strategic geopolitical position to foster global partnerships. While this shift presents promising opportunities, it also introduces challenges related to balancing regional leadership, defence posture, and global engagement. In the context of Prabowo's likely foreign policy, a primary focus will be the establishment of Indonesia as a regional leader within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As Southeast Asia grapples with rising tensions in the South China Sea and broader security issues, Indonesia's leadership could play a pivotal role in shaping regional security frameworks. Prabowo may advocate for a more robust ASEAN that transcends consensus-based decision-making, aiming to create a more decisive body capable of addressing external threats. His previous experience as defence minister could inspire Indonesia to promote stronger military collaboration within ASEAN, including joint exercises and enhanced disaster relief capabilities, particularly in areas vulnerable to external aggression. Indonesia’s approach to the South China Sea may also become more assertive. Although it has previously avoided confrontation, Prabowo's administration might adopt a firmer stance on defending its maritime claims in the Natuna Islands. Expanding naval capabilities and increasing patrols in contested areas may signify Indonesia's determination to assert its claims, potentially positioning it as a mediator in disputes among ASEAN members and external powers. An essential component of Prabowo's foreign policy will also involve the strengthening of Indonesia's defence posture. Southeast Asian nations, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, have been modernising their military forces in response to regional threats, and Indonesia is likely to pursue a similar path. Prabowo's defence-oriented background suggests a significant emphasis on enhancing Indonesia’s military through investments in advanced technologies, including fighter jets, naval vessels, and missile defence systems. Modernising the navy and air force is critical to securing Indonesia's extensive maritime territory, particularly in light of its strategic location along major shipping routes. However, Indonesia's military modernisation will not be confined to conventional threats. Increased investments in cybersecurity and counterterrorism initiatives will be essential to address challenges posed by non-state actors. With the rise of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure in the region, Indonesia’s security apparatus is likely to prioritise the enhancement of its digital defence systems and the strengthening of collaboration with international partners for intelligence sharing. Additionally, fortifying capabilities to counter-terrorism, particularly in regions susceptible to radicalism and piracy, will complement these broader defence efforts. Indonesia's assertive foreign policy is expected to extend beyond regional concerns, with global engagement emerging as a central focus. The intensification of the US-China rivalry presents Indonesia with opportunities to leverage its non-aligned stance for strategic advantage. As the United States seeks to consolidate alliances in Asia to counterbalance China’s influence, Indonesia could assume a pivotal role in managing relations with both nations. The administration under Prabowo may pursue stronger defence ties with the United States, potentially securing military aid and participating in joint military exercises while concurrently fostering robust economic and trade relations with China. This diplomatic balancing act could enhance Indonesia’s geopolitical significance and facilitate negotiations for favourable terms in defence procurement, technology transfer, and infrastructure development. In addition to bilateral engagements, Indonesia may aspire to position itself as a mediator in managing regional disputes arising from US-China tensions. Such a role could elevate its diplomatic profile and strengthen its status as a strategic power broker in Southeast Asia. However, global engagement will not be limited to interactions with great powers. Prabowo’s administration could seek to deepen strategic partnerships with other significant global players, including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. Cultivating closer economic ties with these nations will be crucial for diversifying Indonesia’s partnerships, reducing dependency on China and the United States, and attracting foreign direct investment in critical industries such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and defence. While Prabowo’s assertive foreign policy presents considerable opportunities for Indonesia, it also poses challenges. Increased military spending may exert pressure on the nation’s budget, particularly if economic growth decelerates. Moreover, balancing Indonesia’s assertive stance in the South China Sea with its leadership role in ASEAN may prove complex, given that other member states might adopt varying approaches to managing relations with China. Overextending military ambitions, in conjunction with Indonesia’s traditional non-aligned position, may risk alienating key partners. Additionally, navigating global pressures will necessitate careful diplomacy to avoid becoming ensnared in the broader US-China conflict. In conclusion, Indonesia's assertive foreign policy under Prabowo Subianto is poised to significantly reshape its regional and global engagement strategies. By emphasizing the enhancement of regional leadership, defence modernisation, and the establishment of global partnerships, Prabowo's administration holds the potential to elevate Indonesia's standing within Southeast Asia and the broader international community. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of this policy will be contingent upon Indonesia's ability to reconcile its ambitions with the economic and diplomatic constraints it encounters. To adeptly navigate these challenges, Indonesia must prioritise regional cooperation within the ASEAN framework while concurrently bolstering its defence capabilities. Moreover, a careful and strategic diplomatic balancing act among global powers will be crucial for ensuring Indonesia's strategic autonomy and fostering sustainable growth.

NATO’s Indo-Pacific Expansion Lacks Legality And Common Sense – O...	South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand sent their defence ministers to a NATO meeting in October 2024. While their heads of state and others have attended before, this was the first time these countries’defenceministers joined. This more military-operative attendance signals that NATO is serious about its expansion into this region. From a politico-psychological angle, it also shows that expansion for the sake of expansion has become theraison d’êtreof the once-defensive alliance. NATO has been searching for such a reason to exist ever since the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact dissolved about 35 years ago, and, by all logic, it ought to have been closed down, too. The expansion happens in violation of NATO’s Treaty of 1949. That Treaty is a copy of the UN Charter, refers disputes to the UN and states (Art 5) thatmembersof the alliance are obliged to support any member should it be attacked from the outside. Today, NATO has 32members,but—incrementally and virtually without international attention—it has added 38partnercountries worldwide, including the four above-mentioned. The category 'partner' does not exist in NATO’s Treaty – neither, by the way, do things like nuclear weapons and first-use of them, interventions or bombings in non-member states like Yugoslavia at the time, Kosovo, Libya, Ukraine, etc. These activities have no legal basis in NATO’s Treaty; they areout-of-areaandout-of-treaty operations. One common sense and legal question arises: How far can an organisation deviate from its legal foundation without being investigated for possible illegal conduct – and which institution has the authority to investigate? Here is how NATO motivates its creeping expansion on its homepage: 'To enhance (their) mutual situational awareness of security developments in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, including Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies in various domains, the deepening strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia, and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula… 'Partnership network strengthens security outside NATO territory, which makes NATO itself safer.' Regrettably, NATO’s homepage does not contain any rational, empirically solid, multi-dimensional analysis that substantiates that China is a threat or 'challenge' to NATO’s members. The alliance today runs on postulates and outdatedoffensivedeterrence and defence thinking. China is a problem because it has different values and interests. It sounds increasingly like sermons to a church congregation. According to a June 2023 report by the US Congressional Research Service about US infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific, 'the United States maintains and uses at least 66 significant defense sites spread across the region.' (China has one military base worldwide in Djibouti). In addition, the costs of Western permanent – increasing – naval presence and the tremendous costs of AUKUS, the trilateral partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have increased. AUKUS Pillar 1 is about Australia acquiring nuclear-powered attack submarines and hosting such submarines from the US and UK. Pillar 2 is about intensified collaboration in these high-tech areas: undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, AI and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities and electronic warfare. But the costs of upholding a worldwide militarist empire are unimaginably high and self-destructive: US military expenditures are US $ 916 bn (at least, lots of items are not in the Pentagon budget) = 3.4% of its GDP. It is roughly as large as the next 9 top-ranking countriescombined:China US$ 296 bn/1,7% of GDP, Russia 130/6.3%, India 84/2.4%, Saudi Arabia 76/7.1%, UK 75/2.3%, Germany 67/1.5%, Ukraine 65/37%, France 61/2.1% and Japan 50/1.2% – all according to SIPRI, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Given these facts and the fact that it is the US that builds up tension against China and not the other way around – nobody threatens the West! – it is impossible to find any empirically solid reason for the US/NATO postulate that China is a threat or 'challenge.' It seems, rather, to be pathological – a psycho-political paranoia growing out of a) the subconscious but denied sense of relative decline and b) the permanent need for enemies to legitimise the existence of the out-of-democratic control MIMAC – Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex that the US has or, rather,is. Macro historical studies of empire decline point to causes such as over-militarisation, shrinking legitimacy in the eyes of others, decline on all other power dimensions but the military and – of special importance – over-extension: the empire grows beyond management/control with a declining economic carrying capacity. Since the US/NATO has already lost in more than one way in Ukraine (and all wars since Vietnam), the US may leave it (to the Europeans) and engage in yet another futile war in the Middle East – and then try to 'pivot' to Taiwan/China. But by then, the Empire and NATO will have dissolved – like its Western brother, the Soviet Union – due to self-destructive, delusional policies and emotionalism devoid of vision, rational foreign policies and diplomacy. That is – overextension, militarism and hubris. And that’s when we can hope to create a much better, peaceful and cooperative world. Remember, over the rainbow, skies are still blue. So too in the Indo-Pacific.

Killing Of Innocents By Terrorists In J&K Must End – OpEd	Coming within 48 hours of Omar Abdullah taking oath as Chief Minister of J&K union territory, it’s obvious that Friday’s targeted killing of a 30-year-old migrant labourer by terrorists in the Shopian district of South Kashmir wasn’t coincidental. This dastardly murder was clearly meant to buttress Pakistan's jaundiced view that despite large voter turnout and peaceful conduct of assembly elections in J&K, normalcy still eludes this region. Though personal details other than name of the victim are unavailable, the fact that thevictim had left his home in faraway Bihar and had come to Kashmir in search of an honest living to support his family indicates that he was indeed a very needy person. It would also be fair to assume that being an outsider preoccupied with work, he neither had the time nor inclination to delve into local politics or engage in ideological issues plaguing Kashmir. It’s thus evident that this unfortunate migrant worker was brutally killed,not for anything he had said or done, but only because he happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Besides demonstrating the complete disregard that terrorists have for human life, killing of an innocent person also completely belies claims made by Pakistan and its local proxies that such killings by ‘mujahideen’ [Islamic warriors] have religious sanction as they are part of the ongoing ‘jihad’ [holy war] in J&K. Since Islam preaches that 'the murder of one innocent person is akin to the murder of the whole of humanity,' aren’t those involved in the killing of innocents and calling themselves ‘mujahideen’ actually apostates? Similarly, aren’t those decreeing that such heinous killings are admissible in ‘jihad’ intentionally misrepresenting Islam, and are hence guilty of blasphemy? These are some pressing issues that should concern both the clergy and civil society in Kashmir. The long history of violence orchestrated by Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] in J&K has adequately exposed how low Rawalpindi can stoop in order to further its own self-serving interests. More than thirty years ago it beguiled gullible Kashmiri youth to become cannon fodder in its proxy war aimed at bleeding India through ‘a thousand cuts’ by creating the illusion that an ‘armed struggle’ would get them ‘azadi’ [freedom]. However, within no time, ISI’s unilaterally changed the goalpost by altering the very objective of the so-called ‘armed struggle’ from ‘azadi’ to merger with Pakistan. Separatist leaders who opposed Pakistan’s interference [like All Jammu and Kashmir Awami Action Committee chairman Mirwaiz Mohammad Farook and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front [JKLF] ideologue Prof Abdul Ahad Wani] were murdered, while others meekly accepted this barefaced subjugation of the Kashmiri people by Pakistan. JKLF, which initially spearheaded the so-called 'armed struggle' in J&K espoused ‘azadi’, but this objective went against Rawalpindi’s vested interests. So, ISI created a new terrorist group called Hizbul Mujahideen [HM] to propagate Kashmir's merger with Pakistan. The HM quickly decimated JKLF in a bloody turf war, andJKLF’s Pakistan based co-founder Amanullah Khan’s revelation that HM had killed more JKLF cadres than Indian security forces gives a fair idea of the humongous scale of bloodshed. On the political front, ISI orchestrated creation of All Parties Hurriyat Conference [APHC], an amalgam of separatist groups that served as its faithful minion. Consequently, the 'azadi' call gave way to the 'Kashmir banega Pakistan' [Kashmir will become part of Pakistan] slogan. The unfortunate part was that both APHC leaders and terrorist commanders who vociferously voiced their non-negotiable stand on the ‘right to self determination’ suddenly turned into staunch advocates of Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan. So, while the people of Kashmir were forced into accepting subservience toPakistan, separatist and terrorist leaders responsible for fulfillingISI's demand were suitably rewarded. The wanton violence that erupted in the early nineties turned the paradise on earth into veritable hell soaked in the blood of innocent Kashmiri men, women and children. To prevent its bluff being called out, Rawalpindi cunningly played the religion card that saw the emergence of a new question-cum-answer slogan-'Pakistan se hamara rishta kya? La illaha illallah' [What is the relation of Kashmiris with Pakistan? There’s no other God but Allah]. Islamisation of the so-called ‘Kashmir struggle’ in J&K has opened doors to religious fundamentalism. Readers would recall that in 2017, HM commander Zakir Musa had declared that 'We are fighting for 'Azadi baraye Islam [freedom for the sake of Islam].' Announcing that 'My blood will spill for Islam and not for a secular state,'he threatened to behead APHC leaders if they continued referring to the Kashmir issue as being'political in nature' and not an 'Islamic struggle.' Musa’s leaving HM and joining Al Qaida affiliate Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind [AGuH] indicates the dangers of religious radicalisation. Despite having threatened to behead APHC leaders, the crowd that turned up for his funeral was as big as what one saw during the funeral of HM poster boy Burhan Wani. Theextraordinary public popularity for the AGuH chief espousing Al Qaida's skewed Quranic interpretations is indeed something that should have worried the intelligentsia and civil society in Kashmir, but there are no such indications. Even before one could overcome the shock of Friday’s cold blooded murder of a migrant worker in Shopian, terrorists struck once again on Sunday. Shooting indiscriminately at a group of labourers working on a tunnel project in Gund area of South Kashmir’s Ganderbal district when they were returning to their camp after completing the day’s work, the terrorists killed one local doctor and six immigrant workers while seriously injured five others. It seems that Pakistan army’s proxy war has either dulled sensitivities of the Kashmiri people towards unprovoked violence in J&K or forced them to become mute onlookers. The ongoing trend of civilians having no connection whatsoever with the Kashmir issue being murdered just to keep Rawalpindi in good humour by keeping thepot boiling in Kashmir, can easily spiral out of control and adversely impact the fragile peace that’s slowly returning in Kashmir. This can’t be allowed to happen. So, it’s time people of Kashmir demand that the killers tell them the compelling reasons for committing such unpardonable acts of extreme brutality against innocent civilians thatbrazenly violate Islamic teachings? Most importantly, it’s time Kashmiris became more discerning and by displaying assertiveness, reject Pakistani interference and take control of things themselves. They need to understand that killing innocent civilians in J&K solely serves Rawalpindi's perverse intentions, which is vitiating the peaceful environment in Kashmir and making life for locals. This must end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDCmdSelTbTQK	2024-10-21T09:44:32-07:00	
Zelensky’s So-Called ‘Victory Plan’ In A New Bottle – OpEd	Victory can still win the war so the US and the West need to send additional military aid and loosen the restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons in its possession.' In nutshell is the so-called Zelensky's self-proclaimed 'Victory Plan,' in a New Bottle repeatedly put across to Ukraine’s allies. The world knows who can win. The Russians have the advantage. Putin has a larger Army with a more war waging capability and resources. However, all of this doesn't necessarily guarantee Victory —what the Russian army has in materiel advantages, it lacks in the quality of motivational command to lead with a cause. Having said that Russia's tactical gains over the last few months have left no option to Victory but to withdraw further west. The facts on the ground, include a slow but steady Russian advance with the Ukrainian army suffering high attrition rates. Zelensky knows all of this, and so is this Zelensky's self-proclaimed 'Victory Plan,' which the Ukrainian president has been preaching and boasting of dependent on the US-NATO ally’s support! The hard truth is that the US or the West does not see anything original or innovative in it. The 'Victory Plan' is less a 'Plan' and more a continuation of Zelensky's lobbying campaign to keep US and the Western arms flowing in. Zelenskyy has presented his so-called victory plan to the Ukrainian parliament, President Biden and EU leaders aimed at seeking a just peace to the war with Russia thanks to aid and guarantees from its allies. Zelensky now talks of 'Peace' more frequently than ever. Zelensky's interpretation of a peace process is through his so-called 'Victory Plan' is that 'If we start now and follow the Victory Plan, we can end this war no later than next year.' Zelensky’s Five Point Plan in brief: Invitation to join NATO Even though actual membership is still an issue for the future, an invitation to join would send a strong signal to Russian President Putin. Member countries have committed to Kyiv’s 'irreversible' path to membership but haven't issued an actual invitation. However, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte reiterated that Russia had no role in deciding if Ukraine should be in NATO. More Weapons with No Restrictions on their Use Ukraine’s request at ending all restrictions on the use of donated weapons to strike inside Russia and help from allies in shooting down missiles and drones over Ukrainian territory. For the Western fears of crossing Kremlin red lines Zelensky argued that Ukraine's advance into Russia's Kursk region shows that Putin doesn't have enough strength. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has cautioned 'If the decision to lift restrictions is really taken, that will mean that from that moment NATO countries will be conducting direct war with Russia a nuclear power.' Deterrence Ukraine proposes to deploy on its soil a comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package that will be sufficient to protect Ukraine from any military threat from Russia. Strategic economic potential Ukraine proposes partners from the EU and US sign a special agreement on common use of Ukraine’s critical resources, like lithium, gas, titanium and others, and produce energy together in the future. Post-war perspectives Ukraine would bolster European security with its battle-hardened military by replacing certain military contingents of the US armed forces stationed in Europe. A Very Ambitious Plan: Some of the Ukrainian MPs felt it was a very ambitious plan. 'The plan looks like others need to do everything for us.' 'On one hand, the plan sounds like a fantasy. On the other hand, Patriot, Storm Shadow, and F-16s used to sinking of a large part of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and the control of a piece of Kursk. Everything depends on the decisions of partners and the success of our diplomacy.' Lozynskyisaid. However, he added that Zelenskyy 'did not explain how he plans to achieve the implementation of these points.' UN Warns of Transfer of Weapons to Ukraine-Russia High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said on 13 September 2024,that the provision of military assistance and transfer of arms and ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces have continuedin the context of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in violation of the UN Charter and of international law. Shipments reportedly included such heavy conventional weapons as tanks, armoured combat vehicles and aircraft, helicopters, large-caliber artillery and missile systems and uncrewed combat aerial vehicles alongside remotely operated munitions, small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. She also pointed to reports of States transferring, or planning to transfer, weapons such as uncrewed aerial vehicles, ballistic missiles and ammunition to the Russian armed forces and that these weapons have been used and are likely to be used in Ukraine. But, No one is listening to the UN or on Disarmament issues. Zelensky now repeatedly emphasizes Kyiv’s readiness to negotiate an 'End to the War.' The Victory Plan is based on US-NATO Western allies of their military assistance. ‘Victory’ towards ‘Peace’ has to be on your own strengths and not depend totally on Western support. Zelensky in an interview has hinted at one overreaching message: 'Ukraine is fighting a war not only with Western backing but on behalf of the West. The idea is to ensure that Ukraine gets iron-clad security guarantees from its allies and is well armed to prevent Russia to attack again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2CkMiEAHD5Qpt	2024-10-21T09:43:16-07:00	
Young People Do Not Want A Future With Looming Threat Of Antimicr...	Who would we ever want to deal with infections that are difficult (or impossible) to treat! Young people are right when they call on world leaders to ensure a future where antimicrobial resistance is no longer a threat to global health security and food security. 'When I was a pharmacy student, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) used to be an abstract concept to me. I was taught about AMR and how to identify it by using drug susceptibility test, and how to look at the resistance pattern among other parts of our curriculum. But when I started working as a pharmacist, I saw more and more patients who were dealing with microbes resistant to medicines. AMR was no longer something I learnt about in school but a major challenge I need to deal with because patients rely on us to tell them what medications they can take. When we look at tests, then often we realise that they may have one or two options left of medicines that can respond (as they could be resistant to all other medicines for the disease they have),' said Dr Audrey Wong, Chairperson of Quadripartite Working Group for Young Engagement on AMR. Quadripartite is a historic alliance comprising four global agencies that have come together to address AMR: global UN agency on human health (World Health Organization – WHO), global UN agency on food and agriculture (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations – FAO), global UN agency on the environment (United Nations Environment Programme – UNEP), and World Organisation for Animal Health – WOAH. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the top 10 global health threats today. It is associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths annually, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. AMR affects human health, animal health, plants and also our environment. Without a stronger response to prevent AMR, there would be an estimated average loss of 1.8 years of life expectancy globally by 2035. Financially, AMR would cost the world US$ 412 billion a year in additional healthcare costs and US$ 443 billion per year in lost workforce productivity. In addition to causing deaths, which are projected to increase to 10 million a year by 2050, other expected impacts of AMR include increased morbidity due to infectious diseases, longer hospital stays, escalation of health expenditure, a fall in agricultural productivity (when food security worldwide is already threatened by the dire consequences of the climate crisis) and poor animal health and welfare, exacerbating animal suffering and loss. Dr Audrey Wong was speaking with CNS (Citizen News Service, a founding member of Global AMR Media Alliance or GAMA) on the sidelines of the historic second-ever United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR. A political declaration was endorsed by heads of nations which is many shades stronger than the one adopted 8 years ago at a similar meet. AMR affects our animals too We at CNS also spoke with Karina Khatic, a final year Veterinary student from Trinidad and Tobago who currently serves as a trustee member of the International Veterinary Students' Association which focuses on all aspects of veterinary medicine, including One Health. She is also a part of the Quadripartite Working Group for Youth Engagement on AMR. 'We are so proud to get space to share our voices on AMR [at the UNGA HLM on AMR and other such spaces] and how AMR affects us and risks our present and future. We will continue to call for a change till the AMR threat looms,' said Karina. 'I am a veterinarian, and I work with animals of so many species. AMR can also affect our animals. It is important to remember that AMR does not just affect human beings but also animals. So, we the veterinarians and others involved in animal health and livestock need to be aware and do what-we-can-do (and what we know works) to reduce misuse and overuse of medicines in our sector,' said Karina. She added: 'AMR is a challenge not limited to one sector like human health, but its threat is looming over many other sectors, such as animal health and livestock, food and agriculture, and our environment. We need to engage and work collaboratively with many other sectors to prevent AMR with One Health approach - that is key.' Misuse and overuse of medicines is rampant in human health, animal health and livestock, food and agriculture, and reaches our environment too. That is why One Health approach remains the bedrock to advance progress towards effective prevention of AMR. 'There needs to be more awareness. The accessibility to medicines is far from ideal in my country,' Karina said. Unless ALL people have access to timely and accurate diagnostics (for all diseases, infectious and non-communicable diseases alike), and linkage to standard treatment, care and support, how can we avert AMR? In addition, standard infection control practices in all healthcare settings, communities and homes and universal access to vaccines for vaccination-preventable diseases is key. We must keep disease prevention in a people-centred and rights-based gender transformative manner as mainstay. Agrees Karina: 'We need people-centred responses to AMR. This includes people-centred communications around AMR because we do not have to engage only medical professionals but a range of other sectors and communities.' Agrees Dr Audrey too: 'A lot of times AMR may seem like a big and complex thing for a lot of people, but in fact it is not. AMR can affect anyone! There is a lot what a person can do at an individual level to reduce the risk of AMR: like washing hands and maintaining sanitation and hygiene, getting vaccinated, preparing food safely, among others', says Dr Audrey. Youth manifesto Dr Audrey mentions an important youth-led organising earlier this year which led to the launch of a youth manifesto in lead up to this high-level meet of world leaders on AMR. The preamble of youth manifesto called for: - Meaningful youth engagement in policy, advocacy and programme implementation to achieve integration into local and national AMR action plans. - Fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration to establish capacity-building initiatives and mentorship programmes to enable youth-led actions against AMR at national, regional and global levels. - Encouraging countries and key stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and institutions, to address the AMR priorities and to include youth in co-creating their strategic plans on AMR. - Ensuring One Health approach remains the bedrock for advancing progress to combating AM Social media and AMR Social media campaigns have been very impactful in getting more attention to AMR. AMR, which is often looked as a very medicalised issue, fails to connect with non-medical people. The response to stopping misuse and overuse of medicines has to be rooted in the communities - and communications of which has to take diversity of the communities in account. 'AMR is like a very medical term and it can be really hard to understand and to relate to for a lot of people,' said Dr Audrey Wong. 'That is why we use diverse approaches to reach out to people- for videos we used TikTok, we used story books, among other tools. We also tried to put spotlight via our story book that links malaria with AMR.' AMR survivors breathe life to 'AMR is invisible. I am not' A powerful and potentially game-changing campaign: AMR is invisible. I am not' has helped humanise the AMR epidemic - which continues to take lives as well as increase human suffering. Audrey believes that even individuals can take their own small steps to help mitigate the threat of AMR. Along with it, we must push for stronger national action plans to reduce and prevent the AMR threat. 'It is always about what we all can do (to prevent AMR).' Promises made by world leaders at UNGA HLM on AMR 2024 World leaders at the 79th United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR adopted a political declaration which has concrete targets. Some of these promises include: * Reducing the global deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance by 10% by 2030 against the 2019 baseline of 4.95 million deaths * 100% countries having basic water, sanitation, hygiene and waste services in all healthcare facilities and 90% of countries meeting all WHO minimum requirements for infection prevention and control programmes at the national level by 2030 * At least 80% of countries can test resistance in all bacterial and fungal pathogens included in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) by 2030 * Ensure, by 2030, that all countries have developed or updated and are implementing multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance with national targets informed by analysis of existing capacities and priorities * Strive to meaningfully reduce, by 2030, the quantity of antimicrobials used globally in the agrifood system from the current level.

Who Is Responsible For Obstructions In The UNHRC, Geneva? – OpEd	Tamil activists have participated in the UN human rights process since July 1983 - activists from the South since 1990. Then, only twice a year - the UN Human Rights Commission in March followed by the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights in August. But when Kofi Annan was UN Secretary-General, in 2006, the UN Human Rights Council – UNHRC was established in place of the Commission with various changes. Meanwhile, the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights was named the 'Advisory Committee'. Even though, since 1983, Tamil activists presented injustices committed against the people in the North and East to the members of the UN Human Rights Commission and the Sub-Commission, these institutions never considered the massacres, disappearances, arrests, torture, economic destruction were an important issue in the eyes of the UN. Soon after massive disappearances in the South in 1988-1990, a few politicians from the South attended the Human Rights Commission in the early 1990s. Following Mullivaikaal, since 2012, nine resolutions have been passed consecutively on Sri Lanka in the UNHRC. The first resolution in May 2009 was initiated by Sri Lanka for their benefit, exactly a week after the atrocities in Mullivaikkal. Even though many pogroms were carried out against Tamils on the island from the 1950s, with the support of the ruling governments – it was only after 1977 that the authorities appointed investigative committees and commissions. This was to eye-wash the international community. Failed commissions None of the investigations found justice for the victims. Here are a few examples of failed Commissions and Inquiries: (1) Sansoni Commission – 9 November 1977, Report published 2 July 1980. (2) Report of Presidential Truth Commission on Racial Violence (1981-84), published. (3) France M. S. April (MSF) Report of inquiry into Palambiti-Ranai road attack on vehicle released 9 May 1991. (4) Kokkaticholi Commission of Inquiry appointed 18 June 1991, report released 9 March 1992. (5) 1991-93 Presidential commissions, involuntary arrests of victims from their residences by unknown persons. Report not published. (6) President D.P. Commission appointed by Wijetunga on 13 September 1993. Report not published. (7) 1994 Commission of Inquiry on Disappeared Persons, appointed 30 November 1994. Report published September 1997. (8) Batalanda Commission, December 1995. (9) 1998 All Sri Lanka Commission on Disappeared Persons appointed 30 April 1998, report March 2001 Issued. (10) Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnicity – Appointed 23 July 2001, report released September 2002. (11) Bintunuwewa Commission – to investigate the killing of 28 Tamil youths between the ages of 14 and 23. Appointed March 2001 and report issued. (12) International Committee on Independence of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) - Appointed November 2006. Report not issued. The international community will know that its international members were humiliated by the then government of Sri Lanka. Resolutions passed The following numbers of countries cast their vote in favour of Sri Lanka during the UNHRC resolutions: 2009 2012 2013 2014 2015 2017 2019 2021 2022 22* 15 13 12 (No voting) 11 07 *The resolution passed on 26 May 2009 was in favour of Sri Lanka, with the support of India. According to some UN diplomats, 'This was a fraudulent move by Sri Lanka in the UNHRC'. At that time, Sri Lanka and India falsely promised member countries that, as the communiqué of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there would be an investigation into everything that took place in Mullivaikkal. This caused 22 member countries to cast their votes in favour of Sri Lanka. However, it is worth noting that over 25 countries out of 47 members did not favour this resolution. Some of them neither participated nor abstained from voting - some were not even present in the session. After many years of heavy lobbying by Tamil activists in the UNHRC, the international community came forward to look into the accusation of genocide, crimes against humanity, and human rights abuses of people in the North East. However, some unknown and incomprehensible obstacles began to centre on the UNHRC. Although Tamil activists have been acting with facts and working with dedication, UN diplomats' value information from international human rights organisations more than from Tamil organisations and victims. Who are they? Apart from our observations, some diplomats alerted us, and lately, we felt that we were unable to move anything forward in the UNHRC for unknown reasons. Now, more than fifteen years have passed, and the victims have found no justice. When some member countries wanted to take some initiative to find justice for the victims, they found that unknown sources had created some hidden obstacles. It's a mystery. This prompts me to share certain information regarding the dilemma in the UNHRC. Since 2000, especially in 2002, following the ceasefire between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, some people from an important Western country raised their heads as a group, in deciding the fate of the victims. This group operates from a country where whichever political party comes into office implements what they pre-planned concerning Sri Lanka. They are not only from the West; there are also a few Sri Lankans. Those days, some of these individuals visited Sri Lanka and went to war-torn Vanni. Also, they are very close to some important politicians and popular NGO activists in Sri Lanka. These people are very close with some Tamil diaspora and with locals, gathering information for their distorting task. They are known as members of civil society, but from which NGO is questionable. If you observe this group, some come to Geneva in the morning and return in the evening, while others visit Geneva depending on their agenda, especially to brainwash Tamil activists. Even though they are not seen much in the UNHRC, they closely watch everything concerning Sri Lanka. It is not possible to know their roots. But, it has been revealed that they have already done many subversive tasks in Sri Lanka! Mystery While all the UN Human Rights Commissioners and stakeholders have issued many important statements and reports, this group's continuous interference has suppressed every effort in the UNHRC, causing more disappointment to the victims. These mysterious individuals do not work with any international human rights organisations, but they seem to control their activities regarding Sri Lanka. Due to this group's arbitrary move, Resolution 51/1 passed in 2022, which was supposed to be developed into a strong resolution in the 57th session, has gone to the dogs. No valid reason was given, and the period for formulating a specific resolution was prolonged until September 2025 – the 60thsession of the UNHRC. Now the question is, who are these people - for whom are they working? It seems that they are not bothered about the history of Sri Lanka/Tamils or the root cause of the conflict in Sri Lanka. British Tamils No matter who it is, nothing can be achieved by ignoring these unknown individuals in the UNHRC. Tamil is the oldest language in the world, and it has thousands of proverbs/expressions that convey a long message in two lines. For example: in Tamil 'நம்ப நட, நம்பி நடப்பதே', in English, 'Allow others to trust you, but don't trust others'. Another Tamil proverb says, 'நீண்ட நாள் திருடன் ஒரு நாள் அகப்படுவான்'. In English: 'Long-time thieves will be caught one day'. This is the present situation concerning Sri Lanka in the UNHRC. However, there are three countries very well aware of the political aspirations of the people in the North and East. They were the colonial rulers of Sri Lanka: Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. During the rule of Portugal and the Netherlands, the Tamils remained in their separate kingdom in their homeland, the North East. After these two, during British rule, the Tamil Kingdom remained separate until 1833. Unfortunately, the British amalgamated the Tamil Kingdom with the other two kingdoms in 1833, marking the beginning of the conflict in Sri Lanka. President of France Therefore, the Tamil diaspora in the United Kingdom must remind the British of their mistake and duty. This is the way to safeguard the Tamil nation in Sri Lanka. The Tamils in the UK maintain good relationships with the government in power, with Labour and the Conservatives. I hope the world has heard by now that French President Emmanuel Macron's greeting message to the President of Sri Lanka was in Tamil. The reason is obvious. During Chandrika's presidency, she used all her French political influence to work against the Tamil activists in France. However, this didn't work in her favour, as France is for neutrality. Therefore, the British Tamil diaspora has a huge responsibility and obligation to motivate the British government and the people to understand the grievances of the Tamils caused by the British.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2ClsnRWG5shN0	2024-10-21T09:40:06-07:00	
Global Powers And The Israeli-Lebanese Conflict: A Call For Coord...	The Israeli-Lebanese conflict, particularly the escalating hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, has reached a critical juncture in recent months. The violence, exacerbated by Israel’s extensive aerial bombardments of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers, poses a substantial threat not only to the fragile political stability of Lebanon but also to the broader geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. This situation necessitates urgent and more assertive intervention from the international community. Major global powers, including the United States, Russia, and China, must adopt a resolute approach to enforce international law, exert diplomatic pressure, and mitigate further escalation. This essay analyzes how these powers may influence the trajectory of the conflict and emphasizes the necessity of coordinated involvement to achieve enduring peace in the region. Israel’s recent military operations, specifically the intensified airstrikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, have resulted in considerable civilian casualties and extensive damage to Lebanese infrastructure. The violence has led to the displacement of communities, disruption of livelihoods, and exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis in a nation already experiencing economic collapse. Israel’s military actions have raised serious concerns regarding violations of international legal standards, particularly following an attack that injured several UN peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon to promote regional security and prevent hostilities. This escalation has provoked international condemnation; regrettably, global initiatives to address the crisis have been, at best, tepid. The United States, a long-standing ally of Israel, has exhibited notable ambivalence in its response to the ongoing hostilities. While the United States continues to provide political and military support to Israel, it has been reticent to unequivocally denounce actions that contravene international law, including assaults on UN peacekeepers. This inconsistency undermines the United States’ credibility as a mediator and peace facilitator in the Middle East. The U.S. must adopt a more transparent and assertive position. By exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Israel to adhere to international law—particularly regarding the protection of peacekeeping personnel—the United States could assume a pivotal role in de-escalating the conflict. Should Israel persist in its disregard for international standards, the U.S. should advocate for sanctions or even contemplate initiating Israel’s suspension from certain United Nations entities, thereby signalling that noncompliance will have serious repercussions.In contrast to the United States, Russia and China exert significant influence over Hezbollah's primary supporter, Iran, and possess the capacity to shape the dynamics of the conflict from an alternative perspective. Both Moscow and Beijing maintain strategic relationships with Tehran, which has robust connections to Hezbollah, thereby providing financial and military assistance. Russia and China have vested interests in promoting regional stability to safeguard their geopolitical and economic priorities in the Middle East. Consequently, they are positioned to apply pressure on Iran to moderate Hezbollah's actions and pursue diplomatic resolutions rather than military confrontations. By leveraging their influence, Russia and China could facilitate a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel, which is a critical step toward broader peace negotiations. A collaborative effort involving the United States, Russia, and China is essential for establishing a balanced approach to the conflict. Each of these global powers possesses the capacity to bring their respective allies—Israel and Hezbollah—to the negotiating table. Although their interests may diverge, a common emphasis on reducing regional instability could encourage cooperation. Furthermore, such collaboration could help ensure that neither side dominates the peace process, which is vital for achieving a sustainable resolution. This balanced approach would not only mitigate the immediate crisis but also lay the groundwork for long-term stability in Lebanon and the broader Middle East. International law must be central to efforts aimed at resolving the conflict. Israel's attacks on UN peacekeepers contravene international agreements, including protocols governing the protection of peacekeeping forces. The United Nations must undertake decisive action by investigating these violations and holding all parties accountable, including Hezbollah for its provocations. If Israel persists in breaching international norms, stronger enforcement mechanisms, such as sanctions or suspension from key international bodies, should be considered. These measures would underscore the importance of compliance with international law and delineate the consequences of defiance. The path to peace in Lebanon is fraught with challenges; however, coordinated international pressure, particularly from the United States, Russia, and China, could prove pivotal. The United States must move beyond its ambivalence and spearhead initiatives to hold Israel accountable for aligning its actions with international law. Concurrently, Russia and China should diplomatically engage with Iran and Hezbollah, offering incentives for the cessation of hostilities and participation in peacebuilding efforts. In conclusion, the Israeli-Lebanese conflict constitutes a significant flashpoint within the Middle East, necessitating immediate international attention. The failure of the United States, Russia, and China to synchronize their diplomatic efforts has exacerbated the situation as hostilities continue to escalate. Moving forward requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from the international community, which should hold violators of international law accountable and promote diplomatic resolutions. A balanced approach that underscores the importance of peace and regional stability is essential to mitigating the risk of a broader conflict. Global powers must seize this moment to avert further bloodshed and work collaboratively toward a sustainable resolution in Lebanon.

Mahdi, Tawid, And A Hot Hot Planet – OpEd	Humanity has thrown the global water cycle off balance 'for the first time in human history,' fueling agrowing water disasterthat will wreak havoc on economies, food production and lives. The water cycle refers to the complex system by which water moves around Planet Earth. Decades of destructive land use and water mismanagement have collided with thehuman-caused climate crisisto put 'unprecedented stress' on the global water cycle, said a report published in mid October 2024 by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water. The water crisis threatens more than 50% of global food production, and risks shaving an average of 8% off countries' GDPs by 2050, with much higher losses of up to 15% projected in low-income countries. Ex-president Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle the Biden administration's 'green new scam' in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. He vowed to boost production of fossil fuels; oil, natural gas and coal, and repeal key parts of the Biden 2022 climate law. During his first term in office, Trump dismantled much of the groundwork laid by his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump rolled back nearly 100 different environmental rules and regulations on air pollution, carbon emissions and toxic substances. When voters go to the polls on 5 November, they'll likely be locking in four years of vastly different climate change policy. Don't forget the summer 2024 was Planet Earth's hottest on record. Phoenix climbed over a scorching 110 degrees on 80 days in 2024 -- shattering last year's record of 55 days of temperatures over 110 degrees. But even more dangerous is that scientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have foundthe Thwaites Glacierin Antarctica is melting at an accelerating rate and could be on an irreversible path to collapse, spellingcatastrophefor globalsea level rise. Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet and its collapse could ultimately lead to an 8-10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands. New heat records come amid 13 months in a row of record-breaking temperatures on Earth; not just over land,but in the oceans too. Before 2023, the record highest temperature was 16.8 °C, set in August 2016. Since mid-2023, the planet has broken that 2016 threshold 58 times. Jews and Muslims must concentrate on the challenges facing our world. Both Islam and Judaism teach their followers to take care of the earth. Muslims and Jews also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardshipand khalifah) off our planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. If humans will not reduce man made carbon magnification, not even the coming of Mahdi and Messiahs may be able to overcome human unwillingness to reverse human pollution. God demands that humans fulfill their God given responsibilities. The total economic losses caused by natural disasters hit an estimated $72 billion in the first half of 2022, fueled by storms and floods, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re estimated. And according to a 2020 Oxfam report, the richest 10% of the global population produce half of the Earth's fossil-fuel emissions, while the poorest half contribute a mere 10%. And for the first time in two decades, there are now more closed autocracies than liberal democracies in the world according to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem Institute) at the University of Gothenburg. The democratic melting decline has taken place globally, and an increasing number of people are living in closed autocracies. The level ofdemocracyenjoyed by the average world citizen in 2022 is back to 1986 levels. This means that 72 percent of the world's population, 5.7 billion people, now live under authoritarian rule. Liberal democracies do not automatically overcome autocracies. Democracies must be supported and defended. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strand. Islam anticipates the end to the world as we know it, a final historical confrontation between the forces of good and evil; after which human life will be transformed in a positive way. Many Islamic traditions (Ahadith) say that Prophet Jesus, will return and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against a false messiah, the cruel one eyed Dajjal, called Armilos in Jewish tradition. Now would be a good time for one or more Messianic figures to get to work. What does the Muslim Mahdi do? Shortly before the Day of Judgment, when commanded by God, al-Mahdi will return to lead the forces of righteousness against the forces of evil in an apocalyptic war that would ultimately establish peace and justice on earth, according to Shia believers. 'He will fill the earth with equity and justice, and will rule for seven years.' (Abu Dawud) How does the Jewish Messiah fit in with this? Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) But Prophet Zechariah also envisions a future time when God helps humans establish worldwide peace. All the nations in the world then may travel to Makkah and Jerusalem to worship God in peace. It is important for Muslims to realize that during this prophesied future Hajj Sukkot, the future city of Jerusalem (without a physically rebuilt Temple) will welcome both Jews and non-Jews, just as it did in the days when Prophet David (before King Solomon built the Temple) wrote in his Zabur: 'I rejoiced with those who said to me, 'Let us go up to the house of the LORD...There the (12) tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 122:1-4) Orthodox Jews still pray for the ancient Temple to be rebuilt. But the more numerous Reform Jews stopped doing that two centuries ago. The place is holy; not the building, think the great majority of Jews today who are not Orthodox Jews. And Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) Just as the Kaa'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). But a Muslim shrine, called The Dome of the Rock, as well as a mosque, the Masjid al-Aqsa, stand on the Temple Mount presently. The Dome of the Rock is regarded by Muslims as the third holiest site in the world. Any attempt to replace it or the Masjid al-Aqsa would provoke Muslims to a war of cataclysmic proportions. But a three dimensional virtual reality Jewish broadcast station could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock some 650 feet away from the Masjid al-Aqsa provided Muslims would cooperate. As a Reform Rabbi who believes that the world wide upheavals we see are part of the birth pains of the Messianic Age, I offer Christians and Muslims some more positive insights from the Jewish Prophets and the Rabbinic Sages. Many millions of Jews, Christians and Muslims believe the wars of GogandMagog(Gogu-Magog in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) which started in the 18th to 20th centuries will come to an end in the 21st century. It is true that human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 250 years than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the future with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation?Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Jews, whose Biblical prophets were the ones who first wrote about a future Messianic Age, recognize that the birth of a Messianic Age must be preceded by its birth-pangs. But the prophets of Israel also emphasize the glories of a future world living in peace and prosperity with justice for all. Ancient Jewish prophecies did proclaim that there would be an end to the world as we know it.But they did not prophesy that the world will come to an end, nor did the Prophets of Israel offer an exact date for the transition. The exact advent of the Messianic Age is not knowable because humans have free will and thus the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we humans do. The beginning of the Messianic Age is a time of transition from one World Age into another. How we move through this transition, either with resistance or acceptance, will determine whether the transformation will happen through cataclysmic changes or by a gradual reform of human society; which will lead to a world filled with peace, prosperity and spiritual tranquility. The Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the Jewish community.This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah.The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves have helped bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come about through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps and most obvious of all climate change which will affect both nature and the economy-society. The Messiah (Mahdi) refers to one or more human agents of God who help bring about a non-destruction positive transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (together with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a human being, a descendant of Prophets Abraham and David, with great qualities of national leadership similar to Prophets Moses and Mohammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Islamic 1400s we are now living in, is the age of the coming of Hazrat Mahdi. Prophet Jesus will also return to Earth in this century. As Prophet Micah states: 'In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; and exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'The Torah will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken. All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we (Jews, Christians and Muslims) will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.' (Prophet Micah 4:1-5) One of the signs of the End of Days is the arrival and defeat of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, countries and catastrophic acts of nature. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists, who near the time of the end of days will penetrate into every part of the world. The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 centuries later as Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for generations. Thus, humanity has so far passed through the most devastating era of human history. However, we have not yet reached the goal of the Messianic Age when 'They (all nations) will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken.' (Prophet Micah 4:2-4) As the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearest to being God-fearing.' (5:8) This era will come when Israelis and Palestinians make a long lasting two state partnership of peace; thus fulfilling the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.On thatdayIsrael will joina three-party alliance with Egyptand Assyria,a blessing uponthe heart.The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'... (Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2Cpg1RqszP0yr	2024-10-21T09:36:57-07:00	
Strengthening Democracy And Justice: The Role Of Constitutional C...	The establishment of constitutional courts represents a significant advancement in the legal and political landscape of any nation. These specialized judicial bodies are tasked with interpreting and upholding the Constitution, thereby ensuring that the rule of law prevails, citizens' rights are protected, and democracy is nurtured. In countries like Germany, Russia, Italy, France, and the United States, constitutional courts play a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of power among branches of government and safeguarding individual freedoms. Pakistan's journey since its independence in 1947 has been marked by political upheaval and inconsistent democratic governance. The judiciary, while a critical player in maintaining the rule of law, has often faced challenges related to independence and effectiveness. The demand for constitutional courts stems from the need for a dedicated mechanism to address constitutional issues and protect the rights of citizens. Pakistan's Constitution, adopted in 1973, enshrines fundamental rights and delineates the structure of government. However, the lack of a specialized body to interpret and enforce these provisions has led to instances of executive overreach and legislative impropriety. The establishment of constitutional courts could provide a solution by offering a forum dedicated solely to constitutional matters. The establishment of constitutional courts specifically designed to handle constitutional issues could address these challenges effectively. These courts would focus on interpreting and enforcing the Constitution, ensuring that the rule of law prevails, and protecting citizens’ rights. By dedicating resources and expertise to constitutional law, Pakistan can enhance its judicial performance and create a more reliable legal framework. Constitutional courts can serve as guardians of democracy by ensuring that all laws and governmental actions comply with the Constitution. By providing a venue for the adjudication of constitutional issues, these courts can check legislative and executive overreach, thereby reinforcing the balance of power among institutions. In recent years, political polarization has severely undermined democratic processes in Pakistan. Constitutional courts can act as impartial arbiters in political disputes, helping to resolve contentious issues such as electoral disputes and the legality of government actions. This could restore faith in democratic institutions and processes, enabling citizens to participate in governance with confidence. A robust constitutional court system would ensure that the rule of law is upheld in Pakistan. By interpreting constitutional provisions consistently, these courts can provide clear guidelines for the application of laws, reducing ambiguity and arbitrariness. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their status or position, are held accountable under the law. Moreover, by establishing precedents in constitutional interpretation, these courts can create a framework that helps lower courts and legal practitioners navigate complex constitutional issues. This not only enhances the quality of judicial decisions but also fosters a culture of legal predictability, essential for promoting business, investment, and overall societal stability. One of the most critical roles of constitutional courts would be to protect citizens' fundamental rights. Pakistan's Constitution enshrines various rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, and religion. However, the enforcement of these rights has often been inconsistent, leading to widespread violations and public disillusionment. Constitutional courts can provide a dedicated platform for individuals to challenge violations of their rights. By adjudicating cases involving human rights abuses, these courts would not only offer remedies to victims but also deter future violations by holding perpetrators accountable. This could significantly improve the overall human rights landscape in Pakistan, promoting a more just and equitable society. In addition to protecting civil liberties, constitutional courts can address broader socioeconomic rights, such as the right to education, health, and social security. By interpreting these rights within the constitutional framework, these courts can compel the state to fulfill its obligations toward marginalized and disadvantaged groups. This focus on socioeconomic rights could also lead to more equitable policies and resource allocation, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive the support they need. As a result, constitutional courts could play a transformative role in fostering social justice and reducing disparities in Pakistan. Pakistan's political landscape has often been marred by conflicts between various institutions, such as the executive, legislature, and judiciary. These disputes not only hinder effective governance but also erode public confidence in institutions. Constitutional courts can serve as mediators in these conflicts, providing authoritative interpretations of constitutional provisions that delineate the powers and responsibilities of different branches of government. By clarifying jurisdictional boundaries, constitutional courts can prevent encroachment by one institution into the domain of another. This would enhance cooperation among institutions and promote a culture of mutual respect, essential for a functional democracy. In addition to resolving disputes, constitutional courts can promote accountability among institutions by adjudicating cases related to abuses of power. By holding institutions accountable for their actions, these courts can deter corruption and malfeasance, reinforcing the public's trust in governance. Moreover, the establishment of constitutional courts can encourage institutions to adopt more transparent practices, as they will be aware that their actions can be scrutinized by an independent judiciary. This could foster a culture of accountability and integrity within Pakistan's political and administrative systems. One of the most significant advantages of constitutional courts is their potential to establish consistent legal precedents. By providing authoritative interpretations of constitutional provisions, these courts can create a body of jurisprudence that guides lower courts and legal practitioners in future cases. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that similar cases are treated similarly, fostering fairness and justice in the legal system. Drawing inspiration from the experiences of constitutional courts in countries like Germany, the United States, Italy, France, and Russia, Pakistan can create a framework that not only safeguards fundamental rights but also promotes accountability and civic engagement. However, realizing this vision will require overcoming significant challenges, including ensuring judicial independence, raising public awareness, and building the capacity of the judiciary. As Pakistan continues its journey toward a more democratic and just society, the establishment of constitutional courts can serve as a beacon of hope, ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected, and the rule of law prevails. In a nation where political turmoil has often overshadowed the aspirations of its people, constitutional courts can provide the necessary foundation for a brighter future built on justice, equality, and democratic governance. Furthermore, constitutional courts can play a vital role in protecting fundamental rights, addressing socioeconomic disparities, and promoting accountability among institutions. By fostering a culture of legal predictability and clarity, they can enhance public trust in the judiciary and democratic institutions. As Pakistan navigates its complex political landscape, the introduction of constitutional courts could mark a significant turning point. By prioritizing constitutionalism and the rule of law, Pakistan can move towards a more just, equitable, and democratic society, where the rights and freedoms of every citizen are upheld and protected.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3WTUo6Khsq2P	2024-10-21T09:33:02-07:00	
Building A Lasting Peace Between Azerbaijan And Armenia – OpEd	The prospect of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a long and challenging journey, but there is cautious optimism as both sides inch closer to a formal peace agreement. After years of conflict, over 80% of the peace treaty draft has already been agreed upon, a remarkable achievement considering the deep divisions that have defined relations between the two countries for decades. Yet, the unresolved issues that remain are of paramount importance, particularly the presence of Armenia’s territorial claims against Azerbaijan enshrined in its constitution and legal documents. Azerbaijan has made it clear that peace cannot be built on unstable ground. As long as Armenia maintains legal provisions that imply territorial ambitions over Azerbaijan, true peace remains elusive. It is not just a matter of signing a document; Azerbaijan insists that for any agreement to be genuine, Armenia must commit to revising or removing these claims from its constitution. Without such a move, peace would be fragile, merely a pause in hostilities rather than a sustainable resolution. Baku’s position is not one of obstinacy, but of prudence. Azerbaijan seeks not a temporary ceasefire but a durable and comprehensive peace that will ensure long-term stability in the South Caucasus. The recent history of the region, marred by violence, occupation, and immense suffering, underscores the necessity for a peace that addresses the root causes of the conflict. Azerbaijan cannot afford to settle for a peace that leaves fundamental issues unresolved. The hurdles to peace are not confined to legal texts. Another significant obstacle is Armenia’s ongoing militarization. Over the past year, Armenia has accelerated its military buildup, raising concerns not only in Azerbaijan but across the region. For a country that has engaged in decades of aggressive foreign policy and maintains territorial claims against a neighboring state, this intensification of armament is deeply troubling. The question must be asked: What is the purpose of such military expansion if the goal is genuine peace? The situation is further exacerbated by a well-coordinated defamation campaign led by certain Armenian and pro-Armenian groups on the international stage. This campaign seeks to undermine Azerbaijan’s standing globally, casting a shadow over its peace efforts and tarnishing its image. These efforts, while unsuccessful in derailing Azerbaijan’s path to development and stability, nonetheless create an atmosphere of mistrust that complicates the peace process. For peace to flourish, such negative external influences must be curtailed. Complicating matters further is the role of external powers with vested interests in the South Caucasus. These geopolitical actors often view the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia as an opportunity to exert influence in the region, prioritizing their strategic goals over the well-being of local populations. In many cases, these powers have adopted a stance that disproportionately favors Armenia, emboldening its leadership to take less constructive positions in the peace negotiations. For sustainable peace to be achieved, it is essential that external actors prioritize the long-term stability of the region over their short-term geopolitical ambitions. Despite these challenges, there is a foundation for optimism. The peace process is advancing, and both Azerbaijan and Armenia have a clear interest in reaching an agreement. The conflict that once defined the region has, in large part, been resolved, and new geopolitical realities have emerged in the aftermath of the Second Karabakh War. These realities include an enhanced role for Azerbaijan in regional economic and transport networks, particularly through projects like the Zangezur corridor, which promises to transform regional trade and connectivity. Another encouraging sign is the progress made in the delimitation and demarcation of borders, which had long been a contentious issue. The ongoing negotiations on this matter are a testament to the fact that both sides are willing to engage in practical dialogue on difficult issues. This willingness to work through the complexities of border demarcation offers hope that a broader peace agreement can be reached. The Path to Sustainable Peace To ensure that peace is not only signed but sustained, it is critical that Armenia demonstrates a greater commitment to constructive engagement in the negotiations. This includes halting its military buildup and refraining from international campaigns aimed at isolating or undermining Azerbaijan. Peace requires mutual respect, trust, and a genuine willingness to compromise. Azerbaijan, for its part, has shown extraordinary patience and a readiness to move beyond the past. Despite enduring 30 years of occupation, with its associated human, material, and emotional costs, Azerbaijan continues to extend a hand of peace. This commitment to peace reflects not just a desire to resolve bilateral issues with Armenia but a broader vision for the South Caucasus region. Azerbaijan is invested in creating a future where the region can thrive economically, politically, and culturally. This vision requires peace, stability, and cooperation between all its neighbors, including Armenia. The peace process is therefore not just about ending a conflict but about building a new era of collaboration and shared prosperity. In conclusion, the time for peace has come. While significant challenges remain, the progress made thus far gives reason for cautious optimism. For the region to truly move forward, both Armenia and Azerbaijan must embrace the opportunities before them. Armenia, in particular, must take bold steps towards genuine reconciliation by removing its territorial claims and engaging in a more constructive and peaceful dialogue. Only then can the South Caucasus achieve the lasting peace and stability it so desperately needs. Azerbaijan, as always, remains ready to walk the path of peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3V62ZFRs2unL	2024-10-21T09:31:11-07:00	
Exposing Fake Allegations Of ISKP Operating From Pakistan – OpEd	New accusations by the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IAG) that the Islamic State in Khorasan province (ISKP) is based in Pakistan have fuelled much attention and concern from Islamabad. Such statements which seem to shift focus from Afghanistan’s own problems more specifically the TTP presence in Afghan soil can be seen as questionable motives and legitimacy in the IAG. ISKP creation is traced back to Afghanistan not as Pakistan’s creation as many people tend to believe. Despite IS’s retreat in 2014 from SV checkpoints in northern Iraq for which it had been fighting since 2011, the group and its Pakistani affiliate, the TTP, began collaborating with ISKP formally in 2015, and ISKP was founded largely on elements from Al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban (TTA), and the TTP based in Afghanistan. Prominent disillusioned colourful commanders such as Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost earlier in TTA and Abdul Qahir Khorasani were active in the formation of TTP to which most belonged Hafiz Saeed Khan. Khan, himself a former TTP commander, had a major ideological and business rivalry with TTP’s chief, Fazalullah which compelled him to cross over to ISKP. Hafiz Saeed Khan was the first emir of ISKP, and the majority of ISKP fighters are linked with the TTP or TTA organizations. Another weird note about the early leadership of ISKP is that Abdul Rahman Muslim Doat, who participated in the founding of ISKP, switched sides and returned to the Afghan Taliban. This absolutely negates IAG assertion that the leadership or operations of ISKP are being coordinated from Pakistan. Instead, ISKP was a group that originated in Afghanistan’s own conditions, let alone the impact of factors such as India. Such ‘double game’ of India with ISKP only seems to complicate the narrative which the IAG seems to be propounding. Right from its formation, it has had a connection with Indian militants. It is on record that when ISKP was formed in Nangarhar, Afghanistan dozens of Indian militants had surrendered to the group. Information about active Indian involvement with the group emerged in the last year, when 13 Indian ISKP militants were reportedly killed in a U.S. airstrike (MOAB) in Tora Bora mountains. Furthermore, some of the terrorists belong to ISKP have carried out significant attacks within India and its neighborhood. Mohammed Muhasin from Kerala is a known name linked with an attack in Kabul’s Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib in March 2020. In August 2020, another Indian, Abu Rawaha al-Muhajir, undertook a suicide vehicle bombing on Jalalabad prison. These attacks establish ISKP linkages with India and deal another blow to the propaganda that ISKP is launching operations from Pakistan. However, own connections of ISKP with India do indicate a much larger regional context which is conveniently overshadowed by Afghan and Indian authorities. Growing allegations by IAG on Pakistan appear to be in fact phony strategies in order to absolve themselves of their inability to counter TTP within Afghanistan. The Afghan government has failed to stop TTP the use Afghan territory to launch an operation against Pakistan even after they were requested to do so and provided clear evidence by Islamabad. The TTP which is reported to have carried out several terrorist attacks in Pakistan still enjoys sanctuaries in Afghanistan. India has a stakes in this narrative, and needs to promote it. Indian Media is no doubt among the major sources of Anti-Pakistan propaganda. Indian platforms have given open mikes to known terrorists such as Ehsan Ullah Ehsan, former TTP spokesperson to perpetrate the misinformation. Indian newspapers like the ‘Sunday Guardian ‘frequently features articles written by known terrorists and the nexus between Indian RAW and Afghan GDI in working to destabilise Pakistan through proxy groups such TTP and ISKP. Pakistan has been the recipient of insurgent strikes from both TTP and ISKP. A total of 265 people were killed in 13 attacks inside Pakistan in 2023 for which ISKP took the responsibility. The bombings include one at a political rally in Bajaur where more than 60 people were killed by a suicide bomber and another event in Mastung where more than 50 people were killed by a similar bomber. All these attacks were coordinated from Afghanistan territory, which shows that ISKP has its strong base there. Recent peer accounts including the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have time and again amplified the presence of ISKP, TTP & other terrorist groups in Afghanistan. These groups have joined hands in conducting cross border raids in Pakistan thus proving the Afghanistan’s centrality as a theater of terror in Pakistan. It is a violation of the Doha Agreement since the terrorist groups remain actively operating in Afghanistan today, namely ISKP, TTP, and even Al Qaeda. There are two broad principles of the agreement; the Taliban cannot launch terrorism activities from Afghan territory. Still, the Afghan government displays its inability either to stop the recruitment of Afghan nationals into these groups or cease their cross-border activities. The recent UN sanctions reports which have just been released amplify that the Afghan Taliban has not complied with its counterterrorism obligations thus #Afghanistan ‘s stocks erode. Since the September 11 attack, Pakistan has remained quite straight forward as a country in term of its policy towards terrorism. Such players originating from ISKP, TTP or Al Qaeda are anti Pakistan terrorists and shall be meted out an exemplary response in accordance with the law. Over the years, Pakistan has appealed to Afghanistan to pursue the terrorist groups living in that country, but having had no cooperation they are going to protect their country and the region from terrorism. These richly baseless allegations by the IAG against Pakistan in regard to ISKP is nothing else but a ploy to mask its inefficiency in tackling TTP and other terrorist outfits in their own territories. Cross-border terrorism remains a threat for Pakistan, the victim of militant activity in Afghanistan, which will continue to see ISKP and TTP terrorists operate and plan attacks. The world needs to accept facts about ISKP and relationships which support it instead of being trapped into the dissected goal of a country to destabilize Pakistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3cgjojmG4DSc	2024-10-21T09:28:12-07:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Turkey Page (Part II) – OpEd	Ethiopia’s aggression against Somalia this year, is as unexpected as anyone can imagine. Although the two countries were more or less at peace with each other for some two decades, it would appear the peace was only in place because there was no Somali government of substance in the region for these decades. As soon as Ethiopia felt that Somalia was on the rise again, it came up with its true colors of antagonism and aggression with a direct attempt to break the back of the Somali people. It was not enough what Meles Zenawi did in 2006/2007 through the Ethiopian-organized IGADSOM invasion of Somalia and the creation of religious terrorism in the country. This time, Ethiopia’s current administration, in the place of maintaining the growing cordial relations between the two countries, has forced one of the regions of Somalia to sign an illegal MoU on the first day of this memorable year 2024 in the Somali calendar, wherein it would take a part of Somalia’s sea and territory. Türkiye, one of the key countries involved in both countries had no choice but to intervene to calm down the situation and keep it from becoming beyond a diplomatic impasse. It offered to mediate between the two countries. Several sessions of the mediation process have already taken place, but all have ended up to naught, so far. One must note that Türkiye is a key partner of Somalia and is a vanguard party in Somalia’s forward moves to recover from the years of crises, socially, economically and even politically. It was, indeed, a basket case for years. Türkiye’s help was welcomed by Somalia with a full heart. On the other side, Türkiye was supplying Ethiopia with its iconic TB-2 UAVs to tilt the war with its breakaway Tigray region in its favor. Türkiye had no choice but to intervene and mediate between the two countries as it has, indeed, a good relationship with both. This is a tall order, indeed. Ethiopia is no longer satisfied with its landlocked status and has avowed to have access to a sea, threatening thus all the smaller coastal countries in the region. Somalia appeared to be the weakest in the link and accordingly, it embarked on the illegal MoU, which has since become famous and an instigator of a potentially devastating war in the region. Türkiye wants, as Somalia also wants, to have the MoU withdrawn, thus maintaining Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty intact with Ethiopia having access to a sea. One must note that Türkiye had already committed itself to protect not only the waters of Somalia but also to the territorial integrity of the country. It is strategic military contract between the two countries. Ethiopia needs to have access to new arms and technologies which Türkiye can supply, and Türkiye needs customers for its new and advanced technological weaponry such as the TB-2 UAVs. Both countries offer a ready market for Türkiye’s defense goods, and should it succeed in mediating between them, this would enhance it proactive foreign policy. It is a risky proposition for Türkiye for if the mediation fails, it could lead to a destabilization of the region, which would have negative consequences for its interests in the region. In this respect, one must keep in mind Türkiye’s deepening involvement in the potential and growing hydrocarbon industry of the region, where it has signed contracts with Somalia. Settling the growing dispute between the two countries would greatly add to Türkiye’s prestige and open more doors for it in the African continent and beyond. The exploration of oil and gas through cooperation with Türkiye would naturally lead to other contracts involving not only drilling activities but also to building contracts with respect to the transportation infrastructures in terms of pipes, storage tanks, and shipping equipment. One must note that Türkiye’s ambitions include becoming an energy distribution hub and Somalia could become an integral part of that process, wherein Somalia’s hydrocarbon transfers to Europe and beyond will pass through Türkiye. The Turkish naval presence in the waters of Somalia is a stabilizing factor and a deterrent against the ongoing security fears of the region. There is now a growing Chinese, Indian and other naval forces in the region and since they do not see eye to eye on many issues, the insecurities could grow tangibly as well. Türkiye is helping develop a Somali naval force which will be able, as it used to be in the past, to protect its waters from normal threats of piracy and other criminal activities. Türkiye’s involvement in the region has indeed international implications as major powers are also competing in the region. Türkiye’s involvement in helping protect Somalia’s waters will contribute to reversing the passage of terrorists, illegal migration, and illegal goods in the waters of Somalia, which appear to have dominated these waters ever since the collapse of the government of Somalia, some three decades ago. Keeping the region stable is amenable to Türkiye interests as well the interests of the countries of the region. They have suffered enough from not only environmental calamities but also from internal civil wars. They do not need to add new intra-state wars, which would only benefit the evil forces that have so far dominated the region. This would help Türkiye in opening more doors for itself in the African continent and in particular the Sahel region which has similar terror and resource competition issues as the Horn of Africa States region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3Y41McruRy_8	2024-10-21T09:25:25-07:00	
Dominance Of Mining Corporations And Distressed Democracy In Odis...	Odisha is home to abundant reserves of high-grade natural resources like iron, bauxite, chromite, and manganese ore, along with other valuable minerals such as coal, limestone, dolomite, tin, nickel, vanadium, lead, graphite, gold, gemstones, diamonds, and decorative stones. The resource-rich Odisha accounts for 57 percent of India's iron ore production, with over 60 active mines and more than 150 square kilometres under exploration for additional mineral resources. The people of Odisha are neither shareholders nor beneficiaries of the state's vast mineral resources. Ironically, the poorest of the poor reside in the mineral-rich regions of Odisha, highlighting the stark inequality in the distribution of wealth and benefits from these natural assets. The paradox of plenty defines the state of development in Odisha where poverty and hunger continue to be the national and international news. Since independence, Odisha has consistently been pro-business and mining led industrialisation. Successive governments, led by various political parties such as the Congress Party, Swatantra Party, Janata Dal, Janata Party, Biju Janata Dal (BJD), and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have provided uninterrupted support to business houses and mining-led industrial corporations in the name of economic growth and development in Odisha. However, instead of genuine economic development, the people have witnessed the persistent dominance of mining corporations over democracy, turning the mineral-rich region into a state of resource curse for its inhabitants. The rent-seeking nature of the state and government in Odisha has failed to support either economic growth or human development for its people. Instead, it has reinforced the dominance of caste, class, and the propertied elite, entrenching their control over both the state and its governance of resources. This has laid the foundation for a neopatrimonial relationship between the state, government, businesses, and mining corporations, further consolidating mining corporations’ power and profit at the expense of equitable development in the state. This dominance of mining corporations over democracy in Odisha has led to a persistent political and economic crisis for the people of the state. Performance Audit of Systems and Controls in Assessment and Collection of Revenue from Major Minerals for the year ended March 2022 (Report No. 6 of the year 2024) by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)reveals that the state government has helped mining corporations which led to the massive loss of mining revenue. The state exchequer has also lost massively due to the undervaluation of mineral ores by the Government of Odisha. This undue support by the government to private mining corporations comes with massive political donations. Mining corporations in Odisha have paid ₹601 crore in electoral bonds to various political parties. All major parties, including the BJD, BJP, and Congress, have received their share of this political fee in exchange for supporting mining interests in the state. The BJD received the largest share, amounting to ₹453 crore, while the BJP received ₹145 crore, all from six active mining companies operating in Odisha. Who cares about the mining revenue loss of ₹22,392 crore to the Odisha exchequer? Who cares about the ₹10,294 crore lost due to the undervaluation of ores? Who cares about the people and the environment in Odisha's mining regions? Mainstream political parties, mining corporations, and both ruling and non-ruling elites are working together to uphold each other’s interests, while the people and environment in Odisha continue to suffer in unemployment, poverty, hunger, underdevelopment and illness. Successive governments led by mainstream political parties have consistently provided unwavering support to mining companies and other extractive industries, allowing them to exploit the state's natural resources as if the government exists solely for their benefit, rather than for the people of Odisha. This collaboration not only undermines democracy but also destroys the conditions necessary for deepening democratic governance in the state. The collaboration and dominance of mining corporations over politics, political parties, leaders, and governments is undermining democracy in the state. Both the ruling party and opposition parties, along with their leaders, benefit from political donations to provide support for the mining companies. This crony capitalism, driven by mining companies and their extractive practices, is ruining the state's economy, politics, environment, and the democratic future of the people in Odisha. The BJP came to power by ending more than two decades of BJD rule in the state, but their economic and mining policy positions are not very different. Both the ruling BJP and opposition BJD share an unwavering commitment to mining companies. The new Chief Minister of Odisha, Mr. Mohan Charan Majhi, hails from a tribal community; however, the marginalisation and displacement of tribals from their land due to mining does not seem to concern him. He is actively working to hand over forest areas and tribal lands for mining without any political or moral qualms, despite being a tribal leader. Political parties and leaders are under the influence of mining companies, with regular paycheques from these corporations establishing a foundation for pro-mining narratives among political parties and their leaders, regardless of their political affiliations. Mining is a risk-free business in Odisha. The protection of land, natural resources, and livelihoods is crucial for peace and prosperity in the state. History reveals that economic growth driven by mining-led industrialisation does not eliminate poverty and hunger. Cooperative and collective ownership of natural resources, along with egalitarian distribution and governance, can help eradicate poverty, hunger, and underdevelopment in the state. In this context, the people of Odisha need to pursue a new politics that ensures that people become shareholders and owners of the state’s mineral resources. The first step is to mobilise the working population to oppose mining corporations and break their grip on politics, the state, and the government. Radical alternative politics in Odisha can only pursue policies of egalitarian resource redistribution only by focusing on equality, justice, and liberty as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3d-WdxIa1_WC	2024-10-21T09:23:24-07:00	
Implications Of Indo-US Strategic Partnership On South Asia – OpE...	The south Asia region is setting the stage for the great power competition, as China and US use diplomacy to contain each other, leading to increase rivalry. The US dominance has been challenged by China, a rising economic power in the region. Over two decades, the US has strengthened its strategic partnership with India through initiatives like QUAD and I2U2, aimed at countering China’s growing influence and maintaining the dominant status of US in the Indo Pacific region. This partnership includes cooperation in trade, defense, technology, and various other fields, which has deep implications for South Asia, a region already burdened with historical rivalry, arms race, and under developed infrastructure. As a result South Asia has become victim of the new great powers competition. The rivalry between the major players affects the smaller states of the region, consequently, the expanding Indo-US strategic partnership is continuously hindering the regional cooperation in South Asia. Furthermore, China is one of the emerging dominant powers in the world, having developed various projects such as Infrastructure development in Srilanka, military cooperation with the Maldives and CPEC project in Pakistan to counter influence of United States. On other hand India and the US have deepened the strategic partnership, which has gravely impacted the South Asian nations. The shared political interests of India and US in countering China had led to significant changes in both countries policies. Additionally the shift in US foreign policy towards India has strengthened China’s partnership in South Asia, escalating geopolitical tensions in the region. The Indo-US partnership has been marked by numerous agreements including Civil Nuclear Agreement 2005, Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018 and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) in 2020. The Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2005 un-officially granted the India the status of De-facto nuclear state and lifted technological restrictions allowing India to modernize its military capabilities. As a result the Indo-US partnership is accelerating military modernization and triggering an arms race in the region, raising security concerns for countries like China and Pakistan. Moreover, the Indo-US partnership appears to move away from conflict resolution mechanism in the region, allowing India to strengthen its influence both regionally and beyond. For instance 2019 Balakot crisis and the Indian submarine incursion near Pakistan’s territorial water highlighting India’s aggressive behavior. However Pakistan as a responsible actor, always strives to maintain peace and stability. While the US has historically acted as a mediator in India and Pakistan relations, its increasing partnership with India is undermining its neutrality in the conflict. Consequently, India’s refusal to restart confidence-building measures, coupled with its irresponsible and belligerent behavior and tolerance from the US allows India to dominate the South Asian region. Additionally, The Indo-US partnership is fulfills the economic interests of both countries through trade and investment in defense, information technology and in energy sector. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) 2024, India is the largest arms importer in the world. It imports about 9.8% of the total global arms supply. However 62% of these imports come from Russian and 10% from US, Therefore, the US is enhancing its cooperation with India to encourage the country to reduce its dependency on Russian weapons and shift more of its arms import from Russia to US. This shift would lead to economic gains for the US and further increase its influence in South Asia, enabling it to counter the economic rise of China and Russia. Although China founded the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project for regional connectivity, many of the smaller states of South Asia such as Pakistan, Srilanka, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh have joined it. Analogously the US and India have also initiated the Build Better World (B3W) and India Middle East Europe (IMEC) projects to counter the China’s influence in the region. However this situation presents a herculean task for the smaller states of the South Asia which must decide whether to align with China, Indo-US or to remain neutral. This growing polarization adds to the regions geopolitical challenges. As a result, Indo-US strategic partnership is causing significant geo-political changes in South Asia. It has undermined the effectiveness of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) by reinforcing India’s aggressive posture, which exacerbates regional tensions and fuels an arms race. This increases the likelihood discord and hampers conflict resolution efforts. Furthermore, non-traditional security threats such as climate change, poverty, and food security are being left unaddressed due to India’s non-cooperative policy in the region. Ultimately, the Indo-US strategic cooperation is transforming South Asia in to a hotspot for the great-power competition, contributing to the regional instability rather than enhancing cooperation and resolving existing tensions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3W_TbGgMTGtt	2024-10-21T09:21:35-07:00	
Opening Border Crossings Without Passports: A Threat To Pakistan’...	The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), formed in 2018, considers itself a representation of the rights and interests of the Pashtun people, particularly in the context of their grievances related to military operations and state policies in Pakistan’s border regions. The movement gained significant attention following a grand jirga that convened on 13 October 2024, to address these issues, advocating for improved living conditions and accountability for alleged state abuses. Among some of the demands, PTM has proposed the opening of border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan without passports, framing it as a measure to enhance connectivity and facilitate trade. However, it is imperative to scrutinize the potential consequences of such a move for Pakistan’s security and economy. The stark realities of a porous border suggest that the risks far outweigh the benefits. Primarily, an open border facilitates a myriad of illegal activities, including smuggling, drug trafficking, and human trafficking, all of which can profoundly harm the interests of ordinary citizens. Manzoor Pashteen, along with various mafias, appears to advocate for maintaining the status quo, wherein smuggling flourishes unchecked. This situation raises alarms, as the estimated cost of smuggling to Pakistan’s economy hovers around $1 billion annually, a figure that encapsulates lost revenue and rampant corruption. Such losses not only strain public finances but also undermine the legitimacy of the state. Furthermore, the implications of human trafficking cannot be overstated. Each year, over 10,000 individuals are trafficked across the border, many of whom face exploitation, violence, and even death. The vulnerability of these individuals highlights the urgent need for stronger border controls rather than the loosening of regulations. Instead of promoting free movement, the government should prioritize safeguarding its citizens from these grave threats. In addition to human suffering, legal businesses in Pakistan face crippling competition from smuggled goods, reporting losses that exceed $2 billion. This scenario not only affects the local economy but also diminishes taxpayer revenues, as legitimate businesses struggle to survive against unfair competition. The proliferation of smuggled goods thus poses a significant threat to the economic stability of the nation and raises critical questions about the priorities of those advocating for open borders. Moreover, the illegal influx of firearms presents a dire threat to national security. It is estimated that over 50,000 illegal firearms enter Pakistan from Afghanistan annually, contributing to violence and instability. The porous nature of the border allows terrorist groups to operate with impunity, as evidenced by the fact that over 60% of attacks in Pakistan can be attributed to groups exploiting Afghan territory. This statistic should serve as a wake-up call, urging policymakers to reinforce border security rather than dismantling it. Indeed, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan have already witnessed a concerning 30% rise in terror-related incidents in 2024, resulting in significant casualties among security forces. The collaboration between mafias and terror networks creates a vicious cycle of violence, wherein local populations bear the brunt of the deteriorating security landscape. It is crucial to recognize that calls for open borders not only ignore the existing challenges but also risk exacerbating them. In terms of narcotics, the stakes are alarmingly high. Between September 2023 and June 2024, authorities seized 1,041 metric tons of narcotics, with daily seizures averaging 2-3 tons. The staggering worth of these drugs has inevitably attracted the attention of criminal mafias that benefit from the ongoing trade. Allowing an open border would only empower these networks, undermining law enforcement efforts and perpetuating a cycle of addiction and violence. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has also ramped up its activities, with an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 fighters operating in the border regions, further complicating the security landscape. The rise of such extremist groups has been accompanied by a notable 30% increase in violence in 2024, with over 200 reported incidents attributed to these factions in KP and Balochistan. This troubling trend underscores the need for a robust security framework rather than a relaxed border policy. In conclusion, the call to open border crossings without passports raises critical concerns about the safety and well-being of Pakistan’s citizens. While advocates may tout the benefits of enhanced connectivity, the reality is that such a move would likely facilitate illegal activities that undermine the nation’s security and economy. It is essential for policymakers to prioritize the protection of their citizens and the integrity of the state by reinforcing border controls, thus preventing the further erosion of law and order. The situation demands a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of smuggling and trafficking while safeguarding Pakistan’s future. Only through a concerted effort can the state reclaim control over its borders and ensure a more secure environment for its people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3adj5xVOforT	2024-10-21T09:20:05-07:00	
Chickpeas: Sustainable And Climate-Friendly Foods Of The Future	Climate change has a negative impact on food security. An international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna has now conducted a study to investigate the natural variation of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress. The scientists were able to show that chickpeas are a drought-resistant legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain cultivation systems even in urban areas. The study was recently published in the specialist magazine The Plant Biotechnology. Long periods of drought stress have also become a reality in Central Europe due to climate change, a major threat to plant productivity, harvests and therefore food security. At the same time, there is a decline in the use of plant genetic diversity, and the global food system has become more and more uniform. While there are approximately 7,000 edible crops, two-thirds of global food production is based on just nine crop species. 'This narrow genetic base can have several negative consequences, such as increased susceptibility of plants to diseases and pests, reduced resistance to factors such as drought and climate change, and increased economic fragility,' explains molecular biologist Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna. 'Maintaining adequate plant and genetic diversity is crucial for agriculture, which must adapt to future changing conditions. With our new study, we have taken an important step in this direction and looked at the chickpea as an important food of the future,' says Weckwerth The chickpea is currently not one of the plants mentioned above on which the global diet is currently mainly based. The international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth has now researched the natural variations of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress and achieved promising results. The team managed to grow many different chickpea varieties under drought stress in a field experiment in a Vienna city region, demonstrating that chickpeas are a great alternative legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain farming systems in urban areas. 'The different varieties and wild types show very different mechanisms to deal with persistent drought stress. This natural genetic variability is particularly important in order to withstand climate change and ensure the survival of the plant,' says Weckwerth. 'In our study, we used a stress susceptibility index (SSI) to assess the effects of drought stress on yield. This allowed us to identify genotypes that perform best and worst under stressful conditions. Our findings are crucial for the selection of genotypes for breeding drought-tolerant chickpeas,' explains Palak Chaturvedi from the University of Vienna, lead author of the study. The team used artificial intelligence, multivariate statistics and modeling to identify markers and mechanisms for better resilience to drought stress. 'With their high protein content and their drought resistance, legumes such as chickpeas are a food of the future. Another advantage is that a higher proportion of legumes in a country's agricultural systems improves the overall efficiency of nitrogen use - this also makes agriculture more sustainable,' summarizes Weckwerth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcpQYRuDVqa4rJ1C6BVB_gm	2024-10-20T15:48:47-07:00	
Global Aid Funds Face Fundraising ‘Traffic Jam’	Major global developmentfundsand institutions could struggle to secure the billions of dollars needed to support the world’s least affluent countries as they embark on new funding campaigns, according to analysts. Areportpublished today (Wednesday) by the Center for Global Development says that funds including The World Bank’s International Development Association, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are seeking to replenish their coffers with a combined total of about US$100 billion in grants from donors over the course of 2024 and 2025. This is creating what the report’s authors call a 'replenishment traffic jam', whereby different institutions are lining up for a share of the same limited basket of resources amid aid budget cuts in several countries. Economic headwinds Charities warned in September that the UK’s spending on overseas bilateral humanitarian and development could fall to a 17-year low of 0.36 per cent this year, ahead of an autumn budget announcement later this month. The German governmentsaidin August that it would cut funding for global development cooperation by almost 1 billion euros next year, which comes on top of severe cuts to its 2024 aid budget. According to Janeen Madan Keller, co-author of the report and deputy director of the Global Health Policy Program at the Center for Global Development, foreign aid budgets from the biggest development players are under pressure due to economic headwinds, which makes the current fundraising bids especially challenging. Not only are top donors like the European Union, Germany and France slashing their aid budgets, but the funds that distribute aid keep relying on the same small group of donors, said Keller. 'So, what we’re seeing is the same donors being asked to contribute to these same replenishments,' she toldSciDev.Net. Another issue is that a growing number of aid funds are being created with a specific focus, such as pandemic preparedness or climate response, while the pot of money they’re competing for dwindles, said Keller. Aid at risk 'Prospects for fully replenishing all these funds’ coffers look grim asgovernmentscontinue to cut aid budgets and elections add even more uncertainty to pledges, especially where they entail transitions between political parties,' says the Center for Global Development’s report. It remains to be seen whether development funds will actually fail to raise enough money, since the replenishment season is still underway. But if the money does fall short, aid flows could be jeopardised, with potentially dire consequences for the poorest countries in the world. 'You don’t want [aid] to go up and down, because when it goes down, that can have permanent effects,' said Jean-Louis Arcand, president of the Global Development Network, who wasn’t involved in the report. One typical example is when someone in a poor country loses their job as a result of cuts, they might not be able to afford to keep their children in school, Arcand toldSciDev.Net. Aid budget cuts by major donors such as the UK and Germany could have direct consequences on the stability of aid, which is essential in countries where large shares of government budgets are made up of aid money, said Arcand. 'If the Germans, the UK, cut [aid budgets], the people who are going to get hurt are the people in the least developed countries,' he said. The World Bank, which oversees the International Development Association, or IDA, says there is a need to step up ambition for the IDA since multiple crises have set back progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and development. However, it declined to comment directly on the report’s findings. A Global Fund spokesperson said the Fund hoped to launch its investment case in the first quarter of next year in a 'challenging' context of development finance. The Fund has mobilised an additional US$109.4 million since its last replenishment, or fundraising cycle, so has been able to invest more than expected in the current period, the spokesperson added. More broadly, decreasing aid budgets and reduced domestic financing for health threaten to impact the delivery of 'core and essential life-saving care … such as antiretrovirals,malariabed nets, therapeutics and diagnostics' as well as investment in the next generation of solutions, the spokesperson said. Gavi didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Bucking the trend Elise Dufief, research lead at IDDRI, a France-based sustainable development think tank, said that the latest aid budget cuts do warrant concern, but that some countries are leading the way in increasing contributions. Denmark has said it will increase its aid contributions by 40 per cent and good news is also expected from South Korea, said Dufief, while some African countries have pledged contributions to the African Development Fund. 'I think these countries are really showing that they can decide that they want to contribute and lead on these issues, and hopefully encourage others to join as well,' she said.

From Waste To Resource: Recovering Nutrients To Fertilize The Fut...	Europe faces growing food supply demands and a shortage of non-renewable raw materials for fertilisers. But producing more from available resources is possible, say researchers: 'The nutrients we need are before our eyes, ready to be transformed.' European farmers face a monumental dual challenge: increasing food production while meeting daunting deadlines imposed by the green transition. Amid the drive to produce greener, more efficient fertilisers, new technologies seek to squeeze maximum potential from nutrients that have long been imported, but which until now have been under-exploited. 'An important part of the nutrients we have been importing for years are here, ready to be transformed and to be given another life,' says Javier Brañas Lasala, Director of Research, Development and Innovation at the Spanish fertiliser producer Fertiberia. Using nutrients from bio-waste to reduce Europe’s dependency on non-renewable raw materials and increase the efficiency of new sustainable fertilisers is one of the main goals of B-Ferst, a 5-year European project he coordinates, due to end this October. The European Commission president has highlighted the challenge of securing future food supplies, via sustainable farming that protects nature and respects climate goals. Where are we at globally in facing that challenge? We’re on the way to guarantee the food supply for everyone, but it's still not achieved. The population is growing and unfortunately there are countries and people that don't have enough food. So, we need to increase food production, but we cannot use more land. We need a technological increase in farming systems, to produce more per hectare in a sustainable way. The challenge is very big, because Europe has decided to increase the surface area dedicated to organic farming to 30% in a few years, and organic farming is less productive than traditional farming. So, we must bet on high value-added products and put together all the knowledge we have in order to be much more efficient and at the same time more respectful of the environment. In recent years we’ve seen the pandemic, war in Europe, ongoing disruption to supplies, higher prices. How urgent does that make this transition? As fast as possible, but I’m not sure if we're getting there on time, because it’s not an easy challenge. However, the European Commission has been very clear with dates and deadlines and together with European companies it’s putting a lot of money into research and innovation. The EU still depends on non-renewable raw materials and uses natural gas as its main energy source for producing fertilisers. Are we still not a long way off achieving set goals? It must be step by step. Europe doesn’t have the natural resources to produce the nutrients needed for farming. But we do have a large part of the nutrients we’ve been importing for years: in waste treatment plants, in agricultural soils. We have them here — tons and tons of phosphates and potash and so on — ready to be transformed. We’ve been trying to do that, for phosphorus and for potassium mainly. With nitrogen fertilisers we have the same problem: nitrogen plus hydrogen produce ammonia, and the hydrogen comes from natural gas. Even so, many companies in our sector are setting very ambitious decarbonisation targets, betting on renewable energies and innovating to gradually reduce their carbon footprint and to offer European agriculture sustainable and smart crop nutrition solutions, in line with what society demands. The B-Ferst project set out to valorise underexploited bio-waste, develop new green fertilisers, substitute raw materials, and cut energy consumption. How much has been achieved? We have two goals here: one is nutrient recovery; the other is to increase the nutrients’ performance. The first — the circular economy, the re-use of nutrients from bio-waste — is not easy: a lot of new technologies are under development, but they’re not cheap. There is a logistic issue: the residues are produced in different places, their composition varies during the year, supply is temporal, mostly the nutrients need to be concentrated. You can’t transport low-concentrated bio-waste nutrients far: moving liquid manure 400 kilometres, for example, is expensive. An industrial process is needed to transform a bio-waste into a raw material. Some bio-waste is suitable for fertiliser production, but most needs more development. The project’s objective wasn’t to make fertilisers 100% from bio-waste because that’s nearly impossible at a big scale. But we can produce fertilisers by partially substituting nutrients, with about 20% coming from bio-waste. However, to have more impact in Europe, with more fertiliser producers doing the same, a bigger effort is needed from waste management companies to develop processes to transform this bio-waste into raw materials. And the second objective, to increase the nutrients’ efficiency? We’ve got that through the development of bio-stimulants that increase the efficiency of the nutrients you apply to the soil. It’s very exciting to see how we can make these fertilisers more efficient and more advanced. We’ve also produced special innovative coatings to protect the bio-stimulants, increase the nutrients’ efficiency and protect them in the soil from leeching. With these new additives we’ve found we can increase production by between 5 to 15%. Some reports identify potentially serious barriers, particularly financial and on crop yields. Other reports have also highlighted problems with pricing and regulation. Won’t the new fertilisers be too expensive for farmers? Pricing, like quality, is of course very important: in the end if it's not economically viable it won’t work. Of course, transforming bio-waste into a raw material and moving it from the point of production to the fertiliser plant are costly but farmers aren't going to pay much more for these fertilisers; it’s hard enough for them producing food for us, we can’t make their job harder still! Any difference in price between BFerst fertilisers and conventional ones should be small, but the benefits will be much higher. So, our message is: 'yes, maybe this will be just a little more expensive, but we’re going to produce more per square metre'. Higher yields… Yes, in the end it's going to be a win-win, they're going to produce more, and via a circular economy that uses high-technology bio-stimulants to make fertilisers. We get everything we were looking for: higher yields, lower environmental impact. Are there communication problems with the industry and can they be overcome? I think the farmers will always valorise the best product for their business. The first thing is to show that their production has been higher per kilogram of nutrient they're applying. So, on numbers alone, farmers will be convinced by the economic benefits. Afterwards, we’ll highlight the environmental advantages such as carbon footprint and waste reduction — and argue that they're contributing to make Europe stronger because we’ll be less dependent on natural resources from abroad, very important at a time of international tension.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen11mj3oFyKw7v6L8moPO_	2024-10-20T15:38:42-07:00	
How Airbnb Could Help Curb The Rise In Housing Costs	Home-rental platforms like Airbnb are known to drive up housing costs, but a new study shows that doing a better job of collecting the taxes owed by these home rentals appears to slow the rise in home prices. The finding suggests that tax policy can help to mitigate rising home prices, particularly in areas where there are a lot of short-term rental properties. 'It’s well established that Airbnb rentals can drive up home prices, and that’s because a lot of homeowners who use Airbnb or similar services are not paying the taxes that they’re supposed to,' says Jared Smith, co-author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of finance in North Carolina State University’s Poole College of Management. 'For example, hotels have to pay taxes imposed by local governments on short-term rentals,' Smith says. 'Airbnb hosts are supposed to do this as well, but previous research tells us that as many as 75% of hosts aren’t paying those taxes. That makes being an Airbnb host particularly profitable. This drives up property prices by effectively encouraging people to purchase homes specifically to put them on the short-term rental market. The increased competition makes those properties more expensive for people who are seeking to rent or purchase a long-term home. 'Our goal with this work was to determine whether tax policy can make a difference,' Smith says. 'Specifically, we wanted to examine whether having companies that oversee short-term home rentals – like Airbnb – collect relevant taxes right off the top would help slow the rise in home prices.' For the study, researchers focused on Florida, where taxes are largely levied at the local level. Coupled with the fact that Florida garners a lot of tourist visitors, this made the state a good source of data that would allow researchers to assess the impact of local Airbnb tax collection efforts. The researchers collected county-level tax data from all 67 Florida counties for the years 2012-2019. Between 2015 and 2019, 41 Florida counties adopted tax enforcement agreements with Airbnb, in which Airbnb collects the taxes directly from the hosts who are renting the homes. In the remaining 26 counties, hosts are responsible for paying the taxes. 'In other words, by 2019, 41 counties had rules in place with Airbnb that meant the company collected 100% of the taxes that were due on Airbnb rentals,' Smith says. 'We used statistical approaches that allowed us to account for confounding variables and compare changes in both property prices and residential rent costs across all 67 counties. We refer to the combination of property price and rent costs as ‘housing costs.’' The researchers found that housing costs went up in every county. But housing costs in counties that did not have Airbnb tax enforcement agreements went up 1.6 to5.8% more than housing costs in counties that did have tax enforcement agreements. And the effect of the tax enforcement agreements varied according to the size of the housing unit. 'Essentially, the bigger the housing unit, the more pronounced the effect,' Smith says. 'For example, a one-bedroom apartment might have seen housing prices rise by an additional 1.6%, whereas a four-bedroom home would likely have seen a rise closer to 5.8%. 'In short, our findings suggest that implementing tax enforcement agreements with the companies that oversee the short-term rental industry could make a significant impact in slowing the rise of housing costs,' Smith says. 'This has two very real benefits. First, many parts of the country have been seeing skyrocketing housing prices, putting significant stress on both renters and homebuyers. This could help with that. Second, it guarantees that hosts will comply with existing tax requirements by removing the possibility of tax evasion, which is good news for the coffers of local governments and the services they provide.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfKh-y680HL22_63bikK-sP	2024-10-20T15:33:07-07:00	
Sweden Meets UN Targets For HIV Epidemic	Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, according to a study in Eurosurveillance by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and others. According to the researchers, Sweden is the first country in the world to achieve these targets. Sweden has reached a historic milestone in the fight against HIV. A new study shows that Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, known as the 95-95-95 target. This means that 95 percent of all people living with HIV in the country have been diagnosed, 95 percent of these are receiving treatment, and 95 percent of those treated have undetectable levels of the virus in their blood. The targets are to be reached by 2025. Sweden's figures are even better: 96 percent have been diagnosed, 99 percent are on treatment and 98 percent have undetectable virus levels. 'This is proof that it is possible to reach these ambitious targets. It shows that Sweden's infrastructure for finding and treating people with HIV is very effective,' says one of the researchers behind the study, Professor Anders Sönnerborg at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet. The study is based on data from the national HIV cohort established in 2003. Over 99 percent of all people diagnosed with HIV in Sweden are included in this cohort, and the data has been analyzed using advanced bioinformatics methods in collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States. 'We have shown that we have indeed reached the target. This means that people with HIV in Sweden have a life expectancy approaching that of non-HIV-infected people and that the vast majority of those diagnosed are not infectious,' says Anders Sönnerborg. The results are important because they show that it is possible to achieve the UNAIDS and WHO targets, which may inspire other countries to intensify their efforts against HIV. Despite the successes, challenges remain, such as late diagnosis, stigma and, not least, HIV cure. 'Research on HIV cure is now a top priority,' says Anders Sönnerborg Researchers at Karolinska Institutet are also continuing to work to ensure that the targets are maintained and to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV. 'We are now working on a fourth goal: that 95 percent of people living with HIV in Sweden should have a good quality of life,' says Anders Sönnerborg. Anders Sönnerborg says that Sweden is the first country with a published study that can show that these goals have been achieved. 'This success shows that Sweden is a leader in the fight against HIV and that it is possible to reach the global targets to end the HIV epidemic.' The study was conducted in close collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, and has been funded by the NIH, the Swedish Research Council and Region Stockholm.

3D Printing Method May Improve Micro Energy Storage	One key to making portable devices more compact and energy efficient lies in the precise nanoscale form of energy-storing capacitors. Researchers in Sweden report they've cracked the challenge with a unique 3D printing method.Researchers at KTH Royal Institute of Technology demonstrated a 3D printing method for fabricating glass micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) that reduces the complexity and time required to form the intricate nanoscale features MSCs need. The advance could potentially lead to more compact and energy-efficient portable devices, including self-sustaining sensors, wearable devices and other Internet of Things applications, says Frank Niklaus, professor of micro- and nanosystems at KTH. Their study was published in ACS Nano. The new method addresses two key challenges to fabricating such devices. A micro-supercapacitor's performance is largely determined by its electrodes, which store and conduct electrical energy. So they need more electrode surface area, and they need nanoscale channels to facilitate rapid ion transport. Po-Han Huang, who was lead author of the study at KTH, says the new research addresses both challenges with through ultrashort laser pulse 3D printing technology. The researchers discovered that ultrashort laser pulses can induce two simultaneous reactions in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), a glass-like precursor material. One reaction results in the formation of self-organized nanoplates, while the second converts the precursor into silicon-rich glass, which is the foundation of the 3D printing process. This enables the fast and precise fabrication of electrodes with plenty of open channels, which maximizes surface area and speeds up ion transport. The researchers demonstrated the approach by 3D-printing micro-supercapacitors that performed well even when charged and discharged very quickly. 'Our findings represent a significant leap forward in microfabrication, with broad implications for the development of high-performance energy storage devices,' Huang says. 'Beyond MSCs, our approach has exciting potential applications in fields such as optical communication, nanoelectromechanical sensors and 5D optical data storage.' The implications are also significant for technologies presently in common use. Supercapacitors of the non-micro type are already collecting energy generated during braking, stabilizing power supply in consumer electronics, and optimizing energy capture in renewable energy, Niklaus says. 'Micro-supercapacitors have the potential to make these applications more compact and efficient.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRSACLOX4vQWaRRIH7l7Ps	2024-10-20T15:24:35-07:00	
Iran Seeks Influence In Sudan Through An Influx Of Weapons – Anal...	Iran is working to take advantage of the chaos caused by Sudan’s civil war to gain a foothold on the Red Sea. Establishing a presence in Sudan would, in essence, enable Iran to box in its regional opponents, including Saudi Arabia and Israel, and threaten shipping through the Suez Canal, according to experts. 'It [Iran] considers it a starting point towards achieving long term strategic gains, in terms of expansion in Africa, control of the Red Sea and wider regional influence,' analyst Abdal Monim Himmat wrote recently for The Arab Weekly. Toward that end, Iran has spent more than a year rebuilding its relations with Sudan’s leadership, which is based in Port Sudan because the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controls most of the national capital, Khartoum. In October 2023, Sudan and Iran resumed diplomatic ties and exchanged ambassadors after an eight-year break. Since then, Iran has supplied the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with weapons to bolster its fight against the RSF. A crucial part of those weapon shipments has been the Iran-made Mohajer-6 and Ababil drones. The drones helped the SAF defeat RSF fighters. Earlier this year, the drones played a key role in driving the RSF out of parts of Omdurman and retaking the headquarters of Sudan’s national broadcaster. Mohajer-6 drones are capable of delivering explosives. In addition to Iranian weapons, the SAF increasingly relies on Iranian intelligence to aid its offensives against the RSF. Observers say Iran has helped the SAF recruit and train new soldiers drawn from people displaced by the fighting who have been trained at camps in Uganda. Iran has attempted to use its aid to the SAF as leverage to get the Sudanese leadership to approve an Iranian naval base on Sudan’s coast. The country has rejected that proposal along with a later proposal for a dual-use commercial and military port at Port Sudan. Iran’s aid has become a key component of the SAF’s effectiveness against the RSF. When the Iranian government was distracted by the death of President Sayyid Ebrahim Raisolsadati in May, the SAF’s battlefield actions suffered, according to observers. Sudan’s connections with Iran go beyond weapons and intelligence. 'The Sudanese Army seeks to leverage Iran’s presence as a tool to pressure anti-Iran regional and international actors, encouraging them to push the RSF toward agreeing to a ceasefire on the Army’s terms,' Hani al-Aasar wrote recently for the Emirates Policy Center. The RSF gets aid from the United Arab Emirates, which, along with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries has a tense relationship with Iran. So far, that strategy has not borne fruit, al-Aasar noted. Ultimately, Sudan is likely to come out on the losing end of Iran’s involvement in its civil war as the Islamic Republic expands its presence in the country. 'As the Sudanese army and Iran have clearly intensified their cooperation, speculation has arisen about Sudan’s vulnerability to Tehran’s influence,' al-Aasar wrote. 'The ongoing war between the Sudanese Army and the RSF has significantly eroded Sudan’s resilience against infiltration and influence by foreign powers.' In the short term, however, the influx of Iranian weapons creates the risk that Sudan’s internal conflict will worsen and might spread beyond its borders. 'Iranian weapons in Sudan will further ignite conflicts there and in surrounding countries,' Himmat wrote. 'It will turn the Red Sea into an arena for international confrontation, further complicating the security posture in region and exposing international navigation to major threats.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i866G2VThv7xZ	2024-10-19T17:27:08-07:00	
Tigray Must Avert Another Cycle Of War – Analysis	As tensions between two TPLF factions rise, urgent measures are needed to prevent another crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. By Meressa K Dessu and Tegbaru Yared After two years of war in Ethiopia’s Tigray Region, the 2022 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) ended clashes between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The parties agreed to find lasting and comprehensive solutions, including restoring constitutional order in Tigray. The TPLF was Tigray’s ruling party for over 30 years. Under the CoHA, it makes up only 51% of the new Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), reducing the party’s tradition of absolute control. Now the TPLF has split into two factions, and violent conflict looms again. Divisions are mainly between the party’s leaders in the TIA under Getachew Reda (TPLF Deputy Chair and Executive Committee Member) and those led by Party Chair Debretsion Gebremichael. The former say the latter are trying to undermine and fragment the administration, reducing the TIA’s control over local governance. Debretsion’s faction accuses the TIA of compromising Tigrayan interests,and recentlyclaimedthey disagreed with some CoHA provisions despite publicly committing to implementing the agreement. After coming to power following popular protests and violence in Ethiopia between 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali restructured the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front – a coalition of four regional parties including the TPLF – into the Prosperity Party (PP). The TPLF said the move was illegal and refused to join the PP. This contributed to rising tensions between the PP-led federal government and the TPLF-led Tigray regional government, eventually culminating in the civil war thatkilledover 600 000 people. TPLF infighting could be an opportunity to spark a new political culture and marketplace of ideas in Tigray The CoHA helped establish an ‘inclusive’ TIA. Following his party's nomination, Getachew was appointed president of the interim administration by Abiy. While the TPLF has significant influence over the TIA, the body includes representatives from the political opposition, civil society, Tigray security force and intellectuals. Many Tigrayans have credited the TIA for improving relations with the federal government, helping return some internally displaced persons (IDPs), attempting to separate party and state structures, entertaining media freedom, and promoting assembly and freedom of speech. At the same time, the TIA has been criticised for not addressing crime, returning all IDPs or fully restoring Tigrayan authority to its pre-war status – some territories remain occupied by Eritrean and Amhara forces. The TIA has acknowledged its weaknesses on several occasions, but claims the TPLF’s factionalism has intensified its difficult task. Tensions resulted in the Getachew-led faction boycotting the 14thTPLF Congress in August, convened by Debretsion’s faction. Following the congress’ decisions, 16 senior political figures including Getachew were expelled from the party. The Getachew-led faction has however labelled the congress illegal and its decision ‘null and void.’ Some commentatorscriticisedthe congress for bypassing due process and lackingapprovalfrom the National Election Board of Ethiopia. The board is a federal institution that registers and manages political parties and ensures impartial elections in the country. TPLF infighting could, however, spark a new political culture, civic discourse and a marketplace of ideas in Tigray. Both factions hold public meetings freely to build support and haven’t resorted to using the state's coercive power to resolve their differences, as happened after the bloody 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritreawar. Any move by Tigray’s security forces in support of either faction would plunge the region into violence At the same time, various parts of Tigrayan society have become more assertive and organised, challenging both factions publicly and urging them to avoid violence. This has opened the political space with media outlets, intellectuals, civic organisations, youth and the diaspora expressing different perspectives on politics in Tigray. Healthy debates among the government, parties and social forces are emerging, which could encourage a more open society and non-violent politics – if sustained. The very existence of the two factions may lead to a more balanced, equitable political environment – if they become separate political parties. However, the situation is fragile. Both factions seek support from the Tigray security forces, which is a dangerous move against peace. Getachew’s group claims the TIA commands the security forces, but Debretsion’s faction refutes this. So far, the security forces have largely kept their neutral posture, with their leaders committing to maintaining peace and preventing looming anarchy in Tigray. At this point, any move by Tigray’s security forces to support either faction would plunge the region into more violence. Both sides have popular support, with the youth demanding real changes in the political landscape. Most Tigray security force members are young, so any misstep by their leaders could lead them into violence that will be hard to control. The TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome Another consideration is that the TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome. Any attempt by the Debretsion-led faction or other actors against the TIA will affect the federal government’s interests and could result in military interventions and further crisis. The region fought hard for self-administration and self-determination, so Tigrayans would struggle to accept such interventions. Delays in fully implementing the CoHA may also lead to conflict. The federal government committed to facilitating the return and reintegration of IDPs and refugees, yet hundreds of thousands remain stranded and desperate. More than a million people are displaced in Tigray, and over 70 000 sought refuge in Sudan, which now faces its own civil war. Their continued suffering and frustrations could lead to more violence unless solved urgently. The federal government also pledged to protect civilians and Tigray’s territories from foreign incursion, but variousreportsshow Eritrean forces are still in Tigray and continue committing atrocities against civilians. Recently, the US Special Envoy to the Horn of Africa Ambassador Mike Hammerwarnedthat this presence of Eritrean forces could ‘flame an already tragic situation.’ To prevent another war in Tigray, the CoHA must be fully implemented and political tensions between the TPLF factions resolved. The international community, particularly the African Union, United Nations and United States – who brokered the CoHA, and the European Union, must persuade the TPLF factions to resolve their differences peacefully. All parties to the CoHA should also be encouraged to honour their commitments. Leaders of Tigray’s security forces must maintain their neutrality and avoid intervening in support of either TPLF faction, lest the region be turned into chaos.

Ukraine Repels Russian Aerial Attack On Kyiv	Ukraine's military deployed air-defense systems late Saturday to repel an aerial assault on Kyiv, according to the capital's top elected official. 'Stay in shelters!' Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the scope of the aerial assault. Saturday's attack follows a visit to the city by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who said a Ukrainian defeat would mean 'chaos' for the international order. According to Agence France-Presse, Barrot's speech came hours after Russian forces issued a statement claiming that they'd captured another village in the country's east. Barrot's visit, aimed at underlining Paris' unflinching support for Ukraine, comes at the end of a week in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled his 'victory plan' to defeat Russia, again calling for beefed-up Western backing. 'A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,' said Barrot, who also warned that recent reports of North Korean regular troops supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, if verified, would constitute a serious escalation of the war. France's top diplomat also said Paris was open to the idea of an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, but that talks would continue on the subject with allies. Barrot's stop in Kyiv coincided with the G7 defense ministerial meeting in Naples, Italy, which saw a pledge of 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, including vows of military aid, according to a final statement. 'We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,' read the group's final statement following the one-day summit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8-N0DvfNDp6k	2024-10-19T17:24:04-07:00	
Making The Most Of EU Catch-All Control On Cyber-Surveillance Exp...	By Dr Mark Bromley and Giovanna Maletta In 2021 the European Union (EU) adopted a new iteration of the EU Dual-use Regulation, which sets common standards for EU member states’ controls on exports ofdual-use items. Among other new features,Regulation (EU) 2021/821introduces a new ‘catch-all control’ for cyber-surveillance items. This requires exporters to seek approval for exports of cyber-surveillance items when they become aware that the items are likely to be used in connection with human rights violations, even if those items are not specifically covered by existing export controls. It therefore gives EU member states the power to control such transfers. Although the proliferation and misuse of spyware and other cyber-surveillance tools are growing concerns, the use of the new catch-all control has been limited to date. One likely reason is that exporters appear to be unclear about how to apply it. This week, the EU published a newset of guidelinesintended to help exporters to comply with the catch-all control. This backgrounder examines the catch-all control and the new guidelines, highlighting their main features and limitations. It also suggests steps that could be taken by the newly elected European Parliament and others to improve the guidelines and support consistent, effective application of both the new catch-all control and restrictions on the trade in cyber-surveillance items more broadly. Export controls and cyber-surveillance tools Export controls rely on ‘control lists’ of specific items or categories of items that may only be exported after obtaining a licence from the competent national authorities. However, it is difficult to ensure that these lists cover all relevant items, especially in areas where technologies are developing rapidly. Moreover, there are products that are not controlled because they fall outside the technical thresholds but could nonetheless be used in ways the regulations aim to prevent. States have responded to this challenge by introducing ‘catch-all controls’ that impose a licence requirement on exports of non-listed items that are nevertheless likely to be used in prohibited ways or by prohibited end-users. The control list of the EU Dual-use Regulation is found in Annex I and is based on the control lists adopted by theWassenaar Arrangementand other multilateral export control regimes. Five categories of cyber-surveillance tools have been added to Annex I since 2013, toaddress concernsabout the misuse of these cyber-surveillance items by state actors in ways that threaten other states’ national security (for example, to enable the theft of sensitive data or attacks on critical infrastructure), or in connection with violations of human rights (for example, to facilitate the repression of political opponents through torture or unlawful detention). However, there are additional cyber-surveillance tools that are not captured by the EU dual-use control list. There are also many technologies that have legitimate civilian uses but that can be repurposed as cyber-surveillance tools or their subcomponents. To date, the EU’s control list includes no such ‘truly dual-use’ technologies—only what are better described as ‘single-use’ technologies that are specifically designed for use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. States have so far been unwilling to control exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools and related subcomponents for fear of disrupting the trade in legitimate cybersecurity tools. The new EU catch-all control on cyber-surveillance items and the accompanying guidelines have the potential to help close these gaps by expanding the set of cyber-surveillance items that are subject to control and selectively targeting exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools. The EU cyber-surveillance catch-all control Prior to 2021 the EU Dual-use Regulation included three catch-all controls on non-listed items that may contribute to a weapons of mass destruction programme, have a ‘military end-use’ in a state subject to an arms embargo, or be used as parts or components in illegally exported military equipment. Article 5 of the 2021 Dual-use Regulation adds a new catch-all control that applies to non-listed cyber-surveillance items that ‘may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with internal repression and/or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law’. Article 5 can be triggered in two ways. The national licensing authority can notify an exporter of the requirement for a licence. However, exporters are also obliged to inform their national licensing authority if, on the basis of their own due diligence findings, they become aware that the items are intended for a prohibited end-use, in which case the authority may decide the export cannot go ahead. One category of non-listed cyber-surveillance items that might be subject to a licence requirement under the catch-all control is mobile phone hacking services, which trick wireless carriers’ servers into revealing the location data of their users. Switzerlandhas proposedthat mobile phone hacking tools be covered by the Wassenaar Arrangement control list but this is unlikely to happen in the near future due to political divisions within the group. Another category is data-retention systems, which store collected surveillance data for later use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. These have also been proposed for control at the Wassenaar Arrangement and are included in the national control lists ofGermany and Spain. Truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools that might be covered by the catch-all control include, for example, tools for capturing and analysing biometric data, such as facial recognition tools. Another type isdual-intent tools, such as vulnerability scanners, that are designed to help organizations test their own vulnerability to cyberattacks but can also be used to perpetrate malicious cyberattacks. One important type of subcomponent that might be captured by the catch-all control isdeep packet inspection (DPI) technologies. DPI has a wide range of legitimate cybersecurity applications but is also used to enable the functioning of some cyber-surveillance tools. The new guidelines and what they say Article 5 of the Dual-use Regulation states that the Commission and Council ‘shall make available guidelines for exporters’ on how to implement their obligations under the catch-all control. The newCommission Recommendation (EU) 2024/2659, which was released on 16 October 2024 (but dated 11 October), fulfils that requirement. The guidelines are mainly concerned with clarifying for exporters when they should alert the licensing authority about a potential export. To do this they elaborate on the content of Article 5 and the definition of cyber-surveillance items provided by the Dual-use Regulation. This section looks at key aspects of those explanations and their implications. ‘Specially designed to enable . . . covert surveillance’ The Dual-use Regulation defines cyber-surveillance items as ‘dual-use items specially designed to enable the covert surveillance of natural persons by monitoring, extracting, collecting or analysing data from information and telecommunication systems’. According to the new guidelines, ‘specially designed’ means that covert surveillance must have been the ‘main purpose’ of the item’s development and design, although the item may have other possible uses. ‘Covert surveillance’ is explained as occurring when a person ‘cannot objectively expect to be under surveillance’. This definition potentially brings mobile phone hacking tools, data-retention systems and certain types of dual-intent product within the scope of Article 5. Less clear is if and how facial recognition and other biometric tools would be captured. Both the European Parliament and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)have advocatedfor biometric tools to be subject to controls, and in July 2024 it wasproposedthat facial recognition tools be included in the national control list of the United States. However, many of the mostconcerning applicationsof biometric tools involve the use of footage collected from CCTV cameras that are publicly visible. The guidelines say that ‘[f]acial and emotion recognition technologies that can be used to monitor or analyse stored video images, could fall within the scope of the definition of cyber-surveillance item’. However, if the system is drawing its data from publicly visible CCTV, then it is hard to see how it would meet the criterion ‘specially designed to enable...covert surveillance’, creating ambiguity. ‘Awareness’ that the items are ‘intended . . . for’ Regulation 2021/821 and the new guidelines reflect a wider trend in which NGOs and states are pushing for exporters to take on more responsibility for identifying potentially sensitive exports. Article 5 obliges an exporter to notify the authorities if it is ‘aware, according to its due diligence findings’ that cyber-surveillance items it proposes to export are intended for the proscribed uses. The guidelines state that ‘'aware' ... implies that the exporter has positive knowledge of the intended misuse’ and that ‘the exporter should assess the end-use on a case-by-case basis, in light of the specific circumstances of that case’ in order to identify whether an item may be ‘intended for’ a sensitive end-use. Significantly, the guidelines indicate that the due-diligence obligations apply not only to exporters of finished cyber-surveillance tools but also to exporters of products that ‘could be used as part or component’ of such a system. If the product was ‘specially designed to enable ... covert surveillance’, this implies that the catch-all control could potentially apply to exports of components such as DPI technologies that might be sold as civilian products but later integrated into a cyber-surveillance system. ‘Internal repression’, ‘serious violation of human rights’ and ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’ To clarify what may constitute prohibited uses, the guidelines refer to language used in both the EU Common Position on arms exports (2008/944/CFSP) and its accompanyinguser’s guide. According to the Common Position, ‘internal repression includes ... torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, summary or arbitrary executions, disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other major violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in relevant international human rights instruments’. The user’s guide states that ‘the current and past record’ of the end-user and recipient country with regard to human rights should be considered to assess the risk of an exported item being used for internal repression. Similarly, for the interpretation of ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’, the guidelines again refer to the Common Position user’s guide, which calls for assessing the recipient’s attitude towards international humanitarian law (IHL) by looking at its record, its formal commitments and its capacity to uphold relevant provisions. The Dual-use Regulation uses the Common Position as a point of reference for licensing authorities in making licensing decisions, so it is logical to also use it as a reference point for exporters assessing potential exports of cyber-surveillance tools. However, the Common Position and its user’s guide are focused on transfers of military equipment and do not consider several issues relevant to transfers of dual-use items and cyber-surveillance tools or other items captured by the Dual-use Regulation. In particular, they do not consider factors that would be relevant for assessing the recipient’s record regarding the appropriate use of cyber-surveillance tools or consider the specific IHL risks that might arise in connection with their use. Next steps for Article 5 and the guidelines Regulation 2021/821 tasks the Commission with conducting an evaluation, ‘after 10 September 2024’, of the new catch-all control for cyber-surveillance items. This gives the newly elected European Parliament and others an opportunity to clarify the intended coverage of the new catch-all control and strengthen the EU’s and EU member states’ controls on cyber-surveillance tools more broadly. These steps should include the following: Develop case studies In feedback on the first draft of the guidelines, which was published in March 2023, businesses and other stakeholders asked for ‘concrete practical examples’ of cyber-surveillance items potentially requiring an export licence under Article 5, accompanied by relevant case studies. These have not been included in the published guidelines. Although the guidelines rightly note that it is ‘impossible to provide an exhaustive list of those products that may be controlled as 'non-listed items' under Article 5’, it should be possible to develop real or fictional case studies. This could be done collaboratively by the Commission, the European Parliament, EU member states and NGOs through the use of tabletop exercises. Add language on cyber-surveillance risks to the Common Position user’s guide The new guidelines make frequent reference to Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and its user’s guide. While these documents are useful on issues of human rights and IHL, they do not specifically address issues relating to the use and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools. In order to improve the value and comprehensiveness of the user’s guide, the European Parliament could recommend revising it to cover both military items and items captured by the Dual-use Regulation and include detailed language on assessing risks associated with cyber-surveillance tools. This could be done as part of the currentreview of the Common Position, which is expected to conclude by the end of 2024. Build connections with other areas of policymaking Addressing the proliferation and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools is a complex challenge that cannot be achieved through any single policy instrument. Building on its 2023 inquiry to investigate the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware, the European Parliament could push for the development of a common and coordinated EU approach for controlling not only the export but also the procurement and use of cyber-surveillance tools. In response to theEuropean Parliament’s recommendationsfollowing the inquiry, the Commission is currently working on adraft communicationthat will reportedly focus on addressing the possible misuse of cyber-surveillance tools at the national level. This communication and the publication of the Article 5 guidelines create the opportunity for a more coordinated set of policy responses at the EU level. As part of this approach, the EU should coordinate with theUSA-led initiative to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which seeks to adopt a more comprehensive policy response. With support from the Open Society Foundations, the SIPRI Dual-Use and Ams Trade Control Programme is conducting a project focused on improving the implementation of export controls related to surveillance technologies.

Widening The War: The US Sends Troops To Israel – OpEd	The dangers should be plastered on every wall in every office occupied by a military and political advisor. Israel’s attempt to reshape the Middle East, far from giving it enduring security, will merely serve to make it more vulnerable and unstable than ever. In that mix and mess will be its greatest sponsor and guardian, the United States, a giant of almost blind antiquity in all matters concerning the Jewish state. In a measure that should have garnered bold headlines, the Biden administration has announced the deployment of some 100 US soldiers to Israel who will be responsible for operating the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. They are being sent to a conflict that resembles a train travelling at high speed, with no risk of stopping. As Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant promised in the aftermath of Iran’s October 1 missile assault on his country, 'Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising.' It would be of such a nature that 'They will not understand what happened and how it happened.' In an October 16 meeting between the Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Gallant, the deployment of a mobile THAAD battery was seen 'as an operational example of the United States’ ironclad support to the defense of Israel.' Largely meaningless bits of advice were offered to Gallant: that Israel 'continue taking steps to address the dire humanitarian situation' and take 'all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security' of UN peacekeepers operating in Lebanon’s south. The charade continued the next day in a conversation between Austin and Gallant discussing the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. THAAD was again mentioned as essential for Israel’s 'right to defence itself' while representing the 'United States’ unwavering, enduring, and ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.' ('Ironclad' would seem to be the word of the moment, neatly accompanying Israel’s own Iron Dome defence system.) A statement from the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, was a fatuous effort in minimising the dangers of the deployment. The battery would merely 'augment Israel’s integrated air defense system,' affirm the ongoing commitment to Israel’s defence and 'defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks from Iran.' The very public presence of US troops, working alongside their Israeli counterparts in anticipation of broadening conflict, does not merely suggest Washington’s failure to contain their ally. It entails a promise of ceaseless supply, bolstering and emboldening. Furthermore, it will involve placing US troops in harm’s way, a quixotic invitation if ever there was one. As things stand, the US is already imperilling its troops by deploying them in a series of bases in Jordan, Syria and Iraq. Iran’s armed affiliates have been making their presence felt, harrying the stationed troops with increasing regularity since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7 last year. A gradual, attritive toll is registering, featuring such attacks as those on the Tower 22 base in northern Jordan in January that left three US soldiers dead. Writing in August for The Guardian, former US army major Harrison Mann eventually realised an awful truth about the mounting assaults on these sandy outposts of the US imperium: 'there was no real plan to protect US troops beyond leaving them in their small, isolated bases while local militants, emboldened and agitated by US support for Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, used them for target practice.' To send more aircraft and warships to the Middle East also served to encourage 'reckless escalation towards a wider war,' providing insurance to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could be protected 'from the consequences of his actions.' Daniel Davis, a military expert at Defense Priorities, is firmly logical on the point of enlisting US personnel in the Israeli cause. 'Naturally, if Americans are killed in the execution of their duties, there will be howls from the pro-war hawks in the West ‘demanding’ the president ‘protect our troops’ by firing back on Iran.' It was 'exactly the sort of thing that gets nations sucked into war they have no interest in fighting.' Polling, insofar as that measure counts, suggests that enthusiasm for enrolling US troops in Israel’s defence is far from warm. In results from a survey published by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations in August, some four in ten polled would favour sending US troops to defend Israel if it was attacked by Iran. Of the sample, 53% of Republicans would favour defending Israel in that context, along with four in 10 independents (42%), and a third of Democrats (34%). There have also been some mutterings from the Pentagon itself about Israel’s burgeoning military effort, in particular against the Lebanese Iran-backed militia, Hezbollah. In a report from The New York Times, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., is said to be worried about the widening US presence in the region, a fact that would hamper overall 'readiness' of the US in other conflicts. Being worried is just the start of it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8zFK0VLYUxLj	2024-10-19T17:16:26-07:00	
China’s Information War In Africa – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya and Yuvvraj Singh In 2014, during the Central Foreign Affairs meeting in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping advocated for strengthening China’s soft power globally by improving how the country communicates its message. In the subsequent years, Chinese state-controlled media focused on cultural investments and international cooperation, establishing marketing networks and expanding the reach of quality cultural assets abroad, particularly in Africa. China’s African outreach China’s information campaigns in Africa are subtle, focusing on economic issues and promoting apositive narrativearound its investments, mainly in the Belt and Road Initiative. State-controlled media outlets likeXinhua, China Daily, China Radio International (CRI), and CGTN(formerly CCTV International) play a vital role in this narrative. Meanwhile, StarTimes, a Chinese-owned media company, has become Africa’ssecond-largestdigital TV provider, with over 13 million digital TV and 20 million streaming subscribers. It has invested over US$2 billionin digital TV infrastructure across 30 African countries. Additionally, China actively produces documentaries to enhance its soft power, such as Africans in Yiwu, TAZARA: A Journey without an End, and Bobby’s Factory. For instance, the docuseries 'Bobby’s Factory' focuses on a Chinese factory owner in Africa and his positive interactions with local workers. Another series, 'TAZARA: A Journey without an End', highlights the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project, a symbol of China-Africa cooperation under the broader umbrella of BRI. Consisting of three episodes, 'A Railway of Friendship', 'The Life Line', and 'Love for Tazara', the docuseries delves into the emotional connection of the railway line and how it positively impacted Tanzanian youth. Similarly, 'Africans in Yiwu-Chinese Meet Africa' depicts stories of hardworking and enterprising people living in Africa and their efforts to bridge the China-Africa gap. Finally, ‘My China Story’ features Africans sharing positive experiences from their time in China, further shaping a favourable image among younger generations. China’s information strategy in Africa China has adopted a three-pronged strategy in its information campaign in Africa. First, it hosts and trains numerous African media professionals each year, teaching them to promote Chinese investments as a positive force. Second, China invests in local African media outlets, influencing their editorial practices to align with the Chinese narrative. For example, StarTimes formed a joint venture with the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), securing a majority stake. Finally, China sells technology to African governments that enables tighter control over digital information, including blocking websites and shutting down internet access. During the 2020 Tigray Conflict in Ethiopia, for instance, Ethio Telecom used technology and expertise from Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE to suppress dissent and limit information flow. Chinese content frequentlydownplays local criticismsof its projects, such as labour disputes, environmental issues, and debt concerns, leading to a distorted view of Sino-African relations. DuringZambia’s 2016 elections, Chinese-owned and local media outlets portrayed Chinese investments as beneficial to Zambia’s future economy, favouring pro-China candidate Edgar Lungu. InKenya’s 2017 elections, China’s increasing role as an infrastructure financier was prominently featured. CGTN Africa portrayed the erstwhile President Uhuru Kenyatta as a symbol of modernity and progress, stressing his consent for projects like the Standard Gauge Railway while overlooking public concerns about sustainability and costs and minimising opposition critiques. In Zimbabwe,China has actively supported the ZANU-PFPolitical Party byrestricting civil societymovements and opposition and advancing narratives favourable to China’s interests in politics and business. In order to negotiate contracts and trade agreements, China also generates new narratives. Angola, a major oil producer, has received substantial Chinese infrastructure loans in exchange for future oil exports to China. Chinese media have framed these infrastructure projects as 'infrastructure-for-oil,' portraying them as vital for Angola’s recovery after decades of Civil War. This strategy has ultimately enabled China to gain long-term access to Angola’s oil reserves at favourable prices. Similar tactics were observed in Zambia, where the China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC) secured a significant stake in Zambian copper mines, aided by favourable media coverage that overlooked labour issues and environmental concerns. Similarly, China established a presence at Djibouti’s Doraleh Multipurpose Port as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, downplaying worries about Djibouti’s increasing reliance on Chinese loans. Other strategically important projects, such as Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport and Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, allowed China to reap significant economic and geopolitical advantages by undermining debt concerns and promoting a pro-China narrative. China’s media influence under scrutiny Local perceptions are evolving as more and more African nations speak out against the adverse consequences of Chinese narrative-building.Hakainde Hichilema, the President of Zambia, has voiced concerns about the growing influence of foreign countries in the media, citing China, in particular, for shaping narratives and favouring specific perspectives. Similarly, Chinese investments and loans are frequently presented in an unduly flattering light, according toOby Ezekwesili, a former politician from Nigeria who is currently the Vice President of the World Bank Africa. Ezekwesili has questioned the lack of transparency in contracts granted to Chinese enterprises. She has alleged significant narrative control by Chinese-backed media. Concerns regarding Chinese-owned social media apps like TikTok are also growing because they are perceived to be susceptible to politically-driven actions. Several nations, like Senegal and Somalia,formally prohibitedthe app in 2023, claiming security and moral concerns. Others, including South Africa and Kenya, have petitioned againstWeChat and TikTok, among other apps. Controlling the narratives CCP’s investments in the African media landscape influence access to information and shape key narratives, although the impact of Chinese messaging remains mixed. Officials within African regimes are often more receptive to China’s governance model and messaging. However, ordinary Africans bear the brunt of this narrative battle, inundated with conflicting misinformation designed to sway public opinion and erode societal cohesion. There is an urgent need for awareness campaigns to educate these politicians about the long-term risks to their sovereignty.

Indonesia’s Tax Reforms Risk Being Undermined By Reckless Spendin...	By Yosephine Uliarta Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has beendeclining for over a decade, standing at 12.1 per cent in 2022 — just above Laos in ASEAN and well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3 per cent and the OECD average of 34 per cent. In response,tax reformshave been ongoing, with two major policies set to take effect soon —Core Tax Administration System (CTAS)by the end of 2024 and a potential value-added tax (VAT) rate increase in 2025. The long-awaited CTAS will modernise Indonesia’s tax system by integrating all tax processes into a unified platform, using accurate data to enhance oversight and improve collection. CTAS is expected to expand the tax base and increase efficiency by identifying new taxable objects and untapped revenue potential, improving compliance and making it easier to track income sources. Along with the introduction of aSingle ID for taxationin 2022, it will boost Indonesia’s low personal income tax (PIT) collection. Indonesia’stax revenue structurerelies heavily on corporate taxes (28.8 per cent) and VAT (28 per cent), while the contribution of PIT remains minimal (13 per cent).International trendsshow that countries with higher tax-to-GDP ratios typically generate a large share of revenue from PIT. Most PIT revenue in Indonesia comes from employees, whose taxes are automatically withheld by employers, while self-reported taxes from business owners, doctors and lawyers remain nonoptimal.The tax gap— the difference between potential and actual collections — was 42 per cent for overall PIT and a striking 80 per cent for non-employee income taxes in 2019. The small contribution of PIT is not unique to Indonesia. Due to limited capacity in collecting VAT,less developed countriesshould maximise revenue through easier-to-collect taxes, such as VAT, while continuing to reform PIT. VAT is harder to evade, making it a more reliable tool for revenue generation. Indonesia has already begun reforming its VAT system through the 2021 Tax Harmonization Law, which mandates a VAT rate increase from 11 to 12 per cent as early as 2025. This will bring Indonesia’s VAT rate closer to the OECD average (19 per cent) and global average (15.4 per cent). VAT is often criticised for being regressive —affecting lower-income households disproportionately. But this concern can be mitigated by strengthening targeted social assistance programs, offsetting the rate increase impact on lower-income groups. What matters ultimately is the overall distributional effect of the fiscal system, not just the impact of an isolated policy. Additionally, VAT is not imposed to basic necessities such as food, healthcare and education. While the VAT hike is necessary, the current economic downturn — marked bycontraction in the manufacturing sectoranddeclining consumer purchasing power— means raising VAT in 2025 could worsen financial pressures. Fortunately, the law includes flexibility, allowing the government to adjust the timing of the VAT increase according to economic conditions and providing the option to delay the hike if necessary. Indonesia is moving in the right direction with its tax reforms, but it’s important to recognise that much of the increased revenue from optimising personal income tax and VAT will come from the middle class. This group already bears asignificant tax burden, providing 42 per cent of indirect taxes (VAT and excises) and representing the majority of Indonesia’s income taxpayers. Naturally, they will expect public benefits and better governance in return for their contributions and their political importance cannot be underestimated. Tax reform success depends not just on raising revenue but on how well those funds are spent. Effective delivery of public goods builds support for higher taxes, while reckless spending erodes trust. Ideally, tax and expenditure reforms should go hand in hand, but this alignment is lacking in Indonesia. While revenue efforts are underway, several questionable spending plans risk undermining public support. The government’s plan to cut the Public Service Obligation (PSO) subsidy andadjust commuter train faresin greater Jakarta based on income levels could raise fares for the already financially strained middle class, despite the principle that public transport should serve all citizens equally. The president-elect’s proposal for a nationwide free school meal program has also raised concerns about itseffectivenessandfunding, which may divert essential resources from education and lower the education budget below legally required levels. More broadly,delays in budget disbursementand the failure to meet spending targets have historically undermined the effectiveness of public programs. These spending choices, along with the slow pace of disbursement, highlight a disconnect between tax reform efforts and the responsible, timely use of public funds. As Indonesia advances with its tax reforms, it is crucial to ensure these efforts aren’t undermined by reckless spending. A budget reveals a government’s true priorities, where policy goals meet the reality of implementation, determining how resources are raised and allocated. Responsible budgeting builds and sustains public trust. About the author: Yosephine Uliarta is a Master’s student at the Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University.

They Have The Money, We Have The Numbers – OpEd	Authoritarianism is back across the West — from Europe to the Biden-Harris censorship regime that would fit perfectly in Communist China. I think many of us were surprised during Covid to realize just what the supposedly liberal West has become: Essentially the Soviet Union but with better uniforms — well, better video games, anyway. Of course, it was decades in the making — Covid just showed their cards. The question, as always, is What’s Next.For better or worse, authoritarianism has happened many times in history — it’s kind of the human default. The original state. Humanity has a lot of experience with authoritarianism. So how did people protect themselves last time? Dodging Tyranny in the 1940s An elegant illustration is the 1940s, where essentially the entire globe went authoritarian socialist and then — as always — went to war. And the correct response very much depended on where you were. If you were in New York, you adjusted your stock portfolio. FDR’s 52nd birthday party, dressed as Caesar. The fasces bottom right is unintentionally apt. If you were in Britain you moved to the countryside and stockpiled canned food. If you were in Switzerland you packed a go-bag in case the German army decided to fill in the map. And if you were in Germany, of course, the only plan was to get the heck out. The problem is when to pull each trigger: When do you adjust the portfolio? Buy the canned food? Pack the go-bag? When do you get the heck out? Each of these preparations has a cost. And the more successful you are — the more you’ve built or achieved — the higher those costs go. Moving your family, your business, converting your career to location-independent where you can support your family. People ask why people didn’t leave Berlin before it was too late, and those costs are why. The good news is that this means the vast majority of us will stay and fight. I mean, true patriots will always stay and fight. But those mounting costs mean even apolitical people will fight. They will fight in proportion to the risk — because the cost rises with it. And they will fight in proportion to what they’ve built. That is, the people with the most to lose – the natural elite – are the most likely to stay. Every election since George W we’ve been treated to Hollywood liberals threatening to leave the country. You don’t hear influential people on the other side saying that. We will stay. The Bleaker It Gets, the Better Our Odds And stay we should. Because I know I’ve made this point repeatedly in videos, but we are going to win. Why? Partly tactical. They launched their takeover too soon. Because Covid fell into their lap, and they were still a generation away from the brainwashing it would take for a totalitarian takeover. Instead, the people rejected it. The Covid state left dangerous remnants, to be sure, that will become malignant if not excised. Still, it’s striking — perhaps unprecedented — the degree to which a totalitarian regime, once installed, was almost entirely removed. And the reason is encouraging: Because it polled atrociously — you may remember the Dems turning as one just after Biden assumed office. In other words, even with our shabby election infrastructure, they still fear the people. What remains post-Covid is an institutionalized left that has lost credibility with the majority. That is overextended, that has completely lost touch with the people. This loss of legitimacy means they are far weaker than pre-Covid. And Democracy is coming for them. Liberty’s Moment We’re already seeing the backlash with Trump surging in the polls, with Canada on deck next year, and European countries electing populists. Even more encouraging, if you zoom out rarely in history has liberty had so many advantages. Thanks to the internet — with a big assist from Elon. Of course, liberty starts out with the advantage that man is not by nature a slave. Slavery is an unstable equilibrium. It’s fragile. Just waiting for the right push. But this is up against the natural advantage of authoritarianism — it has the money. And money buys guns. It has the money because it seizes half of what you earn and uses it against you, then prints up whatever else it needs at the central bank. Then it uses that money to control the levers of society, from education to media to finance. We have the numbers, they have the money. Trust in Government Collapsing in Both Parties. What’s Next If it comes down to numbers vs money, our numbers are growing fast. Moreover, gloriously, the more they push the more we grow. Meaning they only have 2 options: pull back and hold on for dear life against the backlash. Or keep pushing and they’re out of power. It’s only a matter of time. In the 1970’s the great economist Murray Rothbard noted that you could fit the entire liberty movement in a New York living room. Now there are literally a billion of us. Forget a living room, we couldn’t fit in a state. Meanwhile their advantage – money – is collapsing before our eyes. Crashing in crippling debt, nervous financial markets, the limits of inflationary printing, and the moribund stagflation that always accompanies it. In short, we’re getting stronger. They’re getting weaker. And the longer it takes, the more spectacular will be our victory.

California’s Coastal Commission Ramps Up Partisan Zealotry – OpEd	In 2022, the California Coastal Commission (CCC)rejected the Poseidon desalination plantthat would have provided Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. The CCC has now rejected a plan by the Space Force to boost the number of launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was allegedly based on environmental concerns, but the real reason recently came to light. In August, the commission asked the Space Force to monitor more closely howsonic booms affect southern sea otters, California red-legged frogs, the western snowy plover and the California least tern. Commissioner Kristina Kunkel worried that the CCC could be 'bullied into ignoring environmental protections' but by October it was apparent that the real problem wasSpaceX and its founder Elon Musk. 'Elon Musk is hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods,' claimed Commissioner Gretchen Newsom,political directorfor the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and not related to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The governor did appoint commissioner Mike Wilson, who is on the same page as commissioner Newsom. 'This company [SpaceX] is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most expansive communications system in the planet,' Wilson proclaimed, and 'just last week that person was talking about political retribution.' Commissioner Caryl Hart also targeted Musk, who builds Tesla electric cars. 'We’re dealing with a company, the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the presidential race,' proclaimed Hart, an attorney and author of a dissertation on 'California State Parks and Climate Change.' Hart wants SpaceX to apply for a coastal development permit issued by the Commission. Commissioner Susan Lowenberg is 'beyond pissed' and proclaims 'I don’t understand why our own government is thumbing their nose at another branch of our government.' Perhaps this is because the California Coastal Commission was not elected by the people of California. A 1972 ballot initiative created a temporary commission aimed at preventing environmental disasters, like the1969 oil spillnear Santa Barbara. The California Coastal Act of 1976, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, made the commission permanent. Since then the CCC has run roughshod over property rights, and ramped up corruption. As Californians might recall, when Hollywood celebrities sought permits for swimming pools and such, commissioner Mark Nathanson, appointed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, hit them up for bribes. In 1993, Nathanson drew aprison sentenceof nearly five years for extortion. Under the command of regulatory zealots likelongtime director Peter Douglas, the commission blocked development and made coastal residency practically impossible for working people. The unelected CCC also projected its regulatory reach intotheme parks such as Sea Worldanddictated the rulesof surfing tournaments. The Poseidon Desalination Plant in Huntington Beach was in progress for 20 years and supported by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, including Gov. Newsom. The CCC turned it down with commissioner Dayna Bochco explaining that 'the ocean is under attack from climate change already.' Bochco is the wife of the late Steven Bochco and served as president of Steven Bochco Productions, producers of 'Doogie Howser MD,' 'Cop Rock' and other television shows. The CCC did approve theDoheny Ocean Desalination Plant, which will produce five million gallons of water a day, much less than the plant that got rejected. An unelected, unaccountable body thus prevents California from deriving maximum benefit from the Pacific Ocean, the state’s greatest natural resource. The commission now seeks to block Space Force launches because a majority of commissioners dislike Elon Musk. By now the lessons should be clear. The elected officials of California’s coastal cities and counties are fully capable of handling their own affairs and dealing with the Space Force. It is long past time to eliminate the Coastal Commission, a partisan political body that exists only to preserve its own power. Meanwhile, more than 50 years after the Santa Barbara oil spill, the greatest source of oil in the ocean is natural seepage from the ocean floor. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) natural seeps in Southern California addfive million gallonsto the ocean annually. In the Coal Oil Point area near Santa Barbara, 4,200 to 25,000 gallons of oil seep into the ocean per day. According to NOAA, the seeps have been leaking for 'thousands of years' and an oil seep is the possible cause of anoil sheen off Huntington Beachlast March.

Patrushev Using New Position To Promote Changes In Russian Naval ...	When Putin transferred Nikolay Patrushev from his position as secretary of the Russian Security Council and appointed him as a presidential assistant in charge of the restored Naval Collegium, many saw that as a clear demotion and even suggested it might cause Putin to challenge Putin. Those suggestions (cf. windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/06/putins-recent-personnel-moves-threaten.html and have overshadowed and distracted attention from a more important development. As Vzglyad commentator Aleksandr Timokhin argues, Patrushev has used his new position to promote the rebuilding of Russian naval and merchant marine capacity and to lead Putin to adopt a far more aggressive stance against the West on the world’s oceans (vz.ru/society/2024/10/17/1292275.html). Indeed, he implies, Patrushev may have emerged from his supposed demotion in an even stronger position and one with more immediate and troubling consequences to the West than even his sometimes paranoid denunciations of what he sees the West as doing inside Russia (e.g., jamestown.org/program/kremlin-worried-about-ukrainian-wedges-inside-russia/ and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/08/newly-elevated-naval-collegium-to.html). In his new position, Patrushev has been working to overcome three major obstacles to Russia’s becoming a major naval power: the longstanding Russian focus on the army rather than the navy as the basis of its strength, serious problems in Russian shipbuilding, and the paucity of exercises that can serve to intimidate others by highlighting Russia’s strength in this area. As Timokhin notes, these three problems have combined to lead to the decline of the Russian fleet since Soviet times, leaving the country’s navy with only approximately a quarter of the ships in the Armenian navy and meaning that there is not a single book in recent times on the uses of the Russian fleet in non-nuclear conflicts with the West. Putin has put Patrushev in this position to overcome these problems, the commentator continues; and Patrushev has the knowledge and energy to achieve far more in this regard than the Russian naval leadership has achieved in recent decades, putting it on course to be far better able to respond to and challenge the navies of the West.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i88We9OTyuil5	2024-10-19T16:49:27-07:00	
ASEAN Must Reform Or Face Decay – Analysis	ASEAN has a long and rich history, but its main tenets and essence of its self-induced mantra of principles have many times failed to spark new confidence in bracing for the tough challenges to come. The recently concluded ASEAN Summit and Related Summits in Vientiane have also portrayed the same old trappings within the entity and beyond exposing the deep lying structural and systemic loopholes and internal weaknesses that have over the decades slowed progress and frustrated many within and without, over the road not taken. The division within ASEAN has weakened unity and collective resolve, giving other powers the advantage of dealing with member states individually rather than with ASEAN as a whole. Previous mechanisms, such as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DoC) and efforts to accelerate the Code of Conduct (CoC) process, are seen as only preventive frameworks that establish guardrails and norms of behavior in the South China Sea. These mechanisms do not directly address the resolution of disputes but merely ensure that behaviours in the contested zones adheres to an agreed code of ethics and procedures, relying on the goodwill of involved states to follow norms and exercise self-restraint. However, the core issues remain unresolved, particularly the need for compliance with international law and maritime law, ensuring that actions do not exceed agreed-upon limits. These laws serve as the foundation for peace, stability, and behavior, based on the rule of law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, in line with international law. They should not be interpreted according to historical perspectives or individual viewpoints. The focus should be on deepening ties with other equally, if not more, important powers in the region especially India and Australia apart from the traditional and conventional powers that have been relied upon in trade, economic development and technological advancement and inflow. Existing economic, trade and people to people ties that have been robust with Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul must also be enhanced to have the long term spillover impact on matters of greater priorities and areas of high politics, transitioning from low politics. Defence and security ties with Seoul and Tokyo present a vast opening for solidification, with Tokyo's OSA and RAA initiatives providing a more reliable fallback defence and deterrent capacities for the region and the country, apart from aligning with the arch of democracies that will stand ready to defend the rules based order. Structural and Systemic Limitations Old conventional approaches of ASEAN have seen ASEAN losing its relevance, strength and leverage to negotiate and fast becoming obsolete. New strategic moves to strengthen internal unity and capacity must also rely on the manoeuvre and political will to escape from past practices and limitations and to gain further weight and leverage in diversifying trade and economic dependence on the major neighbouring economic power and to lessen the baggage and strings involved, and also in increasing the bargaining chips and greater internal security and defence capacities by having more fallback options with the inclusion of new powers that have been neglected in the past, including Russia and India to be seen as the needed third force in the region both in defence and economic presence. Within ASEAN, there is a clear division in addressing this issue and in the response to China's actions, particularly between Manila and other actors. This division has created gaps in the collective approach to positioning ASEAN as a united entity in negotiations and dialogue with China. Manila has expressed frustration with ASEAN and other member states for not supporting its firm stance and physical responses in dealing with Chinese Coast Guard actions, which have led to the risk of confrontation. Other claimants within ASEAN prefer to continue using existing mechanisms to engage with China, aiming to avoid high-intensity confrontations and the risk of retaliation in other areas. Addressing the South China Sea disputes will also require considering potential future claims and changes, not just relying on the CoC or ASEAN's strategic hedging, balancing, or neutrality as a way out. Changes in global power dynamics and the concept of total power will alter the balance of economic and military capabilities, and it is not guaranteed that current dominant economic and military powers will maintain their strength in the future. ASEAN risks irrelevance and being obsolete unless it can jettison its past conventional trap of being a mere balancing entity and a bridge to appease both sides. It needs to make its stance loud and clear,which is to steadfastly align with, and protect the universal principles of the rules based order,the sanctity of international law and maritime law and in safeguarding the interests of each member's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It cannot continue being limited by its overwhelming focus on trade and economic returns without parallel focus on securing the stability, peace and international order in the region and in protecting each member's vulnerabilities and addressing their concerns. Internal economic and development divide has been ingrained, alongside weak internal cohesion on fundamental security concerns, with rising arms races and security dilemma. These core gaps and structural and systemic loopholes will first need serious regional political will to ensure that Asean remains relevant in the future, especially in moving away from its systemic trap of an ineffective security and economic provider and the inability to project wider global influence and escaping its middle powership projection. New Opening for New Reform Malaysia is expected to continue with the policy direction of maintaining strategic hedging and balancing between the two blocs of power, without risking economic and security ties with both China and the US. The concept of independence in foreign policymaking and neutrality is expected to continue with dependence on other emerging powers within the Global South, especially with India, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America and Africa on economic and trade diversification and also in strengthening supply chain and energy and food security and in boosting friendshoring efforts. All said, Malaysia will also expect to continue to strengthen defence and security fallback which will be important to the country in facing renewed threat settings and a volatile region, and will also not risk existing good ties in defence and security with the other power bloc. Malaysia's role as Chair of ASEAN provides a critical and strategic platform for leading the region and shaping new approaches to resolving the conflict in the South China Sea. In line with ASEAN's mantra of non-alignment and strategic hedging and balancing, Malaysia is expected to continue to steer the regional grouping towards this line of approach in dealing with both the West and China, taking into account past mechanisms and also calculating on future changes of possible risks and tensions and the need for continued adherence to decades old mechanism of ASEAN being the primary bridge and balancing role between both sides of the bloc. Concurrently, it is expected for ASEAN under the Malaysian leadership to expand and deepen the role of ASEAN in engaging with immediate neighbouring powers including the current set up of ASEAN + 3 and related Summits and cooperative domains, and also including new players including in South Asia, Middle East and Central Asia. The Need to Preserve the Rules Based Order The CoC will also not fundamentally solve the core contentious claim of the CoC, as it merely provides rules and guidelines on the conduct in the zones,and not providing conclusive judgment of the jurisdictions. As such, ASEAN must push for a concrete plan for upholding the agreed upon adherence to universal norms and the international law and maritime rules, and the freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters, all of which have formed the main basis of international peace and order since WWII, and that the region cannot afford to tolerate attempts to alter the rules based order which will disjoint the entire ecosystem of equality and common status under the rule of law and abiding by the UN Charter. The global system and other countries, as well as the UN, will continue to defend and support ASEAN's position and principles on this issue. This creates a critical platform for strengthening ASEAN's options and power, looking beyond the CoC, ASEAN TAC, SEANWFZ, or ASEAN-China dialogue as conventional conflict prevention mechanisms, while building new capacity without jeopardizing formal relations or ties with external powers. Therefore, the universal system that has maintained global peace and stability since WWII, such as the UN Charter and international law, must be the foundation and provide legitimacy for claimant states and ASEAN. This will serve as the most critical platform and a strong moral standing for asserting sovereignty without disrupting existing relationships, as these foundational principles provide a conviction of legitimacy and a rules-based moral standing. In this context, Malaysia has the opportunity to craft a new narrative, vision, and strategy to steer ASEAN toward a new nucleus of unity, based on the principles of a universal rules-based order, freedom of navigation, and respect for the sanctity of international law and the international law of the sea. This would send a clear message that ASEAN is no longer bound by the old framework, which is seen as weak and overly dependent on external economic pressures and influences. This new direction also demands a fresh concept of conflict deterrence, based on universal and holistic approaches that enhance internal capacity in the domain of hard power deterrence, economic resilience, and diversification of economic dependencies, along with a strong fallback option. Collectively, this will strengthen individual countries and ASEAN's ability to defend regional interests, sovereignty, and peace without compromising official and diplomatic relations with other powers. In a new era of rising autocratic tendencies and policies that have further worsened the risks of conflicts and miscalculations and weakened the fabric of international order based on rule of law and international norms, all free nations and the arch of democracy must not fail the world, in standing in solidarity to defend the beacon of freedom and democracy. Failure to do that will signal a historical misjudgment and mistake in preserving and saving the hard fought freedom and democracy and a rules based order that have preserved global peace for more than seven decades since WWII, and will allow unchecked aggression that will threaten peace anywhere. ASEAN therefore remains a critical forefront in this overall economic and security stability based on values and norms, and defending the freedom in the Indo Pacific will mean defending the freedom of the entire world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8xq1HFiqsCw3	2024-10-19T16:29:51-07:00	
Canada’s Vote Bank Politics: Domestic Compulsion And Foreign Poli...	Sri Lanka and India have become victims of Canada's ethnic vote bank politics. 'Vote bank politics' is a South Asian term which refers to the cultivation of a community to secure their votes. In some cases, a blind eye is turned to undesirable elements, like terrorists, among these communities. Such a blind spot may lead to domestic as well as international problems. Canadian political parties attempt to get the support of various ethnic groups living in Canada. This cannot be deemed objectionable as it is mandated by democratic electoral politics. But in the case of the Sri Lankan Tamil and the Sikh ethnic groups in Canada, political parties' vote bank politics has had direct implications for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and India. Sri Lanka On May 21 this year, the Sri Lankan government hit out at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for engaging in electoral 'vote bank' politics by making an 'outrageous allegation' about 'genocide' during the island nation's brutal armed conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that ended in 2009. Sri Lanka pointed out that the LTTE has been banned in 33 countries other than Sri Lanka. 'Canada's falsification of our history amounts to irresponsible disinformation. It misleads the minds of current and future generations in Canada and elsewhere, encouraging and perpetuating hatred. It empowers extremism on all sides in all parts of the world where such messages are easily and instantaneously transmitted including through social media. We therefore urge the Canadian Government to assume responsibility in a spirit of mutual respect in promoting peace and harmony',' the government's statement said. 'Canada's disproportionate focus on Sri Lanka is a clear example of double standards.While Canada has opted to support a false narrative regarding the conflict in Sri Lanka, it has remained intentionally ambiguous relating to the daily dire humanitarian situations we see elsewhere. It is crucial that countries like Canada, who claim to be global advocates of human rights, recognize their self-interested double standards which are resulting in increased polarization in the international community.' 'Clearly, the repeated statements by the Prime Minister of Canada with regard to Sri Lanka are the outcome of electoral vote bank politics in Canada, funded by a small number of Canadians of Sri Lankan origin with vested and personal interest,' Sri Lanka's statement said. India Earlier this month, the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau accused the Indian government of assassinating a wanted Sikh terrorist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil and expelled six Indian diplomats including High Commissioner Ramesh Kumar Verma. India described the charge as 'preposterous' and accused Trudeau of doing 'vote bank' politics. New Delhi also expelled the top most Canadian diplomat in residence and six others. Canada is a multi-ethnic country in which Sikhs and Sri Lankan Tamils have for long been an important part. The Sikh population is about 770,000 and the Sri Lankan Tamil population is about 240,000. The Sikhs even have a political party the National Democratic Party (NDP) with a significant presence in parliament. The Tamils have no political party but have influential lobbyists in parliament and outside. Sikhs have a reputation for being much more politically engaged than other Diaspora communities in Canada. The Sikh vote is a significant factor in elections. The White Canadian political parties enter into alliance with the ethnic groups or ethnic parties or uphold their demands for electoral gain.Trudeau's Liberal Party has been doing the same. It had an alliance with the NDP, which subsequently broke. Yet, Trudeau continued to cultivate the Sikhs turning a blind eye to those in the community who were actively advocating a separate Sikh country called Khalistan carved out of India. Canadian political scientist Roy Norton points out that over the decades, White Canadian participation in party politics has been declining and the participation of certain Diaspora communities, especially Sikhs, has been rising. In many parliamentary constituencies, the Diaspora communities could tilt the outcome one way or the other. Hence their growing importance for the mainstream White parties. And Diaspora communities in Canada prioritize foreign policy objectives ahead of other concerns, Norton points out. This is where the rub is. The result is that Canadian political leaderships are unwilling to accept even 'reasonable' requests from the Governments of India or Sri Lanka. Though only a section of Sikhs or Tamils are supportive of an independent Khalistan or Tamil Eelam, Canadian political leadersfear losing the entire Sikh or Tamil vote if they do not endorse the demand of the minority. India's Outburst A statement released by India's External Affairs Ministry on October 14, blasted Trudeau of indulging in vote bank politics without nay regard for India's territorial integrity. On the action taken against the Indian High Commissioner in the case relating to the assassination of Sikh terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Indian government said: 'This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.' 'Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard.' 'That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters.' 'Under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, his Government has deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage.' 'This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a Commission on foreign interference. It also serves the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau Government has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains.' 'To that end, the Trudeau Government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada. This has included death threats to them and to Indian leaders. All these activities have been justified in the name of freedom of speech.' 'Some individuals who have entered Canada illegally have been fast-tracked for citizenship. Multiple extradition requests from the Government of India in respect of terrorists and organized crime leaders living in Canada have been disregarded.' Row with Trudeau Goes Back to 2018 International relations expert C.Raja Mohan noted that in most countries, especially democracies, 'the cultivation of narrowly-based domestic constituencies for electoral reasons has its unfortunate consequences for the conduct of foreign policy.' Recalling the 2018 visit to India by Trudeau, Raja Mohan noted thatPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who is more than eager to serenade visiting leaders in his home state of Gujarat, did not travel to Ahmedabad to be with Trudeau. Despite repeated efforts, including at the highest political levels, to flag the question of Sikh separatism in Canada, Trudeau was reluctant to address India's concerns. There was speculation as to whether Trudeau would meet the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh who was on the hit list of the Sikh terrorists. He did not what to meet Amarinder Singh. But according toIndian Expresshe did meet Amarinder Singh after he was told that his plane would not be allowed to land in Amritsar if he did not agree to meet the Chief Minister. Raja Mohan correctly predicted in 2018 that Trudeau's visit, instead of putting aside the Khalistan issue, would aggravate the differences with India. And that was evident in 2023 and 2024. Political scientist Roy Norton found that radicals seeking overt Canadian government support for the dismemberment of a generally friendly country have always failed. But Canadian governments would not interfere with peaceful, law-abiding actions by segments of any Diaspora community, or by any Canadians, supporting human/democratic rights abroad. Ottawa complains that New Delhi and Colombo do not understand this democratic practice. Norton also noted that, in contrast to the past, foreign governments have begun to act on Canadian soil against Canadian citizens who they consider threatening to their interests. Verbal protests have been substituted by action on the ground. The assassination of Sikh terrorist Nijjar allegedly by Indian agents in June 2023 is an example.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8ynuBJxanUmg	2024-10-19T16:25:08-07:00	
China Undermines Its Interests By Boosting Support For Myanmar’s ...	By Zachary Abuza China borders 14 countries, tied with Russia for the most in the world, and Beijing takes great pains to ensure the security of its interests and defend against conflicts from spilling over. Despite that, China’s Myanmar policy is based on faulty assumptions and is undermining its own interests. China’s policy since the February 2021 coup – which Beijing simply labeled a change in government – has never been good. Nonetheless, it refrained from offering initial support for the State Administrative Council (SAC), as the junta formally calls itself, and put pressure on them not to ban the National League for Democracy, which they ultimately did in March 2023. For the first two years, Beijing clearly hedged their bets. But since then, the Chinese have doubled down on the junta. China continues tosell weapons, and there is evidence that Chinese technicians are working in Myanmar’sdefense industries. There is clearly some technology sharing. A new shell designed for drone warfare is a copy of a Chinese-produced munition. At the same time, China had initially held the junta at arms length diplomatically. They have never invited Min Aung Hlaing to China, including to the poorly attended third Belt and Road Initiative summit in October 2023. While China invited the junta’s deputy commander, Soe Win, in July 2024, it was only in a multilateral setting. China has both supported ASEAN’s decision to keep Myanmar’s representation at the non-political level, but also the Thai-ledTrack 1.5 initiativeto engage the junta. China’s primary concern has been the protection of its economic interests, in particular their parallel oil and gas pipelines in Myanmar and theWanbao copper mine. Another priority for China was the development of their special economic zone in the Rakhine state port of Kyaukphyu. Beijing has long been frustrated with theslow implementationof the project, which includes rail and road links to the Chinese border. Although they were able to negotiate further concessions from the diplomatically isolated junta, the project continues to stall. Rebels control borders, resources But since the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic armies that have received various degrees of support from China over the years, launched an offensive against the military regime called Operation 1027 a year ago, there’s been a hardening of China’s position, in line with the junta’s losses. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which includes the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Arakan Army, and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), as well as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), now controls all but one of the major border crossings to China. There has been some $9 billion in cross border trade since the 2021 coup. While this is not huge in terms of China’s overall trade, it matters to Yunnan province, especially in the context of slowing economic growth. And for the sanctioned junta with dire shortages of foreign exchange, border trade is a financial lifeline. China recently shut down five border gates, in order to punish the opposition which continues their offensive against the military. The government in Yunnan has cut electricity and internet service in the enclave of Kokang to further pressure the MNDAA. But facts on the ground are changing. China now must contend with the reality that 90% of Myanmar’s natural resources, including jade and rare earth minerals, are now either controlled by opposition forces or are in contested areas. Chinese hydroelectric dams are now under the control of non-state actors in Shan state, while the KIA is moving in on Chinese backed dams in Kachin. Other Chinese investments arenow in opposition-controlled territories, and they must now pay taxes to the shadow National Unity Government (NUG) or to ethnic resistance organizations. While the Arakan Army (AA) has not taken Kyaukphyu, it controls all the surrounding territory in Rakhine state. Any development of the special economic zone requires negotiations with them. The capture ofAnn Townshipwould give the AA control over a pipeline pumping station. AA control of the territory surrounding the port city of Sittwe forced the Indian government to reevaluate their Myanmar policy and engage the Arakan Army and NUG. China is digging in their heels. Signs of Chinese frustration Since Operation 1027 began last October 27, China has continued the transfer of weaponry to the junta. In August, the military took possession of six additionalFTC-2000G jet trainers, produced by Guizhou Aviation Industries, a division of the large military conglomerate AVIC. While air power alonecan punish civilians, it cannot hold territory, a task that is increasingly beyond the reach of the junta military. Despite at least six intakes of conscripts, adding an estimated 30,000 troops, the new forces are hastily trained, inadequately equipped, and poorly motivated. Some 300 junta troops surrendered in northwestern Sagaing region early this month after nearly one month of fighting. The military was simply unable to resupply them and other forces deployed to far-flung outposts around the country. Peoples’ Defense Force militias and ethnic armies are now routinely targeting the army’s riverine transportation. Demoralized soldiers are voting with their feet andsurrendering. The military launched a counter-offensiveto retake territory lost since Operation 1027 began. While they have made limited inroads, they’ve been against priority urban targets, such as Laukkaing in Shan State’s Kokang region. A leaked document from a July meeting between China's special envoy for Myanmar, Deng Xijun, and the powerful United Wa State Army rebel group, laid bare Beijing’s frustration that the Three Brotherhood Alliance refuses to stop its offensive. China’s concerns about the potential fall of the junta are palpable. China has since also pressured the MNDAA to distance itself from the tripartite alliance and publicly state that it would notcoordinate actionswith the NUG. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Naypyitaw to pledge additional financial assistance to the junta, prompting the NUG to issue a stern warning that debts incurred by an illegal government will not be honored by a future democratic government. Willfully ignorant It is for this reason alone that China has been calling for elections. Beijing sees these both as an offramp and as a way for the military to maintain its political influence in a post-conflict government. Deng and Beijing’s new ambassador to Myanmar, Ma Jia, appear to be willfully ignorant about the degree to which the people of Myanmar hold China in contempt for propping up the military, giving them the weaponry to intensify their aerial attacks on civilian populations, and for searching for ways for the military to prolong their disastrous political interference. China is clearly on the wrong side of history. Chinese diplomats and intelligence analysts are not stupid people. So why are they getting this one so wrong? In part, it’s because of their ideology and analytical blinders. As an authoritarian regime, China can’t imagine a fellow authoritarian regime failing, especially one that they back. But it’s also wishful thinking driven by fear. China, as a statist regime, is highly uncomfortable with the idea of a messy federal democracy on its borders. So for now Beijing is backing the junta, which, despite every advantage in resources and military capabilities, has fallen under the weight of its own incompetence, avarice and delusional thinking. Beijing believes that a corrupt and pliable Myanmar government that includes the military will best serve Chinese interests. At the same time, the NUG and their allies will never accept elections or a negotiated settlement with the junta, who haveproven themselves to be untrustworthy. Giving the junta a seat at the table gives them yet another opportunity to kick the forces of democracy and federalism in the teeth. The people of Myanmar have fought too hard and suffered too much to accept that. Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Italian Court Rules Migrants Shipped To Albania Must Be Sent Back	By Fjori Sinoruka A court in Rome on Friday ordered the transfer back to Italy of 12 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt who were intercepted at sea and then transported to a reception centre in Albania under a controversial new scheme backed by Italy and Albania’s premiers. The court said that it was impossible to assess whether they came from a 'safe country of origin' and so they have a right to have their asylum claims processed in Italy. The decision was based on a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded that a country of origin cannot be assessed as 'safe' if parts of it are not – a decision that could have a major impact on the Italy-to-Albania offshoring project. The court ruling can be appealed and it is so far unclear when the migrants will be returned to Italy. The first Italian military ship holding 16 migrants arrived in Albania on Wednesday. However, four migrants were sent back to Italy the same day; two of them because they were minors and two other for health reasons, according to media reports. Italy unveiled its plan to send refugees and migrants intercepted by its navy at sea to processing centres in Albania was unveiled in November last year by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. The scheme has been criticised in both countries by activists and human rights lawyers who question Albania’s capacities to handle the arrangements. But the deal received the green light from Albania’s Constitutional Court in January. According to the agreement, Italy is covering all the construction and equipment costs. The arrangement is supposed to operate along the same lines as Italy’s repatriation 'hotspots', where migrants and refugees are detained pending repatriation, but which the European Court of Human Rights criticised in March.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i85z-NZWV9yh7	2024-10-19T16:13:02-07:00
