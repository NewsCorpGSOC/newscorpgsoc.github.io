The Risk Of Foreign Intrusion In Presidential Elections In Cote d...	By Arthur Palix Tensions Loom Over the Ballot (FPRI) -- On October 25, 2025, voters in Cote d’Ivoire will head to the polls to elect their next president in a high-stakes election shaped by past controversies and ongoing political uncertainty. A key point of contention remains the potential candidacy of Alassane Ouattara, who has led the country since 2010 and is currently serving his third term despite the Ivorian constitution limiting the presidency to two. The Independent Electoral Commission, led by Ibrahim Coulibaly-Kuibiert, plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the vote, by compiling and revising voter lists, as well as managing elections nationwide. Recent electoral history in Cote d’Ivoire has been marred by turmoil. The 2010 presidential race, a defining moment in the nation’s political trajectory, saw Ouattara challenge incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Despite Ouattara securing 54 percent of the vote, Gbagbo contested the results, triggering a post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 civilians dead in violent clashes between rival supporters. A military intervention led to Gbagbo’s arrest and subsequent twenty-year sentence by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. In 2015, the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), Gbagbo’s party, boycotted the vote, claiming the process was rigged, thereby facilitating Ouattara’s re-election. In 2020, the sudden death of Amadou Gon Coulibaly, the ruling party’s designated candidate, prompted Ouattara to run for a controversial third term. The election, held in a climate of heightened tensions, saw widespread disruptions, the closure of polling stations, and low voter turnout. As Cote d’Ivoire prepares for yet another electoral test, the issue of national reconciliation—long promised but never fully achieved—has become central to the political discourse. With lingering tensions from past elections and growing concerns over political stability, the 2025 vote is set to be one of the most decisive in the country’s recent history. A Fragmented Political Landscape While the 2010 election featured fourteen contenders in the first round, this year’s vote is expected to see roughly half that number—though this reduction does not necessarily signal a clearer political landscape. With less than a year to go, both declared and prospective candidates are maneuvering for a position in what is set to be a high-stakes battle. Incumbent Ouattara, in power since 2010, remains the preferred candidate of the ruling Rassemblement des Houphouëtistes pour la Démocratie et la Paix (RHDP), confirming he is ready to continue serving his country. However, opposition parties strongly oppose the prospect of his re-election, arguing that a fourth term would be unconstitutional. Among the main opposition figures is former president Gbagbo, who is running under the Parti des Peuples Africains – Côte d’Ivoire (PPA-CI). Although acquitted by the ICC and pardoned by Ouattara, Gbagbo has not been granted full amnesty for his role in the 2010 post-election violence, rendering him ineligible to run. A similar fate has befallen Charles Blé Goudé, former minister under Gbagbo and leader of the Congrès Panafricain pour la Justice et l’Égalité des Peuples (COJEP). Despite his acquittal by the ICC, Blé Goudé remains convicted in Cote d’Ivoire, preventing him from contesting the election. Another well-known name in Ivorian politics is former First Lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, who is running under the banner of the Mouvement des Générations Capables (MGC), which she founded in 2022. For its part, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, leader of the FPI, is focusing his campaign on governance, poverty reduction, and strengthening ties with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This fragmented opposition raises concerns, as the multiple left-leaning candidates from the PPA-CI, FPI, MGC, and COJEP could weaken its ability to challenge the RHDP effectively. Tensions are not limited to left-wing parties. The Parti Démocratique de Côte d’Ivoire – Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (PDCI-RDA) is grappling with internal divisions over its candidate. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam has been named the party’s official nominee. Jean-Louis Billon, a former Minister of Trade and influential PDCI-RDA member, has rejected this nomination and has declared his own candidacy, criticizing Thiam as out of touch. An Unstable Climate Conducive to Foreign Interference It is in this uncertain context, with the electorate still scarred by past electoral violence and a list of candidates unsettled, that the Ivorian electorate will have to choose its future president for the next five years. Meanwhile, across sub-Saharan Africa, a growing tide of pan-African sovereignty is reshaping regional alliances and challenging traditional foreign influence. The withdrawal of French forces from the 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion in Port-Bouët marks another step in the decline of France’s military presence in West Africa and comes just months after similar withdrawals from Senegal and Chad. Earlier, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, now members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), ordered the withdrawal of French military forces involved in the fight against regional terrorism for over ten years. The Alliance of Sahel States: A Revival of Pan-African Enthusiasm Formed in 2023, the AES is a mutual defense pact promoting sovereignty, Pan-Africanism, and anti-colonial ideals. The bloc has positioned itself as an alternative to the ECOWAS, a fifteen-member organization that includes Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal, and Benin. In January 2024, the AES officially broke away from ECOWAS, deepening the divide between the two regional bodies. AES countries have positioned themselves as leaders of this generalized pan-Africanist movement, turning down not only the French presence but, more generally, the idea of foreign economic predation from which African countries have suffered for too long. In August 2024, Burkina Faso’s President Ibrahima Traoré rejected an IMF loan, stating that 'Africa does not need international financial institutions to develop.' Present in Mali since 1976, TotalEnergies recently lost its contract to a new partnership between Malian firm Coly Energy and Beninese company Benin Petrol SA. Russia: A Quest for Strategic Influence For some observers, this growing desire for distancing from Western influence in Africa is the result of vast campaigns of manipulation and disinformation orchestrated by powers such as Russia and China. While the existence and impact of these disinformation campaigns remain open to debate, they do raise the question of the extent of such interference during election periods. Two European countries were recently confronted with this type of abuse. In Georgia, the pro-Russian, Eurosceptic 'Georgian Dream' party faced accusations of vote-buying and voter intimidation during the 2024 national elections. Similarly, in Romania, Russian actors were accused of backing far-right candidate Călin Georgescu in the 2024 presidential race. A recent report by the Center for Strategic Studies in Africa highlights Russia’s growing involvement in African electoral processes, with the democratic scores of thirty-one African nations declining over the past five years. The analysis reveals that Cote d’Ivoire has already been targeted by Russian disinformation campaigns, particularly in support of Gbagbo. In a context where the PPA-CI is struggling to establish itself on the Ivorian political scene (winning two communes out of 201 and no region out of the thirty-one in the 2023 local elections), the hypothesis of a rapprochement with Russia raises questions about the influence strategies at play. The interests of the two parties seem to converge. Russia’s influence in Africa has expanded through military and economic cooperation, particularly with the AES. Through the Africa Corp (formerly Wagner Group), Russia provides military equipment, training, and security services to these nations. In January 2025, AES countries signed a Telecommunications and Remote Sensing Satellite Agreement with Russia aimed at enhancing border surveillance and disaster monitoring. For his part, Gbagbo has been a vocal critic of ECOWAS, accusing it of promoting French interests in West Africa. In an interview with AFO Media, he expressed a willingness to normalize relations with AES states should he return to power. While some analysts view this as a continuation of his long-standing rivalry with Ouattara, others see Russia’s potential backing of Gbagbo as a strategic move to increase its foothold in Cote d’Ivoire and the broader West African region. China: A Key Economic Partner China has solidified its position as a major player in the region, becoming 2023 Cote d’Ivoire’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $5.28 billion—an increase of 21 percent from the previous year. Beijing also maintains strong ties with AES nations. In June 2024, Colonel Assimi Goita, Mali’s Head of State, emphasized the benefits of the AES, which has enabled its members 'to move away from facade and ineffective partnerships towards sincere partners' such as Russia and China. A few months later, he even declared that Mali shared 'the same principles and values with the People’s Republic of China, namely respect for the sovereignty of our States, the defense of the interests of our peoples, non-interference in internal affairs, but above all the rejection of manipulation linked to human rights issues.' China’s influence extends to strategic sectors such as energy and infrastructure. In Niger, the China National Petroleum Corporation operates the Agadem oil field—the largest in Africa. Amid growing security concerns, Niger has also tasked China with protecting its energy assets. The potential return of Gbagbo to power could shift Cote d’Ivoire further away from Western alliances, particularly with France and the United States, given Paris’ backing of Ouattara during the 2010 post-election crisis. France: A Contested Historical Partner France maintains long-standing historical and economic ties with Cote d’Ivoire which it inherited from the colonial era. On the commercial front, France remains Cote d’Ivoire’s top trading partner within the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In 2023, Cote d’Ivoire accounted for 38 percent of all French exports to WAEMU while also being the region’s leading exporter to France. However, these economic ties do not shield France from mounting criticism from Ivorian public opinion. The retrocession of the Port-Bouët military camp, perceived by some as a symbol of national sovereignty (and by others as a win-win deal between Cote d’Ivoire and France), comes at a time when anti-French rhetoric is gaining ground in French-speaking Africa. As journalist Alain Foka noted in a May 2023 analysis, younger generations born after independence are questioning the economic and military influence France continues to exert over its former colonies, seen as predatory rather than beneficial. On the other hand, analysts suggest that military cooperation between Paris and Abidjan is far from over. Political expert Seidik Aba predicts that Ouattara, while formally ending France’s direct military presence, may pursue a different model of collaboration, focusing on training programs and intelligence sharing rather than deploying troops on Ivorian soil. Billon could also be seen as a candidate whose election could stabilize relations France and Cote d’Ivoire. A prominent businessman and former Minister of Commerce, Billon ran the Société Immobilière et Financière de la Côte Africaine (SIFCA)—one of Cote d’Ivoire’s largest agro-industrial firms, founded by his father in 1964. SIFCA’s financial ties with France are significant. Over the past decade, Société Générale and Proparco (a subsidiary of the French Development Agency) have invested 85 million euros in SIFCA’s development projects. Billon’s leadership in agriculture and industry positions him as a pro-business figure with strong international connections, particularly in France, Senegal, and Nigeria. However, Billon is not yet an official candidate for his party, the PDCI-RDA, which is currently chaired by Thiam. Thiam has long-standing ties with France and international financial institutions. In a 2009 interview with the Institut Montaigne, he declared that 'France will live. France will continue to shine. My France is an idea, and ideas never die.' Graduated from the École Polytechnique the Mines de Paris, the former Crédit Suisse executive maintains close relationships with French and Anglo-American financial circles. More recently, Thiam suggested international funding for Cote d’Ivoire’s electoral commission to facilitate the updating of the electoral roll. The United States and Israel: Waning Influence or Strategic Shift? The direction of US foreign policy in Africa under the second administration of President Donald Trump remains uncertain. Alhaji Bouba Nouhou from the Michel de Montaigne University in Bordeaux suggests this could pave the way for emerging powers like Iran to deepen their involvement in AES countries, particularly in technology and defense cooperation. A long-standing ally of the United States, Israel also plays a strategic role in West Africa, with Cote d’Ivoire serving as a key partner for Tel Aviv. In October 2024, an agreement was signed for the sale of a patrol boat manufactured by Israel Shipyard. A framework agreement also links the two countries, granting Ivorian access to Israeli expertise in cybersecurity, agriculture, and water management. The foregoing notwithstanding, Israel has announced a reduction in military exports to Cote d’Ivoire, aiming to prevent its weapons from being used in potential election-related violence. A re-election of Ouattara could be favorable for Washington and Tel Aviv, reinforcing Western influence in the region against Russian, Chinese, and Iranian interests. A Decisive Ballot The prospect of foreign interference in Cote d’Ivoire’s 2025 presidential election remains a sensitive issue. As of now, there have been no confirmed efforts to manipulate or destabilize the election process, making any claims of such interference premature. While international actors may hold strategic interests in the country, reducing the election to a mere battleground for external influence risks oversimplifying Ivorian’s complex political landscape, its electoral autonomy, and the ability of candidates to run independent campaigns free from overt propaganda. A pragmatic and evidence-based approach is crucial in addressing the issue—avoiding conspiracy theories and the blanket demonization of any side. Should foreign interference emerge in Cote d’Ivoire’s elections, its true impact will only become clear once the facts and electoral dynamics unfold. That said, electoral interference is not a theoretical concern. Last year, the United States faced attempts of influence from Iran during its 2024 election, while Canada condemned Chinese interference targeting its own electoral process, serving as stark reminders that such risks are real. In this fragile context, ensuring stability and sovereignty are the watchwords for a nation striving for national reconciliation, still bearing the scars of past crises and the hopes of a brighter future. As a strategic crossroads in West Africa, Cote d’Ivoire is both a stakeholder and a player in this dynamic. The outcome of this election could redefine its relations with its international partners and influence the equilibrium of the balance of power in the region. In 2025, Cote d’Ivoire will not only appoint a new leader, but it will also make a decisive choice about the democratic path it wishes to take. Between security concerns, economic transformations, and political tensions, this election will be a defining moment—one that reveals both the progress made and the challenges that lie ahead.

What Are The Origins Of The Money We Use Today? Revisiting Heinri...	The pioneering research by one of the founders of economic anthropology is essential for understanding the social and institutional processes that gave rise to money as we know it. The late 19th century saw economists, mainly German and Austrian, create a mythology of money's origins that is still repeated in today's textbooks. Money is said to have originated as just another commodity being bartered, with metal preferred because it is nonperishable (and hence amenable to being saved), supposedly standardized (despite fraud if not minted in temples), and thought to be easily divisible—as if silver could have been used for small marketplace exchanges, which was unrealistic given the rough character of ancient scales for weights of a few grams.1 This mythology does not recognize government as having played any role as a monetary innovator, sponsor, or regulator, or as giving money its value by accepting it as a vehicle to pay taxes, buy public services, or make religious contributions. Also downplayed is money's function as a standard of value for denominating and paying debts.2 Although there is no empirical evidence for the commodity-barter origin myth, it has survived on purely hypothetical grounds because of its political bias that serves the anti-socialist Austrian school and subsequent 'free market' creditor interests opposing government money creation. Schurtz's Treatment of Money as Part of the Overall Social System As one of the founders of economic anthropology, Heinrich Schurtz approached the origins of money as being much more complex than the 'economic' view that it emerged simply as a result of families going to the marketplace to barter. Surveying a wide range of Indigenous communities, his 1898 book, An Outline of the Origins of Money, described their trade and money in the context of the institutional system within which members sought status and wealth. Schurtz described these monetary systems as involving a wide array of social functions and dimensions, which today's 'economic' theorizing excludes as external to its analytic scope. Placing money in the context of the community's overall system of social organization, Schurtz warned that anyone who detaches 'sociological and economic problems from the environment in which they emerged... their native land... only carries away a part of the whole organism and fails to understand the vital forces that have created and sustained it.' Looking at Indigenous communities as having preserved presumably archaic traditions, Schurtz viewed trade with outsiders as leading wealth to take an increasingly monetary form that eroded the balance of internal social relations. Schurtz deemed the linkage between money, debt, and land tenure to lie beyond the area on which he focused, nor did he mention contributions to group feasts (which historian Bernard Laum suggested as the germ from which Greek obols and drachmas may have evolved).3 The paradigmatic forms of Indigenous wealth were jewelry and other items of personal adornment, decorations, and trophies, especially foreign exotic products in the form of shells and gemstones or items with a long and prestigious history that gave their wearers or owners status. Thorstein Veblen would call the ownership and display of such items conspicuous consumption in his 1899 book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. They had an exchange value, as they do today, but that did not make them monetary means of exchange. Schurtz saw many gray areas in their monetization: 'Beads made of clay and stone are also crafted by Indigenous people and widely used as ornaments but rarely as money.' At issue was how a money economy differs from barter and from the circulation and exchange of useful and valued items in a social economy. Was Indigenous exchange and wealth pre-monetary, an archaic seed that led to money's 'more ideal forms?' Schurtz's Distinction Between Inside-Money and Outside-Money Exchange with outsiders was typically conducted by political leaders as the face of their communities to the outside world. Trade (and also payment of tribute) involved fiscal and social relations whose monetary functions differed from those of the domestic economy but ended up dovetailing with them to give money a hybrid character. Schurtz distinguished what he called outside-money from inside-money, with outside-money ultimately dominating the inside monetary system. 'The concept of money,' he wrote, originated 'from two distinct sources: What functions as the foundation of wealth and measure of value for property and serves social ends within a tribe is, in its origins, something entirely different from the means of exchange that travels from tribe to tribe and eventually transforms itself, as a universally welcomed commodity, into a kind of currency.' Inside-money was used within communities for their own exchange and wealth. Outside-money was derived from transactions with outsiders. And what was 'outside' was a set of practices governing trade outside the jurisdiction of local governance.4 Schurtz's distinction emphasized a characteristic of trade that has continued down through today's world: the contrast between domestic payments subject to checks and balances to protect basic needs and navigating status hierarchies but (ideally) limiting sharp wealth disparities, and exchange with outsiders, often conducted on islands, quay areas, or other venues socially outside the community's boundaries, subject to more impersonal standardized rules. Throughout the ancient world, we find offshore island entrepots wherever they are conveniently located for conducting trade with outsiders. These islands kept foreign contact at arm's length to prevent mercantile relations from disturbing the local economic balance. Egypt restricted foreign contacts to the Delta region where the Nile flowed into the Mediterranean. For the Etruscans, the island of Ischia/Pithekoussai became the base for Phoenician and Greek merchants to deal with the Italian mainland in the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. North Germans seem to have conducted the Baltic amber trade through the sacred island of Helgoland. 'The emergence of specific internal monetary systems is always supported by the inclination to transform outside-money into inside-money, and to employ money not to facilitate external trade, as one might assume according to common theories, but rather to obstruct it,' Schurtz concluded. In his chapter, 'Metal as Ornament and Money,' he pointed out that it was foreign trade that led metal to become the primary form of money. 'While most varieties of ornament-money gradually lose their significance, one of them, metal-money, asserts its ground all the more and finally pushes its competitors out of the field.' He added that: 'Metal-money made from noble metals is not a pure sign-money, it is at the same time a valuable commodity, the value of which depends on supply and demand. In its mature form, it therefore in itself embodies the fusion of inside-money with outside-money, of the sign of value and valuable property with the means of exchange.'5 This merging of inside- and outside-money is documented already in the third millennium BCE in the Near East. Silver-money was used for long-distance trade and came to be used for domestic enterprise as well, while grain remained the monetary vehicle for denominating agrarian production, taxes, and debt service on the land, and for distribution to dependent labor in Mesopotamia's temples and palaces. Schurtz also questioned whether the dominance of metallic money emerged spontaneously in many places or whether there was a diffusion from a singular origin, that is, 'whether a cultural institution has grown in situ or whether it has been transferred from other regions through migration and contact between societies.' The diffusion of Mesopotamian weights is associated with silver points to its diffusion from that region, as does the spread of the region's practice of setting interest rates simply for ease of calculation in terms of the local fractional arithmetic system (60ths in Mesopotamia for a shekel per mina a month, 10ths or percentages in decimalized Greece, and 12ths in Rome for a troy ounce per pound each year). Checks and Balances to Prevent the Selfish Concentration of Wealth What does seem to have developed spontaneously were social attitudes and policies to prevent the concentration of wealth from injuring economic balance. Wealth concentration, especially when achieved by depriving cultivators of their means of livelihood, would have violated the ethic of mutual aid that low-surplus economies need as a condition for their resilience. Viewing money as part of the overall social context, Schurtz described 'the social transformation brought about by wealth' as a result of monetizing trade and its commercial pursuit of profit, or 'acquisitiveness': '[E]veryone is now compelled to join in the competition for property or he will be pulled into the vortex created by one of the newly emerging centers of power and property, where he will need to work hard to be able to live at all. For the property owner, no temporal limit constrains his view on the perpetual increase of his wealth.' Schurtz characterized the economic mentality as a drive for 'the unlimited accumulation of movable property,' to be passed on to one's children, leading to the creation of a wealthy hereditary class. If archaic societies had this ethic, could ancient civilizations have taken off? How did they prevent the growth of wealth from fostering an oligarchy seeking to increase its wealth at the expense of the community at large and its resilience? Schurtz reviewed how Indigenous communities typically avoided that fate by shaping a social value system that would steer wealth away from being used to achieve predatory power over others. He cited numerous examples in which 'immense treasures often accumulate without reentering the transactions of daily life.' One widespread way to do this was simply to bury wealth. 'The primitive man,' he wrote, 'believes that he will have access to all the goods given to him in the grave, even in the afterlife. Thus, he too knows no bounds to acquisition.' Taking his greed and wealth with him to use in the hereafter prevents hoarded wealth from being inherited 'and growing into a dangerous instrument of power' by becoming dynastic; ultimately operating 'on the belief that the deceased does not give up his rights of ownership but jealously guards over his property to ensure that no heir makes use of it.' A less destructive removal of wealth from its owners was to create an ethic of peer pressure in which individuals gained status and popular acclaim by accumulating wealth to give away. Schurtz wrote: '[R]emnants of the ancient communism remain alive enough for a long time to effectively block attempts to amass as many assets as possible in a single hand. And in places without an actual system of debt and interest, the powerful individual, into whose house the tributes of the people flow, has indeed little choice but to 'represent' by way of his wealth: in other words, to allow the people to participate in his indulgences.' Such an individual achieves philanthropic renown by generously distributing his possessions to 'his friends and followers, winning their hearts and thereby establishing real power based on loyal devotion.' One widespread practice was to celebrate marriages, funerals, and other rites of passage by providing great feasts. This 'extraordinary... destruction and squandering of valuable property, particularly livestock and food, during those grand festivals of the dead that evolved out of sacrifices and are, among some peoples, not only an effective obstacle to the accumulation of wealth but have turned into economic calamities' when families feel obliged to take on debt to host such extravagant displays. Religious officials and temples often played a role in such rituals. Noting that 'money, trade, and religion had a good relationship with one another in antiquity,' Schurtz cited the practice of donating wealth to temples or their priesthoods. But he recognized that this might enable them to 'gain dominance through the ownership of money' under their control. 'The communist countermeasures against wealth generally do not endure,' Schurtz wrote. 'Certain kinds of property seem to favor greed directly, especially cattle farming, which can literally turn into a hoarding addiction.' He described communalistic values of mutual aid as tending to break down as economies polarized with the increase in commercial wealth. Schurtz also noted that the social checks on personal wealth-seeking did not apply to economies that developed a 'system of debt and interest.' Wealth in the form of monetary claims on debtors was not buried and could hardly be redistributed to the population at large, whose members typically were debtors to the rising creditor interest. The only way to prevent such debts from polarizing society was to cancel them. That is what Near Eastern rulers did, but Schurtz's generation had no way of knowing about their Clean Slate proclamations. Starting with the very outset of debt records c. 2500 BCE in Sumer, and continuing down through Babylonia, Assyria, to their neighbors, and on through the early first millennium BCE, rulers annulled financial claims on agrarian debtors. That prevented creditors from concentrating money and land in their own hands. One might say that these debt cancellations and land redistributions were the Near Eastern alternative to destroying material wealth to preserve balance. These royal acts did not destroy physical wealth but simply wiped out the debt overhead to maintain widespread land tenure and liberty for the population at large. Canceling agrarian debt was politically feasible because most personal debts were owed to the palace sector and its temples or their officials. Royal Clean Slates seemed so unthinkable when they began to be translated around the turn of the last century that early readers hardly could believe that they actually were enforced in practice. François Thureau-Dangin's French translation of the Sumerian ruler Enmetena's (c. 2400 BCE) proclamation in 1905 was believed by many observers to be too utopian and socially disruptive to have been followed in practice, as was the Biblical Jubilee Year of Leviticus 25.6 But so many such proclamations have been found, extending so continuously over thousands of years—along with lawsuits in which judges upheld their increasing detail—that there is no doubt that these acts did indeed reconcile the accumulation of monetary wealth with social resilience by blocking the creation of predatory oligarchies such as those that would emerge in classical Greece and Rome and indeed survive into today's world. Monetary Innovations in the Bronze Age Near Eastern Palaces and Temples Economic documentation in Schurtz's day was able to trace monetary practice only as far back as classical Greece and Rome. There was a general belief that their practices must have evolved from Indigenous Indo-European speakers. Marcel Mauss would soon treat the gift exchange of the Kwakiutl tribe of the Canadian Pacific Northwest (with their competitive one-upmanship) as the prototype for the idea of charging interest. But monetary interest has a specific stipulated rate, with payments due on specific periodic dates set by written contracts. That practice stems from Sumer in the third millennium BCE, along with silver (and grain) money and related financial innovations in the economic big bang that has shaped subsequent Western economic evolution. Money's function as a standard of valuation did not play a big role in Schurtz's survey. But subsequent archaeological research has revealed that money's emergence as part of an overall institutional framework cannot be understood without reference to written account-keeping, denominating debt accruals, and fiscal relations. Money, credit/debt, and fiscal obligations have all gone together since the origins of written records in the ancient Near East. Near Eastern fiscal and financial records describe a development of money, credit, and interest-bearing debt that neither the barter theory nor Schurtz's ethnographic studies had imagined. Mesopotamia's 'more ideal' money evolved out of the fiscal organization of account-keeping and credit in the palaces and temples of Sumer, Babylonia, and their Bronze Age neighbors (3200–1200 BCE). These Near Eastern economies were larger in scale and much more complex and multilayered than most of the Indigenous communities surveyed by Schurtz. In contrast to largely self-sufficient communities, southern Mesopotamia was obliged to engage in large-scale and long-distance trade because the region's river-deposited soil lacked metal, stone, and even hardwood. The region's need for raw materials was far different from the trade and 'monetization' of luxuries by the relatively small-scale and self-sufficient communities studied by Schurtz and hypothesized by economists imagining individuals bartering at their local market. In these communities, he noted: 'The amount of metal shaped into ornaments almost always far outweighs the amount transformed into practical tools.' Mesopotamia's trade had to go far beyond personal decorative luxuries and prestige commodities or trophy items. An entrepreneurial merchant class was needed to obtain these raw materials, along with a specialized labor force, which was employed by the temples and palaces that produced most export handicrafts, provisioned corvée labor to work on public infrastructure, served as mints and overseers of weights and measures, and mediated most monetary wealth and debt. This required forward planning and account-keeping to feed and supply labor (war widows, orphans, and slaves) in their weaving and other handicraft workshops and to consign their output to merchants for export. Calculating the cost of distributing food and raw materials within these large institutions and valuing their consignment of goods to merchants required designing standard weights and measures as the basis for this forward planning. Selecting monetary units was part of this standardization of measuring costs and value. This made possible the calculation of expected rental income or shortfalls, along with profit-and-loss statements and balance sheets. The typical commodity to be distributed was grain, which served as a standard of value for agrarian transactions and credit balances that mounted up during the crop year for advances to sharecroppers, consumption such as beer from ale-women, and payments to priests for performing ceremonial functions. Their value in grain was to be paid at harvest time. The calculation of food rations for distribution to the various grades of labor (male, female, and children) enabled the costs to be expressed in grain or in workday equivalents. Schurtz would have called this grain 'inside-money,' and regarded as 'outside-money' the silver minted by temples for dealing with foreign trade and as the basic measure of value for business transactions with the palace economy and for settling commercial obligations. A mina (60 shekels) of silver was set as equal to a corresponding unit of grain as measured on the threshing floor. That enabled accounts to be kept simultaneously in silver and grain. The result was a bi-monetary grain-silver standard reflecting the bifurcation of early Mesopotamian economies between the agrarian families on the land (using grain as 'inside-money') and the palatial economy with its workshops, foreign trade, and associated commercial enterprise (using silver as 'outside-money'). Prices for market transactions with outsiders might vary, but prices for debt payments, taxes, and other transactions with large institutions were fixed. Schurtz's conclusion that the rising dominance of commercial money tended to break down domestic checks and balances protecting the Indigenous communities that he studied is indeed what happened when commercial debt practices were brought from the Near East to the Aegean and Mediterranean lands around the eighth century BCE. Having no tradition of royal debt cancellations as had existed in the Near East ever since the formative period of interest-bearing debt, the resulting decontextualization of credit practices fostered financial oligarchies in classical Greece and Rome. After early debt cancellations and land redistribution by populist 'tyrants' in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, the ensuing classical oligarchies resisted popular revolts demanding a revival of such policies. The dynamics of interest-bearing debt and the pro-creditor debt laws of classical antiquity's creditor oligarchies caused economic polarization that led to five centuries of civil warfare. These upheavals were not the result of the coinage that began to be minted around the eighth century BCE, as many 19th-century observers believed, mistakenly thinking that Aegean coinage was the first metallic money. Silver-money had been the norm for two millennia throughout the Near East, without causing disruption like that experienced by classical antiquity. What polarized classical antiquity's economies were pro-creditor debt laws backed by political violence, not money. Conclusion and Discussion Schurtz's starting point was how communities organized the laws of motion governing their distribution of wealth and property. He viewed money as emerging from this institutional function with a basically communalistic ethic. A key characteristic of Indigenous economic resilience was social pressure expecting the wealthy to contribute to social support. That was the condition set by unwritten customs for letting some individuals and their families become rich. Schurtz and subsequent ethnologists found a universal solution for reconciling wealth-seeking with community-wide prosperity to be social pressure for wealthy families (that was the basic unit, not individuals) to distribute their wealth to the citizenry by reciprocal exchange, gift-giving, mutual aid, and other forms of redistribution, and providing large feasts, especially for rites of passage. This was a much broader view than the individualistic economic assumption that personal gain-seeking and, indeed, selfishness were the driving forces of overall prosperity. The idea of monetizing economic life under communalistic mutual aid or palace direction was and remains anathema to mainstream economists, reflecting the worldview of modern creditors and financial elites. Schurtz recognized that mercantile wealth-seeking required checks and balances to prevent economies from impoverishing their members. The problem for any successfully growing society to solve was how to prevent the undue concentration of wealth obtained by exploitative means that impaired overall welfare and the ability of community members to be self-supporting. Otherwise, economic polarization and dependency would lead members to flee from the community, or perhaps it simply would shrink and end up being defeated by outsiders who sustained themselves by more successful mutual aid. As noted above, Schurtz treated the monetization of wealth in the form of creditor claims on debtors as too post-archaic to be a characteristic of his ethnographic subjects. But what shaped the context for monetization and led 'outside-money' to take priority over inside-money were wealth accumulation by moneylending and the fiscal and military uses of money. Schurtz correctly rejected Bruno Hildebrand's characterization of money as developing in stages, from small-scale barter to monetized economies becoming more sophisticated as they evolved into financialized credit economies.7 And, in fact, the actual historical sequence was the reverse. From Mesopotamia to medieval Europe, agrarian economies operated on credit during the crop year. Monetary payment occurred at harvest time to settle the obligations that had accumulated since the last harvest and to pay taxes. This need to pay debts was a major factor requiring money's development in the first place. Barter became antiquity's final monetary 'stage' as Rome's economy collapsed after its creditor oligarchy imposed debt bondage and took control of the land. When emperors were unable to tax this oligarchy, they debased the coinage, and life throughout the empire devolved into local subsistence production and quasi-barter. Foreign trade was mainly for luxuries brought by Arabs and other Near Easterners. The optimistic sequence that Hildebrand imagined not only mistakenly adopted the barter myth of monetary origins but also failed to take debt polarization into account as economies became monetarized and financialized. Schurtz described how the aim of preventing the maldistribution of wealth was at the heart of Indigenous social structuring. But it broke down for various reasons. Economies in which family wealth took the form of cattle, he found, tended to become increasingly oppressive to maintain the polarizing inequality that developed. The same might be said of credit economies under the rising burden of interest-bearing debt. Schurtz noted the practice of charging debtors double the loan value—and any rate of interest indeed involves an implicit doubling time. That exponential dynamic is what polarizes financialized economies. In contrast to Schurtz, mainstream economists of his generation avoided dealing with the effect of monetary innovation and debt on the distribution of wealth. The tendency was to treat money as merely a 'veil' of price changes for goods and services, without analyzing how credit polarizes the economy's balance sheet of assets and debt liabilities. Yet, the distinguishing feature of credit economies was the use of moneylending as a lever to enrich creditors by impoverishing debtors. That was more than just a monetary problem. It was a political creditor/debtor problem and, ultimately, a public/private problem. The issue was whether a ruler or civic public checks would steer the rise in monetary wealth in ways that avoided the creation of creditor oligarchies. Most 19th-century and even subsequent economic writers shied away from confronting this political context, leaving the most glaring gap in modern economic analysis. It was left to the discovery of cuneiform documentation to understand how money first became institutionalized as a vehicle to pay debts. This monetization was accompanied by remarkable success in sustaining rising wealth while preventing its concentration in the hands of a hereditary oligarchy. That Near Eastern success highlights what the smaller and more anarchic Western economies failed to achieve when interest-bearing debt practices were brought to the Mediterranean lands without being checked by the tradition of regular cancellation of personal nonbusiness debt. Credit and monetary wealth were privatized in the hands of what became an increasingly self-destructive set of classical oligarchies culminating in that of Rome, which fought for centuries against popular revolts seeking protection from impoverishing economic polarization. The devastating effects of transplanting Near Eastern debt practices into the Mediterranean world's less communalistic groupings show the need to discuss the political, fiscal, and social-moral context for money and debt. Schurtz placed monetary analysis in the context of society's political institutions and moral values and explained how money is a product of this context and, indeed, how monetization tends to transform it—in a way that tends to break down social protection. His book has remained relatively unknown over the last century, largely because his institutional anthropological perspective is too broad for an economics discipline that has been narrowed by pro-creditor ideologues who have applauded the 'free market' destruction of social regulation aimed at protecting the interests of debtors. That attitude avoids recognizing the challenges that led the Indigenous communities studied by Schurtz, and also the formative Bronze Age Near East, to protect their resilience against the concentration of wealth, a phenomenon that has plagued economies ever since classical antiquity's decontextualization of Near Eastern debt practices.

The barter theory has been refuted by modern research uncovering the Bronze Age Near Eastern institutional origins of money, which I discuss in chapters 1 and 3 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, 2024). My criticisms of this theory are in 'Origins of Money and Interest: Palatial Credit, Not Barter' (Hudson, Michael, 2020). 2 See the papers collected in Wray, L. Randall, 2004. 3 Mauss, Marcel (1925), 2016; Laum, Bernard, 1924. Schurtz mentions spit-money in passing but finds trade in food relatively unimportant. 4 I discuss this in 'From Sacred Enclave to Temple to City' (Hudson, Michael, 1999) and Chapter 10 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, Michael, 2024). 5 Schurtz cited as an example of how monetary authorities could substitute sign-money for metal-money the case of 'Kublai Khan, the ruler of the Mongolian empire, [who] drove out metal-money with sign-money, specifically stamped pieces of paper, evidently following the Chinese example; Marco Polo's accounts indicate that the endeavor must have temporarily succeeded only because of the tremendous power and authority of the ruler, with the result of a vast accumulation of gold and silver in the Khan's residence.' But he made disparaging remarks about the French government's paper money assignats and called John Law a 'swindler,' dismissing government money creation. 6 Thureau-Dangin, François (1905: 86–87), translated the Sumerian term for 'justice' (amargi) to mean specifically that officials and wealthy individuals ('the powerful') would have no legal claims for debt foreclosure. 7 Hildebrand, Bruno (1864), classified economies as passing from Naturalwirtschaft ('barter economy') to Geldwirtschaft ('gold/commodity money economy') and finally Kreditwirtschaft ('credit economy').

Malaysia: Recent Video Mocking Hinduism Reflects Growing Religiou...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof A seven-second video clip on social media targeting a Hindu festival is the latest incident that reflects growing polarization in multi-faith, multi-ethnic Malaysia, analysts say. The clip, posted Tuesday on a radio station’s social media platform, showed three Malay Muslim on-air personalities mimicking devotees in a trance during a Hindu festival celebrated by the country’s ethnic Indian community. The Thaipusam festival was held last month. Era FM, the station owned by the country’s largest broadcaster, Astro Radio, deleted the video on the same day it was posted but not before it was widely viewed. Malaysia’s largest Indian political party, the Malaysian Indian Congress, condemned the clip as a blatant insult to Hinduism. Political analyst Azmil Tayeb said the incident reflected 'growing insensitivity that is the result of the polarization we are seeing' in Malaysian society. 'Every slight, perceived or otherwise, can easily trigger raw emotions and be seen as an attack against one’s community. Polarization hardens people’s sense of ethnic and religious identity,' Azmil, from Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Ethnic Malays comprise 70% of Malaysia’s population, followed by ethnic Chinese (22.6%) and ethnic Indians (6.6%). Rituals performed during Thaipusam hold deep significance for Hindu devotees. The festival honors a goddess’ gift of a spear to vanquish evil given to another. Devotees pierce their bodies with hooks and skewers while chanting 'Vel, Vel,' a reference to the sacred spear. That was the chant the radio station’s staff had mimicked in the video. Aziff Azuddin of IMAN Research, a local think-tank, said attacks on faiths were a result of ignorance and inter-ethnic resentment. 'Non-Muslims feel like their faith or way of living is increasingly being sidelined by the Muslim majority,' he told BenarNews. 'And the Muslim majority is increasingly feeling like non-Muslims are becoming more antagonistic toward them. Both things can be true at once.' Incident reports The three Era FM staff featured in the video posted an apology clip online and the station suspended them. The broadcasting, telecommunications and internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, on Wednesday issued a notice of intent to revoke the radio station’s license. Police Inspector-General Razaruddin Husain said police had received 73 reports about the video clip. 'The case is being investigated under Section 298 of the Penal Code for deliberately insulting other religions and Section 233 of the Communication Act. The case file has been handed to the Attorney General’s Chambers for further action,' the nation’s police chief told BenarNews. Gayathry Venkiteswaran, an analyst from the University of Nottingham Malaysia, raised concerns about the incident’s impact on the nation. 'It does set a bad precedent in the sense that it almost creates the kind of normalization of attacks against minorities,' Venkiteswaran, an assistant professor of media, languages and cultures, told BenarNews. And yet, she warned against legal action in such cases. 'Instead of taking the criminal investigation path, there has to be more public calling out of this behavior, more ethical responsibility from broadcasters and a stronger emphasis on professional conduct,' she said. Leaders must urge influential media figures to conduct themselves ethically, she added. '[This is] an opportunity for them to show how to have conversations about differences in society,' the professor said. Ongoing incidents In other action on Wednesday, the MCMC fined comedian Harith Iskandar and a Facebook user named Cecilia Yap 10,000 ringgit (U.S. $2,260) each for joking about a ham sandwich that a store, KK Mart, had labeled as halal in January. This incident was perceived as disrespecting Islam, because Muslims are forbidden from eating pork products such as ham, which means they are not halal. The owner of KK Mart and a supplier has been fined 60,000 ringgit ($13,550) last year for 'wounding religious feelings' by selling socks with the word 'Allah' printed on them. Last month, a grilled corn vendor was fined 400 ringgit ($90) for displaying a racially charged sign targeting the Indian community. In 2024, a movie director and producer were charged with allegedly 'wounding religious feelings' in a feature film about a young Muslim girl exploring other faiths. ‘Firm message’ Meanwhile on Thursday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim warned citizens against using such incidents to stir up tensions. 'This is a firm message to all Malaysians to stop the culture of insulting any religion, culture, and ethnicity in any space in Malaysia,' his office said in a statement. 'Do not let petty issues weaken us at a time when the country is growing and on a good trajectory.'

Silenced And Struggling In Myanmar: How Polycrisis Fuels Period P...	By Naychi Thel Kyaw Tun Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in Myanmar faces significant challenges due to the ongoing polycrisis: political turmoil, cultural taboos, economic constraints, and limited access to sanitation facilities, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas. Key Takeaways: The Myanmar crisis, worsened by the military coup, has driven up the cost of menstrual products, making them unaffordable and forcing reliance on unhygienic alternatives, risking health and dignity. Cultural taboos and poor sanitation, especially in rural and conflict areas, limit access to menstrual products, leading to health risks and social isolation. Reusable products like cloth pads and cups offer a sustainable solution, but education and better sanitation are vital for widespread adoption in low-income and rural areas. Many women and girls struggle to afford disposable pads, leading to reliance on unhygienic alternatives, while inadequate waste management contributes to environmental pollution. The situation worsens in emergency settings, such as internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where access to menstrual products and privacy is severely limited. Since the military coup in February 2021, Myanmar has experienced severe economic turmoil, leading to a sharp increase in the prices of essential goods, including menstrual hygiene products. Before the coup, a pack of eight to ten sanitary pads cost approximately 400 kyats. By mid-2024, the same pack will cost 1,500 and 2,000 kyats, representing a price surge of over 300%, according to Frontier Myanmar. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report by the Purple Feminists Group, published in February 2025, further highlights that nearly half of respondents spend between 1,000 and 5,000 kyats on disposable pads, while reusable products such as menstrual discs, cups, and tampons cost over 10,000 kyats, making them unaffordable for many low- and middle-income families. This sharp increase in menstrual product prices has exacerbated period poverty, making it increasingly difficult for women and girls to afford essential hygiene products. Although awareness of sustainable options like reusable cloth pads and menstrual cups is growing, cultural acceptance, affordability, and access to clean water remain barriers. A balanced approach is needed to address immediate menstrual needs and long-term sustainability, ensuring dignity, health, and environmental responsibility for women and girls across Myanmar. Immediate Needs in Urgent Situations In crisis settings, the priority is to provide women and girls with reliable and safe menstrual products to maintain their health and dignity. Disposable sanitary pads are often the go-to solution due to their ease of use and immediate availability. However, the distribution of these products in Myanmar's IDP camps has faced obstacles, including cultural stigmas and logistical challenges. A study on conflict and health highlighted that many women and girls in these camps lack access to adequate MHM materials and facilities, exacerbating health risks and social isolation. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report further emphasizes the struggles of menstruators in Myanmar, revealing that many lack awareness and access to proper menstrual products, leading to health risks and social stigmatization. The report calls for educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and dismantling of cultural stigmas to combat period poverty effectively. Disposable pads' immediate availability and convenience make them a practical option in emergencies. However, there are several challenges associated with their distribution and use. First, the cost of these products has increased dramatically, making it difficult for humanitarian organizations to provide them at scale. Second, many women in rural and displaced communities lack access to private and sanitary disposal facilities, leading to improper disposal methods that contribute to environmental pollution. Third, the stigma surrounding menstruation in Myanmar means that many women feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for menstrual products, further limiting their access. To address these challenges, humanitarian organizations and government agencies must prioritize menstrual health in emergency response efforts. This includes ensuring the inclusion of menstrual products in aid packages, setting up designated safe spaces for menstrual hygiene management in IDP camps, and conducting awareness campaigns to break down cultural stigmas. Additionally, donors and international organizations must provide financial support for menstrual product distribution, helping offset the rising costs due to economic instability. Sustainable Solutions for Long-Term Impact While addressing immediate needs is crucial, it is equally important to consider the environmental impact and sustainability of menstrual products. Reusable options, such as cloth pads and menstrual cups, offer a viable alternative. These products reduce environmental waste and prove to be cost-effective over time. In Myanmar, initiatives have been launched to produce reusable sanitary pads locally, empowering women economically and providing a sustainable solution for menstrual hygiene. For instance, a pilot program from UNFPA trained women in IDP camps to manufacture 'Safepads,' reusable pads designed for day and night use. This initiative supplied necessary products and created income opportunities for the women involved. Reusable products offer multiple benefits beyond sustainability. First, they are cost-effective in the long run, reducing the financial burden on low-income families. A menstrual cup, for example, can last up to ten years, whereas disposable pads need to be purchased every month. Second, reusable products significantly reduce menstrual waste, helping to address the growing environmental concerns associated with disposable pads. Third, locally produced reusable pads can generate employment opportunities for women, fostering economic independence and empowerment. However, despite these advantages, there are still barriers to the widespread adoption of reusable menstrual products in Myanmar. Cultural resistance remains strong, with many women hesitant to use menstrual cups due to misconceptions and a lack of proper education on their benefits. Moreover, access to clean water and sanitation is a major concern, as proper hygiene practices are necessary to maintain reusable products safely. Reusable products may pose health risks without adequate washing facilities rather than serve as a sustainable solution. Targeted education and awareness campaigns are essential to encourage sustainable menstrual products. Schools and community groups should incorporate menstrual hygiene education into their programs, teaching young girls about the benefits and proper use of reusable products. Financial assistance programs should also be established to make these products accessible to low-income households. Government support is also critical, whether through subsidies, tax reductions on menstrual products, or investments in better sanitation infrastructure. However, the current political landscape in Myanmar can’t expect a government-led initiative for MHM either from State Administration Council (SAC) or the National Unity Government (NUG). Conclusion Balancing feasibility and sustainability in menstrual hygiene management in Myanmar requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Cultural acceptance remains a significant barrier, as menstrual cups and reusable pads may face resistance due to societal norms and misconceptions. Community education is essential to shift perceptions and promote the benefits of sustainable products. Access to clean water and sanitation is another crucial factor, as reusable products require proper cleaning, making disposable options more practical in areas lacking these facilities. Economic challenges also play a role, with the initial cost of reusable products posing a barrier for many women. Programs that subsidize these products or provide them for free can help alleviate this issue. Additionally, the environmental impact of disposable pads is substantial, making promoting reusable products a necessary step towards sustainability. A multi-faceted approach is needed to address the menstrual health crisis in Myanmar effectively. This includes emergency response efforts to provide immediate relief, long-term strategies to promote sustainable menstrual products, and policy reforms to improve overall menstrual health management. By tackling both the short-term and long-term challenges, Myanmar can ensure that all women and girls have access to safe, dignified, and sustainable menstrual hygiene solutions, regardless of their economic or social status.

The AI Boom And The Future Of Data Centers: How Artificial Intell...	The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an unprecedented surge in demand for high-performance computing power. At the heart of this revolution lies the data center, a critical infrastructure that enables AI development, cloud computing, and big data analytics. As AI-driven applications become more sophisticated, the need for advanced, scalable, and efficient data centers is growing at an exponential rate. This article explores the relationship between AI and data centers, analyzing how the AI boom is fueling a transformation in data center design, infrastructure, energy consumption, and the future of digital ecosystems. Understanding Data Centers and Their Role in AI A data center is a facility equipped with powerful servers, networking hardware, and storage systems designed to process and manage vast amounts of data. These centers serve as the backbone of modern computing, supporting applications ranging from enterprise cloud services to complex AI models. The increasing integration of AI technologies is pushing data centers to adopt more robust and efficient infrastructures to meet the growing computational demands. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), relies on massive datasets for training and inference. This process demands high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities, which are provided by data centers equipped with specialized AI hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and custom AI accelerators. AI workloads require: High computational power for training deep neural networks. Scalable storage solutions to handle large datasets. High-speed networking to facilitate rapid data transfers. Efficient cooling systems to manage the heat generated by AI processors. The Growth of AI-Driven Data Centers The AI revolution is significantly impacting data center growth in several key ways: 1. Hyperscale Data Centers Hyperscale data centers are massive facilities designed to accommodate large-scale computing workloads. These centers are primarily operated by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, all of whom are investing billions in building AI-ready data centers worldwide. AI-driven businesses require greater scalability, leading to the rise of massive hyperscale facilities with thousands of interconnected servers. These data centers use advanced cooling techniques, including liquid cooling and immersion cooling, to handle AI's intensive processing requirements. The need for high-speed, low-latency networking is driving investments in fiber-optic networks and edge computing solutions. 2. Edge Computing and AI While hyperscale data centers dominate AI development, edge computing is playing an increasing role in real-time AI applications. Edge computing brings computational power closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving performance for AI-driven technologies such as: Autonomous vehicles, which require instant processing of sensor data. Smart cities, where AI processes video surveillance, traffic management, and energy distribution in real-time. IoT devices, including smart appliances, medical devices, and industrial automation systems. As AI applications proliferate, data centers must evolve to incorporate edge computing nodes, creating a decentralized computing ecosystem that enhances efficiency and responsiveness. 3. Energy Demands and Sustainability Challenges One of the biggest challenges of AI-driven data centers is energy consumption. AI models require enormous processing power, leading to higher electricity usage and increased environmental impact. According to estimates, AI workloads could consume up to 20% of global electricity by 2030 if sustainable solutions are not implemented. To address these challenges, companies are: Investing in renewable energy-powered data centers, utilizing solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Exploring small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) as a stable energy source for high-performance computing. Implementing AI-driven energy optimization to reduce power consumption through smart cooling systems and energy-efficient hardware. 4. The Role of AI in Optimizing Data Centers Interestingly, AI itself is being used to enhance data center operations. AI-driven management systems analyze real-time data to optimize cooling, power distribution, and resource allocation. Some key AI applications in data centers include: AI-based cooling systems, which dynamically adjust temperatures to maximize efficiency. Predictive maintenance, where AI detects hardware failures before they occur, reducing downtime. Workload distribution, where AI directs computational tasks to the most energy-efficient servers, minimizing power wastage. Companies like Google have already implemented AI-driven cooling management, reducing energy consumption by up to 40% in some data centers. The Future of Data Centers in the Age of AI As AI continues to evolve, data centers will undergo further transformations to support emerging technologies. Several key trends will shape the future of AI-driven data centers: 1. AI-Optimized Hardware and Chips Traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs) are no longer sufficient for AI workloads. Instead, specialized AI chips are becoming the new standard. Companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD are developing AI-optimized processors, including: Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), designed for deep learning tasks. Neuromorphic chips, which mimic the human brain's neural processing. Quantum computing, which has the potential to revolutionize AI training by exponentially increasing processing speeds. 2. AI-Powered Data Centers as a Service (DCaaS) The concept of Data Center as a Service (DCaaS) is gaining momentum, where businesses can rent AI-optimized computing resources from cloud providers instead of building their own infrastructure. This allows startups and enterprises to scale their AI operations without massive capital investment in hardware. Cloud-based AI training enables researchers and companies to train models remotely. AIaaS (AI as a Service) provides pre-trained models and computing power to organizations without requiring on-premises infrastructure. Serverless AI computing allows businesses to deploy AI applications dynamically, only using computational power when needed. 3. The Rise of Modular and Self-Sustaining Data Centers To improve scalability and sustainability, the data center industry is shifting towards modular designs that can be deployed quickly and efficiently. Prefabricated data centers are gaining popularity, allowing organizations to establish AI-ready infrastructure in record time. Additionally, companies are investing in self-sustaining data centers that operate independently of traditional power grids. Some innovative approaches include: Underwater data centers, which use ocean water for cooling. AI-driven microgrids, which generate their own electricity using renewable sources. Bio-computing, where AI models are run using biological processors instead of silicon-based chips. Conclusion The boom of artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of data centers, driving demand for more powerful, scalable, and sustainable infrastructure. Hyperscale data centers are expanding, edge computing is becoming essential, and new energy-efficient solutions are being developed to handle the surge in AI workloads. At the same time, AI itself is revolutionizing how data centers operate, optimizing energy use, managing workloads, and ensuring reliability. As we move forward, the synergy between AI and data centers will continue to evolve, creating a new era of intelligent, efficient, and self-sustaining digital infrastructure. The future of AI depends on data centers, and the future of data centers depends on innovation in AI—a cycle of continuous progress that will define the next phase of the digital revolution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufvhg6exDPqRd	2025-03-06T17:43:20-08:00	
Ukraine’s Reputation For Corruption Is Legion: Has It Gotten Bett...	By Mike Eckel and Heorhiy Shabayev (RFE/RL) -- Before he was appointed head of Ukraine’s Anti-Monopoly Committee in 2023, Pavlo Kyrylenko served as the top official in the Donetsk regional administration, overseeing the Ukrainian-controlled parts of a region partially occupied by Russian forces. During that time, his in-laws were also real estate investors, acquiring 21 properties including commercial office space, land plots, and apartments in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Uzhhorod. His wife, whose relatives’ names appeared on the property ownership papers, also drove a luxury BMW X3 sport utility vehicle. To make matters worse, there were major omissions on his legally required financial disclosure forms. Moreover, his wife did not appear to have any income that would legitimately explain how they acquired 70 million hryvnias (around $1.8 million) in assets. Those revelations, first made by Schemes, RFE/RL’s Ukrainian investigative unit , ultimately led to Kyrylenko being charged with 'illegal enrichment' and 'declaration of false information.' A modest victory for anti-corruption campaigners, Kyrylenko’s charges were another reminder of the issue that Ukraine has been struggling with for a decade or more: endemic, prolific corruption, in the public and private sectors. 'Obviously, we still have a lot of work to do. That’s correct, and of course there is still corruption in Ukraine,' said Daria Kalenyuk, a respected activist and executive director of the Kyiv-based Anti-Corruption Action Center, which was founded in 2012. 'However, I can compare today with what was here 13 years ago…and it's like the results are unbelievable.' Corruption Scandals Three years into Russia’s all-out invasion, Ukrainian society continues on a war footing, galvanized to support the armed forces in the fight against an external, existential threat -- while also rallying behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wartime leadership. But corruption remains a persistent internal threat, illustrated by a series of scandals in recent years involving the Defense Ministry, national prosecutors, and wealthy businessmen. The predecessor to the current defense minister lost his job due to a scandal involving inflated food prices. 'It's good that it is possible in Ukraine, during the [fourth] year of the large-scale invasion, to actually freely expose corruption, and that there are tools which allow [people] to do that,' she told RFE/RL. 'So it's actually an indication that we have an open society and still a system of checks and balances, that we are a free country, free society.' The struggle to clean up the country’s reputation as a swamp has been messy at times, said Andriy Borovyk, the executive director of the corruption watchdog, Transparency International Ukraine. But not every mess is necessarily a sign of corruption, he said. 'Should we talk about corruption during war? I think yes -- it’s necessary,' Borovyk told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service. 'But in Ukrainian society, there’s a tendency to label any inefficiency or stupidity as corruption right away. That’s just how things are perceived here.' 'Yes, corruption must be exposed, but not every inefficiency should be immediately equated with corruption,' he said. Wartime Corruption Under Zelenskyy Disgust with graft is often cited as one of the leading causes for the 2013-2014 Maidan demonstrations, where thousands of Ukrainians took to Kyiv’s streets for months to protest. After President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February 2014, and Russia launched a campaign of covert and overt military action in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s military struggled to mount an effective defense, in some cases lacking weaponry that had been contracted but never supplied. The problem was largely attributed to graft. For many, the nadir came with the post-Maidan discoveries at Yanukovych’s Versailles-like complex called Mezhyhirya , where he built an opulent mansion along with guesthouses, lakes, a collection of classic luxury cars, and a dock with a mock 18th century Spanish warship. Zelenskyy’s landslide election victory in 2019 was widely seen as another push to try to move society beyond old habits: away from bribery and kickbacks -- big and small -- and toward transparency and accountability. Russia’s war has made it more difficult. During the invasion, defense planners have been raked over the coals for several eye-popping procurement scandals -- something that appears to resonate more deeply with Ukrainians eager to support the armed forces. Military contracts had been classified following the 2022 invasion. However, that changed in January 2023, when investigative reporters found a military supplier who was charging the government nearly 2 1/2 times the retail price for eggs. Schemes later found additional contracts with suppliers wxho were providing the armed forces with food items at above-market rates. Public pressure led to Zelenskyy sacking Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov in September 2023. Under pressure from the United States and Western countries aiding Ukraine, the Zelenskyy government set up a specialized entity -- the Defense Procurement Agency -- to streamline how weaponry was contracted, purchased, and supplied. On January 28, 2025, the Cabinet fired a deputy defense minister as part of a shake-up of the procurement operations. That same day , the National Anti-Corruption Bureau -- a dedicated graft-fighting law enforcement agency -- opened a criminal probe of Umerov for refusing to extend Bezrukova’s contract . But Reznikov’s successor as defense minister, Rustem Umerov, criticized the Defense Procurement Agency for what he said was inefficiency and lax governance. Defenders of its director, Maryna Bezrukova, who took over in early 2024, said she helped clean up a murky but essential system. 'Unfortunately, monitoring defense expenditures remains a highly opaque process, and the public learns about irregularities only in isolated cases,' said Serhiy Mytkalyk, who heads a nongovernmental organization called Anti-Corruption Headquarters. How Corrupt Is Ukraine? Transparency International, whose corruption perception ratings are closely watched around the world, said Ukraine had improved markedly in recent years due to 'reforms aimed at European integration and the fulfillment of international obligations.' However, the country slipped last year, the group said, due to reforms 'being implemented only formally,' or the implementation was 'being deliberately stalled.'Overall, Ukraine rated in 105th place out of 180 countries in the organization’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index -- ahead of Russia and Belarus, but behind Moldova, Hungary, and Romania. The United States was in 28th place. Last year, Dmytro Verbytskiy, a top official in the national Prosecutor-General’s Office, was found to be living in a rented suburban townhouse that his nephew had bought at a grossly underpriced value, according to another Schemes investigation. Schemes also discovered evidence suggesting the nephew was in fact a straw-man buyer, secretly representing an Odesa businessman. Experts said the arrangement might constitute tax evasion, though the deputy prosecutor denied wrongdoing. Schemes later uncovered details about Verbytskiy’s girlfriend, who in 2024 became the owner of a new Porsche automobile and a 3-story cottage in the same tony subdivision where Verbytskiy was living—even though her declared income was substantially lower. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau later launched a criminal investigation into Verbytskiy’s assets. Weeks after the revelations, and the subsequent investigation, Verbytskiy officially resigned from the prosecutor’s office. Anti-corruption activist Kalenyuk argued the fact that these scandals and investigations are in the public eye wasn’t a sign of unremitting corruption; rather, she said, it was a healthy sign that Ukrainian public and civil society were reacting to the problem. 'It's like saying that there is no corruption in Belarus. Nobody is talking about corruption in Belarus, absolutely nobody. But it doesn't mean that there is no corruption,' she said. 'It just means that if you are talking about corruption in Belarus, you will be jailed, tortured, extorted, imprisoned, intimidated, killed, whatever.' As for Kyrylenko, who was charged with 'illegal enrichment' for his shady property deals, prosecutors requested he be detained, but instead the court ordered him released on August 28, 2024, pending trial, with an electronic monitoring bracelet, and bail of 30 million hryvnia ($730,000). The bail, Schemes found , was paid not by Kyrylenko, however, but by a businessman that owns a company currently under investigation by a regional unit of the Anti-Monopoly Committee. Mike Eckel is a senior international correspondent reporting on political and economic developments in Russia, Ukraine, and around the former Soviet Union, as well as news involving cybercrime and espionage. He's reported on the ground on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the wars in Chechnya and Georgia, and the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, as well as the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Heorhiy Shabayev is a journalist with Schemes (Skhemy), an investigative news project run by RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. He is a graduate of the Institute of Journalism at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and the author of a dozen investigations into corruption in the government, the construction industry, and in large state-owned enterprises.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufhF0AU-gMurN	2025-03-06T17:36:37-08:00	
Why We’re Stuck With The Term ‘Classical Liberalism’ – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken Near the beginning of his ten-hour lecture series on the history of political thought, the great free-market historian Ralph Raico takes a little time to define his terms. In the first lecture he says: 'What I’m going to be discussing this week is classical liberalism. I might slip and just call it liberalism from time to time, but you’ll understand what I’m saying. We’ll be discussing its growth, its development, and finally, I’ll say something about the possible future of liberalism.' As the lectures progress, it becomes apparent that Raico is using the term liberalism to mean the philosophy of freedom and laissez-faire. To many average Americans who think of themselves as being of the party of freedom and free markets, they may think this is rather odd. Many Americans in this group—especially the variety who are not prone to reading history books—might be confused by this. After all, don’t talk show hosts like Sean Hannity use the term 'liberal' to describe todays social democrats? Isn’t it proper to use the term 'conservative' to describe the free-market group? If one tends to think of the 1940s as the murky, distant past, then yes, the current use of the terms 'conservative' and 'liberal' seems fine. On the other hand, for people who actually study history and try to make sense of intellectual movement and their origins, it is usually obvious that the way the term 'liberal' is used by pundits at Fox News and MSNBC simply doesn’t work. This is because the term 'liberal,' as used by people in the past, clearly meant the party of freedom and free markets. The term 'conservative,' meanwhile, denotes no specific ideological content, and depends on which country one is talking about. The post-1945 ideological movement we now call 'conservative' has never really been an heir to the classical liberals. This can be seen in the American conservative movement’s obsession with war, and in the fact that its founder, William F. Buckley, literally supported the adoption of militarist totalitarianism. Indeed, the free-market aspect of conservatism was never more than a thin patina applied to the movement to help the conservative leaders attract the disaffected free-market supporters of the Old Right. American conservatism in practice has never prioritized freedom as historical liberals have. Indeed, some of the conservative movement’s own theorists, such as Russell Kirk, explicitly sought to separate the conservative movement from the free-market liberals of the nineteenth century. (See Kirk’s book The Conservative Mind.) To describe a free-market person as 'conservative' in 1910 or 1850 would have just been confusing to everyone involved. Libertarianism is the Radical Wing of Classical Liberalism This is an important issue for libertarians since, as Raico shows, the ideology we call 'libertarianism' is simply the radical wing of the intellectual movement known as classical liberalism. This, however, hasn’t stopped many modern day classical liberalism and libertarians from claiming that there is some sort of bright shining line between libertarians and free-market liberals. Often, the claim is that libertarians and classical liberals are fundamentally incompatible because libertarians are all supposedly hard-core anarcho-capitalists while classical liberals demand the existence of a state. This attempt at inserting a hard separation between the two groups does not survive a look at the historical reality, however. For instance, we can find plenty of theorists with anarchist views who were well ensconced and highy influential in liberal circles. Perhaps most notable is Gustave de Molinari, the grand old man of liberalism by the late nineteenth century, but also arguably the first anarcho-capitalist. Molinari denied that a state was necessary and generally took a very radical laissez-faire, anti-statist view. He was also the editor of the flagship liberal journal Journal des Économistes for decades. It would be absurd to claim that Molinari cannot be counted among the liberals because of his anarchist views. We might also look to Jean-Baptiste Say who was clear that he did not regard the state as necessary. It’s hard to overstate Say’s prestige and influence among liberals in the nineteenth century. Yet, he was clearly part of the liberal world, and it makes no sense to claim that his anarchist statements somehow render him not a part of the liberal movement. J.B. Say, like Molinari, was clearly both a libertarian and a classical liberal. We might make similar observations about Herbert Spencer. Spencer, of course, famously wrote an anarchist essay on the right to ignore the state. Was Spencer therefore not a liberal? That would be news to most of the liberals of Spencer’s time. Spencer was one of the radicals, and as such, was a libertarian. But he was hardly outside the liberal movement. As with every other intellectual movement, there were some who were more moderate than others. The breadth and radicalism of some corners of the classical liberal movement should now make it all the more clear how incoherent it would be to apply a term like 'conservative' to describe this group. To apply the term 'conservative' to theorists like Spencer, Say, or Molinari should strike us as laughable. Because of this, Raico has even gone so far as to use the terms 'classical liberal' and 'libertarian' as near synonyms. This is fitting given how even the more moderate classical liberals of the past—such as Adam Smith—would be considered free-market extremists by today’s political standards. In this sense, the term libertarian can indeed serve as a substitute for classical liberal. Why Surrender the Term to the Left? Even with 'libertarian' as a serviceable substitute for 'liberalism,' properly understood, that’s not a good enough reason to simply let the Left have it. Yes, handing over the term 'liberal' to be the exclusive property of the democratic socialists may seem no big deal to people who rarely read about the past as it was before living memory. But, it is a serious problem for people who actually try to think systematically about the origins of modern political and intellectual movements. It doesn’t work to describe the Lockeans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as 'liberals' on one page, and to then describe people with the same beliefs as something else entirely a few paragraphs later—simply because that second group of people happened to live in the twentieth century. This is a formula for creating what Raico calls 'conceptual mayhem' in which the term 'liberalism' means both the ideology of Hillary Clinton and the Ideology of Thomas Jefferson. If we use the word this way, then it has no useful meaning at all. This is how we ended up with the term 'classical liberal' in the first place. Recognizing that there is no suitable substitute term for the ideology of laissez-faire, some commentators attempted to deal with this mayhem. 'Classical liberalism' is an awkward phrase, but is used out of necessity. The added adjective 'classical'—which is essentially a synonym of 'traditional'— is used as a makeshift solution to the abuse of the term 'liberal' in recent decades. That’s why we have it. The whole reason this even became necessary, of course, is because social democrats stole the term to describe their own ideology back in the first half of the twentieth century. As Raico shows, this was done deliberately because liberalism was extremely popular at the time, and it made a lot of sense to poach the word and apply it to the Left’s unliberal ideologies. Raico writes: In a famous passage [Joseph Schumpeter] ironically states that it was a kind of compliment, if an unintended one, when the enemies of the system of free enterprise confiscated the name liberal for what was basically the opposite of what liberalism had stood for from the start. Nowadays, you can find writers who express astonishment that free market economists still sometimes insist on calling themselves liberals rather than conservatives. Some might say why argue over a name, why not just call your position anything at all and go on from there to argue the case for it? Stephen Holmes, a political scientist from Chicago, has called the dispute over the term 'liberal' a matter of bragging rights; the right to brag 'I’m the real liberal in the liberal tradition and you’re not.' On the other hand, he insists that he’s in the real liberal tradition and thinks it’s worth arguing about. Raico notes here that scholars on the Left—that is, the social democrats—aren’t willing to give the term back to the laissez-faire party, and think it’s worth fighting to retain control of the term. On the other hand, many free-market people—who generally seem to lack the savvy and drive of their enemies on the Left—can’t be bothered with fighting for proper terminology. Instead, I often hear from free-market activists that we should just adopt another term. Perhaps 'voluntarist' or 'individualist.' Both terms, of course, conceptually sever the link between modern laissez-faire liberals and their 400-year history. That’s part of the Left’s plan. The Left wants use to believe that modern social democrats like John Maynard Keynes are the real liberals and the inheritors of the the tradition of 'liberty' pushed by the revered American revolutionaries. This is completely false, of course, but by controlling the word 'liberal,' the left can also distance the true party of freedom from its own historical patrimony. Moreover, if a new term for the laissez-party actually becomes popular, the Left will just try to expropriate that term, too. This already happened with the term 'individualist' as Raico notes: some of the English old-fashioned liberals like Auberon Herbert and the extreme followers of Herbert Spencer started saying 'let’s call ourselves something else, let’s call ourselves individualists.' Then, John Dewey started saying 'well, you know, there was an old individualism that is now obsolete.' Dewey then went on to say that his leftwing ideology was the real individualism. Indeed, surrendering to the Left on definitions and terminology just encourages the Left to keep poaching popular words. Basically, every time a self-described 'conservative' uses the term 'liberal' to describe a Leftist social democrat, he is basically saying 'yes, I agree to discuss everything using the terms and definitions dictated by the Left.' We have already made a big concession by using the modifier 'classical' at all. Alas, we are forced into it because the social democrats who now call themselves 'liberals' have long controlled the media and academia, and those groups have tremendous influence in the public’s use of words. Words Have Meanings But, if the real liberals, the real party of laissez-faire, simply abandons the term, it will become next to impossible to construct a coherent historical narrative about the party of freedom and free markets. That’s what the Left wants, of course, but we don’t have to go along with it. Raico concludes: I submit that there is no intellectually honest reason to bestow the term liberal on those nowadays who favor a never-ending list of government funded programs. These programs, we are told, are necessary to deal with every real or imagined ill of society and favor a constantly expanding state apparatus to wage war on the traditional ways and values of civil society. The people who support this are the people who are called liberal nowadays. The 'new' liberalism of Hobhouse and Hobson is indistinguishable from the position, for instance, of Eduard Bernstein, the founder of the vision of socialism in Germany. This has today become socialism altogether in the modern world, just as the position of American liberal intellectuals is indistinguishable from that of people who call themselves social democrats in Europe. ... The working definition of liberalism that I will adopt is this: it is the ideology that holds that civil society—understood as a sum order of society, the sum of the social order minus the state—by and large runs itself within the bounds of a principle of private property. This is liberalism as I’ll be discussing it here. Raico is right. We might still have to add on the word 'classical' on occasion to help along those with a weaker grasp of history. But 'liberal' remains the only truly accurate and consistent term for the ideology of freedom and free markets.

Stop Moving Clocks Back And Forth And Go With Standard Time – OpE...	Daylight saving time returns at 2 a.m. on Sunday. Unless Congress stops the madness of springing forward and falling back every year, it will end Nov. 2, when standard time resumes. Twenty states have proposed or enacted legislation to implement daylight saving time permanently. But those laws cannot go into effect until Congress amends or repeals the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which established the current twice-yearly clock change regime. We’ve been here before. The United States adopted year-round daylight saving time during the two global wars of the 20th century and again starting on Jan. 6, 1974. Both policies were justified as a means of saving not time, but energy. When the U.S. Department of Energy finally studied the issue in 2008—a four-week extension of daylight saving time mandated by an amendment to the 1966 Uniform Time Act—the energy savings were found to be trivial: 0nly about a 0.03 percent reduction in national energy consumption. Subsequent research, including a 2010 study by environmental economists Matthew Kotchen of Yale and Laura Grant, then with the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates daylight saving time actually 'increases electricity demand.' Significantly, 1974’s permanent experiment with daylight saving time ended after just eight months. Though intended to last two years, it was canceled in response to strong opposition from parents who objected to sending their children to school in the dark during late fall and early winter. According to Time magazine, 'Eight children in Florida were involved in pre-dawn car accidents in the wake of the time change, leading a TV commentator to coin the phrase ‘daylight disaster time.’' Daylight saving time has other serious dark sides. Springing clocks forward one hour in March causes worrisome physical and mental health effects, including spikes in heart attacks, strokes and automobile accidents. Sleep deprivation makes people groggy, less focused and less productive on the job until they adjust to the time change. Those adjustments take longer at older ages. The adverse health consequences of daylight saving time explain why the American Medical Association and many sleep specialists and physiologists recommend staying on standard time throughout the calendar year. Standard time aligns the human body more closely with the sun. Sunlight optimally sets our body clocks (circadian rhythms). The Uniform Time Act of 1966 permits individual states to adopt standard time year-round without congressional action. But only Hawaii, parts of Arizona (areas beyond the borders of the Navajo Nation, which comprises 27,000 square miles of that state plus portions of Utah and New Mexico) and the outlying U.S. territories do not observe daylight saving time. So Arizona operates under two different time regimes from March to November: DST for those living on the reservation and standard time for everyone else. The number of hours the sun is shining has nothing to do with where the hands of the clock point. The season, and the arc distance from the equator to your location on the globe, determine the length of the day. The benefits to after-work golfers and others who like longer sunlit evenings hardly justify the substantial costs of the twice-yearly time changes the rest of us are forced to bear. If people want to shop or play golf after work, they can leave their offices earlier in the afternoon when the day already is longer at northern latitudes. In the late 19th century, the railroads adopted the convention of 'standard time,' which is now in effect for a ridiculously brief four months every year. Standard time and geographically defined time zones helped shippers and passengers easily and more accurately plan departures and arrivals. Daylight saving time abruptly shifts most Americans one time zone to the east. Why? Daylight saving time does not 'save' anything. We’ve tried permanent daylight saving time nationwide before. Repeating the same policy mistake and expecting a different outcome is one definition of insanity. Permanent standard time is the best way of resolving the current debate.

End The DC Hold ‘Em Game – OpEd	In its first hearing, the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) cited 'hundreds of billions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted on improper payments and fraud.' The DOGE revelations include $20 billion at the Environmental Protection Agency, money the EPA bosses 'knew they were wasting.' With April 15 looming, taxpayers should be aware of one reason such colossal waste occurs: the government gets their money before they do. As Robert Higgs (Crisis and Leviathan) explains, this is a relatively new development. Before World War II, individuals who owed federal tax on their income paid during the following year in quarterly installments. As Higgs explains, 'Wars have always been the most important occasions for the introduction of new forms of taxation.' A gigantic global war imposed huge revenue demands, so the government devised a plan to withhold tax from workers’ paychecks. One of the architects of this system was economist Milton Friedman, who admitted that he helped 'develop machinery that would make possible a government that I would come to criticize severely as too large, too intrusive, too destructive of freedom.' Withholding was supposedly a wartime measure, but the government conveniently kept it in place. Higgs cites the observation of Charlotte Twight in Dependent on D.C. that 'withholding is the paramount administrative mechanism that since 1943 has enabled the federal government to collect, without significant protest, sufficient private resources to fund a vastly expanded welfare state.' As DOGE now reveals, the welfare state is also an expanded, wasteful state. Politicians and government bureaucrats appear to believe they have a prior claim to what American workers earn. As a matter of right, everything a worker earns belongs to the worker. The so-called 'take-home pay' is what remains after the government grabs the worker’s money first. Workers should get everything they earn and pay their income taxes in quarterly installments, just as freelance writers and other self-employed Americans do now. Writing quarterly checks to the government will raise consciousness of how much the government is taking. Thanks to DOGE, the people are learning how much of their money the government is wasting. Judging by their shrill complaints, government bureaucrats seem to think there’s something wrong with accountability. Musk’s demand for them to show five accomplishments from the previous week really set them off. Imagine if that email had shown up with John Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency. In his long career, Beale never produced anything of value. With degrees in political science, administration, and law, Beale boasted little if any scientific expertise for his job as a 'senior policy adviser' in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. In 1994, Beale told his bosses he was a secret agent for the CIA, but nobody at the EPA bothered to check. While claiming to be in London, India, and Pakistan, Beale was actually performing no work of any kind. He pulled off the CIA ruse for nearly 20 years, bilking taxpayers of nearly $1 million, and even got retention bonuses after he retired. For details, see the hearings shown on C-SPAN. This all went down at the EPA, whose bosses knew they were wasting $20 billion. Taxpayers can be forgiven for thinking the Department of Justice should look into it. As DOGE reveals fathomless waste and fraud, President Trump should push for the elimination of tax withholding at first opportunity. The Internal Revenue Service—bloated by $80 billion under Biden’s 'Inflation Reduction Act,' should not get taxpayers’ money before the workers who earned it. That will restrain government power and help prevent waste, fraud and abuse from happening in the first place.

Is This What Winning Looks Like? – OpEd	If this is winning, it is less fun than I had hoped. The confirmation hearings for Jay Bhattacharya as secretary of the National Institutes of Health just ended. They were short, just two hours from soup to nuts. Nothing played out like I had expected. And yet, now that I think about it, it played out exactly as I should have expected. Jay’s erudition, humility, and sincerity carried the day. His vast knowledge of medicine, science, and economics is worn casually, but it is unmistakable. It’s inconceivable that political actors could possibly match it. That is known and obvious. My main interest in watching was in hope of something approaching a real debate over Covid policy, 2020-2023 (and, in some ways, continuing in new iterations). After all, that is why he was in this seat. The previous administration specifically targeted him, calling him a 'fringe epidemiologist' and sought to censor his opinions. As time went on and the historical trajectory flipped, this quiet academic who stood up for principle when it mattered has found himself picked to head the world’s most powerful scientific agency. One might suppose – if society and politics work as one might intuitively think they should – that there would now be a big discussion and debate on lockdowns, with both sides allowed to speak. Maybe this would be the reckoning we’ve all long awaited. Instead, there was no discussion and no debate at all. The Democratic side of the aisle did not bring it up once. Three Republicans did and briefly. Jay reiterated what he has said for years and what was stated in the Great Barrington Declaration. His position is clear. The role of science is to advise people based on evidence. It is not to use force to interfere with people’s freedoms. Public health agencies should never have pushed school, business, and church closures, nor forced human separation and masks, and so on. He said this clearly, inclusive of vaccine mandates. 'Science should be an engine for knowledge and freedom, not something that stands on top of society and says you must do this or else.' 'It shouldn’t be pushing Covid vaccines.' 'The proper role of scientists in a pandemic is to answer basic questions that policy makers have about what the right policy should be.' 'The role of scientists shouldn’t be to say you can’t send your kids to school for two years.' 'If science is a force for freedom and knowledge, it will have universal support.' There was zero pushback from the other side. They might as well have had their fingers in their ears. There was a change of subject, almost a desperate one. No one took issue with a word he said on this subject. Instead, the only subject from the Democratic side was pressing to make sure that the money keeps flowing out of the NIH to the research centers in their states. Are we supposed to believe that the new orthodoxy is that the Covid response was a disaster? No one said that but Jay, Rand Paul, and two other Republicans. From the other side, there was not even a breath of contradiction. At the same time, there were no apologies, no admissions of stupidity, no granting that mistakes were made. Instead, we got silence on the whole topic that even the New York Times now admits is the single most important topic of our times. After all, the Covid response did in fact set the world on fire. It is a main cause of the utter collapse in the prestige of experts in many sectors, if not all sectors. It’s a central reason why people don’t trust their doctors, why the media is in such disrepute, why the politicians are met with such incredulity. It’s the major contributing factor for ill-health, illiteracy, depression, substance abuse, economic dislocation, job insecurity, and cultural despair. And yet, we seem to be at a stalemate. The proponents of the response – or those who simply chose to look the other way – don’t want the subject to come up ever again. It is an affected amnesia. The people who were demonized all along and now turn out to be right want to debate but cannot find any sparring partners. We won the match but the bell never rang. The purpose of the bell is to prevent an ambush from behind, which is precisely why this studied silence is so alarming. What happens when a new virus comes along, real, manufactured, or imagined? We have no real statements saying that there will not be a repeat. The existing policy is still what it was: lockdown until vaccination. To be sure, with Jay and RFK and others now in the driver’s seat, this is less likely to go down the same way. And yet if you look at the handling of the Bird flu, you see the same strategies being deployed in ways that have affected prices and the food supply. Authorities want every bird slaughtered if one tests positive. They feed tax dollars to pharmaceutical companies to develop and distribute livestock vaccines. There has been no change in the policy concerning PCR testing and what that implies for the animals. Meanwhile, just before inauguration, the HHS, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Interior cooperated in pushing out the first-ever One Health policy for the US, working directly with the WHO, which the US has supposedly left. In other words, there is no real change in the policy or the orthodoxy. One reason for that is precisely because of the absence of real public discussion and debate. If such a debate did occur, and if our leaders would at least be open and honest about this calamity (even if they still defend it), we might finally make progress toward putting the world back together again. As it stands, there are too many unanswered questions, too much pent-up anger, too much uncertainty about precisely how governments plan to manage pandemics, whether they affect humans or livestock. It simply will not do to pretend that none of this happened and hope it goes away once people are tired of the subject, forget, and push back the trauma into the recesses of the public mind. This is all too dishonest for a civilized people. Jay wanted that debate. His interrogators did not. Again, this is not the way winning should feel. Brownstone Institute’s 10-part history could not have come at a better time. We need more than the right people in high-profile positions. We need a completely new paradigm, which cannot really take hold until that reckoning finally does occur. That begins with frankness and an end to the silence. Below is an AI-generated reconstruction of Jay’s opening statement. Reconstructed Opening Statement by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, March 5, 2025 Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Hearing Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and distinguished members of this committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as President Trump’s nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health. It is an honor to be considered for this role at an institution that has long been the crown jewel of American biomedical science—a place with a storied history of supporting breakthroughs that have saved countless lives and deepened our understanding of human health. But today, that legacy is at a crossroads. American health is in decline. During the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy in the United States plunged, and it has yet to recover. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens—adults and children alike—are grappling with a crisis of chronic diseases: obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. These conditions are robbing us of our vitality and our future. At the same time, public trust in science and medicine has eroded, shaken by a series of missteps and a growing perception that our institutions prioritize conformity over truth. The NIH, as the world’s preeminent health research agency, must rise to meet these challenges. But it cannot do so effectively under the shadow of its recent past. Over the last few years, top NIH officials oversaw a culture of coverup, obfuscation, and intolerance for ideas that diverged from their own. We’ve seen this in the dismissal of legitimate scientific debate during the pandemic, and we’ve seen it in scandals like the fraudulent Alzheimer’s research that undermined confidence in NIH-funded science. This must change. If confirmed, I pledge to restore the NIH to its foundational mission: funding the most innovative, cutting-edge research to deliver transformative advances in human health—not just incremental steps, but bold leaps forward. My plan is to ensure that NIH invests in science that is replicable, reproducible, and generalizable—science we can trust. Too much of modern biomedical research fails this basic test, and we owe the American people better. Central to this vision is a commitment to free speech and scientific dissent. Dissent is not a threat to science—it is the very essence of science. For too long, the NIH has stifled disagreement, sidelining early-career scientists and others who dared to question the orthodoxy. I will establish a culture of respect where all ideas can be expressed and debated openly, because that is how we uncover truth. This is not just a principle; it is a necessity if we are to rebuild the public’s faith in our work. I also share Secretary Kennedy’s urgency in confronting the chronic disease crisis. American health is going backwards, and the NIH must lead the way forward by investigating the root causes of these conditions and developing solutions that prevent and reverse them. This will require rigorous oversight of research that could pose risks—such as studies with pandemic potential—while ensuring the vast majority of NIH work continues to advance the public good. The NIH’s nearly $48 billion budget is a sacred trust, supporting over 300,000 researchers worldwide. If confirmed, I will steward those resources with care, prioritizing innovation over bureaucracy and ensuring that every dollar serves the mission of making Americans healthier. Together with this administration, we can return the NIH to its gold standard—delivering discoveries that improve lives, save lives, and, yes, make America healthy again.

Artificial Intelligence And The Fate Of The Human Imagination: A ...	The incursion of artificial intelligence (AI) into the domains of literature and the arts poses profound existential and epistemological questions. It unsettles our deepest assumptions about creativity, consciousness, and the very nature of human expression. As machines increasingly encroach upon the spaces once considered the sanctuaries of human uniqueness, the creative landscape experiences both an expansion and an erosion. AI serves as both muse and menace, liberating and shackling, augmenting and obfuscating the intricate web of the human psyche. This article offers a psychoanalytic and philosophical meditation on the ramifications of AI's presence in literature and the arts, dissecting its promises and perils. The Machine as the New Muse: The Expansion of the Creative Process From a Freudian perspective, creativity emerges from the dynamic interplay between the unconscious and conscious mind. It is a sublimation of drives, an elaborate dance between the id, ego, and superego. AI, by introducing an externalized mechanism of creativity, extends this dialectic beyond the individual, offering an additional layer to the creative psyche. Instead of serving as a passive tool, AI functions as a collaborator—suggesting, modifying, and even generating aesthetic products. The subconscious mind, once constrained by the individual's linguistic and cognitive limits, finds in AI an endless associative engine, capable of producing variations upon variations of thought. Philosophically, AI engenders a new form of authorship. If the Derridean notion of différance suggests that meaning is always deferred, existing in an endless play of signifiers, then AI's capacity to endlessly iterate creative works becomes the ultimate realization of this concept. The human artist is no longer a singular origin of meaning but rather a navigator amidst an ocean of algorithmic possibilities. In this sense, AI does not replace creativity; it amplifies it, extending the horizon of what can be imagined and constructed. The Aesthetic Singularity: AI and the Death of the Artist Yet, as AI expands creative possibilities, it also challenges the ontological status of the artist. The Romantic ideal of the solitary genius—haunted, inspired, forging the new from the abyss of the self—stands in stark contrast to the mechanized, iterative processes of AI. If AI can generate poetry, paintings, and novels with an efficiency that surpasses human labor, does this herald the obsolescence of the human artist? Lacanian psychoanalysis suggests that subjectivity is formed through lack—the recognition that one is incomplete, forever seeking an unattainable fullness. Human creativity, therefore, is the expression of this lack, a striving for wholeness through symbolic representation. AI, however, lacks this constitutive void. It neither desires nor suffers, and thus, while it can generate art, it cannot create in the psychoanalytic sense. Its productions are simulations, however intricate, lacking the libidinal investment that renders human art a confrontation with the Real. This is where the existential crisis of AI-generated art unfolds. If art is to be defined as the manifestation of inner turmoil, existential questioning, and the ineffable yearnings of being, then AI's role in the arts becomes a simulacrum of true creativity—an echo without an original voice. The aesthetic singularity AI promises thus threatens to render the concept of authorship meaningless. If machines can create without agency, then authorship itself becomes an illusion, dissolved into the collective unconscious of the algorithm. The Commodification of Creativity: From Catharsis to Consumption AI does not merely alter how art is created but also how it is consumed. Late capitalism thrives on efficiency and productivity, and AI fits seamlessly into this framework. Algorithmic art does not need rest, inspiration, or existential crisis; it operates on demand, tailored to market preferences. The distinction between high art and mass production collapses under the weight of infinite customization. AI-generated literature and paintings become products in the purest sense, stripped of the inefficiencies of the human creative struggle. Walter Benjamin's critique of mechanical reproduction warned of the loss of the 'aura'—the unique presence of an artwork in time and space. AI extends this logic to its extreme. When a painting can be replicated or generated infinitely, when a poem can be adjusted in real-time based on audience reception, what remains of the sacred aura of artistic expression? Furthermore, the psychoanalytic function of art as catharsis is undermined. Traditional artistic labor involves confrontation with the unconscious, a journey through repression and revelation. AI-generated works, devoid of psychic investment, risk becoming mere commodities—slick, polished, and ultimately hollow. The therapeutic potential of literature and the arts is diluted when the process of artistic struggle is replaced by instant generativity. The Promise of Transhumanist Art: A Hybrid Future? Despite its threats, AI also presents new forms of artistic experience that may redefine human creativity rather than destroy it. Transhumanist philosophers envision a future where human cognition is augmented by artificial intelligence, leading to an entirely new category of artistic expression. In this vision, AI does not replace human creativity but enhances it—offering artists novel tools to navigate the liminal spaces of imagination. AI-generated art, rather than an autonomous force, may function as a prosthetic extension of the artist's mind. Just as the invention of photography transformed visual representation without eradicating painting, AI might serve as a new mode of aesthetic evolution. The human-AI collaboration could birth forms of literature and art that are unimaginable within the constraints of the human cognitive apparatus alone. However, this hybrid future demands vigilance. The risk remains that AI's ability to predict and optimize artistic trends might result in a hyper-rationalization of creativity. If algorithms dictate aesthetic decisions based on engagement metrics and popularity, art may increasingly serve as a means of control rather than a vehicle for radical expression. Conclusion: The End or Evolution of Art? AI's intrusion into literature and the arts is not merely a technological shift but a philosophical and psychoanalytic rupture. It raises the fundamental question of whether creativity is a uniquely human trait or if it can be outsourced to an intelligence devoid of human consciousness. AI's potential to expand artistic possibilities is undeniable, but so is its capacity to trivialize and commodify creativity. From a psychoanalytic perspective, AI lacks the unconscious depths that fuel human artistic production. Its outputs, however refined, remain spectral—approximations of creativity rather than its true expression. Philosophically, AI challenges the concept of authorship, placing artistic agency in a liminal state between human intention and machine execution. Perhaps, then, the real challenge is not whether AI can create art but whether humans will allow themselves to be eclipsed by their own creations. If AI is to be integrated into the arts, it must not be as a mere producer of aesthetic commodities but as a means to deepen the human encounter with the unknown. The fate of literature and the arts in the age of AI will ultimately depend on whether we harness artificial intelligence to elevate human creativity or surrender to the seductive ease of mechanized imagination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufrCcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-03-06T17:06:59-08:00	
EU Edges Closer To €150 Billion Defense Package Despite Hungary’s...	By Alexandra Brzozowski and Magnus Lund Nielsen and Nicoletta Ionta and Owen Morgan and Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU leaders endorsed a landmark €150 billion defence spending plan at their highly-anticipated emergency summit on Thursday, while Hungary's Viktor Orbán refused to back a statement of support for Ukraine. All 27 EU countries agreed to consider 'as a matter of urgency' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's plan to issue €150 billion in fresh loans to boost defence spending, paving the way for the Commission to put a concrete proposal on the table by the next summit in two weeks' time. However, a statement of support for Ukraine was supported by only 26 countries, with Orbán – an ally of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – remaining in obdurate opposition, as most leaders had anticipated. It is not the first time in recent history that EU leaders have adopted a separate statement without Hungarian backing. But their doing so on Thursday shows clear intent that a 'coalition of the willing' will find avenues to send more financial and military aid to Ukraine as the United States withdraws. Hungary could not agree to the statement that all other EU leaders 'firmly supported', which affirmed that 'there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine' and that any peace deal must 'respect Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Slovakia, led by the pro-Russian Robert Fico, was persuaded to support the Ukraine text by the last-minute inclusion of wording on exploring 'workable solutions' to its ongoing gas supply dispute with Kyiv – though the concession was significantly watered down in the summit's final hours. 'Money where our mouth is' Von der Leyen, who took leaders through the contours of her ReArm Europe plan first announced on Tuesday, confirmed she would table a legal text that elaborates on her menu of five defence funding options in time for the next summit. Those five options, which attracted varying support on Thursday, include: the €150 billion in loans, activating a national 'escape clause' in the bloc's fiscal rules, incentivising the use of cohesion funding for defence spending, a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, and mobilising private capital through completing the Savings and Investment Union. Not on the table, yet, is joint borrowing – or the issuance of so-called Eurobonds – despite French President Emmanuel Macron saying after the summit he was 'ready to look' at the idea. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed that Germany would like the spending plans to go even further, by creating a long-term exemption of defence investment from EU fiscal rules. European Council President António Costa, who convened the emergency summit, called for 'flexibility' in the application of the fiscal rules, but stopped short of backing the German proposal for a full revamp. 'We are putting our money where our mouth is,' Costa said. Hungary's 'isolation' is not 'division' On Ukraine, meanwhile, the 26 European leaders agreed to examine proposals by the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas for a significanly increased aid package to be sent to Ukraine this year – which had fallen off the draft text only days prior. Macron said that the EU is 'entering a phase of discussions' that means he will soon be 'ready to talk to President Putin... once we've agreed with both President Zelenskyy and our partners that the time is right.' Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who secured a minor victory with the late inclusion of language that 'welcomes all efforts' towards a 'comprehensive, just and lasting' peace, including those of Trump – ruled out deploying Italian troops to Ukraine in a peacekeeping force. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined the leaders for a working lunch, lauded a 'very productive day' in Brussels and confirmed he would travel to Saudi Arabia next week, where his team would attend talks with the United States. 'We are not alone - and we feel it,' he had told reporters on his arrival earlier on Thursday. Despite Hungary's opposition, there was general insistence that the EU's message of support for Kyiv was not weakened. Hungary had 'isolated itself', said Costa – which does not mean 'division'. 'Anytime you bring 27 countries around the table, everybody has their own nuance,' Thomas Byrne, Ireland's European minister, told reporters. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged her fellow leaders to 'conclude that it is really good that there are 26 countries in the EU that – with everything that is happening around us and with the challenges in Ukraine – stand firm in our support.' 'We can be proud of the old continent today,' she added.

Macron’s Offer: France And The Delusions Of Nuclear Deterrence – ...	The singular antics of US President Donald Trump, notably towards supposed allies, has stirred the pot regarding national security in various capitals. From Canberra to Brussels, there is concern that such assumed, if unverifiable notions as extended nuclear deterrence from Washington are valid anymore. America First interests certainly bring that into question, as well it should. If the imperium is in self-introspective retreat, this is to the good. But the internationalists beg to differ, wishing to see the United States as imperial guarantor. In Europe, the fear at the retreat of Washington’s nuclear umbrella, and the inflation of the Russian threat, has caused flutters of panic. On February 20, 2025, Friedrich Merz, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union and the incoming German chancellor, floated the idea that other states consider shouldering Europe’s security burden. 'We need to have discussions with both the British and the French – the two European nuclear powers – about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the UK and France, would apply to us.' Merz has also explicitly urged European states to accept the proposition that 'Donald Trump will no longer unconditionally honour NATO’s mutual defence commitment', making it incumbent on them to 'make every effort to at least be able to defend the European continent on its own.' On March 1, French President Emmanuel Macron showed signs of interest. In an interview with Portuguese TV RTP, he expressed willingness to 'to open this discussion … if it allows to build a European force.' There had 'always been a European dimension to France’s vital interests within its nuclear doctrine.' On March 5, in an address to the nation, Macron openly identified Russia as a 'threat to France and Europe'. Accordingly, he had decided 'to open the strategic debate on the protection of our allies on the European continent by our (nuclear) deterrent.' The future of Europe did not 'have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.' The matter of France’s European dimension has certainly been confirmed by remarks made by previous presidents, including Charles de Gaulle, who, in 1964, stated that an attack on a country such as Germany by the then Soviet Union would be seen as a threat to France. Domestically, Macron’s offer did not go down well in certain quarters. It certainly did not impress Marie Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. 'The French nuclear deterrent must remain a French nuclear deterrent,' she declared in comments made on a visit to the Farm Show in Paris. 'It must not be shared, let alone delegated.' This was a misunderstanding, came the response from Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The deterrent 'is French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.' A number of countries meeting at the European Union emergency security summit in Brussels showed interest in Macron’s offer, with some caution. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk suggested that 'we must seriously consider this proposal.' Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nausėda thought the idea 'very interesting' as 'a nuclear umbrella would serve as really very serious deterrence towards Russia.' Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa was not inclined to commit to a stationing of French nuclear weapons on Latvian territory: it was 'too soon' to raise the issue. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, on the other hand, found the debate 'premature', as 'our security is guaranteed by close cooperation with the United States'. He certainly has a point, given that the United States still, at present, maintains an extensive nuclear arsenal on European soil. The trouble with deterrence chatter is that it remains hostage to delusion. Strategists talk in extravagant terms about the genuine prospect that nuclear weapons can make any one state safer, leading to some calculus of tolerable use. Thus we find the following comment from Benoît Grémare of the Université Jean Moulin Lyon 3: '[T]he fact remains that without US support, the balance of power appears largely unfavourable to France, which has a total of 290 nuclear warheads compared to at least 1,600 deployed warheads and nearly 2,800 stockpiled warheads on the Russian side.' While Grémare acknowledges that France’s thermonuclear arsenal, along with the M51 strategic sea-to-land ballistic missile, would be able to eliminate major Russian cities, Russia would only need a mere '200 seconds too atomise Paris' if its Satan II thermonuclear weapons were used. 'This potential for reciprocity must be kept in mind amid the mutual bet of nuclear deterrence.' Logic here gives way to the presumption that such weapons, rather than suggesting impotence, promise formidable utility. This theoretical, and absurd proposition, renders the unthinkable possible: that Russia just might use nuclear weapons against European countries. Any such contention must fail for the fundamental point that nuclear weapons should, quite simply, never be used. Instead, they should be disbanded and banned altogether, in line with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Unfortunately, the French offer of replacing the US nuclear umbrella in Europe perpetrates similar deadly sins about deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpoDu3lKMwSE	2025-03-06T16:57:05-08:00	
Cambodia: World’s ‘Largest Online Black Market’ Loses Banking Lic...	By Jack Adamović Davies Huione Pay, the banking arm of what’s been called the world’s 'largest ever illicit online marketplace,' has been stripped of its banking license, the National Bank of Cambodia confirmed to RFA this week. The company is part of the wider Huione Group of Cambodia, a conglomerate which operates several 'Huione' products, including marketplaces, banking and finance apps. One of these, a Telegram marketplace, has been identified as a notorious place for crime tied to up to $24 billion in illicit transactions. Huione Pay’s license was withdrawn owing to its noncompliance with 'existing regulations and recommendations that may have been made by the regulators,' a National Bank of Cambodia spokesperson told RFA by email on Thursday. The spokesperson did not say when the license was withdrawn or what repercussions the company might face if they continue to operate. Huione did not respond to RFA’s requests for comment before publication. It has previously denied criminal activity– when Huione was identified by the cryptocurrency compliance firm Elliptic to have facilitated millions of dollars in criminal payments, it issued a statement insisting that it was a mere 'information publishing and guarantee trading platform' bearing no responsibility for the goods and services others used it to trade. However, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, Huione’s Telegram marketplace has become one of the main arteries of illicit commerce in Southeast Asia, a region grappling with an epidemic of human trafficking and internet fraud. The UNODC’s regional representative, Benedikt Hofmann, welcomed the termination of Huione Pay’s license. The withdrawal 'will send an important signal, especially given the high profile of Huione and its outsize role for the region’s criminal ecosystem,' he told RFA. Hofmann cautioned, however, that this latest development would not be a cure-all for the region’s crime epidemic – nor would it necessarily mean the end of Huione. 'Huione is in many ways the tip of the iceberg and we will see users shifting to other, similar providers which have emerged in the region,' he added. Much of the money that was being moved through Huione Pay came from illicit activities linked to cyberscamming, the UNODC found. For more than half a decade the region in which Huione operates has been dotted with compounds housing what the U.N. says are hundreds of thousands of enslaved workers forced to perpetrate a type of cyberscam commonly known as 'pig butchering'. The practice is estimated to swindle billions of dollars from its victims around the world every year. Elliptic, the cryptocurrency compliance firm, traced billions of dollars flowing from Huione Guarantee, the Telegram marketplace, to Huione Pay. This was 'likely so that these criminally-derived funds could be cashed out,' firm founder Tom Robinson told RFA. 'I think this will be a blow to Huione Guarantee,' Robinson added. 'We have direct evidence of Huione Pay laundering money from scam victims around the world, including the elderly and vulnerable. They are willing facilitators of pig butchering and other fraud, so any regulatory action against them should be welcomed.' The loss of Huione Pay’s license, which has not been previously reported, does not seem to have curtailed the company’s activities, however. As recently as Thursday the company’s official Telegram channel, linked to on its website, was offering loans to customers. A post on February 27th promoted the launch of a Huione-branded Visa card. Visa did not respond to requests for comment by press time. News of Huione Pay’s license being withdrawn was greeted as overdue by a former employee who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. They told RFA it was openly acknowledged within the company that there were two sets of accounts maintained. 'They cook the books,' the former employee said. While the company handled billions of dollars, 'close to none' of those transactions were made available to the compliance department, which was relegated to the role of advisors, ' whose advice were never taken seriously,' the former employee said. One of Huione Pay’s three directors is Hun To, a cousin of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet. Official censure of a company so close to the inner circle of Cambodia’s ruling family is unusual. But Jacob Sims, an expert on transnational crime, told RFA that the withdrawal of Huione’s banking license should not be read as a herald of reform. 'It all ultimately amounts to a brand switch,' Sims said. 'It’s basically an easy thing for the regime to point to and say, ‘Look, we’re cracking down on this’ without doing really anything but consolidating Huione’s available brands.' For Sims, there’s one way the Cambodian government could show it was serious about cracking down on the crime wave Huione has been surfing: 'Arrest all the people involved in Huione.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufv6XzDSqmF9W	2025-03-06T16:53:45-08:00	
US Envoy To Travel To Saudi Arabia For Talks With Ukrainians	A top Trump administration official said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with Ukrainian representatives for talks about a ceasefire to pause Russia’s invasion. 'We’re now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh, or even potentially Jeddah,' said Steve Witkoff, who serves as U.S. President Donald Trump’s special Middle East envoy. He added: 'The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well.' He said Trump felt Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made amends after the two leaders’ confrontation in the White House last Friday. 'He felt that Zelenskyy’s letter was a very positive first step. There was an apology. There was an acknowledgement that the United States has done so much for the country of Ukraine, and a sense of gratitude,' Witkoff said. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, was in Brussels with European leaders for emergency talks. 'We will arm ourselves faster, smarter and more efficiently than Russia,' said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who holds the European Union's rotating presidency. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advanced a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense, alongside commitments to encourage the 27 member countries to invest a total of about $863 billion in defense over the next four years. 'We are very thankful that we are not alone and these are not just words,' Zelenskyy said. 'We feel it. It’s very important.' French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of talks that EU members would 'take decisive steps forward,' while he expressed concerns about shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine under Trump. 'The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,' Macron said. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said Thursday that France is sharing intelligence with Ukraine, a move that followed the United States saying it was cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that the United States had, for the moment, ended sharing its intelligence with Kyiv, although the move could be short-lived after Zelenskyy said the exchanges with Trump in the Oval Office last week had been 'regrettable' and that Ukraine was ready for peace talks with Russia. Trump earlier in the week ordered the U.S. to suspend military aid to Kyiv’s fighters. Since the start of the war in 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces. Reaching a peace deal could prove difficult. Ukraine has long demanded a restoration of its internationally recognized 2014 borders before Moscow unilaterally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Overall, Russia now holds about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including much of eastern Ukraine, and has vowed to not return any of it to the Kyiv government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufl4NbGCTJmfg	2025-03-06T16:50:46-08:00	
Trump Bullish But America Divided – OpEd	By Dr. Amal Mudallali President Donald Trump declared on Tuesday that 'America is back' at the start of his first speech to a joint session of Congress in his second term. He proclaimed: 'America’s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back,' before adding that the American dream is 'unstoppable.' But a look at the headlines of the last few days shows a different America and a different world than the one the president boasted about. The country is split down the middle about his policies and that was visually obvious during the speech to Congress. The Department of Government Efficiency and its leader Elon Musk are under attack by Democrats and government employees who have lost their jobs. The opposition, Congress and the courts are battling the president in what some have dubbed a constitutional crisis over the president’s authority. The relationship between the US and its neighbors is tense due to the president’s tariffs against Canada and Mexico, while China is threatening a trade war. There are fears over the long-term damage being to America’s relations with its neighbors and to global trade. The relationship with America’s allies in Europe, America’s closest allies and NATO partners, is rife with tension over the war in Ukraine, how best to end it and how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In his speech, the president presented a different picture on all these issues and events on the ground show that his strategy is winning so far. The president invited Musk to his congressional speech and praised him for the accomplishments of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with overhauling the federal government. Musk and his team have been making drastic cuts to federal agencies, leading to job cuts, the elimination of agencies like the US Agency for International Development and funding freezes, fueling protests and an outcry by Democrats. Several of the federal employees who have lost their jobs were in the gallery as guests of the Democrats. The president said Musk is 'working very hard. He didn’t need this' and was not apologetic about the work of the department. While the president boasted about his success in securing the border, his tariff battle with America’s neighbors is capturing the headlines. The tariffs have caused a crisis in America’s relationship with Canada and Mexico and are threatening to upend global trade, while affecting the livelihoods of everyday Americans. Experts are warning that the tariffs could lead to greater inflation and affect the president’s domestic and economic agendas, while causing recessions in Canada and Mexico. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the crisis with the two neighbors may be resolved this week and Trump will 'probably' announce a deal that will reduce the tariffs, following lengthy phone calls between their representatives and the commerce secretary. The dispute between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies also seems on its way to being resolved. The president softened his tone after he received an 'important letter' and expression of regret by Zelensky over the Oval Office argument with the American president and Vice President J.D. Vance. The letter expressed Ukraine’s willingness to come 'to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,' President Trump said as he read from it. Trump also quoted the Ukrainian president assuring him that he was ready to sign the 'agreement on minerals and security.' The US president did not back down from his intention to 'reclaim' the Panama Canal or shy away from a new expansionist foreign policy. As proof that Trump’s strategy seems to be working, it emerged that a consortium of companies including American investment firm BlackRock was set to buy shares from the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings that would give it control of the ports at either end of the canal. This would give Trump, who raised the alarm about potential Chinese interference with shipping operations in the strategic canal, a victory. Greenland is also still in the sights of the American president. After telling Greenland, 'we strongly support your right to determine your own future,' he said: 'One way or the other, we’re going to get it,' citing its vitality to American and international security. But the response from Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede was categoric. 'We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,' he wrote after the speech. Trump did not say much about the Middle East, except to speak of the Abraham Accords that were agreed in his first term, which he described as 'one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations.' He said a 'lot of things are happening in the Middle East … a rough neighborhood, actually.' But his administration seems to have already rejected the plan for rebuilding Gaza that was approved by the Arab summit in Cairo this week. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told The Times of Israel that Trump 'stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas.' He added that the Arab plan 'does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.' But he kept the door open for more talks 'to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Does Trump’s agenda have the backing of the American people, whether domestically or on foreign policy? He spoke to a divided country. The Congress chamber looked like a split screen, with Republicans standing up and cheering and Democrats sitting down and protesting with signs like 'it’s a lie,' 'resist' and 'Musk steals.' But the Democrats seemed more like students protesting in the streets than a political party that has a strategy or a roadmap on how to oppose Trump’s agenda. The president said more Americans now believe that the country is going in the right direction. At least one poll supported this statement, with 47 percent of Americans believing this, up 10 points from December, as Newsweek reported. The Democrats are not seen as a credible opposition with a strategy, while the president is on a winning streak and he is 'just getting started,' as he said in his speech.

Pakistan’s Eroding Strategic Flexibility: The Heavy Price Of Its ...	Pakistan stands at a decisive juncture in its history. Once recognised as a regional power with immense potential, the nation now grapples with a troubling decline in strategic flexibility. This is largely attributed to short-sighted policies that have prioritised military strength over other national priorities. The consequences of these decisions are increasingly apparent, jeopardising Pakistan's political cohesion and economic development. A unified, resilient political landscape is essential for enhancing Pakistan's strategic flexibility. However, the military's outsized influence over civilian governance has fragmented the political system, hindering the establishment of robust democratic institutions. Political parties struggle to formulate stable, long-term strategies amidst this environment. In recent years, Pakistan has faced numerous political crises, many escalating into violent confrontations, widespread protests, and growing distrust between the state and its citizens. While some political tension is inevitable in any democracy, Pakistan's habitual reliance on coercive measures to resolve disputes has perpetuated a damaging cycle. Historically, the state has employed force - through military interventions, police actions, and other coercive means - to manage political crises. Such actions frequently exacerbate the very issues they aim to resolve, leading to heightened polarisation, public unrest, and enduring instability. Although force may provide temporary suppression of dissent or a veneer of order, it fails to address the root causes of political conflict and often widens the divide between the government and the people. Pakistan finds itself trapped in a damaging cycle, political repression stifles progress and fuels instability, undermining economic recovery. The military's overwhelming influence over civilian leadership has created an environment that frequently suppresses dissent, restricting the free exchange of ideas and stifling democratic growth. This political repression, ostensibly aimed at preserving control, has ultimately resulted in greater harm by cultivating instability that obstructs Pakistan's development across multiple fronts. This predicament generates a paradox - while Pakistan projects military strength globally, its internal cohesion remains fragile. Ongoing military interference has prevented civilian leaders from adequately addressing critical internal challenges like poverty, corruption, and unemployment, all of which are essential for national stability. Consequently, these unresolved issues undermine Pakistan's ability to formulate flexible, pragmatic policies that can adapt to evolving global dynamics. The consequences of political repression extend far beyond the economic sphere, profoundly impacting the daily lives of average Pakistanis in ways often overlooked by those in power. Economic hardships like rising unemployment and inflation disproportionately burden the poor and marginalised, who must endure a political system that fails to prioritise their welfare. The lack of political cohesion and accountability contributes to the neglect or underfunding of vital public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This perpetuates a cycle of inequality where the struggling become increasingly disenfranchised, depriving future generations of opportunities for upward mobility. The prospects of the Pakistani populace are, in many ways, compromised by a ruling elite that prioritises control over genuine progress. To break free from Pakistan's detrimental political cycle, the country must undertake comprehensive reforms that prioritise democratic values, political inclusivity, and expanded freedoms. The political landscape requires decentralisation, allowing for the inclusion of a wider array of voices and ideologies. Such an approach would not only enhance political cohesion but also promote national unity. This transformative process should begin by empowering civilian institutions and ensuring the military's role remains strictly within constitutional boundaries, enabling elected leaders to guide the nation's future. Political reform would further contribute to increased transparency and accountability - critical components for restoring public trust in the system. Without a strong political framework that holds leaders accountable, Pakistan's future trajectory will remain uncertain. For citizens to actively engage in the political system's development, they must have faith in its integrity. The time has come for Pakistan to move away from relying on coercive measures as the primary response to challenges. By cultivating a culture of dialogue and negotiation, the country can lay the groundwork for a more inclusive, peaceful, and stable future. This does not imply abandoning the state's obligation to maintain law and order, but rather a reconsideration of conflict resolution strategies, favoring peaceful solutions over violent or coercive actions. Both the state and citizens have essential roles to play in supporting this new social contract emphasising dialogue and peaceful conflict resolution. Pakistan possesses the capability to reclaim its strategic flexibility and influence, but it must first recognise that genuine security and sustainable growth stem from comprehensive solutions, not solely military strength. By reevaluating its policies and developing a more integrated national strategy, Pakistan can forge a path toward a future characterised by resilience, cooperation, and innovation in addressing both internal and external challenges. The urgency for action is paramount. This article was published at The Friday Times	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufp8pADN3HjuL	2025-03-06T16:40:37-08:00	
UN Experts Condemn Israeli Move To Reopen ‘Gates Of Hell’ And Uni...	By Ephrem Kossaify More than 20 UN independent human rights experts have denounced the decision by the Israeli government to block all humanitarian aid to Gaza and resume a total siege of the territory. They warned that this breaks the terms of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, breaks international law and puts the prospects for peace in jeopardy. In a joint statement on Thursday, the experts condemned Israel’s decision on Sunday to suspend deliveries of all goods to Gaza, including critical, life-saving aid. It follows an announcement by the Israeli war Cabinet that it was prepared to withdraw from the ceasefire agreement, with some ministers openly calling for reopening the 'gates of hell' in the war-battered enclave. 'This action constitutes a gross violation of international law,' the experts said. 'As an occupying power, Israel is legally obligated to ensure the provision of sufficient food, medical supplies, and other forms of aid. 'By blocking such essential services, including those vital to sexual and reproductive health and disability support, Israel is weaponizing humanitarian assistance.' Such actions represent 'serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law,' they added, and might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute. The independent experts who put their names to the statement included Francesca Albanese, the special rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Michael Fakhri, the special rapporteur on the right to food. Special rapporteurs are part of what is known as the special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. They are independent experts who work on a voluntary basis, are not members of UN staff and are not paid for their work. They also criticized Israel’s general approach to the ceasefire agreement, which initially was hailed as a pathway to peace. Instead of fostering a cessation of hostilities, however, the agreement has been marked by continued violence and destruction. At least 100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since it took effect on Jan. 19. The total death toll in the territory since the war began in October 2023 now stands at 48,400, as Israeli forces persist with airstrikes and ground assaults. 'The harsh conditions of the ceasefire, marked by limited aid and scarce resources, have only exacerbated the suffering of Gaza’s population,' the experts wrote. 'The decision to reimpose a total siege on Gaza — where 80 percent of farmland and civilian infrastructure has already been destroyed — will undoubtedly worsen the humanitarian crisis.' While some states and regional organizations have attempted to justify Israel’s actions as a response to alleged ceasefire violations by Hamas, the experts noted that repeated violations of the agreement by Israel have largely gone unreported. They called for the mediators of the ceasefire deal, Egypt, Qatar and the US, to intervene to help preserve the agreement in accordance with international obligations. They also stressed that Israel’s actions should be viewed within the context of the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, a situation the International Court of Justice has demanded came an end. The experts concluded by issuing a strong call for global action: 'Nations must recall their obligations under international law and act to halt this brutal assault on the Palestinian people. The international community cannot allow lawlessness and injustice to prevail.' As the world watches the devastating effects of the latest Israeli decision, the experts warned that fragile hopes for peace in the region continue to fade, and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza is far from over. The initial phase of the ceasefire expired on Sunday without Israel and Hamas reaching an agreement on an extension or a way forward for the deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpPXNBU0l5ht	2025-03-06T16:33:16-08:00	
The Fractured Shield: Can Europe Secure Itself If America Walks A...	The battlefields of Ukraine are not just testing Kyiv’s resilience; they are exposing the fragility of the Western security order. For decades, Europe has outsourced its defense to American power, relying on Washington’s nuclear umbrella, intelligence networks, and military supremacy. But what happens when that umbrella folds? A Future Without Washington’s Security Guarantee In Washington, where political tides shift with electoral cycles, murmurs of disengagement are growing louder. A second Trump presidency could usher in an era of isolationism that European leaders have long feared. Proposals to withdraw from the United Nations, freeze military aid to Ukraine, or even exit NATO are no longer speculative—each has been openly debated in America’s political mainstream. The implications are stark. If the United States retracts its security commitments, can Europe hold the line against an emboldened Russia? Can NATO survive as a European-led entity? And most urgently, should Ukraine brace for a Western-brokered 'peace' that cements Russian territorial gains while locking Kyiv into economic dependence on its allies? The Numbers Don’t Lie: Can Europe Defend Ukraine Alone? The cold calculus of war tells a sobering story. The United States has delivered over '$75 billion' in military assistance to Ukraine since 2022—more than double what all European nations combined have provided. The Pentagon alone has supplied 'over 2,000 armoured vehicles, 300,000 rounds of artillery, and advanced missile systems' that have kept Ukrainian defences operational. By contrast, Europe, despite its vocal solidarity, has struggled to match America’s firepower. The European Union’s much-vaunted '€50 billion aid package' pales in comparison to Washington’s largesse. Germany’s pledge to boost its military spending to '2% of GDP' remains unfulfilled, and even France—long an advocate for European 'strategic autonomy'—lacks the industrial capacity to replace American weapons in the short term. The UK, despite being one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers, faces significant constraints in its defense production capabilities. The question is not whether Europe wants to support Ukraine—it is whether it 'can'. And right now, the numbers suggest it 'cannot'. The Fragile Chessboard: A War or a Truce on America’s Terms? The military aid dilemma is just one part of a broader geopolitical shift. Behind closed doors, the Biden administration is already exploring the contours of a potential peace deal—one that may not align with Ukraine’s ambitions. At the heart of the negotiations is an unspoken trade-off: Ukraine’s war effort is bleeding Western arms stockpiles dry, but Kyiv also possesses a wealth of 'rare earth minerals' critical to American and European industries. Ukraine holds some of the largest untapped reserves of 'lithium, titanium, and nickel'—all essential for military hardware and clean energy technology. A potential deal would see Kyiv securing long-term American economic support in exchange for prioritizing U.S. and European access to these critical resources. But at what cost? A settlement could pressure Ukraine into territorial concessions, effectively rewarding Russia’s aggression while transforming Ukraine into a resource colony for the West. If Ukraine refuses, the alternative is equally stark: fighting a war without the assurance of continuous Western aid. Can NATO Survive an American Exit? The biggest strategic question looming over Europe is whether NATO can endure without U.S. leadership. Washington currently accounts for nearly '70% of NATO’s defense spending', and its military bases in Germany, Poland, and the Baltics serve as deterrents against Russian expansionism. If an American withdrawal from NATO materializes, European nations will need to rapidly build a credible defense infrastructure—a task that will require at least '€500 billion in immediate military investments' just to replace U.S. capabilities. European unity, however, is fragile. 'Macron’s vision of an independent European defense force' clashes with Poland’s insistence on a 'U.S.-centric security structure'. The cracks within the EU’s security apparatus could widen under the pressure of war. Meanwhile, the UK's post-Brexit security strategy remains in flux. While London has remained a reliable partner to Kyiv, its long-term commitment to European defense in the absence of American leadership remains uncertain. Can the UK, alongside France and Germany, lead a reconfigured NATO without Washington’s firepower? For Ukraine, this means one thing: 'Time is running out'. The New World Order: A Future Without Washington’s Hegemony If America disengages, the ramifications extend far beyond Europe. A retreat from Ukraine would embolden China to accelerate its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, raising the likelihood of a 'Taiwan confrontation'. Meanwhile, Moscow, sensing Western vulnerability, could set its sights on 'Moldova or the Baltics'—testing NATO’s willingness to defend its smallest members. A weakened NATO could also shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where 'Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia' are vying for regional dominance. Without American leadership, Europe would struggle to navigate the diplomatic fallout from a reconfigured global order in which 'Beijing and Moscow dictate the terms of engagement'. In an increasingly multipolar world, European leaders must ask themselves: Is it time to break free from America’s security apparatus and chart an 'independent defense strategy'? Or will the West’s failure to secure Ukraine mark the 'unravelling of the post-World War II order'? The Economic Fallout: What a Disengaged America Means for Markets Beyond security concerns, the economic ramifications of a U.S. pullback from global leadership would be profound. A fractured transatlantic alliance would 'undermine investor confidence', drive 'capital flight from European markets', and create supply chain disruptions—particularly in the energy and defense sectors. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England would need to 'reassess financial stability measures' in anticipation of geopolitical turbulence. Meanwhile, China and Russia could use the opportunity to expand their influence over 'emerging markets, energy networks, and digital infrastructure', further challenging Western economic supremacy. A U.S. retreat from NATO would also raise questions about the future of the 'petrodollar system', as Gulf states reconsider their reliance on American security guarantees. If Saudi Arabia and the UAE shift towards a 'multipolar trade strategy', it could significantly impact global commodity markets, driving 'higher inflation and currency volatility'. The Defining Crossroads The war in Ukraine has transcended the realm of a single nation's struggle for sovereignty; it has become a litmus test for the resilience of the transatlantic alliance—an order painstakingly constructed from the wreckage of the last great conflict. The fractures of the present war now threaten to unmake the very foundations of Western security. Should Washington waver in its commitments, Europe must brace for the fallout. The question is not merely one of willingness, but of capability. Is the continent prepared to shoulder the burden of its own defense in the face of an emboldened Russia? The answer remains deeply uncertain. A fundamental truth looms large: Europe’s security is inextricably tied to Ukraine’s fate. And Ukraine’s survival hinges on America’s resolve. The decision, however, is not Europe’s to make. It rests in Washington’s hands. **And the world waits, watching.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufmJsIeHWW_qR	2025-03-06T16:30:12-08:00	
Supreme Court Case For First Catholic Charter School Begins Oral ...	By Kate Quiñones A Catholic charter school is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to approve the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school in a case that could reshape school choice and religious freedom in the U.S. In an opening brief filed on Wednesday, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School — a Catholic charter school managed by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa and Eastern Oklahoma — maintained that it is religious discrimination for the state to withhold generally available funding solely because the school is religious. The Oklahoma Supreme Court previously ordered Oklahoma’s charter school board to rescind the contract with St. Isidore in June, citing the First Amendment’s prohibition of laws that would establish a state religion. Shortly after, both St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board filed separate petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2024. In the opening briefs, St. Isidore and the school board maintained that if the state is going to offer general funding for private charter organizations, it cannot deny that funding to a charter school on the basis of religion. 'The First Amendment protects St. Isidore from discriminatory state laws that would bar it from participating in that program or receiving funding solely because the school it has designed is religious,' read the brief filed by the Notre Dame Law School’s Lindsay and Matt Moroun Religious Liberty Clinic, a teaching law practice that trains Notre Dame law students. The attorneys pointed out that Oklahoma designed the program 'to foster educational diversity through privately designed and operated charter schools … but Oklahoma denies that opportunity to religious entities solely because they are religious.' In a similar vein, the charter school board argued on Wednesday that the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision was a 'distortion of the First Amendment' that 'would have devastating effects on religious organizations,' according to the opening brief filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit that defends First Amendment rights. 'Faith-based groups often provide vital public services in which they partner with the government or are subject to government regulation,' the brief read. 'Yet under the decision below, many of these organizations would be deemed state actors disqualified from providing broad-ranging social services — including foster care, adoption services, medical care, homeless shelters, and other aid to disadvantaged communities.' Isidore was initially approved to be a charter school by the state board in 2023, but Oklahoma’s Republican Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a lawsuit against the board, arguing the establishment violated the state’s religious liberty protections. Drummond opposed the charter school’s petitions to the Supreme Court last year, maintaining that having a Catholic charter school is a 'clear-cut First Amendment violation,' according to a Dec. 9 press release. Nicole Stelle Garnett, John P. Murphy Foundation professor of law at Notre Dame, said St. Isidore is asking the Supreme Court to uphold its 'basic right against religious discrimination.' 'States routinely partner with faith-based organizations to serve the public — whether by providing education, shelter, food, health care, you name it,' Garnett said. 'The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the government may not offer support to private groups like these and then deny that opportunity to organizations based on their religion.' Oklahoma ranked 49th in education in the U.S. in 2024, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, with 84% of its eighth graders testing 'not proficient' in math and 76% of its fourth graders 'not proficient' in reading. Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and chairman of St. Isidore's Board, noted that the archdiocese wanted to improve educational access for Oklahomans. 'Too many children in Oklahoma — particularly in remote and rural communities — don’t have robust learning opportunities or access to schools that may serve their children’s individual needs,' Scaperlanda said in a March 6 statement. 'We want to help fill that gap by offering an excellent, Catholic education to all interested families across the state, regardless of their zip code, their income, or any other circumstance.' 'All children deserve to thrive in an environment that fits them, and we hope to help make that a reality,' Scaperlanda added. There are more than 30 privately operated charter schools in Oklahoma. John Meiser, director of Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Clinic, lauded Oklahoma’s endeavor to 'foster educational pluralism' and 'create a diversity of learning options for all children' but noted that this must be open to all. 'That is a great endeavor. But bedrock constitutional law is clear: Oklahoma cannot invite any and all educators to participate in it except those who happen to be religious,' Meiser said. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on April 30, with a decision expected this summer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JuftsYplBO5J-7	2025-03-06T16:23:47-08:00	
Thaksin’s Apology For Southern Thai Massacre Could Boost Peace Ta...	By Mariyam Ahmad and Nontarat Phaicharoen Former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra’s recent apology about a 2004 massacre that took place under his watch and his new role as adviser to ASEAN chair Malaysia could potentially influence peace talks in Thailand’s southern border provinces, security analysts said. Peace negotiations between Bangkok and Malay Muslim separatist rebels have shown no signs of resuming in the more than six months since Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, became Thailand’s prime minister. Meanwhile, the post of chief Thai peace negotiator has been left vacant for months, amid sporadic insurgency-related violence in the Thai Deep South. Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in August 2023 after years of self-imposed exile and later received a royal pardon, visited the southern border region on Feb. 23 as the new adviser to Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, the 2025 chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. During his visit Thaksin apologized for incidents that occurred under his administration. He was responding to a question about the Tak Bai massacre, one of the most infamous incidents in the long-running insurgency. The former prime minister said he had good intentions and cared for everyone before a military coup forced him from office in 2006. 'But mistakes can happen in governance. If I made any mistakes that were unsatisfactory, I apologize so that we can turn back and solve problems together. I don’t want small misunderstandings to remain,' he said, without specifically mentioning the massacre. The incident occurred on Oct. 25, 2004, when security forces violently dispersed protesters from in front of the police station in Tak Bai, a district of Narathiwat province. Eighty-five people were killed. Most of the victims gagged to death in the backs of military trucks, where they were bound and stacked up like logs. The 20-year statute of limitations passed last year without any charges being filed. Phumtham Wechayachai, Thailand’s deputy prime minister and defense minister, praised Thaksin’s visit, calling it a sign that progress should be visible this year. 'I think we will have a better direction and next year we will find a way to end this. As the person responsible for the southern region, we should be able to find a solution,' Phumtham told reporters on Feb. 27. 'I confirm that the dialogue process still exists, but I cannot specify the plans in the immediate future. I would like this Ramadan month to prove that there must be no incidents and violence must stop,' said Phumtham, who serves as deputy prime minister under Prime Minister Paetongtarn. Since MPs elected Paetongtarn as PM to succeed Srettha Thavisin in August 2024, little has been done to foster peace in the border region – which she visited in January – while no formal talks have been held, analysts and activists noted. Among those is Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, director of the Cross Cultural Foundation. 'Even though it’s a democratic government, in practice it doesn’t play a role in controlling security agencies. Doing nothing is like neglecting duty, such as not appointing a head of the peace dialogue panel,' she told BenarNews. 'Meanwhile, the violence has increased significantly. Since the statute of limitations expired for the Tak Bai case, expectations have risen, but when they do nothing, it’s like neglecting an important duty.' Another analyst said Thaksin’s apology was needed. 'Thaksin has previously made statements like this, but this time it could be considered the clearest and most official,' Panitan Wattanayagorn, a security analyst and former chairman of the government’s security advisory committee, told BenarNews. 'Apologizing is better than saying nothing at all, because significant events related to the southern border situation occurred while he was prime minister. Not saying anything might be more damaging,' he said. The year 2004 was the one during which the insurgency reignited. The Deep South, made up of provinces and districts that lie along Thailand’s border with Malaysia, is where members of the predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim population have long pressed for greater autonomy. The Deep South Watch monitoring center reported over 22,000 violent incidents occurred between 2004 and 2024, resulting in over 7,500 deaths and 14,000 injuries. Between 2005 and 2024, the Thai government has spent about 500 billion baht (U.S. $14.7 billion) addressing southern border problems. Peace talks began in 2013 but have frequently stalled because of government changes. Important vacancy unfilled Going forward, the Paetongtarn administration needs to improve the National Security Council (NSC) role in peace talks, Panitan said. Chatchai Bangchuad, had served as lead negotiator in Deep South peace talks with Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) rebel leaders but his promotion to NSC security council chief last October means the lead negotiator position is open. 'The government must urgently enhance the NSC’s capabilities, as they have been inadequate so far. They might begin by adding both domestic and international advisers to formulate a winning strategy,' he said. 'The dialogue can be postponed, but it’s necessary to exchange new information, control the situation in the area and successfully bring people to the table.' Meanwhile, some analysts and human rights advocates said Thaksin’s apology lacked sufficient weight given the severity of past incidents. 'It seemed like he was saying that officers might make mistakes. He may have wanted to be cautious about being blamed for past problems, but he apologized only for minor frictions,' Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, told BenarNews. 'In reality, the feelings of people in the area regarding the Krue Se and Tak Bai incidents, where many people died with high levels of violence, at minimum Thaksin should take responsibility for this part and express it with stronger words,' he said. Analysts said Anwar’s appointment of Thaksin could potentially assist Malaysia’s involvement in addressing the southern conflict, particularly given Kuala Lumpur’s role as facilitator of peace talks between the Thai government and BRN. 'The appointment of Thaksin as adviser to the ASEAN chair might help bring Brunei and Indonesia into participating in the peace process,' Panitan, the analyst, said. 'However, cooperation between the government and opposition on this issue should also exist.' In addition, Srisompob said, Thaksin could have some power. 'After this, Thaksin might use his special relationship with Anwar to solve problems through back channels, addressing issues that can’t be resolved through open processes.' Anwar, meanwhile, told Malaysian PMs last week that Thaksin’s appointment could buoy efforts to resolve the conflict in Thailand’s southern border region. 'It helps even though there were some controversies being raised. He recently went to southern Thailand to apologize for the Tak Bai incident and gave assurance that he will cooperate with Malaysia to find peace,' Anwar said. Jon Preechawong in Bangkok and Farhana Farush in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nrdgM6TlnK19	2025-03-04T17:08:19-08:00	
Rising Arctic Temperatures Threaten Russian Cities And Military F...	Temperatures in the Russian North are rising three times as fast as in other parts of the country, a development with enormous but as of yet not fully appreciated geoeconomic and geopolitical consequences. These changes are increasing the ability of other countries to transit the Northern Sea Route (NSR) without relying on Russian icebreakers. Critically, rising temperatures are thawing the permafrost underlying the whole region, in turn undermining and destroying the integrity of local infrastructure, including pipelines and airfields. Rising temperatures are also further isolating population centers and military bases, making it far more difficult for Moscow to exploit natural resources and sustain Russian dominance of the NSR and the country’s claims in the Arctic (see EDM, November 15, 2022, February 22, 2023; The Barents Observer, May 18, 2022; To Be Precise, September 22, 2023; TASS; RIA Novosti, September 11, 2024; The Moscow Times, September 12, 2024). While Moscow celebrates what it has achieved—and often even what it has not—the situation in the North is a quickly escalating problem for the Russian government (Window on Eurasia, January 10). Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has forced Moscow to cut back and even cancel plans to build railways and highways in the Russian North (see EDM, February 22, 2023). At present, the region severely lacks sufficient road and rail infrastructure. Communities living in the North have instead traditionally relied on 'ice roads,' which are formed when rivers freeze, for delivery of supplies and to transport ores of various kinds. Ice roads, however, can no longer be relied on because the surface of many waterways is not remaining frozen long enough or becoming thick enough to carry heavy trucks (see EDM, March 12, 2024; Nakanune, January 28, February 20; The Barents Observer, February 25). This issue is exacerbated by what some scholars are now calling the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic. This refers to the influx of warm water from the Atlantic Ocean into the Arctic Ocean, which is itself caused by the increasing amount of sea ice melting in the Arctic from Scandinavia to the Bering Strait (Igor V. Polyakov et al., 'Atlantification advances into the Amerasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean,' Science Advances. Vol 11, No. 8 (2025); The Barents Observer, February 25). This trend affects not only the ocean and global weather patterns but also the life of population centers and military bases in northern Russia’s littoral regions. In a growing number of places in the region, the only reliable means of transport is by air. This, however, is a serious limiting factor given the carrying capacity of planes, closing of airports in the region, and inadequate roads and rail lines connecting to them. As Sergey Sulyma, a Russia historian who specializes in transportation issues, points out, Russian officials like to brag that jet planes have reduced the time it takes to get from Moscow to Chukotka, located in the extreme northeast of the Russian Federation, to only eight hours (REX Information Agency, February 10). This claim omits the fact that it takes days or even weeks for passengers and cargo to travel to and from the airport in Chukotka because of the absence of year-round roads (REX Information Agency, February 10). These delays mean that the region is not reliably supplied with goods, which has unsurprisingly led to a slow but steady emigration out of Chukotka (see EDM, July 6, 2021; Nakanune, January 28, February 20). This trend, broadly mirrored across the Russian North, makes it almost impossible to maintain the development of natural resources, the maintenance of NSR-related search and rescue institutions or guidance facilities, or the support of military facilities Moscow needs to project power further into the Arctic. Insufficient highways and rail lines represent only one example of the failure of the Russian government to support regional infrastructure in the North. Another problem involves pipelines. The shifting ground with the melting of permafrost has caused pipelines to fail, spilling their contents and even leading to their abandonment on occasion, as continuous repairs are too expensive. This means oil and gas recovered in the Russian North often does not reach the central areas of Russia where they can be used or exported. In turn, population centers and military bases in the Russian North do not receive a steady supply of the petroleum products they need. Russian officials have long been worried by this fact and in 2017 prepared a 900-page report detailing just how dire the situation had become (Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment of the Russian Federation via Web Archive, 2018; The Barents Observer, October 2, 2018; Window on Eurasia, October 2, 2018). There is no reason to think that the situation has improved since then, and every reason to believe that it has gotten worse as the topic appears to have become politically sensitive in Moscow. The impact of global warming on the Arctic Ocean and Russian littoral is especially great with regard to Russian military facilities in the region. Putin has an expansive plan to develop the Arctic seabed and has made claims to portions of the Arctic that are contested by other Arctic states. These claims remain under consideration at the United Nations vis-a-vis its Law of the Sea-mandated process (Window on Eurasia, August 25, 2022, December 27, 2023). Putin’s efforts to develop Russia’s military bases in the North in accordance with his Arctic aspirations have been largely constrained. This is due to the high costs and difficulties of transporting supplies to such facilities, on top of the problems which Russia is experiencing in shipbuilding for its Arctic Fleet (Window on Eurasia, January 19, 2022). Moscow has, as a result, cut back and sought cheaper means of projecting power by building low-cost drone bases and potentially exploring options to purchase ships from elsewhere (see EDM, July 6, 2021, April 18, 2024; , October 15, 2023, October 26, 2024). As Russia’s Arctic territory continues to warm, the combination of its impact on the ocean and the littoral will only intensify. With less ice on the Arctic Ocean, more ships from other countries will likely make use of the NSR or regions adjoining it, creating a situation in which Moscow will feel even more threatened and prepare to be in a position to respond militarily (Window on Eurasia, August 6, 2024). With higher temperatures on land in the Russian Far North, however, Moscow will find it increasingly difficult to implement such a policy, given the unlikelihood of having either the necessary population or military bases in the region. Moscow will thus likely be inclined to adopt a more aggressive approach to any new international presence in the region, potentially by employing forces further from the Arctic itself (see EDM, May 30, 2024). Such a shift in Russian strategy and tactics will require corresponding shifts by others as the Arctic heats up—both literally and figuratively.

Pakistan’s Path Forward Requires More Than Economic Recovery – An...	By Saima Nawaz Pakistan’s 2024 witnessed economic uncertainties, political instability, social unrest and the resurgence of terrorism, marking a grim period. These challenges were not isolated incidents, but manifestations of a broader systemic failure that has persisted for decades. The inability to address these issues comprehensively has left the country in a state of crisis, demanding a transformational change in governance and planning. The February 2024 election was one of the most rigid and contested elections in Pakistan’s history, resulting in a fragile coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League with the support of the Pakistan People’s Party. The election deepened polarisation and raised questions about the legitimacy of key institutions such as the election commission, the judiciary and the central authority. 2024 saw a significant increase in terrorist activities along the border, especially with Afghanistan, exacerbating national security concerns. Pakistan’s abysmally low ranking in political stability deterred investment, hampered governance and undermined the long-term prospects of the nation. But the completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and the signing of a new US$7 billion Extended Fund Facility for three years provided much-needed economic support. Additional support through rollovers of deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates stabilised the external account. These developments were accompanied by significant macroeconomic improvements. The policy rate fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, inflation dropped from 29.7 per cent in December 2023 to 4.1 per cent by December 2024 and remittances surged by 32.8 per cent. This helped the current account post a provisional US$1.2 billion surplus for the second half of 2025. The stock market reflected renewed confidence, with unprecedented gains signalling optimism among investors. Despite macroeconomic stabilisation, GDP growth in July–September 2024 was 0.9 per cent, driven primarily by agriculture. The industrial sector — which holds the key to export-driven growth — continued to struggle with negative growth, a worrying sign for a country striving to build export surpluses. Pakistan will hardly manage 3 per cent GDP growth in 2025. Rising poverty and persistent unemployment further compounded the socioeconomic challenges. Pakistan’s tax base remained critically narrow and fiscal deficits are raising concerns about debt sustainability. Public debt-to-GDP ratios remained high, with increasing reliance on external borrowing to meet fiscal obligations. Despite efforts to improve investor confidence, actual foreign direct investment inflows in 2024 fell short of projections. The Federal Board of Revenue also failed to meet its tax collection targets despite imposing heavy taxes. Pakistan continues to lag in adopting modern technology-driven economic solutions. Internet access remained slow and inconsistent, hindering e-business and innovation, while public sector inefficiencies continued to plague governance. As 2025 begins, Pakistan faces a critical juncture. Pakistan launched the Uraan Pakistan five-year plan to redefine the country’s economic trajectory, but its success hinges on a fundamental shift in how challenges are addressed. The Vision 2025 and Vision 2047 initiatives had been presented with similar ambitions but lacked effective government assessment and follow-up. Uraan Pakistan is following the same pattern, not incorporating lessons from past failures, risking the repetition of unfulfilled promises rather than ensuring implementation. Pakistan needs a new direction — a systems-based framework that addresses the interconnectedness of its challenges and charts a path towards sustainable progress. A systems-based model views Pakistan’s challenges as interconnected elements of a larger ecosystem. Each stakeholder — the parliament, the establishment, the judiciary, the media, civil society, academia and the public — represents a critical node in this system. Any dysfunction in one node inevitably disrupts the entire system, as was evident in 2024. Parliament’s inability to legislate effectively created policy gridlock, while judicial overreach undermined executive authority. Media sensationalism fuelled social unrest and bureaucratic inefficiency stalled reforms. Economic transformation must be predicated upon systemic reform. Pakistan needs to transition from a fragmented and crisis-driven model to an integrated ecosystem that prioritises innovation, inclusivity and sustainability. Regulatory simplification is essential to make it easier for businesses to operate, while the tax base must be broadened to reduce fiscal deficits and directed towards digital infrastructure and human capital development. Industrial revitalisation is critical — targeted incentives and technological improvements can drive export-led growth and integrate Pakistan into global value chains. The Uraan plan must be recalibrated to reflect these priorities. Digital transformation should be at the forefront, with investments in high-speed internet and digital infrastructure that enable e-commerce and innovation. Education reforms are equally vital and research and development should be incentivised to foster innovation. Political stability is the linchpin of systemic reform. A national dialogue involving all political parties and civil society is essential to build consensus on critical reforms. Transparent electoral processes are needed, and governance must focus on long-term objectives that transcend party lines. Transparency and accountability must begin at the top, with the prime minister and cabinet leading by example. 2025 must not be another year of inertia. It must be the year Pakistan breaks free from the cycles of crisis that have defined its past. This is not an easy path, but it is the only path forward. The systemic approach is not just about solving problems — it is about creating a framework where problems are less likely to arise in the first place. It is about shifting from reactive governance to proactive, integrated planning.

Regional Dynamics: The Evolving Iran-Armenia Relationship Amid Ge...	Introduction In today's rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, Armenia and Iran are seeking to strengthen their connections regarding economic, political, and security matters. And despite the United States signing a Strategic Partnership Charter with Armenia in January to enhance cooperation in energy, defense, security, and diplomacy, Tehran asserts that U.S.-Armenia relations will not impact its relationship with Armenia. Iran is in a significantly different position today compared to just a few months ago. Following the collapse of the Assad regime last December and the uncertainty surrounding its proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, Iran may need to realign its regional priorities. Historically Iran and Armenia have had a very healthy and cordial relationship. Iran and Armenia’s relationship can be seen as a mutually beneficial economic collaboration built around investments, trade agreements, and infrastructure projects. Iran today remains Armenia’s third largest trading partner, and an estimated 30% of Armenia’s international trade runs through Iran. During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, Iran tried to broker a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, hoping to establish itself as a regional negotiator. Now with Iran’s future in the Middle East appearing more uncertain, it may begin to play a greater role with its neighbor to the north. One area where Iran might increase its focus is the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed transport route running through southern Armenia designed to connect Azerbaijan with its exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Here, Armenia and Iran have found common ground in their opposition to Azerbaijan’s proposed corridor. At the same time, recent diplomatic meetings between Iran and Armenia, signalling each other’s willingness to work across a multitude of issues, coupled with Iran’s increased economic activity with the Eurasian region, indicate a potential pivot towards deeper cooperation that could reshape the region. A Brief History Armenia and Iran share a rich history spanning over 2,500 years. We can find the first mention of the word 'Armenia' from the Persian king Darius during the 4th century BC. Up until the early 19th century, Yerevan was part of the Qajari (Persian)Empire. In Yerevan, the Blue Mosque, the residence of the viceroy of the Shah is preserved to this day as a religious and cultural center. In the 1990s the Armenian government renovated the Blue Mosque for services for Armenia’s Iranian Muslim community. In Iran, there remains a strong Armenian diaspora of around 60-80,000 people, while the Armenian Apostolic Church operates its three dioceses in Atrpatrkan, Tehran, and Isfahan. Since the beginning of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1992, Iran and Armenia have strived to maintain a strong relationship. The two countries have shown a strong history of working together on issues surrounding energy, transport, environmental protection, inter-regional, scientist-education, and cultural spheres. February Meetings On Saturday, February 22, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) Mohammad Ali Dehaqan Devi met with Armenian Deputy Economy Minister EdgarZakaryan and Armenia’s Ambassador Grigor Hovhannisyanin Tehran. They emphasized Iran and Armenia's strong relationship while highlighting the need to increase trade relationships between the two countries. Iranian officials stressed their country’s interest in strengthening trade relations with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEA). Zakaryan highlighted the significant potential for economic collaboration between the two neighboring countries, stressing the importance of this in achieving their trading objectives, saying 'Armenia is prepared to collaborate with Iran across various sectors to strengthen mutual trade relations,'. Just two days later on February 24 Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and Armenian Foreign Minister Arat Mirzyoan were present in Geneva to attend a high-level meeting of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Disarmament Conference. While in Geneva, they held a bilateral meeting to discuss relations between their two countries. Here they reaffirmed their desire to strengthen bilateral ties concerning trade and economic growth. Araghchi emphasized the need to protect state sovereignty in the South Caucus region and for continued cooperation and coordination in security and stability. Mirzoyan, on his side, emphasized Armenia's commitment to strengthening ties with Iran across various sectors, including economic, trade, cultural, and transportation areas. Araghchi reaffirmed Tehran’s readiness to support peace efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 'We strive for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan and are ready to support this process. EAEU On February 28 Mehr News Agency, a semi-official news agency of the government of Iran, reported that the Iranian parliament has approved the agreement to create a free trade zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This comes just two months after Iran was granted observer status in the EAEU. Iranian Minister of Industry, Mines, and Trade, Mohammed Atabk said, 'The free trade agreement with Eurasia allows us to export 87% of our goods to the Eurasian Economic Union member states at zero tariffs and import goods from these countries at zero tariffs. The total population of the Eurasian Economic Union member states is 240 million people, so it is a huge market that can be used,'. The free trade agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran should take effect by April or early May. The EAEU is a regional, political, and economic union made up of the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Russian Federation. The EAEU provides for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, while pursuing a unified policy across various sectors, including transport, industry, agriculture, energy, and foreign trade. Iran's exports to the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) rose by 22 percent, amounting to $1.631 billion, in the first ten months of the current Iranian calendar year (from March 20, 2024, to January 19, 2025). Economic analysts have suggested that the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement could exceed $10 billion annually within a few years. In addition to trade, the agreement may promote joint ventures, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer in sectors like energy, transportation, and manufacturing. The Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement is a significant step forward, emphasizing regional economic cooperation in an increasingly interconnected global economy. As it nears implementation, the agreement is expected to reshape economic ties between Iran and the Eurasian region. Nagorno Karabakh and the Zangezur Corridor During the initial days of the Nagorno-Kabrabkah conflict, Iran had sought to create a peace plan between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In a televised address Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei spoke about Azerbaijani territorial recognition yet made clear that the rights and security of Armenians 'must be ensured'. Armenia and Azerbaijan eventually came to a settlement brokered via the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group. Armenia claims it did not explicitly reject Iran’s attempts at brokering peace but instead preferred going through the OSCE Minks Group. During the 2020 Karabakh War, Azerbaijani media accused Iran of supporting Armenia with arms and fuel. Recently, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has criticized Iran for fuel transfers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan’s suspicion of Iran was only further enforced when in July 2024, it was reported that Iran and Armenia had signed a secret arms deal worth $500 million, which includes drone and air defense missiles, among other various military equipment. Following Azerbaijan’s victory in the Karabakh War, a trilateral ceasefire agreement alongside Russia was signed that included provisions for the opening of transportation routes. This provision, article 9 stated, 'All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions.' Azerbaijan strongly believes that Article 9 gives it the right to open the Zangezur Corridor. Armenia, however, is firmly against this belief, claiming that it does not view the Zangezur Corridor as a route or a corridor. Armenia’s opposition to the corridor is founded on its concerns over national security, sovereignty, and historical grievances. Yet, Armenia has found a partner in Iran in its opposition to the corridor. Motivated by worries that the initiative could diminish its status as a key regional transit center and weaken its strategic influence in the South Caucasus, Iran is strongly against the creation of the Zangezur Corridor. Iran’s Opposition to the Zangezur Corridor Friendly Relations with Armenia: Iran has historically maintained friendly relations with Armenia and supports Armenia’s sovereignty. Reduced Energy Demand: A pipeline built along the Zangezur pipeline would carry more oil and gas to southern Europe and reduce European demand for Iranian hydrocarbons. Challenges in Sanction Negotiations: A weakened Iran could complicate the country’s efforts to negotiate relief from international sanctions. Transit Role for Azerbaijani Citizens: Iran acts as a transit country for Azerbaijani citizens traveling to Nakhchivan, providing Tehran with leverage over Azerbaijan. Pan-Turkish Aspirations: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said the corridor could be used to unite the Turkish world, with an estimated 16% of Iran’s population being ethnically Azerbaijani, there are fears that the Zangezur Corridor could led to demands for greater autonomy or even create separatist movements within Iran. Post-Assad Era: As Iran’s supply lines to the Levant face increasing threats, the Zangezur Corridor could further isolate Iran and significantly diminish its influence in the South Caucasus. Opportunities for Further Cooperation USAID: In February, the Trump administration announced plans to cut 90% of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 's foreign aid contracts, slashing global assistance by $60 billion. Armenia had received $110 million of the $250 million initially pledged to it by USAID for 2024 before the funding freezes were implemented. Critics of Trump's decision to dismantle USAID caution that this opens the door for Russia to expand its influence in Central and Eastern Europe, however, it also presents an opportunity for Iran to deepen its ties with Armenia. With a less active US presence in the region, Iran is hoping to capitalize on strengthening its relationship with Armenia and the Eurasia region. Continued Economic Cooperation: In 2023, bilateral trade grew by 43%, accompanied by the implementation of five major infrastructure projects, including the expansion of the North-South Highway, modernization of border crossings, and development of energy infrastructure. In 2024, a $15 million investment in Yerevan established a joint technology park, focusing on IT and biotechnology cooperation. That same year the Iranian Trade Center in Yerevan was launched, providing essential services such as financial transactions, logistics, legal advice, and customs support. This ongoing trade and investment between Iran and Armenia will ensure that both countries continue to gain from their partnership Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor: To countermeasure Turkiye and the Zangezur Corridor, India, Iran, and Armenia have proposed working together to create a Persian Gulf-Black Sea Transit Corridor (PBTC). Initially proposed by Iran in 2016, the PBTC aims to link Europe with India through Armenian territory and Iranian ports, effectively bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. This initiative seeks to streamline cargo transit, enhance infrastructure, and simplify shipping procedures. The project also hopes to compete with Türkiye’s Development Road, which connects Europe and Türkiye via the Great Faw Port in Iraq, cutting 15 days of transit time by circumventing the Suez Canal. By establishing a connection between Armenia and India and China, the PBTC looks to offer an alternative to Türkiye’s Development Road and the Suez Canal, which would unlock new trade and investment opportunities for both Armenia and Iran. Conclusion Armenia and Iran are connected through a shared history, culture, and geography, making Armenia one of the few countries that truly aligns with Iran's economic and geopolitical interests. The partnership between Armenia and Iran reflects a strategic alignment shaped by shared geopolitical interests and historical ties. This partnership, driven by mutual strategic, economic, and security objectives, seeks to counter Türkiye and Azerbaijan's increasing influence in the region while enhancing trade and investment between them. With Iran’s ouster from Syria last December, and the uncertainty of its influence over the rest of the Middle East, Iran may begin to place a greater focus on Armenia and the Eurasian region. Recent diplomatic meetings have emphasized the importance of enhancing trade with the EAEU, as Iran seeks to increase its economic activity in the region and gain greater access to European markets. Iran is expecting the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement to significantly boost trade and promote regional economic cooperation. By strengthening trade with the EAEU and boosting ties with Armenia, Iran could help offset some of its losses in the Middle East, while counterbalancing Türkiye’s rising influence over the region. Additionally, although the Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor is still just a proposal, its implementation could significantly benefit the economies and the global presence of both Iran and Armenia. In a constantly shifting geopolitical environment, Iran can find reassurance in its partnership with Armenia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nvw6FR-a0AHP	2025-03-04T17:04:26-08:00	
Lent As Pilgrims Of Hope – OpEd	Lent is a season of profound spiritual significance, a time when we are called to journey inward and outward, to reflect on our lives, and to renew our commitment to Christ. As male and female religious, missionaries, and priests, we are uniquely positioned to embrace this season as 'pilgrims of hope.' Our vocation calls us to be witnesses of the Gospel, to embody the hope of Christ in a world often marked by despair, division, and uncertainty. This reflection seeks to explore what it means to live Lent as pilgrims of hope, drawing from the experiences of religious life, missionary work, and priestly ministry. A pilgrim is someone on a journey, often to a sacred place, seeking transformation and deeper communion with God. Lent invites us to become pilgrims, not necessarily in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense. We are called to leave behind the familiar comforts of our routines, our habits, and even our sins, to embark on a journey of conversion. This pilgrimage is not a solitary endeavor; it is a communal journey with Christ and with one another. As religious, we are already pilgrims by virtue of our vows. Poverty calls us to detach from material possessions and to trust in God’s providence. Chastity invites us to love freely and purely, directing our hearts toward the divine. Obedience challenges us to surrender our will to God’s plan, even when the path is unclear. These vows are not burdens but gifts that free us to journey more deeply into the heart of God. For missionaries, the pilgrimage of Lent takes on an added dimension. Missionaries are called to go to the peripheries, to places where hope is scarce, and to be bearers of Christ’s light. This requires a willingness to step out of our comfort zones, to encounter the unfamiliar, and to trust that God is already at work in the lives of those we serve. I recall a missionary priest who spent years in a remote village in Africa. He often spoke of the challenges of learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, and facing the harsh realities of poverty and disease. Yet, amidst these difficulties, he found profound hope in the faith of the people he served. Their joy and resilience in the face of adversity were a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel. Hope is the virtue that sustains us on our pilgrimage. It is not a naive optimism or a passive wishfulness, but a confident trust in God’s promises. Hope reminds us that, no matter how dark the present moment may seem, God’s love and mercy will ultimately prevail. As St. Paul writes, 'Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us' (Romans 5:5). For priests, hope is at the heart of our ministry. We are called to be instruments of God’s grace, to bring hope to the hopeless, and to remind people of their dignity as children of God. I think of a priest who served in a prison ministry. He often encountered men and women who had lost all sense of hope, who felt abandoned by God and society. Through his presence, his prayers, and his words of encouragement, he helped them to see that they were not beyond redemption, that God’s mercy was greater than their sins. This is the hope we are called to embody as priests: a hope that speaks of forgiveness, healing, and new beginnings. The traditional practices of Lent, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, are not ends in themselves but means of deepening our hope in God. Through prayer, we cultivate a relationship with the One who is the source of all hope. Fasting helps us to detach from the things that distract us from God and to hunger more deeply for His presence. Almsgiving reminds us that our hope is not just for ourselves but for the entire human family, especially the poor and marginalized. For religious, these practices take on a communal dimension. Our communal prayer, whether it be the Liturgy of the Hours or the celebration of the Eucharist, is a powerful expression of hope. It is a reminder that we are not alone on this journey, that we are part of a larger body of believers who are striving to live the Gospel. I remember a religious community that dedicated their Lenten season to praying for peace in a war-torn region. Each day, they gathered to intercede for those affected by violence, trusting that their prayers could make a difference. Their hope was not in their own efforts but in the power of God to bring about peace. Fasting, too, can be a communal act of hope. By giving up something we enjoy, we are reminded of our dependence on God and our solidarity with those who go without. I think of a religious sister who fasted from social media during Lent. She found that this small sacrifice freed her to be more present to the people around her and to spend more time in prayer. Her fasting was not just a personal discipline but a witness to others of the joy that comes from putting God first. Almsgiving is perhaps the most tangible expression of hope. It is a way of sharing our resources with those in need, trusting that God will provide for us as well. I recall a missionary who worked in a slum community. During Lent, she organized a food drive to help families struggling with hunger. What struck me was not just the generosity of those who donated but the hope it inspired in the recipients. For many, it was a reminder that they were not forgotten, that God was working through others to provide for them. Of course, the journey of hope is not without its challenges. There are times when we may feel discouraged, when the weight of the world’s suffering seems too much to bear. We may wonder if our efforts are making a difference, if our prayers are being heard. In these moments, it is important to remember that hope is not based on our own strength but on God’s faithfulness. I think of a priest who served in a parish that was struggling with division and conflict. Despite his best efforts, the situation seemed to only get worse. He felt overwhelmed and began to doubt his ability to make a difference. Yet, in prayer, he was reminded that his role was not to fix everything but to be a witness to Christ’s love and mercy. This realization gave him the strength to persevere, to continue reaching out to those who were hurting, and to trust that God was at work, even in ways he could not see. For missionaries, the challenges to hope can be even more acute. They may face rejection, hostility, or even danger in their work. Yet, it is precisely in these moments that their witness to hope is most powerful. I think of a missionary who was imprisoned for his faith. Despite the harsh conditions, he continued to pray for his captors and to share the Gospel with his fellow prisoners. His hope was not in his own freedom but in the promise of eternal life with Christ. His witness inspired many, including some of his captors, to turn to God. As we journey through Lent, we are reminded that our hope is not in vain. The Resurrection of Christ is the ultimate source of our hope. It is the assurance that death and sin do not have the final word, that God’s love is stronger than anything we may face. This hope sustains us in our darkest moments and gives us the courage to continue our pilgrimage. For religious, missionaries, and priests, the Resurrection is the foundation of our vocation. It is the reason we can embrace poverty, chastity, and obedience, knowing that our true treasure is in heaven. It is the reason we can go to the peripheries, trusting that Christ is already there, waiting for us. It is the reason we can minister to the broken and the lost, confident that God’s grace can transform even the most hardened hearts. I think of a religious sister who worked with victims of human trafficking. She often spoke of the pain and suffering she encountered, but she also spoke of the hope she found in the resilience of the women she served. Many of them had experienced unimaginable trauma, yet through the sister’s love and support, they began to see themselves as beloved children of God. This was a powerful reminder that the Resurrection is not just a future hope but a present reality, breaking into our world through acts of love and mercy. As we journey through this Lenten season, let us embrace our identity as pilgrims of hope. Let us be men and women who radiate the hope of Christ, who remind the world that no matter how dark the night may seem, the dawn is coming. Let us be religious, missionaries, and priests who live our vows with joy and fidelity, who go to the peripheries with courage and compassion, and who minister to God’s people with love and mercy. May our prayer, fasting, and almsgiving be expressions of our hope in God’s promises. May we face the challenges of our pilgrimage with faith and perseverance, trusting that God is with us every step of the way. And may we always keep our eyes fixed on the Resurrection, the ultimate source of our hope, as we strive to bring the light of Christ to a world in need. In the words of St. Augustine, 'We are an Easter people, and ‘Alleluia’ is our song.' Let us live this Lent as pilgrims of hope, singing the song of 'Alleluia' with our lives, and bearing witness to the joy of the Gospel.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevXGYPT28bm6U	2025-03-04T15:29:02-08:00	
Madrid Leads Development Of Quantum-Safe Communications Through T...	The Regional Government of Madrid is strengthening its commitment to quantum communications with an investment of 16 million euros in research projects on quantum communications and cybersecurity within the framework of the International Year of Quantum Science and Technologies declared by UNESCO. Among the initiatives the regional government is promoting stands out MadQuantum-CM, which aims to expand the largest quantum communications network in Europe, MadQCI, positioning itself as a strategic initiative for the development of secure quantum communications in Europe. At IMDEA Networks, as one of the project participants, we lead the development of next-generation quantum communication protocols. ‘Our work is focused on creating solutions that extend the reach and functionality of quantum networks, ensuring their integration with current communications infrastructures’, explains Albert Banchs, IMDEA Networks’ principal researcher on the project. Meanwhile, 5TONIC, the open research and innovation laboratory created by Telefónica and IMDEA Networks, plays a fundamental role together with the Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M), as a validation and testing centre of new technologies for the control of quantum communication networks. As such, a solution has been developed for secure end-to-end key distribution based on cloud native and QKD (quantum key distribution) technologies, which has been evaluated by means of a digital twin for QKD networks, also developed in the context of the project. This solution will be experimentally validated on a hybrid PQC/QKD (Post-Quantum cryptography/QKD) multi-domain testbed deployed in the 5TONIC laboratory. ‘Our facilities allow us to evaluate quantum communications protocols and equipment in real operating conditions, a crucial step for its future commercial implementation,’ explains Carlos J. Bernardos, vice-president of 5TONIC and full professor at UC3M. With the purpose of extending the largest quantum communications network in Europe, the deployment of the MadQuantum-CM project relies on Telefónica’s fibre optic infrastructure, over which quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are implemented. This combination of cutting-edge telecommunications infrastructure with quantum technology will guarantee inherently secure communications based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The MadQuantum-CM consortium, coordinated by the Universidad Politécnica of Madrid, includes the participation of leading institutions such as the National Institute for Aerospace Technology, the Spanish Metrology Centre, the Fundación Vithas, the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid and the Universidad Complutense of Madrid. The project is funded by the European Union through NextGenerationEU funds, by the Community of Madrid and by the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR) in the framework of the Complementary Quantum Communication Plan, with a total investment of 73 million euros. The project’s key objectives include the development of new, more efficient and secure quantum communication protocols, the integration of QKD technologies into conventional communications networks, the training of specialised researchers to boost the national industry, and the creation of use cases in critical sectors such as healthcare, energy and public services. 5TONIC, as a laboratory of reference in the development of 5G and 6G technologies, facilitating collaboration between academia and industry, also contributes to technological development in the field of quantum communications. ‘The synergy between the different ecosystem players, from operators such as Telefónica to research centres such as UC3M and IMDEA Networks, is fundamental to the success of the project,’ adds Bernardos. The development of quantum communications has become a strategic priority for both Europe and Spain, with Madrid being a reference hub for the research and development of these fundamental technologies for the security of future communications. The collaboration between 5TONIC, Telefónica (which is deploying the MadQCI fibre network) and IMDEA Networks in the framework of MadQuantum-CM exemplifies the innovation model needed to lead this technological revolution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTeva9UjjLtOOEa	2025-03-04T15:25:29-08:00	
The Complex Effects Of Pesticide Exposure On Bumble Bee Health	The effects of pesticide exposure on pollinator health may be more complicated than originally thought, according to a team of researchers in Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences who recently published an article on the topic in Biology Letters. In the study, the researchers examined the effects of imidacloprid, a common insecticide, on bumble bees. They found that while exposure to the insecticide was associated with shorter lifespans and reduced reproduction, low doses also were associated with new queens surviving longer in diapause. This phenomenon of hormesis — when low doses of a normally fatal toxin actually benefit an insect — is poorly understood in pollinators, and these short-term benefits often come at a cost, said Etya Amsalem, associate professor of entomology at Penn State and lead author on the study. 'If hormesis goes unrecognized, it could lead to the mistaken conclusion that certain pesticides benefit bees,' Amsalem said. 'Such a misconception is dangerous, given the well-documented negative effects of imidacloprid and the trade-offs associated with hormetic responses — where short-term benefits trade-off with long-term fitness.' Amsalem added that a useful analogy for hormesis is caffeine: In small amounts, it can be beneficial, but at high doses, it becomes toxic. 'Even low doses can have unintended effects, such as disrupting sleep,' she said. 'Just as coffee drinkers should be aware of its multiple effects, researchers and policymakers must account for hormesis when evaluating pesticide impacts on pollinators.' Pennsylvania’s native bumble bee queens are particularly vulnerable to outside pressures, such as harsh winters, according to the researchers. A bumble bee queen must go through diapause — a dormant stage that enables an insect to withstand harsh environmental conditions — to survive to the spring, when she can start a new colony. Over 75% of a queen bumblebee’s life can be spent in diapause — a significant amount of time when the bee faces extreme temperatures, possible infections and starvation. And if she doesn’t survive this period, she will not be able to establish a new colony of bumblebees, meaning the world can lose up to hundreds of potential pollinators with every dying queen. 'But diapause is poorly understood,' Amsalem said. 'And despite the fact that most pollinators undergo winter diapause, pesticide risk assessments typically focus on the bee’s active seasons, overlooking a significant portion of the bee’s life cycle.' During active seasons, pesticides are known to have detrimental effects on pollinators, Amsalem said. Many pesticides can dissolve in water, where plants can absorb and transport them into their pollen and nectar. When this happens, pesticide residues can be picked up by beneficial insects — such as bees and other pollinators. This pesticide exposure can cause immediate death or a decreased lifespan and inability to reproduce. To assess the impacts of one of the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid, during both the active season and diapause, the researchers mixed imidacloprid with sugar water and fed the solution to bumble bees. They then assessed the total lifespan of males, workers and queens and measured reproductive output in the females. 'The results were straightforward: Higher concentrations led to shorter lifespans and fewer offspring, a typical and expected response of bees to neonicotinoids,' Amsalem said, noting that while neonicotinoids are banned in Europe, they make up about a quarter of the global pesticide market. Amsalem said what came next was a little more surprising. 'In the second experiment, we fed queens sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid, induced diapause by placing them in cold storage and monitored survival weekly,' she said. 'Surprisingly, we found that sublethal imidacloprid exposure actually improved the queens' survival.' The researchers found that these queens were unexpectedly more resilient against harsh winter conditions after pesticide exposure. Amsalem recommended that these findings be integrated into risk assessment and conservation management strategies for bumblebees. She also argued that these hormetic responses need to be studied further to assess the reasons why these responses occurred. Knowing the mechanism, she said, may give scientists a broader understanding of insect responses to pesticides. 'Most importantly, we must strive to conduct nuanced science that provides a holistic understanding of how stressors affect pollinators — ensuring better-informed conservation efforts,' Amsalem said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevXGTN7vWPqUd	2025-03-04T15:23:23-08:00	
James Webb Telescope Reveals Planet-Forming Disks Can Last Longer...	If there were such a thing as a photo album of the universe, it might include snapshots of pancake-like disks of gas and dust, swirling around newly formed stars across the Milky Way. Known as planet-forming disks, they are believed to be a short-lived feature around most, if not all, young stars, providing the raw materials for planets to form. Most of these planetary nurseries are short-lived, typically lasting only about 10 million years – a fleeting existence by cosmic standards. Now, in a surprising find, researchers at the University of Arizona have discovered that disks can grace their host stars much longer than previously thought, provided the stars are small – one-tenth of the sun's mass or less. In a paper published in the Astrophysical Letters Journal, a research team led by Feng Long of the U of A Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, in the College of Science, reports a detailed observation of a protoplanetary disk at the ripe old age of 30 million years. Presenting the first detailed chemical analysis of a long-lived disk using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the paper provides new insights into planet formation and the habitability of planets outside our solar system. 'In a sense, protoplanetary disks provide us with baby pictures of planetary systems, including a glimpse of what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy,' said Long, the paper's lead author and a Sagan Fellow with the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. As long as the star has a certain mass, high-energy radiation from the young star blows the gas and dust out of the disk, and it can no longer serve as raw material to build planets, Long explained. The team observed a star with the official designation WISE J044634.16–262756.1B – more conveniently known as J0446B – located in the constellation Columba (Latin for 'dove') about 267 light-years from Earth. The researchers found that its planet-forming disk has lasted about three times longer than expected. 'Although we know that most disks disperse within 10 million to 20 million years, we are finding that for specific types of stars, their disks can last much longer,' Long said. 'Because materials in the disk provide the raw materials for planets, the disk's lifespan determines how much time the system has to form planets.' Even though tiny stars retain their disks longer, their disk's chemical makeup does not change significantly. The similar chemical composition regardless of age indicates that the chemistry does not change drastically even as a disk reaches an advanced age. Such a long-lived, stable chemical environment could provide planets around low-mass stars with more time to form. By analyzing the disk's gas content, the researchers ruled out the possibility that the disk around J0446B is a so-called debris disk, a longer-lasting type of disk that consists of second-generation material produced by collisions of asteroid-like bodies. 'We detected gases like hydrogen and neon, which tells us that there is still primordial gas left in the disk around J0446B,' said Chengyan Xie, a doctoral student at LPL who also contributed to the study. The confirmed existence of long-lived disks rich in gases has implications for life outside our solar system, according to the authors. Of particular interest to researchers is the TRAPPIST-1 system, located 40 light-years from Earth, consisting of a red dwarf star and seven planets similar in size to Earth. Three of those planets are located in the 'habitable zone,' where conditions allow for liquid water to exist and offer the potential for life to form, at least in principle. Because stars with long-lived planetary disks fall into a similar mass category as the central star in the TRAPPIST-1 system, the existence of long-lived disks is especially interesting for the evolution of planetary systems, say Long and her co-authors. 'To make the specific arrangement of orbits we see with TRAPPIST-1, planets need to migrate inside the disk, a process that requires the presence of gas,' said Ilaria Pascucci, a professor of planetary sciences at LPL who co-authored the study. 'The long presence of gas we find in those disks might be the reason behind TRAPPIST-1's unique arrangement.' Long-lived disks have not been found for high-mass stars such as the sun, since stars in such systems evolve much more quickly and planets have less time to form. Although our solar system took a different evolutionary route, long-lived disks can tell researchers a lot about the universe, the authors noted, because low-mass stars are believed to vastly outnumber sun-like stars. 'Developing a better understanding of how low-mass star systems evolve and getting snapshots of long-lived disks might help pave the way to filling out the blanks in the photo album of the universe,' Long said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevTlM4tpF5u0R	2025-03-04T15:21:36-08:00	
Sleep Health May Impact Mobility For Women With Chronic Condition...	Poor sleep health can lead to many daily problems, and for people with chronic illnesses, one of those problems can be difficulty with daily movement. Researchers from University of Michigan Health used data from the Nurse’s Health Study - a cohort study of more than 70,000 women nurses followed over time with surveys given every 2 years and used the dataset to focus on the impact of sleep on future mobility, with a special focus on chronic health conditions that are known to affect mobility. The study findings, published in Sleep Epidemiology suggested that poor sleep health predicted a decline in mobility over the eight years following a chronic health diagnosis. Women with diabetes, osteoarthritis or multiple sclerosis who also had signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were more particularly likely to have future problems with mobility compared to counterparts who didn’t have signs of sleep apnea. 'Poor sleep is often overlooked or assumed to be a consequence of aging, functional decline or disability in those with chronic health conditions,' said senior author Tiffany J. Braley, M.D., M.S., associate professor of neurology. 'However, sleep disturbances and disorders may also be an upstream contributor to these issues,' said Braley, also the director of the multiple sclerosis and neuroimmunology division at the University of Michigan Health. 'Treating sleep problems can have positive effects on other parts of life, including physical functions like mobility. In our clinical experiences within medical and rehabilitation contexts, we have observed that how someone is sleeping can have a direct impact on how they engage in physical activities as part of their treatment or self-management,' said first author Daniel Whibley, Ph.D., assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of Michigan Health. The study found that signs of obstructive sleep apnea, reported sleep durations outside of the recommended guidelines, and a perception of inadequate sleep were all associated with an increase in the future use of assistive devices to help with mobility, such as a cane or wheelchair. 'Identifying sleep disturbances or signs of a sleep disorder, providing information about healthy sleep habits and referral to a specialist when needed may help to reduce the progression of mobility issues,' said Whibley. 'Our study is the first to observe this association in women, including those with and without long term conditions, making this research important to consider when addressing ways to better the long-term health of women with these conditions.' 'Reasons for these findings may vary depending on the condition, but require further study,' said Braley, who encourages providers to screen patients with chronic conditions for sleep disturbances and refer to sleep specialists early if an underlying sleep disorder is suspected, as 'the vast majority of sleep disorders are highly treatable.' For patients, Whibley recommends speaking up about problems with sleep. 'Consider sleep as an important part of overall health, especially for those who want to take a proactive role in addressing treatable causes of disability,' notes Whibley, 'as it can help patients take control of their physical health.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTeveL2OAKuMJ6a	2025-03-04T15:17:31-08:00	
Giant Clone Of Seaweed In The Baltic Sea	Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have discovered that what was previously thought to be a unique seaweed species of bladderwrack for the Baltic Sea is in fact a giant clone of common bladderwrack, perhaps the world's largest clone overall. The discovery has implications for predicting the future of seaweed in a changing ocean. In the brakish waters of the Baltic Sea, bladderwrack is the dominant seaweed species as it is one of the few seaweed species that can tolerate low salinity. The seaweed forms large forests from the surface down to a depth of 10 metres. Fish fry, snails and crustaceans thrive here, and the kelp forests also provide an important habitat for larger fish. This makes it an interesting species for researchers to study. Using genetic mapping of marine species is one way to understand how these species should be managed. Falsely mistaken for an own species 'The Baltic Sea is entering a period of warmer and probably even fresher seawater. In new conditions, all species must try to adapt in order to survive, including the important bladderwrack,' says Kerstin Johannesson, Professor of Marine Ecology at the University of Gothenburg and one of the lead authors of a new study in the journal Molecular Ecology. Through DNA sequencing, the researchers have found that a small, bushy form of seaweed in the Baltic Sea that was previously thought to be a separate species (called narrow wrack) is a clone of bladderwrack. The clone has formed new populations by dispersing fragments of an original female plant with the water currents and growing into new individuals of wrack. The clone spreads over more than 500 km of the coast of the Bothnian Sea, from Öregrund in Uppland to just south of Umeå, and may be the world's largest clone of any organism. Millions of individuals in one clone Bladderwrack has separate male and female plants that normally form new individuals after sexual fertilisation. 'This clone comprises millions of individuals, and in some areas, it is completely dominant, while in other areas it grows alongside sexually propagated individuals of bladderwrack. We have found a few more large clones in the Baltic Sea, but the female clone off the Swedish Gulf of Bothnia is by far the largest clone – a real super female,' says Ricardo Pereyra, researcher in the group who led the genetic analyses. Uncertain future for clones Seaweed clones face an uncertain future as the Baltic Sea is affected by climate change. Without constant sexual reproduction, there are few genetic changes and adaptations in the genetic material of the stocks. 'A clone almost completely lacks the genetic variation that otherwise means that there are individuals in a population that can handle the changes and make the species survive,' says Kerstin Johannesson. New species in Estonia During the survey, the researchers from the University of Gothenburg also identified a new species of seaweed on the Estonian coast which, like the small seaweed clone, is small and bushy, but has both males and females and reproduces only sexually. This seaweed is very closely related to bladderwrack but is currently reproductively isolated from bladderwrack in the area.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevd9yvk1jmlyp	2025-03-04T15:11:07-08:00	
The First Bronze Age Settlement In The Maghreb	Most Bronze Age settlements have been documented in European territory. Despite its geographical proximity, the Maghreb has always been absent from these historical narratives, erroneously characterized as an ‘empty land’ until the arrival of the Phoenicians around 800 BC. Now, a research study led by Hamza Benattia Melgarejo ( University of Barcelona) has uncovered the first Bronze Age settlement in this geographical area, predating the Phoenician period. This discovery is of great significance for the history of Africa and the Mediterranean. According to the results published in Antiquity, excavations at Kach Kouch, located in northwest Morocco, reveal a human occupation datable to between 2200 and 600 BC. This would show that it would be the earliest site of this chronology in Mediterranean Africa, except for Egypt. The international research team, led by Hamza Benattia Melgarejo, PhD student at the UB’s Faculty of Geography and History and member of the UB’s Classical and Protohistoric Archaeology Research Group, has been working on the prehistoric settlement of Kach Kouch, which extends over an area of approximately one hectare near the Lau River. It is located ten kilometres from the present-day coast, near the Strait of Gibraltar, and thirty kilometres southeast of Tétouan. Excavations have revealed different phases of occupation. The first, from 2200-2000 BC, is poorly represented but significant. The evidence suggests an initial contemporary occupation in the transition from the Bronze Age to neighbouring Iberia. The second phase, 1300-900 BC, is a vibrant period in the history of the settlement. A stable agricultural community was established at Kach Kouch and is the first definitive evidence of sedentary life before the Phoenician presence in the Maghreb. Wooden mud-brick buildings, rock-cut silos and grinding stones reveal a thriving agricultural economy based on crops such as barley and wheat, supplemented by sheep, goats and cattle. A third phase, extending from 800 to 600 BC, demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the inhabitants of Kach Kouch. During this period, several cultural innovations from the eastern Mediterranean were introduced, such as wheel-thrown pottery, iron tools and new architectural traditions using stone. This mix of local and foreign practices illustrates how the community actively participated in Mediterranean exchange networks. 'Kach Kouch is one of the first well-documented examples of continuous settlement in the Maghreb and tells a very different story from the one that has existed for a long time: it shows the history of dynamic local communities that were far from isolated', says Benattia. 'The excavations at this site are another step towards correcting these historical biases and reveal that the Maghreb was an active participant in the social, cultural and economic networks of the Mediterranean', says the UB researcher.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevUUnScAunbRn	2025-03-04T15:08:48-08:00	
World’s Critical Food Crops At Imminent Risk From Rising Temperat...	Global warming is already reshaping our daily lives, with storms, floods, wildfires and droughts around the world. As temperatures continue to rise, a third of global food production could be at risk. Now, a new study in Nature Food offers a more precise picture of exactly where and how warming will affect our ability to grow food. Researchers at Aalto University studied how future changes in temperature, precipitation and aridity will affect growing conditions of 30 major food crop species across the globe. They found that low-latitude regions face significantly worse consequences than mid- or high-latitudes. Depending on the level of warming, up to half of the crop production in low-latitude areas would be at risk as climate conditions become unsuitable for production. At the same time, those regions would also see a large drop in crop diversity. ‘The loss of diversity means that the range of food crops available for cultivation could decrease significantly in certain areas. That would reduce food security and make it more difficult to get adequate calories and protein,’ says Sara Heikonen, the doctoral researcher who led the study. Up to half of the world’s food crop production may be affected Warming will severely decrease the amount of global cropland available for staple crops –– rice, maize, wheat, potato and soybean –– which account for over two-thirds of the world’s food energy intake . In addition, ‘tropical root crops such as yam, which are key to food security in low-income regions, as well as cereals and pulses are particularly vulnerable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the region which would be impacted most, almost three quarters of current production is at risk if global warming exceeds 3°C,’ Heikonen says. By contrast, mid- and high-latitude areas will probably retain their productive land overall, though zones for specific crops will change. These areas are also likely to see an increase in crop diversity. ‘For example, the cultivation of temperate fruits, such as pears, could become more common in more northerly regions,’ says Heikonen. However, even if climatic conditions are favourable, other factors could hamper agriculture in these areas, says the study’s senior author, Professor Matti Kummu. ‘We showed that there’s climatic potential but, for example, warming might bring new pests and extreme weather events, which our model doesn’t include. So the situation isn’t really that black and white.’ Options for adaptation and mitigation Many of the low-latitude regions threatened most by warming are already vulnerable in numerous ways. They face problems with food sufficiency, and economic and systemic forces make them less resilient than northern countries. Nevertheless, Kummu sees ways that these regions could, at least partly, meet the challenge. ‘In many low latitude areas, especially in Africa, the yields are small compared to similar areas elsewhere in the world. They could get higher yields with access to fertilisers and irrigation as well as reducing food losses through the production and storage chain. However, ongoing global warming will add a lot of uncertainty to these estimates and probably even more actions are needed, such as crop selection and novel breeding,’ he says. ‘But I always say that the modelling and analysis is the easy part –– understanding how to make the changes happen is the hardest part.’ While policy-makers in low-latitude countries should work to close those gaps, in mid- and high-latitude regions farmers and policy-makers need more flexibility, says Kummu. Warming will likely change which crops are grown in those areas, and further changes will come from the array of pressures on the global food system. Coping with those changes will require the ability to adjust and adapt as the consequences of climate change unfold. ‘If we want to secure our food system in the future, we need to both mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects,’ says Heikonen. ‘Even if the biggest changes are in equatorial regions, we will all feel the effects through the globalised food system. We need to act together to address these problems.’	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevaPeL2qpKFR1	2025-03-04T15:06:22-08:00	
Heat From the Sun Affects Seismic Activity On Earth	Seismology has revealed much of the basics about earthquakes: Tectonic plates move, causing strain energy to build up, and that energy eventually releases in the form of an earthquake. As for forecasting them, however, there’s still much to learn in order to evacuate cities before catastrophes like the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tōhoku earthquake that, in addition to causing a tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, resulted in more than 18,000 deaths. In recent years, research has focused on a possible correlation between the sun or moon and seismic activity on Earth, with some studies pointing to tidal forces or electromagnetic effects interacting with the planet’s crust, core, and mantle. In Chaos, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Tsukuba and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan explored the likelihood that Earth’s climate, as affected by solar heat, plays a role. The study builds on one that a pair of the researchers had published in the same journal in 2022; that study connected solar activity, particularly sunspot numbers, with seismic systems on Earth to establish a causal effect. 'Solar heat drives atmospheric temperature changes, which in turn can affect things like rock properties and underground water movement,' said author Matheus Henrique Junqueira Saldanha. 'Such fluctuations can make rocks more brittle and prone to fracturing, for example — and changes in rainfall and snowmelt can alter the pressure on tectonic plate boundaries. While these factors may not be the main drivers of earthquakes, they could still be playing a role that can help to predict seismic activity.' Using mathematical and computational methods, the researchers analyzed earthquake data alongside solar activity records and surface temperatures on Earth. Among other findings, they observed that when they included Earth surface temperatures into their model, the forecasting became more accurate, especially for shallow earthquakes. 'That makes sense, since heat and water mostly affect the upper layers of the Earth’s crust,' said Junqueira Saldanha. The findings suggest the transfer of solar heat to the surface of the Earth does affect seismic activity, however minutely, and that incorporating solar activity predictions into detailed Earth temperature models may help issue earthquake forecasts. 'It’s an exciting direction, and we hope our study sheds some light on the bigger picture of what triggers earthquakes,' said Junqueira Saldanha.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevSV_2tUsKgkG	2025-03-04T15:03:59-08:00	
Breakthrough In Clean Energy: Palladium Nanosheets Pave Way For A...	Hydrogen energy is emerging as a key driver of a clean, sustainable future, offering a zero-emission alternative to fossil fuels. Although it is promising, the large-scale production of hydrogen relies heavily on expensive platinum-based catalysts, and hence affordability remains a major challenge for the industry. To surpass this, researchers from the Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have developed a novel hydrogen evolution catalyst, bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI), that offers platinum-like efficiency at a fraction of the cost. Their groundbreaking study, which was published in Volume 31, Issue 6 of Chemistry – A European Journal, has also been selected as a 'Cover Feature' for the journal, highlighting its significance in advancing sustainable hydrogen production. The study was led by Dr. Hiroaki Maeda and Professor Hiroshi Nishihara from TUS in collaboration with high-profiled researchers from the University of Tokyo, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Kyoto Institute of Technology, RIKEN SPring-8 Center, and the National Institute for Materials Science, Japan. The discovery marks a breakthrough in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) technology, which is a key process in green hydrogen energy generation. HER occurs in the process of electrolytic splitting of water for the generation of hydrogen. The HER catalyst electrodes, traditionally made of platinum, facilitate the conversion of nascent hydrogen ([H])—generated at the electrode surface during water splitting—into hydrogen gas (H₂). While platinum (Pt) as a HER catalyst is highly effective, its scarcity and high cost significantly increase manufacturing expenses, limiting its large-scale application. Using a simple synthesis process and limited amounts of precious metals, the research team offered a highly efficient alternative for Pt catalysts. The team fabricated palladium-based nanosheets that could maximize catalytic activity while minimizing metal usage, drastically lowering the costs associated with H₂ production. 'Developing efficient HER electrocatalysts is key to sustainable H₂ production. Bis(diimino)metal coordination nanosheets, with their high conductivity, large surface area, and efficient electron transfer, are promising candidates,' says lead researcher, Dr. Maeda. 'Additionally, their sparse metal arrangement reduces material usage. Here, we have successfully developed these nanosheets using palladium metal.' The team developed PdDI nanosheets (C-PdDI and E-PdDI) using two different methods: gas-liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation respectively. After undergoing the activation, the E-PdDI sheets exhibited a low overpotential of 34 mV as well as platinum’s overpotential of 35 mV, which meant that very little extra energy was required to drive the hydrogen production. The exchange current density of 2.1 mA/cm² also matched the platinum’s catalytic performance. The results therefore place E-PdDI among the most efficient HER catalysts developed to date, making it a promising low-cost alternative to platinum. One of the critical aspects of any catalyst is its long-term stability. These PdDI nanosheets demonstrated excellent durability, remaining intact after 12 hours in acidic conditions, confirming their suitability for real-world hydrogen production systems. 'Our research brings us one step closer to making H₂ production more affordable and sustainable, a crucial step for achieving a clean energy future,' explains Dr. Maeda. Furthermore, by minimizing the reliance on scarce and costly platinum, PdDI nanosheets align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 7—promoting affordable and clean energy, SDG 9—industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The implications of this study extend beyond laboratory experiments. The scalability, enhanced activity, and cost-effectiveness of PdDI nanosheets make them highly attractive for industrial hydrogen production, hydrogen fuel cells, and large-scale energy storage systems. Additionally, replacing platinum-based catalysts with PdDI could reduce mining-related emissions, accelerating the transition to a sustainable hydrogen economy. Also, the density of palladium atoms is ten times lesser than Pt atoms, reducing the dependency on precious Pt metal, and approaching for a cost-effective production of electrodes. The replacement of Pt with PdDI nanosheets is expected to produce great outcomes in automobiles, hydrogen production, and electrode-supplying industries. As research progresses, the team at TUS aims to further optimize PdDI nanosheets for commercialization, contributing to the development of an environmentally friendly hydrogen society.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevbVeiPtDcMc_	2025-03-04T15:02:08-08:00	
TROPEX-2025: Strengthening India’s Maritime Resolve In The Indo-P...	In the face of evolving maritime challenges and the shifting dynamics of global geopolitics, India has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to securing the Indo-Pacific region through the successful execution of the Theatre Level Operational Readiness Exercise (TROPEX) 2025. This biennial exercise, conducted by the Indian Navy with active participation from the Indian Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard, is a testament to India's robust maritime capabilities, strategic foresight, and dedication to regional stability. A Comprehensive Display of Maritime Strength TROPEX-2025, spanning from January to March 2025, unfolded across the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The exercise encompassed harbour and sea phases, integrating various facets of combat operations, cyber and electronic warfare, live weapon firings, and amphibious exercises (AMPHEX). The scale of TROPEX-2025 was unprecedented, with approximately 65 Indian Naval ships, nine submarines, and over 80 aircraft participating in complex maritime operational scenarios. This extensive mobilisation aimed to validate and refine the Navy's Concept of Operations, emphasising forward-deployed sustenance and interoperability with other services. A highlight of the exercise was the deployment of India's indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, symbolising the nation's strides towards self-reliance in defence manufacturing. Accompanying INS Vikrant were state-of-the-art Visakhapatnam and Kolkata Class destroyers, Kalvari Class submarines, and an array of advanced aircraft, including the MiG-29K fighters, P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, HALE Sea Guardian drones, and MH-60R helicopters. The integration of these platforms showcased India's capability to orchestrate coordinated and precise maritime operations, reinforcing its position as a formidable naval power in the Indo-Pacific. Jointmanship and Interoperability: The Cornerstones of TROPEX-2025 The essence of TROPEX-2025 lies in its emphasis on jointmanship and seamless interoperability among the Indian Armed Forces. The exercise witnessed the convergence of assets from the Indian Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard, operating in unison to simulate real-world combat scenarios. The Indian Air Force contributed with Sukhoi-30 and Jaguar fighter aircraft, C-130 transport planes, flight refuellers, and AWACS aircraft, enhancing the exercise's aerial dimension. The Indian Army's involvement included an infantry brigade comprising over 600 troops, participating in amphibious landings and establishing beachheads, demonstrating the capability to effectively project power from sea to land. A significant event during TROPEX-2025 was the embarkation of senior military leadership, including the Vice Chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, aboard frontline naval ships such as INS Vikrant and INS Jalashwa. Their presence underscored the high level of coordination and the importance of integrated operations. These leaders witnessed dynamic operations, including missile firings, anti-submarine drills, and extensive flying operations by MiG-29K fighters and various helicopters, both day and night. Such high-level participation not only boosts the forces' morale but also signifies a unified strategic vision aimed at safeguarding India's maritime interests. Strategic Significance in the Indo-Pacific Context The Indo-Pacific region, a pivotal conduit for global trade and energy flows, has increasingly become a theatre of strategic competition. Emerging challenges, including assertive maritime claims and the militarisation of critical sea lanes, necessitate a proactive and prepared stance. TROPEX-2025 is a clear signal of India's resolve to maintain peace, stability, and the rule of law in these waters. The exercise's expansive scope, covering the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the broader Indian Ocean, reflects India's capability to monitor and secure critical maritime zones. By rigorously testing combat readiness through simulated warfare scenarios, anti-submarine operations, and amphibious landings, TROPEX-2025 ensures the Indian Navy remains poised to counter conventional, asymmetric, and hybrid threats. This readiness is crucial in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring regional partners of India's commitment to collective security. Countering China's Maritime Expansion: The Role of TROPEX in Power Projection China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has aggressively expanded its presence in the Indian Ocean, frequently deploying warships and intelligence-gathering vessels near territorial waters. The establishment of a PLA Navy base in Djibouti, strategic military agreements with Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and its expanding naval footprint in the Bay of Bengal through economic coercion tactics have raised serious security concerns for India. TROPEX 2025 sends a powerful message that India is not a passive bystander but a formidable force willing to challenge such incursions. The inclusion of offensive naval tactics, area denial strategies, and multi-theatre force deployment showcases India's preparedness to intercept, neutralise, and eliminate threats in its maritime domain.Moreover, by deepening naval cooperation with the Quad, ASEAN partners, and regional allies like France (which has strategic bases in the Indian Ocean), India is ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains free from unilateral dominance. A Final Warning to Hostile Powers As the exercise concludes, one thing is clear: India will not tolerate maritime coercion, territorial incursions, or hegemonic ambitions that threaten its national security and regional stability. TROPEX 2025 cements India's position as the leading maritime force in the Indo-Pacific, ready to counter threats, protect vital sea lanes, and uphold the principles of freedom of navigation. For adversaries who seek to encroach upon India's maritime domain, TROPEX 2025 is a stark reminder that the Indian Navy is equipped, prepared, and determined to enforce its sovereign rights and strategic interests. Whether it is PLA naval vessels prowling in the Indian Ocean, Chinese spy ships attempting to gather intelligence near India's naval bases, or coercive debt-trap diplomacy seeking to encircle India's influence, none will go unchecked. With unmatched firepower, strategic alliances, and an unwavering commitment to regional peace, TROPEX 2025 is not just an exercise, it is a declaration. A declaration that India is a significant maritime power in the Indo-Pacific will not yield an inch of its rightful sphere of influence to any expansionist force. The seas belong to those who have the will to defend them, and India, through TROPEX 2025, India has made it abundantly clear: it will lead, protect, and prevail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevcoUOrk3WyH_	2025-03-04T10:15:14-08:00	
Zelenskyy Says Oval Office Meeting Was ‘Regrettable’, Willing To ...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the tense Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump last week was 'regrettable,' and that he is willing to work with Trump's 'strong leadership' to achieve long-term peace. Zelenskyy's remarks came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine, which is critical to fighting Russia's invasion. 'The meeting did not go the way it was supposed to,' Zelenskyy said. 'It's unfortunate that it happened this way. It's time to make things right. We want future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' Saying that 'none of us want an endless war,' he added that 'Ukraine is ready to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring long-term peace closer...My team and I are ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to achieve long-term peace.' Zelenskyy thanked the US for its support during the war and said Kyiv was 'ready' to sign the US-proposed minerals deal, even though his remarks did not specifically address the US decision to halt aid to Ukraine. Late on March 3, senior US officials told multiple media outlets that Trump had ordered a pause in all military aid to Ukraine, piling pressure on Kyiv to fall in line with US efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia despite a lack of security guarantees for Ukraine. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,' reports quoted a White House official as saying on condition of anonymity. 'The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well.' 'This is not permanent termination of aid, it's a pause,' Fox News quoted a Trump administration official as saying. The suspension will last until Trump determines that Ukraine's leaders demonstrate a good-faith commitment to peace, according to Bloomberg and Fox News. Speaking from Washington on March 4, US Vice President JD Vance spoke about the US decision to suspend military aid. Vance said the US needs to 'get some payback for the incredible financial investment' it has made in Ukraine. When asked if the US would resume providing military aid to Ukraine, Vance says that 'everything is on the table' once Kyiv begins negotiating. What Are The Chances Of A Reversal? Reports of the suspension widened the rift between Zelenskyy and the Trump administration, which had long been troubled but split wide open at the White House meeting. The pause amplifies already deafening questions about US support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion at a time when Moscow's forces have been gaining ground for many months, albeit at a massive cost in casualties, and Ukraine struggles with manpower problems and other challenges in the biggest war in Europe since 1945. It is likely to add to concerns in Kyiv and among its supporters in the West that Ukraine could be pressured into a cease-fire or a peace deal that favors Moscow. Those worries increased after Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin in mid-February and then sent top officials to meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. The Kremlin welcomed the news. 'If it’s true, then it’s a decision that really could push the Kyiv regime into a peace process,' Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'If the United States stops being [an arms supplier] or suspends these supplies, it will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,' he said. Any disruption in the flow of US arms to the front line would rapidly weaken Ukraine's chance of beating back Russia's invasion. The suspension applies to 'all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland,' Bloomberg reported. 'The suspension of U.S. assistance for Ukraine is a very unfortunate and significant development, but it may not have immediate impact,' Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on the Ukrainian and Russian militaries, wrote in a thread on X. 'Ukraine is far less dependent on the U.S. for day to day battlefield needs in 2025, than it was in earlier periods of the war. ' 'Much depends on the extent [to which] Ukraine has been stockpiling munitions/parts and where Europeans can step in, although in some cases they have low inventories, and in others U.S. retains the ability to deny any transfers,' Kofman wrote. 'The impact will probably be much more visible in a few months. The pause 'will have a bad impact, of course, if you deprive Ukraine of assistance from the United States, whether it's financial aid or military aid,' independent military analyst Yury Federov told Current Time. 'Military assistance includes not only supplying weapons, ammunition and so on, but it also includes supporting Ukraine by providing intelligence information.' 'Most experts estimate that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be able to maintain the current pace and intensity of military operations for about six months,' he said. 'Whether this is correct or not is difficult to say.' How Much Aid Is Affected? The precise amount of military aid affected is unclear, but the transfer of $3.85 billion worth of weapons authorized by Congress under Biden had not yet been allocated by the White House. No new military aid has been approved since Trump took office in January. The US Congress has appropriated more than $180 billion in support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, about two-thirds of it military aid. 'First of all, the suspension of US aid could affect air defense missiles, HIMARS ammunition, and artillery,' Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko wrote on Telegram. The United States is the only producer of HIMARS and ATACMS systems and if they run out, Ukraine's ability to strike far behind Russian lines and guard its rear positions will be compromised. Ukrainian politicians voiced dismay at the decision and concern over the tattered ties between Kyiv and Washington. 'The dialogue with the United States must be restored immediately, because its rupture will, by and large, benefit only Putin,' Iryna Friz, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity bloc in Ukraine's parliament and member of the Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. Friz pointed out that European leaders have also urged Zelenskyy to seek to mend relations with the Trump administration. Roman Kostenko, secretary of the same committee in the Verkhovna Rada, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that the United States was 'blackmailing us with these weapons and trying to make us make some concessions.' The situation is 'very bad, but not catastrophic,' he said. 'Even if we lose this assistance, there will be no catastrophe, but the situation, of course, will be much worse. Therefore, now we all have to do everything in order not to lose assistance.' Prominent Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said the current US policy on Ukraine, dramatically different from the Biden administration’s stance, is part of 'the new political reality.' 'But tactically, we need to preserve the remnants of the partnership and the ability to buy weapons from the United States and receive intelligence and satellite information,' he told Current Time. Fesenko called for changes in Kyiv’s approach to US ties, including 'a refusal to bet on personal contacts between Zelenskyy and Trump. 'This has been Zelenskyy's premise from the very beginning, that the most important thing is his personal relationship with Trump, he said. 'And what did we see? Unfortunately, it didn't work.' In the United States, Democrats in Congress immediately condemned the pause in military aid. 'My Republican colleagues who have called Putin a war criminal and promised their continued support to Ukraine must join me in demanding President Trump immediately lift this disastrous and unlawful freeze,' said Representative Gregory Meeks (Democrat-New York). The military aid pause came after Zelenskyy's disastrous visit to the White House, which had been expected to produce a deal on joint development of Ukrainian rare minerals and hydrocarbon resources that Trump has cast as a crucial step toward peace between Ukraine and Russia. Instead, a meeting before cameras in the Oval Office devolved into a vocal clash, with Trump and Vance saying that Zelenskyy should be more grateful for US support and is in no position to make demands. The signing of the minerals deal was scrapped, Zelenskyy left the White House early, and Trump said he could 'come back when he is ready for peace.' Senior US officials blamed Zelenskyy for the blowup and called on him to apologize. On March 3, Trump suggested his patience was running out, criticizing Zelenskyy's resistance to the prospect of a quick cease-fire without the kind of concrete security guarantees Kyiv has been seeking from the United States. What Could End The Military Aid Pause? 'What we need to hear from President Zelenskyy is that he has regret for what happened, he's ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he's ready to engage in peace talks,' White House national-security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News earlier on March 3. After Zelenskyy was quoted as saying the end of the war is 'very, very far away,' Trump wrote in a social media post: 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!' In the Fox interview, Vance said that the door remains open to the Ukrainians, but that European leaders must tell Zelenskyy that the war can’t go on forever. He said they admit this in private but in public tend to 'puff' Zelenskyy up. He also defended Trump's position that giving Washington an economic interest in the future of Ukraine will serve as a sound security guarantee. 'If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,' Vance said in the interview. 'That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years,' he added. Trump said on March 3 that he does not believe the minerals deal is dead. With US support deeper in doubt after the Oval Office clash, European leaders moved to take more control of potential peace negotiations and to step up military aid to Ukraine. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 3 that there were a 'number of options on the table' for a cease-fire agreement to at least temporarily halt fighting sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago. The statement came after French President Emmanuel Macron told the newspaper Le Figaro that he thought a one-month truce on air, sea, and energy infrastructure would give allies time to assess Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to a full and lasting cease-fire. 'Manufactured Escalation,' Says Germany's Merz Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is proposing a 'rearm Europe plan' as European governments scramble to mitigate their growing differences with the United States over the war in Ukraine. 'We need a massive surge in defense, without any question. We want lasting peace, but lasting peace can only be built on strength, and strength begins with strengthening ourselves,' von der Leyen said on March 3. In a letter to EU member states on March 4, she proposed that 800 billion euros ($840 billion) be made available for European defense spending going forward, with 150 billion ($157 billion) euros in new loans for defense investments to be backed by the EU's budget. In some of the strongest European comments yet on the White House standoff, Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, referred to what he called 'manufactured escalation' at the meeting, a thinly veiled criticism of Trump and his administration. 'It was not a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but obviously a manufactured escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,' Merz told a news conference in Hamburg on March 3, adding that Europe 'must now show that we are in a position to act independently.' Despite intense and ongoing discussions on boosting Europe's own defense capacities and alarm over warming rhetoric between Moscow and Washington, European leaders say engaging the new US administration is a priority. Merz said he would 'advocate doing everything to keep the Americans in Europe.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevX1-hlTYelyI	2025-03-04T10:13:40-08:00	
Reality Confronts The Euro Ruling-Strata: ‘Through The Tear In Th...	They (the Euro-élites) don’t have a chance: 'If Trump imposes this tariff [25%], the U.S. will be in a serious trade conflict with the EU', the Norwegian Prime Minister threatens. And what if Brussels does retaliate? 'They can try, but they can’t', Trump responded. Von der Leyen has, however, already promised that she will retaliate. Nonetheless, the combined suite of the Anglo administrative forces is still unlikely to compel Trump to put U.S. military troops on the ground in Ukraine to protect European interests (and investments!). The reality is that every European NATO member – to varying degrees of self-embarrassment – admits publicly now that none of them want to participate in securing Ukraine without having U.S. military troops provide ‘backstop’ to those European forces. This is a palpably obvious scheme to inveigle Trump into continuing the Ukraine war – as is Macron and Starmer’s dangling of the mineral deal to try to trick Trump to recommit to the Ukraine war. Trump plainly sees through these ploys. The fly in the ointment, however, is that Zelensky seemingly fears a ceasefire, more than he fears losing further ground on the battlefield. He too, seems to need the war to continue (to preserve continuing in power, possibly). Trump calling time on the Ukraine war that has been lost has seemingly caused European elites to enter some form of cognitive dissonance. Of course, it has been clear for some time that Ukraine would not retake its 1991 borders, nor force Russia into a negotiating position weak enough for the West to be able to dictate its own cessation terms. As Adam Collingwood writes: 'Trump has torn a huge rip in the interface layer of the fantasy bubble … the governing élite [in the wake of Trump’s pivot] can see not just an electoral setback, but rather a literal catastrophe. A defeat in war, with [Europe] left largely defenceless; a de-industrialising economy; crumbling public services and infrastructure; large fiscal deficits; stagnating living standards; social and ethnic disharmony – and a powerful populist insurgency led by enemies just as grave as Trump and Putin in the Manichean struggle against vestiges of liberal times – and strategically sandwiched between two leaders that both despise and disdain them …'. 'In other words, through the tear in the fantasy bubble, Europe’s elites see their own demise …'. 'Anybody who could see reality knew that things would only get worse on the war front from autumn 2023, but from their fantasy bubble, our élites couldn’t see it. Vladimir Putin, like the ‘Deplorables’ and ‘Gammons’ at home, was an atavistic daemon who would inevitably be slain on the inexorable march to liberal progressive utopia'. Many in the Euro ruling-strata clearly are furious. Yet what can Britain or Germany actually do? It has quickly become clear that European states do not have the military capacity to intervene in Ukraine in any concerted manner. But more than anything, as Conor Gallagher points out, it is the European economy, circling the drain – largely as a result of the war against Russia – that is dragging reality to the forefront. The new German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has shown himself to be the most implacable European leader advocating both military expansion and youth conscription – in what amounts to an European resistance model mounted to confront Trump’s pivot to Russia. Yet Merz’s winning CDU/CSU achieved only 28% of votes cast, whilst losing significant voter share. Hardly an outstanding mandate for confronting both Russia – and America – together! 'I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the U.S., step by step', Friedrich Merz said. Second place in the German election was taken by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 20% of the national vote. The party was the top vote getter in the 25-45 year-old demographic. It supports good relations with Russia, an end to the Ukraine war, and it wants to work with Team Trump, too. Yet AfD absurdly is outcast under the ‘firewall rules’. As a ‘populist’ party with a strong youth vote, it becomes automatically relegated to the ‘wrong side’ of the EU firewall. Merz has already refused to share power with them, leaving the CDU as pig-in-the-middle, squeezed between the failing SPD, which lost the most voter share, and the AfD and Der Linke, another firewall outcast, which, like AfD, gained voter share, especially among the under-45s. The rub here – and it is a big one – is that the AfD and the Left Party, Der Linke (8.8%), which was the top vote getter in the 18-24 demographic, are both anti-war. Together these two have more than one third of the votes in parliament – a blocking minority for many important votes, especially for constitutional changes. This will be a big headache for Merz, as Wolfgang Münchau explains: 'For one thing, the new Chancellor had wanted to travel to the NATO summit this June, with a strong commitment to higher defence spending. And even though the Left Party and the AfD hate each other in every other respect, they agree that they won’t give Merz the money to strengthen the Bundeswehr. More important, though, is the fact that they won’t support a reform to the constitutional fiscal rules (the debt brake) that Merz and the SPD are desperate for'. The Rules are complicated, but in gist dictate that if Germany wants to spend more money on defence and aid to Ukraine, it had to be saved from elsewhere in the budget (most likely from social spending). But politically, saving on social spending to pay for Ukraine hasn’t played well with the German electorate. The last coalition failed on precisely this issue. Even with the Greens, Merz still will be short of the two-thirds majority necessary to make constitutional changes, and the ‘Centre’ just doesn’t have the fiscal space for challenging Russia without U.S. funding. Von der Leyen will try to ‘magic’ money for defence from somewhere, 'but German youth are voting against the Establishment parties who are hated. They can build a few Leopards if they want. They won’t get recruits'. Whilst the EU and Britain are proposing to raise billions to arm themselves against some imaginary Russian invasion, it will be done against the backdrop of Trump saying explicitly – on the threat of a Russian invasion of NATO – 'I don’t believe that; I don’t believe it, not one little bit'. Another Euro-shibboleth ripped by Trump. Thus, how will the European public, which has largely soured on the Ukraine war, react to higher energy costs and more tax and social service cuts, in order to pursue an unwinnable war in Ukraine? Starmer already has been warned that the (government debt) ‘bond vigilantes’ will react badly to yet more UK government debt as the fiscal situation wobbles precariously. There are no obvious solutions to Europe’s current predicament: It is, on one hand, an existential conundrum for Merz. And on the other, it is the same one that dogs the EU as a whole: To get anything done, a parliamentary majority is a basic necessity. The ‘firewall’, though primordially intended to protect the ‘Centrists’ in Brussels from Rightist ‘populists’, was subsequently turbo-charged in Brussels by Biden’s issuing of a foreign policy determination to all U.S. foreign policy ‘actors’ to the effect that populism was a ‘threat to democracy’ and must be contested. The practical outcome however, has been that across the EU, blocking coalitions were formed of odd (minority party) bed-fellows agreeing to keep the Centrists in power, but which rather has led to endless stasis and an ever increasing detachment from ‘we, the people’. Angela Merkel governed in this way, kicking the can of reform down the road for years – until the situation ultimately became (and still is) insoluble. 'Can another coalition of short-sighted centrists arrest the decline of the economy, fix the failure of leadership, and free the nation from its pernicious political trap? I think we know the answer', writes Wolfgang Münchau. There lies a bigger problem however: As Vance very explicitly warned at the recent Munich Security Forum, Europe’s enemy lies not with Russia; It lies within. It derives, Vance implied, from the fact of having a permanent bureaucracy, assuming to itself the exclusive prerogative of autonomous governing power, yet incrementally becoming ever-more remote from its own base. Tear down the firewalls, Vance advocated, in order to return to the (abandoned) principles of that earlier democracy originally shared between the U.S. and Europe. Implicitly, Vance is targeting the Brussels Administrative (Deep) State. The Eurocrats see in this new front an alternate American-supported attack on their Administrative State – and perceive therein their own demise. In the U.S., there is acknowledgement that there is an 'institutional resistance to Trump' in the DOD, DOJ and the FBI. It proves, Margot Cleveland argues, that those touting the need for 'institutional resistance' and the supposed independence from the executive branch, are the opponents to democracy – and to Trump. Given the close nexus between the U.S., the British and European Deep States, the question arises as to why there is such strong parallel resistance to Trump amongst European leaders also. Ostensibly, it is not in Europe’s interest to mount a concerted resistance against the U.S. President over a failed war. Is the European frenzy then fuelled by a wider (U.S.) Deep State desire to neuter the ‘Trump Revolution’ by demonstrating, in addition to the U.S. domestic opposition at home, that Trump is causing havoc amongst the U.S.’ European allies? Is Europe being pushed further down this path than they would otherwise have chosen to venture? For Germany to change course – albeit unthinkable for Merz – it would require only a minimal amount of imagination to envision Germany again linked to Eurasia. The AfD gained 20% of the vote on just such a platform. Really, there probably is little other option.

The Broken Trough: Trump’s Geopolitical Gamble And Its Consequenc...	Donald Trump’s presidency has ushered in a seismic shift in the geopolitical landscape, challenging the foundational perceptions Americans have held for generations. Since at least 1939, the United States has viewed the Soviet Union as an adversary, a rivalry rooted in ideological and strategic differences. The U.S. never recognized the Soviet annexation of the Baltic republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—as legitimate, reflecting a belief that the people of these nations did not willingly submit to Moscow’s rule. During World War II, the U.S. and the Soviet Union briefly aligned against the Axis powers, but this alliance unraveled shortly after victory, giving way to the Cold War. The Cold War saw the West and the Soviet Union, later transitioning into an authoritarian Russia, locked in a geopolitical rivalry punctuated by proxy conflicts across the globe. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point, scattering its republics into economic and social chaos. Western leaders, however, squandered this opportunity. Rather than swiftly integrating the former Soviet states into NATO’s protective umbrella, they hesitated, leaving a power vacuum that Russia would later exploit. Ukraine, arguably the most critical piece of the post-Soviet puzzle, remained outside the West’s orbit. To decisively dismantle the Soviet empire, absorbing Ukraine into the Western economic and political sphere was essential— without it, the notion of a Russian empire cannot truly endure. Yet the West, intoxicated by the Soviet collapse, underestimated Russia’s resilience. Fueled by soaring oil and gas revenues, the Russian Federation recovered with surprising speed, embarking on a mission to reassemble its lost dominion. Ukraine emerged as both a buffer zone for the West and a coveted prize, a linchpin in Russia’s imperial ambitions. The history has shaped generations of Russians who despise Western values, particularly those espoused by the United States. Russian culture mocks Americans as dim-witted and uncouth, coining the slur 'pindos' to encapsulate this scorn. Europe is dismissed as 'Gayropa,' a jab blending 'gay' and 'Evropa' to deride its liberalism. The war in Ukraine, launched in 2014, encapsulates this hostility. It is not a mere territorial dispute but a punitive campaign to subjugate Ukraine and erase its sovereignty. Russia stands as the unambiguous aggressor, while Ukraine fights for its survival as an independent nation. Previous U.S. administrations grasped this dynamic, though their responses often fell short. The Biden administration, for instance, provided military aid to Ukraine—enough to stave off collapse but insufficient to expel Russian forces. The result has been a brutal stalemate, now stretching into its third year, with neither side gaining decisive ground. Ukraine has become a relentless meat grinder for Russian troops, forcing Moscow to conscript North Korean soldiers, whom Ukrainian forces have systematically eliminated. Then comes Trump, whose stance defies decades of American foreign policy. For reasons unclear, he harbors disdain for Ukraine and an affinity for Putin’s strongman persona. He has muted criticism of Russia while flinging baseless accusations at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a dictator, a mediocre comedian, and a leader with a fabricated 4% approval rating. These were falsehoods, and many Republicans countered that Putin, not Zelenskyy, fits the dictator mold. As for the comedian label, Zelenskyy was regarded as one of the greatest entertainers in the entire post-Soviet space, not just Ukraine. Trump’s retort—that he never said such things—drew a wry nod to his MAGA — 'Make Amnesia Great Again' playbook, a jest at his penchant for rewriting his own words. His team has pushed a narrative of excessive U.S. spending on Ukraine, tossing out inflated figures like $350 billion or $500 billion, which are significantly higher than the amounts reported by the Pentagon and Ukrainian officials. In reality, U.S. support has been far more modest, and even at its highest estimates, it represents a bargain when weighed against the strategic goal of weakening a geopolitical rival. No American lives have been lost, much of the aid consists of outdated equipment slated for disposal, and a portion of the funds has bolstered the U.S. military through the production of new equipment. Yet Trump appears unswayed by this logic. He does not view Russia as an adversary, a stance that upends the post-1939 American worldview. His demand that Ukraine repay U.S. aid—a notion unsupported by any formal agreement—borders on the absurd. Why single out Ukraine, a nation locked in an existential struggle, when no such demands have been made of Iraq, Kuwait, or Afghanistan? Trump has cast himself as the 'Peacemaker-in-Chief,' insisting that both he and Russia desire peace. But his version of peace translates to a Russian victory, a capitulation that would reward aggression. This position clashes with a core tenet of American identity—enshrined in folklore, literature, comics, and films—where justice, the defense of the weak, and resistance to bullies reign supreme. Heroes like Captain America and Spider-Man embody this ethos, a cultural thread Trump’s policies unravel by siding with the oppressor. The fallout from Trump’s stance is unfolding in real time. His administration’s recent conduct—most notably the disgusting denigration of Zelenskyy during a meeting in the Oval Office—has left it scrambling to contain the damage. Claims that Zelenskyy was rude ring hollow against the backdrop of European leaders and unbiased observers who see Trump’s and Vance’s behavior as indefensible. This episode evokes a cautionary tale from Russian literature—Alexander Pushkin’s The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish. In it, an old woman’s insatiable greed leads her to demand mastery over the sea from a magical fish, only to find herself returned to poverty, staring at a broken trough. Trump, in his quest to play a 'world peacemaker' and tilt the geopolitical board toward Russia, has arrived at a similar fate. His administration sits amidst the wreckage of its own making, its credibility fractured. The administration’s promises of mineral deals, aid repayment, and future contracts have evaporated at least temporarily. Europe has rallied more firmly behind Ukraine, increasingly skeptical of America’s reliability as a global leader. The much-touted 'peace in 24 hours' has proven an empty boast, a punchline rather than a policy. The U.S. economy stumbles—Q1 GDP projections for 2025 have shrunk to -2.8%—and Trump’s tariff threats have failed to cow nations into submission. His conduct has estranged allies, and cozying up to Russia, a nation that loathes the U.S. to its core, strains credulity. Ukraine persists, its anthem defiantly proclaiming 'not dead yet,' though the path ahead is brutal. Every civilian death would mount a charge against Trump, who has withheld critical aid like Patriot missiles, tainting his image further. He placed the demand for an apology on one scale and the deaths of people fighting for their way of life on the other. Ukraine’s fight is not just for its own survival but for the principles that once defined American leadership—freedom, sovereignty, and resistance to tyranny. Trump’s pivot toward Russia threatens to rewrite this narrative, casting the U.S. as a bystander or worse, an enabler. The optics are dire, and Republican senators and congressmen may begin to distance themselves, unwilling to tether their political futures to this sinking ship. This rift foreshadows political peril. The Senate and House may slip from Trump’s grasp, echoing the impeachments of his first term. All of this could have been sidestepped had he confronted Russia alongside a united Western front. Instead, he chased a mirage of peace on Putin’s terms, landing at that broken trough. The broader implications are stark: the United States risks ceding its moral and strategic standing—a legacy built over generations—to a vision that elevates personal whims over principled policy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevcu88VfW9QRY	2025-03-04T10:08:43-08:00	
How Mesopotamia’s Urban And Industrial Revolution Started Politic...	Giorgio Buccellati's At the Origins of Politics takes readers to the early stages of a process that became the structure of modern life Archaeologist and scholar Giorgio Buccellati's book At the Origins of Politics describes how Mesopotamia's urban revolution in the late fourth millennium BC shaped a new mentality. The segmentation and specialization of industrial production required written recordkeeping, standardization of weights and measures, and surveying and allocation of land planning. This inherent logic of handicraft production and its related organization of trade and market exchange, especially with the palace and temple institutions, led to new forms of social interaction, with the state and its laws and religion consolidating the new managerial hierarchies. I met Buccellati in 1994 at the first of what would become a decade-long series of Harvard-based colloquia to compile an economic history of the Bronze Age Near Eastern origins of money and interest, land tenure, and its public obligations. Since these innovations were shaped largely by relations with the temples and palaces, our group started by focusing on just what it meant to be public or private. It was fairly clear what 'privatization' meant, but calling the palace or temples 'public' was problematic. Royal price schedules for grain, silver, and other key commodities applied only to transactions with these large institutions, which were corporately distinct from the rest of the economy where prices were free to vary. Hammurabi's laws focused on the relations between the palatial sector and the family-based economy on the land, which followed its own common law tradition for wergild-like personal offenses and other legal problems not involving the palace. How far beyond the palace did the state extend? Buccellati's paper focused on a broader philosophical idea of 'public' as referring to the overall system of social and economic organization: 'The dichotomy between public and private is coterminous with the origin of the city.'1 As he points out in At the Origins of Politics: 'The increased size of the settlements created a critical mass, whereby face-to-face association no longer was possible among each member of the social group.' The relationship was political. 'On the etymological level, the terms 'urbanism' and 'politics' are equivalent, given that they both derive from the word for 'city' in Latin and Greek respectively.' His term 'state-city' emphasizes the overall political and administrative context. He views industrialization as the economic dimension of the urban revolution that occurred in the late fourth millennium BC. The scale and social complexity of mining (or trading for metal) and metallurgy, beer-making, and weaving involved increasingly impersonal relationships as industrial organizations created products beyond the ability of individuals to make by themselves. The evolution was from direct personal contact to being part of a long, specialized chain. Describing this takeoff as the first Axial Age, Buccellati explains how economic and social relations had been transformed over the 50,000-year evolution from small Paleolithic groups to urban industrial production, trade, and property relations. The technology and administration of production transformed the character of labor and what Buccellati calls para-perceptual thought. The moral principles of mutual aid, group solidarity, protection of the needy, and basic rights to means of self-support were retained from pre-urban practice but were administered on the state level. 'The state was never able to eliminate or even ignore the people... political ideology became a way for the leadership to justify itself in front of the base,' bolstered by religious attitudes to popularize an 'Ideology of Control... the ideology of command, of leadership not necessarily based on coercive means.' Even in the face of 'ever-increasing gaps in prestige and economic ability,' the rhetoric of kingship promoted 'a sense of solidarity that transcends the limit of reciprocal face-to-face recognition.' For the king, the aim was to make 'submission not just tolerable but actually desirable.' That enabled Mesopotamian rule to be personal and indeed dynastic. 'The king was not just the most powerful private individual; he embodied a distinct organism.' Kings were described as serving heaven, as reflected in Hammurapi's stele depicting him presenting his laws to the god of justice, Shamash (or in some interpretations, receiving them from Shamash). 'The private model was thus superimposed from scratch on the public one,' merging the state and religion as every new king pointed to his ancestors as if this meant continuity of the law. The principle of kings being hereditary was accepted 'without ever being formulated in theoretical terms.' From Living in a State of Nature to a Stratified Managerial Order Buccellati describes production as evolving from interpersonal and small scale to institutional and large scale. He describes how Paleolithic hunters and gatherers met their needs by using what they found in nature. They napped flints to make spear points and cutting tools, and wove plant fibers to make clothing, baskets, and other artifacts, but these materials were as they found them. And personal wealth took the form of shells or other objects found in nature. However, the increasing complexity of industrial organization transformed the character of producers in that they ceased to have face-to-face relations with the users of the objects they made. Products evolved increasingly beyond objects found in nature, and also beyond the ability of single individuals to make them as they required chains of transformation via metallurgy and manufacturing. Although Buccellati does not focus on land tenure, money, and credit in this volume, his analytic schema of the transition from 'nature' to man-made institutional structures suggests how land and credit relations evolved along similar lines, from informal and spontaneous to formal and standardized. If there was an archaic relationship with the land, it was for an Indigenous tribe to claim territory as belonging to itself for hunting and gathering and for ceremonial or religious functions. Most exchange was domestic, taking the form of reciprocal gifts, often of the same food types simply as a means of binding groups together in the spirit of mutual aid. But artifacts were traded among Indigenous communities already in the Ice Age, from one tribal group to another, sometimes passed along over long distances. Gathering places for such exchange existed already in the Ice Age, often at river crossings or natural meeting points. These would have been seasonal sites, with chieftains responsible for keeping the lunisolar calendar to time when to travel to such spots. If anything, such gathering places were the opposite of the later city that Buccellati describes. The idea was to prevent any one group from dominating others or restricting territorial control. The result was akin to the amphictyonic centers of classical antiquity, neutral zones set aside from political cities and rivalries, with careful equality of participants as a condition for amicable relations. Deities often were trees, woods, or natural rock formations such as those that survived in Germanic religion into the first millennium of our era, and Japan's Shinto religion. Lunar and solar deities were part of an astronomical cosmology reflecting the rhythms of nature. By the Bronze Age, gods took on the role of patrons of social authority and justice as urbanization transformed the natural environment. Technology enabled the production of new shapes and 'artifacts that have no analogy in nature.' Mud bricks became standardized to build walls. 'Stone is no longer seen as an adaptation of pre-existing forms' but was shaped to produce new building structures. Fire played an important role in controlling the environment, not only to cook food but also to bake mud bricks and harden ceramics, and to refine metal from ores and make alloys such as bronze to produce tools, weapons, and other implements. The potter's wheel and spindles for weaving were developed, and a managerial class came into being as manufacturing such products required increasingly complex organization, from producers and traders to armies. The Neolithic agricultural revolution saw the standardization of land, allotted to community members in lots sufficient to support their families, with proportional obligations attached—obliging their holders to serve in the army and provide seasonal corvée labor on communal building projects. These obligations were what defined land tenure rights. That created a strict relationship with the emerging urban centers that transformed 'the village as it existed in prehistory... in the sense of autonomous villages that found an end in themselves. ... Agricultural or manufactured production did not have as its end point the village, but rather and especially the urban markets.' Rural villages became part of the city, and local conflicts were settled by traveling urban judges. Monetization of Exchange Between the Rural and Urban Centers Money evolved as part of the valuation dimension of exchange. Anthropologists studying surviving Indigenous communities have found that artifacts typically are valued for their rarity or lineage of ownership. In archaic times such objects were often buried with their wearers, having become part of their personal identity. In time, they took a proto-monetary signification of esteem. But it was in southern Mesopotamia that money became formalized as a measure of valuation, simultaneously for domestic agrarian and industrial exchange—mainly for grain and wool—and for foreign trade. In both cases, the palace and temples played a key role. A standardized measure of value was needed for the economy's own industrial and institutional functioning, not merely for personal decoration and status. Foreign trade was necessary to obtain raw materials not found in the region's river-deposited soil. Copper and tin were the key metals that were needed, the alloy of which gave its name to the Bronze Age (3500-1200 BC), but silver was adopted as the main measure of value for palace transactions and those of entrepreneurs, presumably because of its role in religious symbolism. Silver and other commodities were obtained by a mercantile class of entrepreneurs, whose major customers were the palace and temples, which also supplied most of the textiles being exported. The largest categories of debts and fiscal obligations were inter-sectoral, owed by citizens on the land and mercantile entrepreneurs to the palace sector and its temples. The seasonal character of agriculture made credit necessary to bridge the gap between planting and harvesting, to be paid on the threshing floor when the crop was in. Grain served as the main domestic agrarian measure of value and the medium for paying agrarian debts. The palace and temples integrated their economic accounts by setting the silver mina and shekel that denominated the value of commodities obtained in foreign trade (and consignments of what was exchanged for them) as equal to corresponding measures of grain, while dividing the relevant measures into 60ths to facilitate the allocation of food and raw materials based on the 30-day administrative month used by the large institutions. The resulting monetary system of account-keeping for credit and fiscal collection was part of a broader economic context in which standardized weights and measures were used to quantify and calculate the various magnitudes of the inputs required by the large institutions for producing commodities in their workshops, along with the amounts of the charges, fees, and rents payable to the institutions and fiscal collectors. The surplus grain rent paid to the large institutions supported dependent labor in the weaving and handicraft workshops. Commodities no longer were made by individual craftpersons known to the users, but by many, whose identities were institutional and hence collective and impersonal as far as the buyers or users were concerned. The workforce consisted largely of war widows and orphans, and also slaves captured from the mountains surrounding Mesopotamia. (A typical word for slave was 'mountain girl.') The textiles woven by this labor were consigned to merchants to act as intermediaries between the large institutions or the growing class of private estate holders and foreign purchasers. Interest charges (usually equal to the original loan value for consignments of five years) served as a means for consigners and backers to obtain their share of the gain that merchants were expected to make on their trade. Bucellati shows how the urban revolution's 'evolutionary process in motion' to transform society and with it 'the very nature of human existence.' The development of writing, for instance, had a deep effect in transforming thought processes, much as the creation of languages had served to 'externalize thought.' It enabled the communication of ideas to others without having to rely on memory. Originally used by the eighth millennium BC to oversee and quantify trade and exchange transactions, it came to be used for accounting and credit, and increasingly to preserve, arrange and order thoughts, public announcements, treaties, poetry, and laws. The written word became a new medium for thought. Buccellati describes this 'reification of thought' as part of the 'removal from nature.' That was part of the evolving uniformity that spread from the production of commodities to shape the overall social order. Debt Strains Lead Rulers to Protect Their Economies From Polarizing Industry and entrepreneurial foreign trade concentrated control and wealth in the hands of managers and 'big men.' Their economic gains caused a wealthy class to emerge, initially within the large institutions, with credit being used to pry labor away from palace control. Creditor claims on indebted cultivators accumulated, largely at the institutional level of landholders, merchant-creditors, and also ale-women, whose customers ran up tabs for their beer, to be settled at 'payday' on the threshing floor when crops were harvested. It was inevitable that strains would develop as a result of the rising role of credit and debt relations, especially in times of flooding or crop failure. As rent and other payment arrears and interest charges mounted up, private lending (often by royal or temple officials acting on their own account) became the major initial way to obtain the labor of debtors, by requiring them to work off their debts. That prevented cultivators from performing the stipulated corvée and military service that they owed in exchange for their land tenure rights. The result was a threefold conflict: first, creditors against debtors; second, creditors against the palace over the appropriation of labor via debt bondage; and third, the assertion of creditor power against traditional communal moral ideas of equity and mutual aid. Archaic communities traditionally sought to minimize economic inequality, perceiving much personal wealth as being achieved by exploiting others, above all by indebting them. By the third millennium, indebted cultivators faced the threat of being disenfranchised, losing their personal freedom and self-support land through foreclosure. As Buccellati observed in our 1994 colloquium royal protection of homesteaders, canceling the overgrowth of personal debt resulted 'more from a concern for the public domain than as a phenomenon of privatization.' Rulers from the third millennium BC onward protected palace claims on the labor of their citizens from being disrupted by debt strains of the type to which subsequent Western civilization has succumbed. Sumerian rulers made sure that these strains would not be permanent because that would have been at the expense of the palace's own requirements for corvée and military service from agrarian debtors. Buccellati pertinently notes that three main considerations shaped Near Eastern public laws: 'the concept of rules, the sense of justice, [and] the decisive moments in resolving conflict.' Hammurapi's 'code' was simply a collection of judgments, but his andurarum proclamations were enforced by the courts to cancel personal debts (but not mercantile debts), liberate bondservants (but not slaves), and redistribute self-support land (but not townhouses) that had been forfeited to creditors or sold under economic duress. These Clean Slates were the most basic royal administrative acts of Mesopotamian rulers from Sumerian times onward. They were the moral pillar of the state. The Mesopotamian State Solved the Debt Problem That Western Civilization Has Not Buccellati sees the transformation of production, economic control, and ways of perceiving and thinking about one's place in society as progressing toward a geopolitical peak with the Assyrian Empire. What enabled and made this sustained achievement so successful were royal laws to regularly restore economic balance on a system-wide level. Clean Slate proclamations prevented a creditor oligarchy from emerging to rival palace claims on the labor and crop surpluses of citizens on the land. In this respect, the distinction between financial and industrial gain-seeking—and the socially destructive character of usury and creditor self-interest—was recognized already in the third millennium BC in the Hymn to Shamash, the Akkadian god of justice (lines 103-106): What happens to the loan shark who invests his resources at the (highest) interest rate? He will lose his purse just as he tries to get the most out of it. But he who invests in the long term will convert one measure of silver into three. He pleases Shamash and will enrich his life.2 Buccellati rightly states that 'We are the heirs of Mesopotamian perception and political experience.' Modern civilization, however, has retrogressed from the Bronze Age Mesopotamian achievement of avoiding deepening financial and economic imbalance. He notes that modern society defines property as being alienable, but in the West securing property rights always has entailed the 'right' to forfeit it to creditors or sell under duress—irreversibly. That has been the case ever since Near Eastern commercial and credit practices were brought to the Aegean and Mediterranean lands in the first millennium BC. The West has adopted the basic economic practices invented in the fourth and third millennia BC, but not the economically protective measures that rulers took to annul the buildup of creditor claims to reverse the increase in debt bondage and loss of land by debtors. That decontextualization is what in my view makes the West 'Western.' Bronze Age Near Eastern practice was so different from the Western worldview that most modern historians resist recognizing and appreciating the relevance of the region's takeoff in the fourth and third millennia BC. Indeed, today's anti-state economic ideology denies that money and industrial enterprise could have been innovated by what Buccellati calls the state, that is, the palatial authority. This ideology obscures a great question posed for the West: How is it that Near Eastern 'divine kingship' achieved what Western democracy has failed to do: check the emergence of a creditor rent-seeking oligarchy, which in classical antiquity would strip the Greek, Italian, and other populations of their means of self-support that had formed the basis of economic liberty for the first 3,000 years of the Mesopotamian takeoff that this book so comprehensively describes.

Righteous, Confused And Unwilling: Europe’s Ukrainian Predicament...	There is something deeply moving about the ignorance and scatty nature of politicians. At points, it can even be endearing. In the apparently wide wake left by the mauling of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of the press at the Oval Office on February 28, backers of Kyiv’s war effort were wondering: What next? How do we prevent Ukrainian defeat at the hands of Russia? Having irresponsibly cuddled, coddled and insisted that Ukraine was in with more than a sporting chance to bloody and beat the clumsy Russian Bear that shows no signs of stepping down and hibernating, they now find themselves without a war sponsor in the United States. The previous US President Joe Biden had been more than willing to keep the war machine fed by proxy, furnishing Zelensky handsomely. The Washington war establishment purred, happy that Ukrainians were doing the dying and bleeding Russia’s soldiery white. Cant and righteousness were in abundant supply: the Ukrainians were foot soldiers wrapped in civilisation’s flag, democracy worn on their sleeves. Accusations from the Russian side that Ukrainian nationalism was also adulterated by a history of fascist inclination were dismissed out of hand. A country famously seized by kleptocrats, with a spotty, ill-nourished civil society, had been redrawn as a westward looking European state, besieged by the Oriental Barbarism of the East. If words of support could be counted as weapons, then Zelensky would have had a fresh arsenal in the aftermath of his tongue lashing by President Donald Trump and his deputy J.D. Vance. Much of these were provided by leaders gathered at Lancaster House on March 1 hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Starmer, for his part, promised that Europe would continue sustaining Ukraine’s efforts and, were a peace deal to arise, aid the country in improving its defences to ensure that 'Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself'. French President Emmanuel Macron tried to clarify any doubt that had arisen in the Oval Office savaging. 'There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.' The 'we' in this case, Macron went on to add, involved 'Americans, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese, and many others.' Germany’s Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz also declared that 'we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war', affirming that 'we stand with Ukraine'. The country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, thought it prudent to point out that the Oval Office brawl 'underlined that a new age of infamy has begun', adding that Russia would be withstood 'even if the US withdraws support, so that it [Ukraine] can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation'. Other leaders expressed supportive words of standing. Donald Tusk of Poland: 'Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not standing alone.' Spain’s Pedro Sánchez: 'Ukraine, Spain stands with you.' Canada’s Justin Trudeau: '[we] will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.' When they were not standing, many of these effusively supportive leaders were scrambling, teasingly suggesting a bloc of military support that may, somehow, be formed in the absence of US involvement. This would comprise the sillily worded 'coalition of the willing' (that expression, when used in 2003, saw the United States, UK and Australia, along with a motley collective, violate international law in invading Iraq). Such a coalition, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen dreamily envisaged, would transform Ukraine into a 'steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders'. This imaginatively foolish and recklessly irresponsible undertaking does little to patch up the irreplaceable role the US plays in a number of areas, not least the budgetary coverage of NATO, coupled with the promise for military intervention in the event a member state is attacked. Macron has, at stages, taken pot shots at NATO as cerebrally obsolete, a brain dead creature best be done away with. But these articulations, beyond such reports as NATO 2030, have not resulted in anything significant that would cope with an absentee US. European states, furthermore, are divided ahead of the March 6 summit, where the EU will supposedly approve some 20 billion euros for the purchase of missiles and air defence equipment for Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in a letter to European Council President António Costa, offered the view that the EU, 'following the example of the United States – should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine'. Slovakia’s Prime Minister, Robert Fico, was even harder in his response, suggesting that financial and military assistance to Kyiv could be refused were ceasefire efforts not pursued, rejecting such notions as 'peace through strength' being advocated by various EU members. It was also incumbent, Fico went on to insist, that any settlement 'explicitly include a requirement to reopen the transit of gas through Ukraine to Slovakia and Western Europe.' With this in mind, and the pressing, crushing implications of power, not as fantasy, but as coarsening reality, other options must be entertained. Given their lack of punch and prowess, one arising from years fed by the devitalising US teat, European states are simply playing with toy soldiers. Eventually, they will have to play along if peace in Ukraine, however much detested in its form, is to be reached.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevYt1sus-mdLf	2025-03-04T10:05:27-08:00	
India And EU Reconfigure Their Bilateral Relations – OpEd	On February 27 and 28, Ursula von der Leyen visited India with her team of Commissioners to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and representatives from key Ministries to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries, at a time when Trump is threatening his trading partners, including the EU and India, with reciprocal tariffs. Of course, at this moment, Trump has mainly focused on the war of exchanging economic ammunition through tariffs with China. China also announced tariffs on a range of agricultural products in response to the new U.S. tariffs. The Chinese Ministry of Finance stated on Tuesday, February 25, that it would impose additional tariffs of 10% to 15% on agricultural products ranging from soybeans and corn to dairy and beef. The German politician stated about the India-Belgium partnership: 'The competition among major powers is an opportunity.' The trip of the President of the European Commission aims to increase the European Union's cooperation with New Delhi in the following areas: trade, technology, security, defense, connectivity, and global cooperation. 'The aim is for this visit to mark the beginning of this new era,' said von der Leyen, while Indian Prime Minister Modi stated on his part: 'This Commission College mission to India is unprecedented, it is a historic visit. The EU and India have the potential to become one of the defining partnerships of this century.' With these words, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, opened the meeting in New Delhi in the presence of Indian Prime Minister Modi. 'India,' von der Leyen stated, 'is the largest democracy and will soon be among the top 4 largest economies in the world. It is the guiding voice of the Global South. The EU is a cross-border democracy and a unique open economy. The largest trading partner for 80 countries. This world is full of dangers. But I believe that this modern version of great power competition is an opportunity for the EU and India to revitalize their cooperation.' Regarding the three pillars (trade and technology, security and defense, connectivity and global cooperation), the President of the European Commission concluded: 'I want this visit to mark the beginning of this new era. Prime Minister Modi and I share the same view. It is time to advance our EU-India strategic partnership to the next level. We are fighting for our security and prosperity. For the common global challenges we must address. And for the benefit of our respective regions and our partners around the world. Over the past thirty years, we have achieved much together. But in reality, we have only scratched the surface of the potential that exists. So it is not the time to set limits on our cooperation, nor to remain stuck in seeking agreement on every regional or global issue. It is time to be realistic and ambitious and to redefine our priorities according to today's realities.' But what is the practical significance of these commitments for future cooperation between India and the European Union? For the President of the European Commission, India can serve as a bridge between the South and the European Union, between the Indo-Pacific and Europe, as it represents a stable cushion of certainty in an uncertain world. Europe, on the other hand, is ready to invest productively to contribute to the realization of the goal of connectivity with India. Through the Global Gateway (our global infrastructure worth 300 billion euros), Europe is set to invest in energy transfer projects throughout India and between India and the rest of the world. Von der Leyen presented her plans, stating that this is just the beginning of the connectivity-building project between India and Europe. According to the Chancellor, 'the India-Middle East-Europe corridor launched in New Delhi in 2023 during India's G20 presidency is a historic opportunity to be revitalized as it is a fantastic project. This corridor can be a modern 'Silk Road' directly connecting India, the Arabian Gulf, and Europe. With a future railway connection, exchanges between India and Europe will become 40% faster. Could this be a subtle response to Elon Musk's ambitious plan to connect New York to London in 25 minutes via a $20 billion hyper-tunnel? And to advance the cooperation, one of the wishes of the Commission's president is the possibility of creating a free trade agreement between the EU and India. 'I know well that it will not be easy,' admitted von der Leyen, 'but I also know that timing and determination matter, and that this partnership comes at the right time for both.' Additionally, she added her willingness to cooperate with India on semiconductors, clean technology, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and public digital infrastructure. By investing together in these technologies and building strong supply chains, the European Union and India can create a real advantage for us in today's global and competitive economy by drawing on each country's mutual capabilities and talents. It was precisely about free trade that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke next during the press conference with Ursula von der Leyen. 'We are working together with the European Union,' explained Modi, 'to finalize a free trade agreement by 2025: we agree to collaborate on semiconductors, artificial intelligence, iGmega computers, and 6G.' The Commission's College mission to India was described by the Indian Prime Minister as 'unprecedented, a historic visit.' It seems that the common ground underlying the India-EU strategic partnership is a shared belief in democratic values and respect for the citizen within a rule of law social capitalism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevfIGg4NdYvKo	2025-03-04T10:03:39-08:00	
Offshore Wind: TotalEnergies And Partners Inaugurate 640 MW Yunli...	During a ceremony held in Taipei, TotalEnergies and its partners announced the successful inauguration of the Yunlin offshore wind farm in Taiwan, which is now fully operational and generating renewable electricity at its planned capacity of 640 MW. A new milestone for TotalEnergies in Asia TotalEnergies holds a 29.46% stake in Yunneng Wind Power Co., Ltd., the joint venture responsible for the project. The other stakeholders include Skyborn Renewables with 31.98%, EGCO Group with 26.56%, and Sojitz with 12%. The development and construction of the Yunlin project were led by Skyborn with the support of the other partners. Following the Commercial Operations Date (COD), expected in June 2025, TotalEnergies will take the lead in technical operations management, whilst Skyborn Renewables will continue to lead other management services. 'We are very pleased to be inaugurating the Yunlin offshore wind farm, as we take a new step forward in our offshore wind development', said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President Renewables at TotalEnergies. 'This 640 MW project will help us achieve our 2025 targets for 35 GW of gross renewable capacity and over 50 TWh of net electricity production, amounting to 10% of TotalEnergies’ energy output. Our role as technical operator on Yunlin will allow us to strengthen our offshore wind competencies as we look ahead to our future projects in Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom', he added.In Asia, TotalEnergies owns a renewable energy portfolio (solar, wind, batteries) of over 23 GW gross, across all stages, from development to construction and operation. Of this capacity, 50% is already operational or under construction. One of the largest offshore wind farms in Taiwan The Yunlin offshore wind farm is located about 15 kilometers off the west coast of Taiwan, at water depths of up to 35 meters. The project consists of 80 wind turbines, each with 8 MW capacity. The electricity generated is fed into the Taiwanese grid and contracted to Taiwan Power Company (TPC) through two 20-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) at an average rate of $165/MWh. The Yunlin offshore wind farm produces 2.4 TWh of renewable electricity per year, powering over 600,000 Taiwanese households and reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 1.2 million tons.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevVmRQJ6_F6vh	2025-03-04T10:01:24-08:00	
US Troop Withdrawal: Can Indonesia And ASEAN Fill Security Vacuum...	The withdrawal of United States soldiers from South Korea would significantly impact regional security, economic stability, and diplomatic relations on the Korean Peninsula. Given the shifting power dynamics, increased collaboration among neighboring countries is essential. For instance, ASEAN and Indonesia could fill in the vacuum and play a pivotal role as mediators to help reduce instability and foster dialogue in the Korean Peninsula if the United States withdrew its troops from South Korea. The presence of the U.S military in South Korea has played a role in maintaining stability in the region ever since the Korean War era began in 1950. A substantial number of troops totaling up to 28,000 are currently deployed on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. presence acts as a deterrent against aggression from North Korea and is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of South Korea and its allies. This strategic significance is further underscored by escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, driven by China's growing influence and North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Conversely, discussions about the withdrawal of U.S. troops raise important concerns regarding security gaps, increased regional arms competition, and the future of diplomatic relations. In the year 2025, in the period of President Trump's second term in office, the U.S government requested that South Korea provide compensation for hosting U.S Armed Forces in the Korean Peninsula. Failure to meet these obligations would result in troop withdrawal by the United States, introducing uncertainty into the region's security and diplomatic situation. The primary security concern following the U.S. exit is the increased risk from North Korea's escalating threats in the region. Without U.S. forces stationed there, there would be less deterrence against aggression from Pyongyang and a greater chance of military escalation by the North Korean regime. North Korea has consistently advanced its missile and nuclear programs, with significant progress in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities in 2024. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea could create heightened security challenges for the country and potentially ignite an arms race among neighboring nations, including Japan, China, and Russia. Consequently, South Korea may need to increase its defense budget and military capabilities, which could strain its economy. The decision to withdraw tactfully could strain the relationship between the United States and South Korea as it has long been a source of security for South Korea, and any abrupt change in approach may raise doubts in Seoul about Washington's loyalty to its partners. This uncertainty may prompt South Korea to consider security options that could bring it closer to China. A diminished U.S. presence in the region could further enhance China's influence. Additionally, ongoing efforts to improve Korean relations and advance nuclear disarmament may be jeopardized. Without U.S. support, South Korea may struggle to negotiate effectively and could lose its leverage in discussions with North Korea. The potential impact of a U.S. retreat on the economy would be substantial, particularly because South Korea plays a significant role in the global economy. Any instability in South Korea could trigger global repercussions. Investor doubts might arise, leading to capital flight and market fluctuations. The absence of U.S. troops could create economic insecurity, affecting trade and investments not only in South Korea but also beyond its borders. ASEAN nations, which rely heavily on stable trade ties in the region, could also feel the effects. Disruptions in stability in South Korea could impact sectors such as electronics and automotive, given their connections with ASEAN countries and technology supply chains. The historical tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to impact its stability today. The Korean War never officially ended; instead, it paused with the 1953 Armistice Agreement, resulting in a fragile ceasefire. North Korea's pursuit of weapons and occasional provocations threaten regional peace. Despite diplomatic efforts, including meetings between the U.S. and North Korea, progress on denuclearization has been limited. Failed interactions have further heightened tensions, increasing the risk of conflict. Additionally, escalating tensions between South Korea and Japan, fueled by grievances and economic disputes, add further complexity to the security landscape. Potential conflicts may arise from various clashes. If the North Korean government were to collapse, shifts in alliances towards China or Russia could become significant factors to consider. In a worst-case scenario where U.S. troops are no longer present in the region, tensions between North and South Korea could escalate, especially if North Korea perceives their absence as an opportunity to provoke confrontation. Additionally, the collapse of the North Korean regime due to internal strife or external pressure might trigger a refugee crisis that would require global assistance to manage effectively. Furthermore, South Korea could find itself compelled to seek security assurances from China, which could alter the region's power dynamics. Despite these challenges, ASEAN has the opportunity to act as a stabilizing influence. With a history of diplomatic involvement through platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit, ASEAN's neutral stance allows it to foster dialogue among key players, including North and South Korea, as well as China and the United States. As a united entity, ASEAN holds the diplomatic power to reduce conflicts and promote peaceful resolutions. Indonesia occupies a significant role within ASEAN as a leading economy and a key member capable of spearheading various initiatives. Its historical interactions with North and South Korea as a respected mediator highlight its potential to facilitate diplomatic engagements between the two nations. Indonesia's previous efforts in hosting peace dialogues and its active participation in denuclearization talks demonstrate its ability to positively influence negotiations and reduce tensions, leveraging its position as an aligned nation. To effectively prevent conflicts, strategies such as organizing discussions, utilizing discreet diplomatic channels, and promoting economic collaboration among nations can be considered. One way ASEAN can enhance stability is by strengthening connections among neighboring regions to lessen the need for dependence and establish financial motivations for peace-building efforts. Moreover, encouraging conversations between North and South Korea via ASEAN-led platforms may nurture trust and collaboration. Furthermore, supporting nonaligned defense partnerships could aid in maintaining a power structure in the area without triggering tensions. In conclusion, the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from South Korea presents security, political, and economic challenges. Their absence could empower North Korea, strain alliances, and disrupt economic stability. However, ASEAN countries, particularly Indonesia, can help mitigate these risks by serving as neutral intermediaries. South Korea needs to strengthen its defense capabilities, ASEAN should enhance institutional frameworks, and the global community must support regional stability through diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation. Ensuring the security of the Korean Peninsula is vital for overall stability, and ASEAN plays a crucial role in fostering lasting peace and harmony in the region.

Ancient Sacrifice Fuels Modern Global Justice – OpEd	(UCA News) -- In the heart of one of Sao Paulo's favelas, Sister Maria Oliveira ladles steaming feijoada into bowls for hundreds of hungry families. Her soup kitchen, Projeto Esperança (Project Hope), represents a powerful transformation of Lenten tradition into social action. 'Empty stomachs can fuel either despair or action,' she says. 'We chose action.' From Ancient Roots to Modern Activism The 40-day Christian season of Lent, dating back to the 4th century, has historically been marked by prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. This ancient practice mirrors similar periods of spiritual discipline across faith traditions — from Ramadan in Islam to periods of austerity in Buddhism and Hinduism. What began as personal spiritual purification has evolved into a catalyst for collective social transformation. According to religious historian Dr. Teresa Berger of Yale Divinity School, 'Lenten practices have always contained seeds of social justice. The early Church fathers emphasized that true fasting meant sharing bread with the hungry, not merely abstaining from food.' In Brazil, Sister Oliveira's community transformed this ancient tradition of Lenten fasting into a sustained campaign for food security. 'Each meal we forgo funds a community kitchen that now feeds 200 families in our favela,' she explains, demonstrating how spiritual sacrifice can manifest as tangible social change. Global Reverberations This reimagining of ancient spiritual practices has sparked similar movements worldwide. In Manila's Tondo district, the 'Voices of Lent' movement united Catholic churches, Muslim communities, and secular organizations to address housing violations. Their shared 40-day commitment to amplifying stories of the urban poor forced local authorities to confront long-ignored issues. The movement has gained momentum in environmental activism. In Germany, the Catholic relief agency Misereor launched its 2024 Lenten campaign with a stark message: 'The Amazon is bleeding.' According to Misereor's annual report, by partnering with the Munduruku people, the initiative channeled Lenten donations into legal battles against illegal gold mining. Their efforts contributed to a significant victory when the European Union banned gold imports linked to Amazon deforestation in March 2024, according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. In South Korea, the Catholic Climate Movement redefined sacrifice during Lent when more than 50,000 households slashed energy use by 40%. According to a report published by the Korean Catholic Climate Action Network, their 'Carbon Fast,' tracked via a mobile app, pressured Seoul's government to accelerate emissions targets, the Korea Herald reported in April last year. Meanwhile, in Paris, climate group Alternatiba's 40-day Lenten vigil outside TotalEnergies' headquarters influenced shareholders to scale back Arctic drilling plans, as reported by Le Monde on April 3, 2024. The Catholic Church's Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace The Catholic Church's global Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace represents one of the most significant institutional efforts to harness this ancient tradition for contemporary challenges. Established by Pope Paul VI in 1967, this worldwide initiative has evolved from simple almsgiving to addressing systemic causes of poverty and conflict. In India, the campaign has taken on distinctive characteristics, reflecting the country's unique challenges. According to Caritas India's 2023 annual report, their '40 Days for Life and Dignity' campaign mobilized over 600 parishes across 12 states to address food insecurity and religious discrimination. In Kerala, the campaign funded sustainable agriculture initiatives that helped 3,000 small-scale farmers transition to organic methods, while in Jharkhand, it supported legal aid for indigenous communities facing displacement. Father Thomas D'Souza, Director of Caritas India, noted: 'Our Lenten campaign is not simply about charity but about transforming unjust structures. We ask people not just to give up luxuries but to give up indifference.' The campaign raised approximately 120 million rupees (approximately $1.5 million) during Lent 2023, with 85% going to domestic programs and 15% to international solidarity efforts, Indian Catholic Matters reported in May 2023. Globally, the Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace has established enduring institutions in over 100 countries. In El Salvador, it supports cooperatives founded during the civil war that now provide livelihoods for thousands. In Rwanda, it funds reconciliation programs bringing together perpetrators and survivors of genocide. According to the Pontifical Council Cor Unum's 2023 report, the campaign raised over €500 million (US$524.6 million) globally, representing one of the largest faith-based humanitarian initiatives in the world. Transformative Power in Conflict Zones The transformation of Lenten practices has proven particularly powerful in conflict zones. In Ukraine, Orthodox priests reimagined the traditional fast as a platform for peacebuilding. Father Dmitri Kovlov's 'Breaking Bread, Building Peace' initiative brings together divided communities for dialogue. 'In times of war,' he says, 'our Lenten sacrifice must be our prejudices, not just our food.' The Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s news site, Religiyna Pravda, reported that over 50 communities participated in these reconciliation meals during Lent 2024 The movement has even influenced corporate behavior. In Germany, the 'Corporate Conscience Campaign' documented by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last year saw business leaders commit to 40 days of ethical business practices and worker-centered policies, resulting in improved labor relations and increased social responsibility investments. Embodied Sacrifice Perhaps most striking was the impact in the Philippines, where Lent 2023 brought significant change to Negros Occidental. For 40 days, 200 farmers lived on coconut water and rice gruel, their bodies becoming living testimonies to injustice. According to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, their demand for the return of ancestral lands seized by sugar barons succeeded, with the government redistributing 1,200 hectares by Easter. In Kenya, the 2024 '40 Days of Mourning' campaign transformed Lent into a powerful statement against gender-based violence. After a tragic January saw 45 women murdered, Catholic nuns and Muslim leaders launched nightly vigils outside courthouses. The Nation newspaper at the time reported that their persistent protests pressured President Ruto to fast-track a Family Protection Bill, imposing life sentences for femicide. Even in Haiti's challenging conditions, Lent inspired creative solutions. The Church's '40 Days of Light' campaign distributed 15,000 solar lamps in gang-controlled Port-au-Prince, funded by meals forgone during the Lenten fast. 'No electricity? We became the light,' youth coordinator Jean-Paul Desrosiers, was quoted in The Miami Herald's coverage of the initiative. Digital Amplification and Lasting Impact The digital age has amplified these voices of hope. The '#40DaysOfJustice' social media campaign connected activists across continents, from indigenous rights defenders in Bolivia to anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, sharing daily testimonies of challenges and transformation. According to an April 2024 report by the World Council of Churches, the campaign reached over 10 million people across six continents. While critics argue these Lenten campaigns risk reducing justice to a seasonal trend, 2024's movements have shown signs of endurance. Germany's Misereor now funds year-round Amazon legal defense, while Kenya's anti-femicide coalition maintains monthly vigils. In Sao Paulo, Sister Oliveira's kitchen continues beyond the Lenten season, embodying her belief that 'Easter is not an endpoint. It is a promise that sacrifice can spur resurrection — in our streets, not just our souls.' Conclusion: Ancient Wisdom, Contemporary Power These diverse initiatives demonstrate how ancient spiritual practices can illuminate paths toward justice and renewal in our fragmented world. The 40-day Lenten journey — with roots stretching back 16 centuries — continues to evolve, offering a powerful template for sustained social engagement in an age of fleeting attention spans and ephemeral activism. What makes these Lenten-inspired movements particularly effective is their integration of spiritual discipline with social action, personal transformation with systemic change. The ancient wisdom of deliberate sacrifice creates space for deeper reflection on structural injustice while the time-bound nature of the season provides urgency and focus. As Lent continues to be reimagined across different contexts and cultures, it reveals the enduring power of ancient spiritual practices to inspire, sustain, and amplify movements for justice. In an era when activism often struggles to maintain staying power, these movements demonstrate that ancient wisdom, when creatively reinterpreted, can provide both the spiritual resources and practical frameworks needed to nurture lasting social transformation.

Will The US Leave NATO? Officials Push Back Against Rising Doubts...	By Rikard Jozwiak (RFE/RL) -- We’ve been here before -- declaring NATO dead or dying. Recently, U.S. Republican Senator Mike Lee posted on X, saying: 'It’s time to leave NATO and the UN.' Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, responded simply: 'I agree.' While officials in Brussels and elsewhere note that Musk often shares political opinions on his platform, X, without necessarily shaping U.S. policy, some observers acknowledge his access to Trump and his informal influence in certain conservative circles in Washington, D.C. Still, NATO officials at their Brussels headquarters have remained surprisingly calm so far. Their answer to whether the alliance’s demise is imminent is still a resounding 'No' for two reasons: the gap between rhetoric and action; and the difference between NATO allies and NATO aspirants – notably Ukraine. U.S. Wants Greater Defense Spending Take the first reason. As recently as last week, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to NATO’s mutual defense clause, Article 5, in remarks alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That stance was reiterated multiple times -- both publicly and privately -- by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels in February. While he firmly insisted that European allies must significantly increase their defense spending, everyone I spoke to described the discussions as constructive. 'He never left the room, listened, asked questions, and took notes -- not the behavior of an ally about to quit,' one NATO ambassador told me. And in that vein, NATO diplomats continue to navigate the constant speculation. 'We need to decipher what it all means, said one senior official. 'But we’ve also learned that we should ignore the noise and look at actions. It’s a sort of ‘strategic patience’ we must practice.' Ukraine's Uncertain NATO Path Ukraine, however, is a different matter. 'The Ukraine track has changed, but not the NATO track. They’ve been pretty tough on Ukraine but remain committed to NATO,' one alliance ambassador observed. The shift in tone toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy is one clear example, but Britain’s new role in coordinating arms deliveries to Ukraine is another indicator. It’s also evident that Ukraine won’t be joining NATO anytime soon -- though, in truth, it was the Biden administration that blocked Kyiv’s membership at recent NATO summits, much to the quiet relief of some Western European countries. The new U.S. administration is just more blunt about it. What countries on NATO’s eastern flank are now asking is whether American troops will remain stationed there. For now, the answer is yes, though many acknowledge concerns about an impending review of U.S. troop levels in Europe. But if these countries are attacked by Russia, will U.S. forces come to their aid? The prevailing belief is that they will. but Article 5 of the NATO treaty depends on both allies and adversaries believing it will hold. As one Eastern European official put it: 'It’s like Schroedinger’s cat -- it exists in both states, alive and dead, until the box is opened. In NATO’s case, until Article 5 is actually tested, we won’t really know.' Rikard Jozwiak is the Europe editor for RFE/RL in Prague, focusing on coverage of the European Union and NATO.

Rebuilding Trust In China’s Food Safety System – Analysis	By Lei Liu and Meilin Tang A food scandal has rocked China, following a report from state-backed media The Beijing News on 2 July 2024, which revealed that Hopefull Grain & Oil Group and China Grain Reserves Oil and Fat had used fuel trucks to transport edible oils without undergoing a mandatory cleaning process for years. The government reacted rapidly, initiating joint investigations, detaining the truck owner and drivers and launching a nationwide rectification campaign towards edible oil transportation. Still, the event evoked harsh criticism and extensive anxiety over China’s food safety. The Chinese government has long been struggling with food safety issues. In 2009, China enacted its Food Safety Law, followed by amendments in 2015, 2018 and 2021. Since 2016, China has been committed to implementing a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for food safety violations and established two national networks to monitor food contamination risks and food-borne illnesses. According to the 2024 ‘Research Report on Food Safety Status in China’, the pass rate for food sampling inspections remained above 97 per cent from 2019–23. But public trust in food safety remains low. A survey conducted by Jiangnan University in 2022 showed that only 47.2 per cent of respondents were satisfied with local food safety, though 59.4 per cent expressed confidence in prospects for future changes to food safety procedures. The oil scandal has once again pushed China’s food safety issue to the forefront. Now the concern is not only coming from the Chinese public, but also the international community given China’s recent visa-free policies attracted 8.54 million international tourists in the first half of 2024, a 190.1 per cent increase from 2023. The sense of insecurity regarding China’s food system could undermine the willingness of tourists to travel to China. China’s food safety problem has also severely damaged the international reputation of Chinese food businesses and sparked concerns about the loss of competitiveness for food exports. China’s food safety problem primarily lies in its weak regulatory enforcement. Complex food supply chains and the emergence of internet-based sales platforms call for cross-departmental, cross-level and cross-regional regulatory enforcement, which remain lax and clumsy. Inadequate punishments for food safety violations incentivise producers to produce and sell non-compliant food as the benefits of violating safety laws exceed the costs. Corruption is also a significant challenge. There have been numerous reports of canteen contractors and school principals colluding to provide poor quality food to students. The framework of co-regulation with businesses and the public remains underdeveloped, which weakens regulatory oversight. Beijing must urgently implement concrete solutions to regain the public’s trust in food safety measures. The government must improve its enforcement capacity to respond effectively to public outrage in the wake of food safety scandals. Mainstream media channels, especially official ones, must take the lead in providing accurate and timely information to minimise the spread of inaccurate information on social media during food crises. Administrative procedures for official media responses should be simplified to improve the efficiency of communication with the public. Stakeholders outside government must also improve public communication channels. Businesses should establish or support non-profit public information centres that provide science-based food safety information. China can also leverage social media by creating portals for reporting food safety problems to foster public awareness and participation. China must also strengthen its whistleblower protection system and raise rewards for reporting violations. The government must also fix loopholes and weaknesses in its food safety management system. China should expand nationally unified standards and align them to international benchmarks. Though China has issued 1610 entries of food safety standards — covering over 340 food types — several problems remain, including relatively low standards, an incomplete food classification system and insufficient mandatory standards. More severe punishments should be imposed on businesses for food safety violations. China should implement a risk-based rating mechanism and system to allocate regulatory measures with different intensities based on comprehensive assessments of businesses’ risk levels according to factors such as business characteristics, random inspection records and regional attributes. Beijing must strengthen cross-regional supervision. With the development of retail food markets, especially food e-commerce, production and consumption of food products increasingly involve multiple jurisdictions. Data sharing platforms and joint law enforcement mechanisms between different regions are necessary to enable a more coordinated response to food safety risks and curb the challenges of administrative division. China has one of the most advanced information technology systems in the world, which could be more extensively employed to empower food safety regulation by integrating online and offline regulation and facilitate fast information dissemination and transparent state–citizen interaction.

Greenland And The US: Will Trump’s Arctic Vision Prevail? – Analy...	By Prithvi Gupta Over the recent weeks, the United States’ (US) President Donald Trump has expressed his imminent interest in purchasing Greenland, a self-governed island of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated that Greenland is critical for American national and economic security and, therefore, should be made a part of the US. This idea was met with scepticism from the Greenlanders, mainland Danes, and Europeans, who viewed it as expansionist and imperial, with the Danish Prime Minister (PM) Mette Frederiksen stating that her country is not for sale. This article analyses the geoeconomic and strategic rationale of Trump’s Greenland bid for preserving and furthering US national and economic security and forecasts plausible scenarios for the future. Strategic and geoeconomic rationale In the initial days of Trump’s Greenland bid, the Europeans assumed that the idea of purchasing Greenland was nothing more than a pressure tactic at securing increasing access to the Arctic island’s mineral resources, and expanding US military operations in the critical region, where China and Russia have increased their naval activities—military or otherwise. However, since January 2025, after a call between the Danish PM Mette Frederiksen and President Trump, the Danes have been in crisis mode as President Trump made his administration’s views clear on the strategic necessity of the island being a part of the US. This is not the first time the US has endeavoured to purchase Greenland from Denmark. A closer look at US history delineates the precedent of purchasing foreign land amid geopolitical turmoil and upheaval. For instance, after its loss in the Crimean War, Russia sold Alaska to the US in 1867 for US$ 8.2 million; the US and Russia shared hostility towards the erstwhile British Empire—then a dominant naval power in the Indian and Pacific Oceans—whom Moscow and Washington wished to counter. This was Washington’s first foray into the Arctic. Since then, different US administrations have proposed purchasing Greenland in 1867, 1910, 1946, 1955, 2019, and finally, 2025. Recently, the Arctic imperative has found increasing political support in Washington, especially after the 2022 Russian aggression in Ukraine. The reasons for Trump’s interests in the Arctic can be assessed as related to security, great power calculations, and geoeconomics. Security rationale As the Russian-Ukraine crisis gathered momentum, Finland and Sweden also joined the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in 2023 and 2024, respectively, making all the Arctic members (except Russia) NATO members. Besides, Russia’s civilian and military nuclear facilities in the Arctic increased from 62 to 81 between 2021 and 2025 and are poised to cross 110 by 2035. These bases are host to nuclear-powered missiles, submarines, and other nuclear weapons—ranging from the Burevestnik missiles to the Poseidon torpedos. These bases are also testing grounds for Russian nuclear military equipment. Due to these developments, Moscow is the dominant military power in the Arctic. Russian territory includes over 50 percent of the Arctic coastline and has 22 military bases along the Arctic coast as opposed to NATO’s 20, of which 11 belong to Norway. Notably, Greenland hosts the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, a US military installation key to missile early warning and defence and space surveillance. Countering Russia’s military and nuclear expansion in the Arctic can be one of the security reasons for President Trump’s Greenland bid. Geoeconomic security Greenland is also strategically located along two potential shipping routes: the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route. These routes are currently untraversable due to the treacherous terrain, weather, and ice. However, as commercial traffic in the Arctic Ocean increases, these routes will be important for global and regional trade. Greenland is strategically positioned to benefit from the comprehensive marine infrastructure required to operationalise and control these routes and assist in emergency management, prevention, and response in the Arctic. Today, 500 ships undertake multiple voyages in the Arctic annually, a 37-percent increasebetween 2013 and 2023. Besides geostrategic location vis-à-vis shipping routes, Greenland's natural resources may have also piqued President Trump’s interest. Greenland’s rare-earth minerals (REMs) allows the US to reduce its reliance on China, which dominates the global critical minerals supply chains. Greenland possesses vast deposits of lithium, graphite, yttrium, and cobalt—all essential for manufacturing batteries, wind and solar technologies, and advanced military equipment. Greenland also possesses massive unexplored off-shore oil and gas reserves and abundant, undepleted fisheries, which weigh into the Trumpian calculations, as well. Access to the Arctic routes and Greenland’s abundant natural resources can be pivotal to the US trade and economy and may constitute President Trump’s Greenlandic calculations. Great power calculations Additionally, China, which views itself as a ‘near-Arctic’ state, has increased military and economic cooperation in the Russian Arctic. Sino-Russian joint coastal guard and military exercises and investments along the Russian Arctic in logistics and energy infrastructure through the Polar Silk Road framework culminated in the establishment of a joint Russia-China Arctic sub-governance and cooperation mechanism to oversee all economic and political cooperation. Chinese investments in the Russian Arctic total US$ 90 billion, cementing the Russia-China econo-security partnership in the Arctic. It is plausible that the Greenland purchase is intended to form a bulwark of resistance against the Chinese and Russians in the Arctic. Domestic resistance is reduced by the current political situation in US legislation and executive bodies. As the Trump-led Republican party now controls the US House of Representatives, the US Senate and the White House, legislating and executing a Greenland purchase is a surmountable task for the 47th President of the United States (POTUS). In fact, on 14 January 2025, in the US House of Representatives, a Republican Representative from Tennessee, Andy Ogles, led several of his Republican colleagues in introducing the ‘Make Greenland Great Again (MGGA) Act’, which would direct the US Congress to support President Trump’s negotiations with Denmark in acquiring Greenland immediately. Following the approval of this Act, the POTUS can formally proceed to negotiate the Greenland purchase. Plausibility and scenarios Among other plausible turnouts, four future scenarios seem likely. As President Trump has not ruled out economic and military force to annex Greenland as a US territory, there is the possibility that he will impose tariffs and sanctions on Denmark’s trade with the US. It is notable that Denmark is part of the European Economic Community (EEC) and that there will be a ripple effect of any potential US sanctions on Denmark. Main Danish exports to the US include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technologies. Another possibility, which seems highly unlikely yet plausible, is that Trump invades Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally, and any military action by the US will damage the transatlantic alliance beyond repair, reaping benefits for China and Russia. The third plausibility is that President Trump simply loses interest in the Greenland bid and pauses after Denmark commits to meet the NATO obligations in the Arctic and upgrades the Greenlandic defence infrastructure to adequate standards. There is speculation that this is the latent aim behind President Trump’s Greenland bid. The last plausible scenario, which is a long-term one with many hiccups along the road, is that Greenland gains independence from Denmark and establishes closer ties with the US. Currently, Denmark provides US$ 600 million worth of subsidies to the Greenlanders, which is 50 percent of the Greenland government’s annual budget. Before gaining independence, Greenland needs to fix its economy. Conclusion 2025 does not mark the first instance where Washington has proposed a Greenland purchase, thereby giving precedent to President Trump’s bid. Although his transatlantic allies ridicule this idea, Trump’s bid displays the growing geopolitical and economic importance of the Arctic region in global affairs.. Trump’s bid may be rooted in strategic, economic and great-power delineations; purchasing Greenland is still an uphill task. The idea’s feasibility depends on Danish resistance, US political will, and Greenland’s fiscal self-sufficiency. The Arctic’s future hinges on these unfolding dynamics.

Afghanistan: Weakening Regime – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh The ‘political landscape’ of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan is in increasing turmoil. A deep divide has emerged between the Kandahari group led by Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada and the Haqqani Group led by Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Haqqani Group also includes Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar and Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai. These three – Haqqani, Baradar and Stanikzai – are among the most prominent Taliban leaders after Akhundzada. Indeed, at the time of writing two of these three top leaders of the Haqqani Group – Sirajuddin Haqqani and Abbas Stanikzai – have left the country and are currently residing in United Arab Emirate (UAE). There were rumours of disaffection around Baradar’s absence as well, since it overlapped with Haqqani and Stanikzai’s, but he has returned to Kabul. The first to leave the country was Stanikzai who openly challenged Akhundzada, calling his decision to ban girls' education and other restrictions on women his 'personal choice'. He stated on January 18, 2025, Today, we are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a total population of 40 million. We have stripped them of all their rights by closing the doors to schools and universities for them, giving them away as compensation in personal disputes, and preventing them from choosing their husbands. Are we truly following Sharia? … The path we are currently following is guided by personal choice, not Sharia... We call on the leadership of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban] to make education accessible to everyone. He added, Follow him [Akhundzada], but not to the extent that, God forbid, you grant him the rank of prophethood or divinity. If you [Akhundzada] deviate even a step from God's path, then you are no longer my leader, I do not recognize you. Stanikzai went on to add that the world was critical of the Taliban's curbs on women and 'this is precisely the problem' that they have with the Afghan government, which has not been officially recognized by any country, primarily because of the regime's treatment of the female population. Stanikzai has been opposing the policy of restricting women rights for long, but this was the first time that he openly challenged Akhundzada. Ibraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group’s South Asia program, noted that Stanikzai had periodically made statements calling girls’ education a right of all Afghan women. Bahiss added, 'However, this latest statement seems to go further in the sense that he is publicly calling for a change in policy and questioned the legitimacy of the current approach.' Days later Stanikzai fled the country to escape an arrest warrant and travel ban imposed by Akhundzada. Stanikzai who was to be arrested and tried in a military court, managed to escape as Afghanistan Defence Minister, Mullah Yaqoob, a key Stanikzai ally, had intervened to facilitate his safe departure and arranged for his travel to Dubai. Stanikzai claimed, however, that he was travelling to the UAE because of health issues. Sirajuddin Haqqani is also in the UAE. According to a United Nations Security Council statement issued on January 22, 2025, Haqqani was granted a travel exemption to perform Umrah in Saudi Arabia between January 23 and February 3. However, sources indicate that he has not returned, despite the expiration of the United Nations travel exemption. Haqqani left the country amid reports that Akhundzada had curtailed his powers, leading to a deep divide between the two. Akhundzada had stripped the Ministries of Defence, Interior and the General Directorate of Intelligence of the powers to distribute weapons, ammunition and military equipment. As per the directives, Akhundzada, was to decide on all distribution of military equipment. It was claimed that Akhundzada made this decision after Sirajuddin Haqqani distributed quantities of weapons among his supporters in the eastern provinces. Confirming the new decree, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid stated on November 8, 2024, that the decree was issued with the aim of 'proper management and security of weapons' and to prevent the 'misuse' of military equipment. More importantly, Khalil Rahman Haqqani, a senior Afghan Taliban figure and Acting Minister of Refugees and Repatriation and his three bodyguards were killed in a suicide blast in the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation compound in Kabul on December 11, 2024. Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the Haqqani network, and was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current leader of the Haqqani network and the Taliban Interior Minister. Privately, most Haqqani supporters accused his rivals in the Taliban of ordering his assassination. Haqqani’s visit to the UAE was publicized by the Taliban on January 22, but little was disclosed about its purpose. However, Jilani Zwak, an Afghan journalist, noted that the UAE had been playing a unique intermediary role in Taliban-United States (US) relations. Zwak argued, 'I don’t think this trip was about Afghanistan’s relations with the UAE. It was more about Afghanistan’s relations with the United States – and more specifically, the Haqqani network’s ties with Washington. The UAE has served as a mediator between the Taliban and the US.' Significantly, Mohammad Asif Siddiqui, a former deputy chairman of Afghanistan’s Senate, had earlier claimed that senior Taliban figures currently outside Afghanistan were working to undermine Akhundzada’s authority: 'These figures – Haqqani, Baradar, and Stanikzai – are all in the UAE and Qatar… Qatar, which played a key role in bringing the Taliban to power, is now pressuring foreign powers to push for a leadership change within the Taliban.' It is not a coincidence that Stanikzai, on January 4, 2025, had praised the then US President-elect Donald Trump as a 'decisive and courageous' person. He had stated, 'One or two weeks from now, he [Trump] will come to power. He should change his policy, abandon Biden’s policy, and create a new approach. From Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate’s side, the path is open for them. If they intend friendship, we will extend a hand of friendship as well. An enemy does not remain an enemy forever, and a friend does not remain a friend forever.' Meanwhile, the third prominent leader of the group Abdul Ghani Baradar Abdul Ghani Baradar, returned to Kabul ahead of schedule, cutting short a UN-approved travel exemption that allowed him to stay in Qatar till March 3, 2025, for medical treatment. He had left Afghanistan on February 9, but attended a ceremony in Kabul on February 20, to inaugurate several development projects. Indeed, the Kandahari faction’s rigidity on the strict implementation of regressive Sharia laws across the country has created a deep divide within the Taliban. The Ultra-conservative Kandahari group and the ‘moderate’ Haqqani group have been at loggerhead, and speculation is rife that the Haqqani Group is trying to remove Akhundzada. Moreover, the Akhundzada group’s policies have pushed a large proportion of the population away from the regime. On July 24, 2024, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) survey report, based on interviews of 888 women in 33 provinces and 64 men in 14 provinces, noted that only four per cent of Afghans want the Taliban government to be internationally recognized. The survey also found that only two per cent of women reported having 'good' or 'full' influence over decision-making processes in their communities, compared to 18 per cent of men. 64 per cent of women said they 'never' felt safe when alone at home, while only two per cent of men felt secure when leaving home with a female family member. These developments have enormously compounded the Taliban’s problems. Overall fatalities which had fallen from 1,653 in 2022 to 501 in 2023, increased to 856 in 2024, an increase of 70.85 per cent. 2025 has already recorded at least 137 fatalities (data till March 2). Two of the principal challengers to the Taliban regime – the resistance forces and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) – remain potent threats. The National Resistance Front's military activities started in August 2021 when the Taliban attacked us in the Panjshir Valley [in northern Afghanistan]. Since then, we have been resisting them. We started from two provinces in the north, yet now we have networks and operations in almost 20 provinces after three years of expansion. Our operations at the moment are unconventional and mostly guerrilla operations. Yet, the military wing of the National Resistance Front is based inside Afghanistan, our bases, and our commando units are all in the country, and… we are increasing our recruitment and operational capacity. The National Resistance Front (NRF) which initiated the onslaught against the Taliban regime in August 2021 itself - the Taliban returned to power on August 15, 2021 - still remains the biggest challenge for the Taliban regime. According to Institute for Conflict Management (ICM) data, NRF has killed 36 Taliban fighters in the current year, so far, without losing a single fighter of its own. In 2024, NRF killed 444 Taliban fighters, losing six of its own. Since August 2021, NRF has killed a total of 1,777 Taliban fighters and has lost 236 cadres (data till March 2, 2025). Earlier, as reported on September 1, 2024, Ahamd Massoud, the exiled leader of NRF, asserted, The second most lethal resistance force, the Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF) has killed 52 Taliban fighters in the current year, so far (data till March 2, 2025). No AFF fighter has been killed in these incidents. Through 2024, AFF had killed 230 Taliban fighters, and lost just three of its own. On February 27, 2025, AFF claimed on X that, over the preceding three years (the group was formed in 2022), the Front had executed a total of 330 successful operations, resulting in the elimination of 821 Taliban fighters and injuries to another 868, and had lost 13 of its own. These operations included 87 targeted attacks in the preceding year alone, on Taliban bases, checkpoints, and gathering points, killing 229 Taliban militants and injuring 166. AFF asserted that it had expanded its military operations to 31 provinces across Afghanistan (out of a total of 34 provinces in the country); enhanced its organizational structure and operational capabilities; and improved strategic communications, intelligence, and field operations. There are several other resistance forces, including the Afghanistan Liberation Movement, the Afghanistan Liberation Front, the National Mobilization Front, and the Afghanistan Islamic National and Liberation Movement, which are fighting against the Taliban regime. There have been numerous attempts to bring all these resistance forces together to put more pressure on the Taliban. For instance, in a first meeting in April 2024, the NRF and AFF discussed the possibilities of unity and coordination between. However, no further developments have been reported in this regard. These groups pose a critical challenge for the Taliban regime in its efforts to consolidate its position as the legitimate government and true representative of Afghanistan. Engaged in territorial battle with these resistance forces, the Taliban is also finding it difficult to control the unabated terrorist activities of the IS-KP, which has undermined security and is a constant threat to the civilian population. ICM data indicates that there was a total of 247 civilian fatalities in 2024, with the IS-KP alone responsible for at least 135 of these. While perpetrators of 76 civilian killings remained unidentified, the Taliban killed 36 civilians. 11 civilians have already been killed in 2025, two of them by IS-KP in two separate incidents: January 21: A Chinese national named Li, who was working in the mining sector, was killed while travelling with his Afghan translator, in an attack along the Dasht-e-Qala road, which connects the Taluqan and Khwaja Bahauddin Districts in Takhar Province. On January 22, IS-KP took responsibility for the killing stating: 'Yesterday, the soldiers of the Caliphate targeted a vehicle carrying a Chinese communist in the village of Katakjar, Takhar, using a machine gun, resulting in his death and damage to his vehicle.'January 7: Abdul Razaq, an imam and teacher at a local seminary, was killed, and Hamdullah Mohammadi, a preacher at the New City Mosque, was injured in an attack orchestrated by IS-KP in the Baghlan-e-Jadid District of Baghlan Province. Though the Taliban has repeatedly claimed that it has ended the presence of IS-KP in Afghanistan, it is abundantly clear that the IS-KP remains a potent threat. Indeed, on June 5, 2024, a report issued by the Afghanistan United Front (AUF), led by Sami Sadat, former commander of Afghanistan's Special Forces, stated that IS-KP had a current strength of 9,000 fighters in Afghanistan and could conduct attacks 'throughout the region'. AUF further noted, 'The IS-KP group has the ideological, human resources, and recruitment capacity to carry out attacks in Europe and the United States, and they have demonstrated this capability in Afghanistan and Iran as well.' Most recently, on December 12, in its propaganda poster regarding the suicide attack on Khalil Rahman Haqqani, IS-KP’s Al-Azaim media criticized the remarks of the Taliban's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who had previously stated that anyone claiming IS-KP's presence in Afghanistan should provide evidence; the post queried, 'Do you still deny our existence?' Meanwhile, as mentioned above the Taliban killed 36 civilians in 2024, and at least nine of the 11 civilians killed in 2025. The incidents in the current year include: February 23: A young man, identified as Hamed Agha, was shot dead in Parwan Province after spending a week in Taliban detention. Agha was a resident of Bagram District.January 27: Eight civilians were detained and subsequently killed by the Taliban in separate incidents across Afghanistan. They were charged with collaborating with armed opposition groups. Since its return to power, the Taliban has particularly targeted civilians who it believed were still loyal to the former government, or those who were opposing its socio-religious diktats. In addition to IS-KP, other terrorist groups also continued to maintain a strong presence on Afghan soil, prominently including Al-Qaeda and Tehreek-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), among others. The volatility at the international borders with Pakistan and Iran adds to the Taliban’s mounting problems. Most recently, heavy shelling between the Pakistan Army and the Taliban forces started on February 22, 2025, at the Torkham border, one of the most important routes for trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The heavy firing started as Pakistan sought to prevent the Taliban from building a checkpoint near the Torkham border. The Afghanistan-Pakistan border region has seen a succession of two types of violent incidents: attacks by infiltrating militants on Security Forces (SFs) check posts/camps and exchanges of fire between the SFs of both sides over the issues of border fencing and construction of security posts. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since April 2007, when the first such clash was reported, there have been at least 26 incidents of clashes between SFs on both sides, in which 59 persons, including 40 SF personnel and 19 civilians, have been killed on the Pakistani side (data till March 2, 2025). Afghanistan rarely confirms its own casualties. Further, according to the SATP database, 415 persons (including 314 Pakistani SF personnel and 101 civilians) were killed in 179 attacks by terrorists from across the border since April 2007. As SAIR has noted earlier the international border Afghanistan and Pakistan has remained a bone of contention since the beginning. Not surprisingly, while Afghanistan continued to oppose Pakistani efforts to fence the Durand Line, which would give it permanent legitimacy, Pakistan continued to obstruct Afghan efforts even to erect check-posts along the border. The humanitarian crisis in the country, meanwhile, remains critical. According to the latest World Food Programme (WFP) data, over a quarter (14.8 million) of the Afghan population of 43.4 million were facing acute food insecurity. One in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. WFP has noted that 'these figures sadly keep the country squarely amongst other severe global hunger crises. 1.4 million mothers and children are no longer receiving specialized nutritious food to prevent malnutrition, while malnutrition rates remain critically high.' The Taliban has failed comprehensively to address economic distress in the country. According to the World Bank's update released on February 5, 2025, The economic recovery has been uneven, with rural centers benefiting more than urban areas. The lack of job opportunities, coupled with ongoing displacement of population, has exacerbated regional disparities. Moreover, high levels of informal labor and the limited formalization of businesses restricts access to secure livelihoods and social safety nets, further deepening poverty for millions of Afghans. Afghanistan's economic outlook remains highly fragile with a very limited revenue base. The country's high trade deficit, dependence on imports, and shrinking fiscal space present formidable challenges to sustainable recovery, and key sectors such as agriculture remain vulnerable to the effects of climate change, insecurity and a lack of investment, further complicating the recovery process. Meanwhile, which began soon after the withdrawal of Western forces from Afghanistan, have further complicated Afghanistan's problems. External powers, prominently including China, are trying to make inroads into the country, in an effort to capture and control its significant natural resources. Afghanistan has extraordinary deposits of rare earth elements, including metals that play a critical role in the modern manufacturing sector, such as tellurium, cobalt, iron, copper, Tungsten, Manganese, and possibly the world's largest deposits of Lithium, among others. In addition, there are also significant deposits of gold, precious stones, coal, oil and gas. On February 26, 2025, US President Donald Trump, outlining the policy of his first presidency, declared, We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it's exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles. And you know who's occupying it right now? China. Biden gave it up. Reacting to Trump's statement, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, denied the claim and cautioned, 'They should refrain from making emotional statements based on unsubstantiated information… Bagram is controlled by the Islamic Emirate, not China. Chinese troops are not present here, nor do we have any such pact with any country.' Despite being in power for over three years, the Taliban has failed to win the confidence and support, either of the Afghan population, or of the international community. International recognition for its regime remains elusive, despite the engagement of several countries and international agencies with the regime, both for the provision of humanitarian relief and for commercial interests, particularly for the exploitation of Afghanistan's abundant natural resources. There is very little possibility of Hibatullah Akhundzada making any changes in the prevailing regressive policies followed by his government. Absent such changes, international recognition for the Taliban remains unlikely. The internal churning within the Taliban leadership can only lead to further turbulence within the country.

Triumphalism In Moscow About Setback In Peace-Making For Ukraine ...	By Pavel K. Baev Moscow’s mouthpieces competed to celebrate and ridicule the individuals involved in the February 28 talks in Washington, D.C. between Ukraine and the United States. To the surprise of many, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House empty-handed after arriving with the expectation of signing a symbolically important minerals deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy’s point, 'I am not here to play cards,' echoes the same conviction as when he famously refused to escape from Kyiv when threatened by Russian tanks, claiming 'I need ammunition, not a ride' (X/@UkrEmbLondon, February 26, 2022; Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 1). Ukrainian victory in Russia’s war against the country remains out of reach, and in the latest Russian opinion polls, less than a third of respondents express resolve for continuing combat operations. Support for making concessions in order to sign a prospective peace agreement has, however, barely reached 30 percent (Levada.ru, February 28). This creates little if any incentive for Russian President Vladimir Putin to indicate readiness to make steps toward a compromise. In an interview on March 2, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explained that 'during Donald Trump’s first election, many of our politicians fell into euphoria. Now they are falling into it again' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 2). This euphoria is due to what Lavrov characterized as the U.S. administration’s pragmatism and common sense in its approach to relations with Russia. The Kremlin was likely worried about the flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington D.C. last week, while its own consultations about normalizing relations and appointing a new ambassador to United States were progressing slowly (Vedomosti, February 28). The quarrel in the White House last Friday, however, has been presented by the Russian state and in media narratives as '[u]nprecedented in the history of international politics and diplomacy' and evidence of Ukraine being in the wrong (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). The Kremlin considers the exchange as reassurance that Zelenskyy is 'obsessed with continuing the war and rejects peace' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). It has, in Moscow’s mind, confirmed that Zelenskyy is 'the most dangerous threat to the international community,' he has 'lost his grip on reality and is unable to reach and honor agreements' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s newly-promoted negotiator, described the discord as 'historic' (RBC, February 28). Russian state media have published a full transcript of the exchange, characterized as an 'open squabble,' between Zelenskyy, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance (Izvestiya, March 1). Moscow pundits have been eager to overdo one another with sarcastic assessments of Zelenskyy’s political blunders and awkward English (Kommersant, February 28). They emphasize U.S. official statements that Zelenskyy was put in his place and how Zelenskyy 'rushed' out of the Oval Office after 'Trump personally ordered Zelenskyy to leave the White House and the United States' (TASS; Ekspert, March 1). Zelenskyy’s readiness to engage in talks at the White House reflected his commitment to sign the agreement on U.S. privileged access to Ukraine’s mineral resources, including rare earth elements, that had been negotiated despite many technical issues and emotional reactions (Carnegie Politika, February 27). Moscow had been monitoring the bargaining with much concern assuming that the deal might include deposits on the Ukrainian territories annexed by Russia (NV.ua, February 28). Putin even tried to counter this agreement by inviting the United States to invest in development of Russian mineral resources, including aluminum (The Moscow Times, February 27). Russia is rich in many minerals, including rare earth elements, but many discoveries from the Soviet era, for instance lithium deposits, are underexplored, and the investment climate remains forbidding (Forbes.ru, February 26; Nezavisimaya gazeta, February 27). Offers made by Dmitriev to his U.S. counterparts were far from exciting, but the Ukrainian projects are also a long way from becoming profitable. The disappointing cost-benefit calculations may have dissuaded Washington from presenting the agreed document as a major success (Re: Russia, February 28). Instead of the minerals deal, the demand for a ceasefire became the key issue. For Ukraine, the central question is security guarantees, because Zelenskyy cannot trust Putin’s goodwill (see Strategic Snapshot, February 24). For Russia, an armistice leaves the root causes of the existential conflict unaddressed, while the war is, in Putin’s words, 'God’s will' (Rossiiskaya gazeta, February 23). Zelenskyy did not deny the problems that Ukraine is facing while defending against Russia’s invasion, yet the same cannot be said for Putin who continues to pretend that miniscule advances by Russian forces do not yield tremendous costs (The Insider, February 24). The attrition of the 'big battalions' of the Russian Army can no longer be compensated by recruitment offers with mind-boggling bonuses to 'volunteers,' which in turn would delay any further mobilization efforts by many months (The Moscow Times, February 28). As European leaders convene an emergency summit with Zelenskyy in London for a 'once in a generation moment,' Putin’s position is evaluated quite differently than in Washington (Nezavisimaya gazeta, March 1; The Kyiv Independent, March 2). The summit has alarmed many Russian 'patriotic' commentators (TopWar.ru, February 26;Meduza, March 1). This position of collective strength has not been the only show of support for Zelenskyy by European leaders, who gathered at an emergency summit in Paris last Monday on the sidelines of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia (Kyiv Independent, February 18). These summits reflect the fast emerging determination in Europe to invest greater resources in building own defense base and in keeping Ukraine in the fight, while leaving Russia to face an overwhelming coalition in its immediate and most important neighborhood (Izvestiya, February 28). These developments have required tactical rhetorical maneuvering by the Kremlin as it has in prior years dedicated great effort to constructing a worldview in which the intrinsically hostile United States leads a grouping of obedient vassals in confrontation with Russia (Svoboda.org, March 2). This narrative is shifting as the rapprochement between Putin and Trump undercut such simplistic geopolitics. Experts in Moscow have ventured opinions about the need to modify the political discourse, but in fact, it is the whole political philosophy of breaking the U.S. world 'hegemony' that needs change (RIAC, February 26). Putin attempted to explain his maneuvering addressing the expanded gathering of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Collegium, but the usefulness of embracing the arch-enemy was far from obvious for this loyal audience of the most powerful of Russian special services (Kommersant, February 27). Splitting the trans-Atlantic unity and driving the United States away from Europe has been a long-set goal in Russia’s strategy, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine is used as a lever for achieving this goal. The Kremlin, however, may be overcalculating the benefits of last Friday’s meeting in the White House to Moscow’s narratives. It is convenient to dismiss Europe as a disunion with no security agency, but a different reality is taking shape faster than Moscow expects. This emerging Europe is vested in ensuring peace for Ukraine, and it is up to European leaders to demonstrate that the real barrier to lasting peace is not Zelenskyy’s stubbornness, but Putin’s insatiable pursuit to see Ukraine defeated.

US Puts Firewall To Protect Ukraine Deal With Russia – OpEd	The verbal shootout at the Oval Office last Friday brought out President Vladimir Zelensky’s fury that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are very close to a deal on Ukraine, while the conclave in Lancashire House in London on Sunday involving 18 European leaders messaged that Zelensky is in good company. Connecting the dots, the incisive mind of Stephen Bryen, a leading expert on security, strategy and technology who previously held senior positions in the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, wrote on Substack: 'Trump invited [French president] Macron and [UK prime minister] Starmer to Washington to brief them, which he apparently did. The French went away fairly unhappy, but Starmer seemed to be in general agreement. Starmer made a pitch to include Article 5 and NATO in any deal; Trump rejected that appeal. Putin, meanwhile, talked to [Chinese president] Xi by telephone and sent Sergei Shoigu (who heads Russia’s Security Council, something like the NSC) to Beijing to meet with Xi. 'Trump invited Zelensky. The cover for Zelensky’s appearance in Washington was the 'Minerals Deal' which the two leaders were supposed to sign… The real reason for the Zelensky visit was to brief him on the Putin negotiations and to gain his support.' In the event, Trump could neither brief Zelensky on the Ukraine deal nor sign the 'Minerals Deal' because the Ukrainian president took great exception to any negotiations with Putin. He did this in public, to Trump’s face, and in front of the press. The result was there was no private meeting and Trump told Zelensky, 'he would be welcomed back only when he was ready for peace.' This is where things stand. The strategy session that Trump is due to take later today with his top advisors will signal what happens next. There is a strong likelihood that Trump may cut off arms deliveries and/or financial assistance to Ukraine. Now that the Rubicon has been crossed, Trump is unlikely to change course on Russia — unless, of course, Zelensky falls in line in abject surrender, which seems unlikely too. Russians of course welcome his ouster. It is highly unlikely that Trump will be cowed down by the temper tantrums of the EU or impressed by Britain’s grandstanding. Germany is without a government for the next several weeks; it weakens the Europeans’ punch. Indeed, the back channel communication between Moscow and Washington has gained traction. Moscow assesses that Trump has the upper hand. This is reflected in the growing optimism in Putin’s remarks last Thursday while addressing the Board of the Federal Security Service (collegium of Russia’s top foreign intelligence officials.) Putin began by saying that the world and the international situation are changing rapidly and 'the first contacts with the new US administration inspire certain hopes.' He said: 'There is a reciprocal commitment [with Trump] to work to restore interstate relations and to gradually address the enormous amount of systemic and strategic problems in the global architecture which once provoked the crises in Ukraine and other regions… Importantly, our partners demonstrate pragmatism and a realistic vision of things, and have abandoned numerous stereotypes, the so-called rules, and messianic, ideological clichés of their predecessors.' Putin estimated that conditions exist for a dialogue 'on bringing a fundamental solution to Ukraine crisis,… a dialogue on creating a system that will truly ensure a balanced and mutual consideration of interests, an indivisible European and global security system for the long term, where the security of some countries cannot be ensured at the expense or to the detriment of the security of other countries, definitely not Russia.' However, Putin also flagged that sections Western elites 'are still committed to maintaining instability in the world, and these forces will try to disrupt or to compromise the newly resumed dialogue' and, hence it is vital that 'every possibility offered by dialogue and special services to thwart such attempts' needs to be leveraged. Indeed, the New York Times disclosed today that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia 'as part of a larger re-evaluation of all operations against Russia.' Equally, reports have appeared that Putin has given similar instructions restraining the Russian agencies. What lends enchantment to the view is that many of the US’ most sophisticated operations against Russia are run out of Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the storied intelligence agency that broke the Enigma codes in World War II. Suffice to say, the US seems to be cutting itself free from longstanding joint operations with Britain directed against Russia. A Guardian newspaper report has separately corroborated the Times disclosure of a shift in the US policy. It added that the warming of US-Russia relations is apparent also in certain recent other incidents which indicate that the US is 'no longer characterising Russia as a cybersecurity threat.' The paper claimed that analysts in the super secret Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) of the United States spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity that they were 'verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.' Quite obviously, a crisis of confidence has arisen in the US-UK 'special relationship' — or, to put it differently, the Trump administration is taking steps to sequester the Cisa from rogue operations. There is a Cold War history of rogue operations by spy agencies. One of the most celebrated cases was the incident on 1st May, 1960 when an American U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers flying at an altitude of 80,000 feet was shot down over Soviet air space triggering a diplomatic crisis that caused the collapse of a summit conference in Paris between then US president Dwight Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev — and the sudden death of the two leaders’ closely nurtured dream of détente. An analogical situation exists today. Both Washington and Moscow are conscious of it. The need for such a veil of secrecy around the high level dialogue between the Kremlin and the White House is self-evident. There are too many detractors in the collective West who won’t settle for anything short of a Russian defeat in Ukraine and would rather keep the war going. In such a fraught scenario, on the Russian side, the Kremlin’s writ ultimately prevails despite whatever dissenting voices exist in the military-industrial complex or amongst super hawks with revenge mentality. But that is not the case in the US where remnants of the old regime still hold sensitive positions, as the Guardian report vividly brings out. In the final analysis, therefore, it may well turn out that — to quote Stephen Bryan — Trump 'will let Ukraine collapse but may seek a deal with Putin on Ukraine once Zelensky is gone.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHruofv7p8eIb	2025-03-03T16:20:14-08:00	
Airstrikes: The Last Bastion Of Junta Power In Myanmar – OpEd	By Antonio Graceffo I was driving with the Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a faith-based frontline aid organization, down one of the few remaining paved roads that had survived years of war. One of the Rangers in the back of the pickup truck began banging on the cab’s ceiling—a signal to pull over. The driver swerved aggressively, quickly steering the vehicle into the jungle. Once under the cover of trees, everyone jumped out and took shelter in a drainage ditch, eyes fixed on the sky. Above us, the faint sound of jets echoed as they crisscrossed over our position. 'Before they attack, you’ll hear the pitch change when they dive,' a veteran soldier said. We listened in silence, but the attack never came. In the Myanmar civil war, every rebel knows that there are no good aircraft. The resistance forces have no planes or helicopters. So, when a plane, helicopter, or drone is heard, people run for cover. The few remaining schools, temples, hospitals, and churches all have bomb shelters nearby, as do the internally displaced people’s camps, which now house about 80% of the population. Watching the jets, which, at this point of the war are responsible for most of the casualties, it was frustrating to realize that the resistance doesn’t have a single antiaircraft gun or man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS). Government forces can fly overhead with impunity, terrorizing the population and killing at will, without any fear of counterfire. As the jets got slightly ahead of our position, one of the soldiers shouted: 'They just fired rockets.' Given the trajectory, we assumed the target was about two kilometers down the road. In any other place, in any other war, one of the soldiers would have grabbed a radio or cell phone to call ahead and check for casualties. But after the 2021 coup, the Tatmadaw cut off the internet, cell service, and electricity across the entirety of Karenni State. Thus, the only way to find out what is actually happening is to go there. We jumped into the truck and rushed to the next village, with the Rangers prepared to provide medical aid. Upon arrival, the local military commander and his soldiers were milling about in the street. Seeing the Free Burma Rangers (FBR) markings on our vehicle, they flagged us down and reported that the Tatmadaw had just blown up a school and a hospital. By the grace of God, neither building was in use, and not a single person had been injured. However, both buildings were completely destroyed. Across Myanmar, this scenario plays out multiple times per day. The army regularly bombs on internally displaced camps, civilian villages, schools, churches, and hospitals. According to David Eubank, head of Free Burma Rangers (FBR), 'At this point every hospital and most churches in Karenni State have been bombed at least once.' Karenni State has a significant Catholic population, and the beautiful churches and cathedrals seem to be a favored target of the government. We photographed the impact zones to estimate the size of the explosives, and it seemed that a crater of that size could only have been made by a 500-pound bomb. The Rangers quickly filmed a video to inform the world about what had happened. One of the Rangers stood in front of the wreckage and said, 'It’s the 13th of February. This is Dharaku Village. It just got hit by an airstrike that targeted a school and a hospital. There’s an impact area about 15 yards away from the school, which destroyed about half of it. And then, about 30 yards down the hill, there’s another impact area.' We were joking that, after the war, he might have a future as a newscaster, but then we heard the sound of an aircraft in the sky again. At that moment, a Chinese-made Y-12 aircraft flew overhead. Aircraft identification is one of the many grim skills even civilian children have learned since the coup. These planes are typically used for resupply, but they also serve for surveillance. Fearing we might be spotted and targeted for another attack, the soldiers quickly moved the vehicles off the road. After the plane passed, the local commander politely asked us to leave, concerned that we might be targeted or that having extra soldiers and vehicles in the village could invite further attacks. As we left, one of the Rangers grabbed a large chunk of shrapnel to use as a kettlebell for exercising back at camp. Even this simple act highlights how nothing goes to waste and how everything is in short supply. There is no local manufacturing, so every product, including petrol and food, has to be transported through jungles, over mountains, and across war zones. The currency has crashed, and shortages of goods and food are fueling severe inflation. The effects are especially harsh for a population where nearly no one has a wage-paying job. For instance, resistance soldiers don’t receive salaries, nor do aid workers—two of the most common jobs in the region. The area where we were working had been captured by government forces but was liberated in 2022 by resistance forces. Now, it is under the control of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF). The settlements resemble post-apocalyptic ghost towns. Although many homes remain undamaged by bombs, they are uninhabitable because the government planted landmines and booby traps around nearly every building, especially churches. Just before my arrival, a young soldier stepped on a landmine outside a church. As a result, almost the entire population is living in temporary shelters under plastic tarps. The KNDF Chairman, Khun Bedu, is working diligently with the Interim Executive Council (IEC) to establish and implement a civilian government. Various departments, such as health and education, are already operating, staffed by civilians who provide what aid they can to the people. However, because of the airstrikes, there is no way to return to normalcy. No matter what physical infrastructure or societal institutions the IEC builds, a government airstrike can come at any moment and destroy everything. Just outside of town, government forces attempted to retake territory lost in 2022. Initially, the resistance was overrun, but the next day they launched a successful counterattack. They quickly regained ground, but chose to hold their position because they were running low on ammunition and knew they couldn’t maintain additional ground if they advanced. A battalion commander pointed out that airstrikes on civilian targets are sporadic, but if the KNDF takes too much land or gets too close to government bases, all bets are off, and the government could unleash a full-scale bombing campaign. The resistance would have no way of countering it. As a result, the war has ground to a strange stalemate. Not just in Karenni State, but in most of the states actively fighting against the junta, the ethnic resistance armies have captured all but the largest cities. The capital of Karenni State, Loikaw, is largely under government control, and the same is true for Karen State’s capital, Hpa-An, and Shan State’s capital, Taunggyi. In Kachin State, the capital, Myitkyina, and in Arakan State, the capital, Sittwe, are nearly, but not entirely, under resistance control. However, in areas like Karenni, Arakan, and Kachin, the vast majority of the population now lives under the governance of ethnic resistance forces, rather than the Tatmadaw. One of the most practical differences between government-controlled and ethnic-controlled areas is the use of native languages as the medium of education in schools, where they still exist. Education often takes place in dry riverbeds under camouflaged tarps hidden in the jungle, taught by volunteer educators with few, if any, resources. Despite the hardships, their commitment to building a functioning civil society in the midst of a David vs. Goliath struggle is remarkable. Sadly, until the issue of airstrikes is resolved, this smoldering conflict will never end, and the people will never be able to reclaim their lives, nor will civilian governments be able to govern. To end the airstrikes and bring about a resolution, Myanmar needs: 1) The United States and other Western powers to prevent China and Russia from selling aircraft, munitions, and fuel to the junta; 2) Civilian governments established in places like Karenni State to receive international recognition, as well as diplomatic support and aid; 3) The international community to persuade the Thai government to open humanitarian corridors, allowing truckloads of medicine, food, and other supplies to cross the border freely; and 4) Resistance forces to receive US military aid, munitions, small weapons, and especially man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), along with sophisticated drone jammers. While many in the United States and the West are concerned about providing weapons to a country in conflict, ending the war sooner – ending the airstrikes – will save more lives in the long run.

Tariffs Are Wealth Destroyers – OpEd	By Frank Shostak On January 31, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico (except for Canadian crude oil and energy imports, which will be subject to a 10 percent tariff) and a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. Tariffs are taxes on things that Americans buy from producers in other countries. One would have thought that out of all people, President Trump—who prides himself on placing America first—would never consider imposing tariffs. After all, a tariff on any imported good implies curtailing the supply of less costly goods and encouraging the supply in a domestic market of more costly, domestically-produced goods (i.e., punishing the domestic consumers: the Americans). In his Economics in One Lesson, Henry Hazlitt quotes Adam Smith, It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbors, and to purchase with a part of its produce, or what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever else they have occasion for. What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. Also, on this Rothbard wrote in the Power and Market, 'Tariffs injure the consumers within the ‘protected’ area, who are prevented from purchasing from more efficient competitors at a lower price.' Furthermore, by raising a protection wall to various inefficient domestic industries, Trump’s policies are going to promote inefficiency, thereby undermining the process of wealth generation. In 'The Menace of Tariffs,' Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. made the following comments, Trump said in his interview that high tariffs will encourage foreign firms to relocate to the United States, so that they can avoid paying the tariffs. What this argument ignores is that there is no benefit to American consumers in having firms located here rather than in foreign countries. What matters to consumers is getting the lowest price for the goods and services they want; and if the firm that offers the lowest price is in China rather than America, so what? According to Rothbard, in 'Smashing Protectionist ‘Theory’ (Again),' Invariably, we will find that the protectionists are out to cripple, exploit, and impose severe losses not only on foreign consumers but especially on Americans. And since each and every one of us is a consumer, this means that protectionism is out to mulct all of us for the benefit of a specially privileged, subsidized few — and an inefficient few at that: people who cannot make it in a free and unhampered market. Take, for example, the alleged Japanese menace. All trade is mutually beneficial to both parties — in this case Japanese producers and American consumers — otherwise they would not engage in the exchange. In trying to stop this trade, protectionists are trying to stop American consumers from enjoying high living standards by buying cheap and high-quality Japanese products. Instead, we are to be forced by government to return to the inefficient, higher-priced products we have already rejected. In short, inefficient producers are trying to deprive all of us of products we desire so that we will have to turn to inefficient firms. American consumers are to be plundered. Given that President Trump considers himself as a successful businessman, he surely must be well aware that the ultimate goal of every business is to make profit. Hence, to succeed in this task as a businessman, Donald Trump will not allow activities that would undermine the net worth of his company. Yet the President is of the view that this is acceptable for the economy as a whole. If policies such tariffs weaken the process of wealth formation and undermine individual well-being, obviously this is bad news for the economy as a whole, which President Trump holds as number one on his priority list. President Trump is of the view that, through tariffs, he can make the US economy prosperous. Ludwig von Mises said the following, At the bottom of the interventionist argument there is always the idea that the government or the state is an entity outside and above the social process of production, that it owns something which is not derived from taxing its subjects, and that it can spend this mythical something for definite purposes. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that a 25 percent tariff—retained through 2029—would reduce the gross domestic product of the United States by $200 billion. According to the Budget Lab at Yale University, American households will lose approximately $1,200 in purchasing power. The retaliation by countries such as China, the Eurozone, and Canada to Trump’s tariffs raises the likelihood of a trade war that is going to feed the ego of politicians. By raising tariffs on American imports, these countries will only make things much worse to themselves. What is the point of punishing your own citizens because of a misguided economic policy of the US? By curbing imports from the US to the domestic markets, one does not fix the negative side effects of US tariffs. If all countries in the world were to impose tariffs on imports, this would quickly arrest international trade and lead to massive economic impoverishment. In Power and Market, Rothbard argued that the absurdity of the pro-tariff arguments can be seen in the following example of two individuals Jones and Smith. This is a valid use of the reductio ad absurdum because the same qualitative effects take place when a tariff is levied on a whole nation as when it is levied on one or two people; the difference is merely one of degree. Suppose that Jones has a farm, 'Jones’ Acres,' and Smith works for him. Having become steeped in protariff ideas, Jones exhorts Smith to 'buy Jones’ Acres.' 'Keep the money in Jones’ Acres,' 'don’t be exploited by the flood of products from the cheap labor of foreigners outside Jones’ Acres,' and similar maxims become the watchword of the two men. To make sure that their aim is accomplished, Jones levies a 1000-percent tariff on the imports of all goods and services from 'abroad,' i.e., from outside the farm. As a result, Jones and Smith see their leisure, or 'problems of unemployment,' disappear as they work from dawn to dusk trying to eke out the production of all the goods they desire. Many they cannot raise at all; others they can, given centuries of effort. It is true that they reap the promise of the protectionists: 'self-sufficiency,' although the 'sufficiency' is bare subsistence instead of a comfortable standard of living. Money is 'kept at home,' and they can pay each other very high nominal wages and prices, but the men find that the real value of their wages, in terms of goods, plummets drastically. Truly we are now back in the situation of the isolated or barter economies of Crusoe and Friday. And that is effectively what the tariff principle amounts to. This principle is an attack on the market, and its logical goal is the self-sufficiency of individual producers; it is a goal that, if realized, would spell poverty for all, and death for most, of the present world population. It would be a regression from civilization to barbarism. Conclusion The imposition of tariffs is going to hurt the American consumers. This will stifle trade between the US and the rest of the world. It will undermine the process of wealth generation. According to Mark Hendrickson—'Trump’s First Big Economic Mistake,' In 1850, Frederic Bastiat wrote in his classic essay, 'The Law,' that tariffs are a step toward socialism. In his words, 'protectionism, socialism, and communism are basically the same plant in three different stages of its growth.' All three call for government to intervene in the marketplace to influence who gains and who loses. About the author: Frank Shostak is an Associated Scholar of the Mises Institute.

Unpredictable Days Ahead – OpEd	By Dr. J. Scott Younger One month has passed since Donald Trump entered the White House for the second time. One can only add that it has been fairly dramatic, two wars going on, which he said he would put a stop to, and the signing of umpteen executive orders including the of many MAGA supporters involved in the White House riots in January 2021. He still found time to spend weekends at his Florida base, however, and get in a statutory round of golf. The President surpassed himself when pontificating about the Ukraine war, making seemingly outrageous remarks about his European and UK allies, and having a cruel dig at President Volodymyr Zelensky, all wrong and full of misinformation. One doubts he reads anything and ‘’opens his mouth and lets his belly rumble’’ to quote a fairly common slang phrase. It must have made Vladimir Putin smile and given him satisfaction before peace talks get more serious. So far, he has found he has found routes to get away with it. A solution has always come to hand, for example being self-exonerated as president for several pending court cases to answer charges on a host of issues, including fraud. It is 26th February, Wednesday, and President Emmanuel Macron of France has been to give the European view of matters, with the war in Ukraine being at the top of the list, and the British Prime Minister will be following on Thursday 27th, separately, to endorse the European point of view and, importantly promise a commitment by the UK government to raise defence spending. Both Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer have done nothing to help, Trump said earlier! This week will be interesting to see after Macron and Starmer have confronted the President. Whatever, the Europeans are awakening slowly to the idea that their future safety has to depend very largely on themselves and the US cannot be relied on for aid unless it can be seen to be in their interest. America First!! This may be on hand. Trump, who looks at the solution to any problem like a real estate deal to be done, its profitability, never mind the people that could be hurt in its execution, has already eyed the valuable rare earth minerals. These can be found in the eastern lands of Ukraine, and are to be used to pay back the US for continued support for the war which he has said he would end. The cost to the West, which he has wrongly assessed, he has taken very much in the US favour, loans and grants being mixed up and Europe getting the short straw. He is correct, however, in saying that Europe has relied on the US too much over the years. The main outstanding issue is that Putin thinks that, as part of any peace agreement, that Russia will keep all or at least the majority of eastern Ukrainian lands that Russia has wrongly invaded, and which holds a good amount of the rare earth minerals. This is not the way that Ukraine thinks, which conjures up a with every party to give something, and Uncle Sam to coordinate and get the rare earth minerals but ensuring that Ukraine is part of the European Union and perhaps NATO going forward. The process will take several months, but the fighting and killing, continuing damage to buildings must stop before the end of the peace agreement. The sooner the better. It is a sad day when Putin would think, as he implied in a rare speech given the day before yesterday, that he would welcome a return to the old-world order of the US, China and Russia once more dominating proceedings, his interpretation of an extension of Trump’s thinking! I do not believe that is what Trump has implied I his utterings or of what most of the world wants. The worrying issue is that, because Trump believes he has a good rapport with Putin, he tends to dismiss the latter’s several serious untruths, or downright lies, which Putin puts out as the official Kremlin line, expecting his general populace to believe it, and the difficulties that would descend on them if they didn’t. Trump should note that over half a million Russians fled the country, through the southern borders, when he started the war with Ukraine, either to avoid being called up for armed forces duty or simply for reasons of disagreement with the government. Putin has had to go to China and from there to N. Korea, which Trump visited twice the last time he was in the White House, to get the additional troops he needed to give himself any chance of getting a satisfactory outcome from the war. Trump has demonstrated a handpicked team which looks like he has copied some of Putin’s play book, that is the gathering to his side a few of the richest men in the world, like oligarchs, and bypassing, where possible, the departments of government, giving them, ‘the oligarchs’, each a fairly- free hand. This will probably rebound on him rather sooner than later. Elon Musk, the product of a most unhappy and unusual upbringing and reputedly the richest man in the world, has been appointed to lead the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) with the task of cleaning up the main departments of central government and ridding them of any corruption; he is supposed to exert unilateral control over the entire Federal Government. As the British paper, the Byline Times, puts it ‘’Elon Musk’s unchecked consolidation of power over government infrastructure, financial systems, AI governance and digital media does not serve the interests of the Trump administration or the broader conservative movement -----his actions demonstrate that he is not working for Trump or the Republican Party but rather for his own power and the broader neo-reactionary agenda’’. The rest of the article is more troubling. How long will the Trump-Musk partnership last? Months? Year or two? The other war Trump has stated that he would stop is that in Gaza between the Israelis and Palestinians, or more correctly Hamas, which is ‘recognised’ as a terrorist organisation by western governments. He has entertained Benjamin Netanyahu, the PM of Israel, in Florida, from which, in a joint press conference, he promised to clean up the Gaza strip, for which he would require the 2m Palestinians who lived there to leave and go to Jordan and Egypt, and then he would build ‘The Riviera of the Middle East’. Mouths fell open at this bombshell! There are at least two things that are wrong with that statement. First, it is not in Israel’s grasp to grant Gaza; it is part of Palestine. Secondly, the people of Gaza certainly do not want to be uprooted from land which has been in their families for generations, centuries, albeit largely turned to rubble through continual bombing by Israelis. Nor do the Egyptians or Jordanians wish to absorb such a large population of forcibly displaced people who have spent the past year without jobs, hiding from nightly bombing from arms supplied by the US, just surviving with UN aide, parsimoniously let in by Israel. Naturally, the extremist far-right of Netanyahu’s government, who rather dominate the proceedings unfortunately, were delighted with President Trump’s announcement. They noted that he would be otherwise occupied in the coming period with Putin and the war in Ukraine and used the opportunity to step up the war against the Palestinians. They have illegally taken over a further part of the Palestinian owned West Bank, Jenin, clearing out the township of mostly refugees to provide space for their soldiers. They are also finding excuses to break the ceasefire process and hostage exchange, the first phase coming to an end shortly; the army is once more girding up to continue its operations in Gaza. What action will the Trump administration take? It is only fair to say that large numbers of Israelis are fed up with the strife and want to see an end to the war, which they rightly see is being pursued for personal reasons. Their voice, regrettably, carries insufficient weight, as often found in similar circumstances across the world with a government holding a tight grip on power, and not necessarily carrying out the wishes of the people. This summary proceedings of recent events has been underlined by the changeover in the US presidency, with the bringing in of the 47th incumbent to hold this prestigious office, Donald Trump, with all the unpredictability he brings. It can only be seen as a statement in time. It would be a brave man who would predict what will happen in a week’s time never mind a few months. So, watch this space! About the author: Dr. J.

What’s At Stake In The Budget Battle – OpEd	For the first time in years, the U.S. Congress is considering budget bills that could seriously rein in government spending growth. The big-budget news came out of the House of Representatives last week. The House passed its budget blueprint by a two-vote margin. House Concurrent Resolution 14 covers proposed spending for the entire U.S. government for the remainder of its 2025 fiscal year through its 2034 fiscal year. What’s in the House’s Budget Blueprint The House bill allows for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. These cuts include extending current income tax rates at their current levels, which are set to rise after this year. Without this action, 62% of income tax filers will be forced to pay higher income taxes starting in 2026. This tax increase would have a negative impact on the growth of the U.S. economy. The cost of avoiding these tax hikes will partly be offset by cuts to the federal government’s overall discretionary and mandatory spending. The House budget bill aims to reduce mandatory spending by up to $2 trillion. That’s a big opportunity for fiscal reform because this spending increases by autopilot and is off-limits in annual budget negotiations. At the same time, the House bill proposes large reductions to nondefense discretionary spending, totaling $1.8 trillion from 2025 through 2034. This spending exploded during the Biden-Harris administration, creating the need to bring it back down to more sustainable levels. The House bill proposes to cut this portion of discretionary spending by a lot over the next two years. After which, it will resume growing at a slower rate. Meanwhile, the rate of defense spending growth would be reduced to about 2.4% annually, slower than the rate recorded during the Biden-Harris administration. Not a Sure Thing The passage of the House bill wasn’t guaranteed. The Senate had crafted a less expansive budget bill, Senate Concurrent Resolution 7, which likewise passed by a narrow margin several days before the House bill. The Senate’s version of the spending bill was adopted as a 'fallback budget' in case the House’s more ambitious budget blueprint couldn’t get the votes to pass. What One Big Budget Bill Means The successful passage of the House bill, however, now means the entire scope of the U.S. government’s fiscal policies for spending and taxes is on the negotiating table. That process is called reconciliation, and if truly successful, it will improve the U.S. government’s fiscal policies by making them more sustainable. The action now shifts to House and Senate budget negotiators, who will work to create one big budget bill on which both bodies will vote. Whether that effort will be successful remains to be seen. If it is unsuccessful, Congress will resort to its 'continuing resolution' budget game, which is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The one thing you can count on however is hearing a lot of screaming in the media about the budget bill. Especially from those who benefitted the most from the Biden-Harris administration’s excessive and wasteful spending. Their free ride on the federal government’s gravy train needs to end. The budget battle of 2025, while only just getting started, is a long-needed reckoning.

Extrajudicial Killings, Custody Deaths Resurface Under Yunus Govt...	By Zia Chowdhury Human rights activists in Bangladesh are raising alarms about extrajudicial killings and other in-custody deaths of suspects recurring since the interim government came to power. The administration headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took office last August after a student-led uprising toppled the autocratic government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Her 15-year rule was tainted by widespread allegations of officer-involved killings and enforced disappearances. Ain-o-Shalish Kendra, a local rights organization, which was vocal in its criticism of abuses committed under Hasina, claims that at least 19 people have been killed by law enforcement agencies since Aug. 8, 2024 – when Yunus took office – including at least five in January. 'Those people either got killed in so-called gunfights or exchange of fire, or they were tortured while being in custody and later brought dead to hospitals,' the group’s senior coordinator, Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir, told BenarNews. Shafiqul Alam, spokesman for interim government leader Yunus, issued a statement outlining the administration’s efforts against extrajudicial killings and other abuse. 'Upholding human rights in every sphere of national life is a core mission of the current government, which includes some of the top rights activists in the country,' he said, adding the government had set up commissions to reform the criminal justice system. 'Most of the commissions have submitted their reports. The interim government will hold meaningful dialogue with the political parties over these reports in an effort to eradicate every opportunity for human rights abuses in police interrogation, crime management and judicial procedure,' Shafiqul said. Yunus’ government has pledged to implement institutional reforms and put the country back on a democratic path as it prepares Bangladesh for the next general election. However, crime has surged in the seven months since Hasina fell from power, with the interim government being criticized for failing to safeguard law and order. Meanwhile, rights activists have questioned the continued killings under the interim government. In a report filed in January, New York-based Human Rights Watch said law enforcement abuses were a problem during Sheikh Hasina’s tenure as prime minister before she was forced to flee the country on Aug. 5, 2024, but they have not gone away. 'Troublingly, security forces in Bangladesh are replicating familiar patterns of abuses from the Hasina administration,' the report said. Elsewhere, A.S.M. Nasiruddin Elan, director of human rights organization Odhikar, called for the Yunus government to act. 'This should not continue. We urge the government to identify everyone involved in killings and bring them to justice,' he told BenarNews. 'We also keep eyes on ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’' Since the operation was launched on Feb. 8, over 12,500 people have been arrested. The administration dropped 'Devil Hunt' from its name in the face of mounting criticism. Leaders of the Awami League (AL), which ruled under Hasina’s leadership, claimed the arrests targeted the party. 'Thousands of Awami League leaders and activists were arrested in the name of ‘Devil Hunt,’' Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, the party’s organizing secretary, told BenarNews. Killings Among publicized cases of recent killings at the hands of police and military forces Touhidul Islam, 40, a leader of the youth-wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), died in Cumilla on Feb. 1 after being taken into custody the day before by a military unit. Family members allege he was tortured. 'There are several bruises on his body from waist to feet. There are numerous marks of torture on different parts of the body including abdomen, chest, back, legs and throat. He was beaten throughout the night and brought to a hospital in the morning after dying,' his brother, Abul Kalam, told BenarNews. That same day, the defense ministry’s Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR) announced the formation of a high-level committee to determine the cause of death. In addition, the commander of the military unit that took Touhidul into custody was relieved of his duties. In a written statement, ISPR said appropriate action would be taken if an investigation determined those responsible for Touhidul’s death, but the directorate declined additional comment until the investigation was finished. Touhidul’s survivors were not satisfied, adding police would only tell them the investigation was ongoing. 'They all promised a fair probe and action, we haven’t seen anything as of now,' Kalam said. 'We have lodged a case accusing five named and some unnamed people. None has been arrested yet. 'How long it will take, God knows.' More recently, two men were killed on Feb. 20 during a reported exchange of gunfire with law enforcers in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area. ISPR identified the dead men as Md. Jumman and Miraz Hossain. Nur Khan Liton, a member of Commission for Enforced Disappearance and former leader of Ain-o-Shalish Kendra, noted that instead of curbing extrajudicial killings, the number had gone up since August. 'And the government is not taking any visible measures to minimize these extra-judicial killings. We have been told the same old narratives in every custodial death, crossfire or gunfight case,' he told BenarNews, adding law enforcers claim they were forced to return fire. 'It’s alarming and disappointing at the same time.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHlsgBTt-8yVC	2025-03-03T16:03:38-08:00	
India: No Safe Zones In Madhya Pradesh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 19, 2025, at least four women Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadres, active members of different committees of the 'KB' division (the Kanha Tiger Reserve in Mandla, Madhya Pradesh, and the Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary in the Kawardha District of Chhattisgarh), were killed by the Madhya Pradesh Police during an encounter near Ronda Forest Camp in the Supkhar Forest Range under Garhi Police Station limits in Balaghat District. The slain Maoists were identified as Asha, the ‘KB’ division 'commander,' facing 18 criminal cases in Madhya Pradesh, who hailed from Chhattisgarh’s Sukma District and carried a bounty of INR 1.2 million on her head in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in her home state, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh; Sarita alias Sheela alias Padam, and Lakkhe Maravi, both hailing from Sukma District, Chhattisgarh, and carried a bounty of INR 600,000 in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in Chhattisgarh, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh, each; and Ranjita alias Ramli Alami, a resident of Kondagaon District, Chhattisgarh, with a reward of INR 600,000 in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in Chhattisgarh, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh. Police recovered an INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, one Self-Loading Rie (SLR) and a .303 rifle, besides essential daily use items, from the encounter spot. Balaghat SP Nagendra Singh stated, 'It was our third encounter in the last 30 days. Earlier, in January, we held two exchanges of fire here and now finally we succeeded in gunning down four women Naxals. Our campaign to eliminate Naxals will be continued further.' On February 8, 2025, Security Forces (SFs) exchanged fire with around 18 to 20-armed CPI-Maoist cadres in uniform in the dense forests of Rajadera Kekdewada under Hatta Police Station limits in Balaghat District. No injuries were reported from either side, however, during a search of the area after the extremists managed to escape taking advantage of the dense forest terrain, SFs recovered a grenade launcher, a magazine, seven live cartridges, and essential supplies including rice, sugar, soybean balls, oil, and tea leaves. On January 3, 2025, a late-night encounter took place between the Hawk Force of Madhya Pradesh and a group of armed CPI-Maoist cadres, during a search operation based on intelligence inputs, in the Dharamara Forest area of Lanji Tehsil (revenue unit) in Balaghat District. After a brief encounter, the Maoists managed to escape into the dense forest. No casualties were reported from either side in the firefight. SFs recovered items typically used by Maoists from the encounter site. The February 19, 2025, incident is the lone fatality-related incident recorded in the State in Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE]-linked violence in the current year, thus far (data till March 2, 2025). According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Madhya Pradesh recorded three fatalities (all Maoists) in LWE-related violence in 2024. In 2023, there were five fatalities, including one civilian and four Maoists. For 14 years in a row, SFs did not suffer any loss in the State in 2024. The last SF fatality was reported on September 22, 2010, when the Maoists killed a trooper of the Hawk Force (the special anti-Naxalite force of Madhya Pradesh Police) near Sitapala village in Balaghat District. On the other hand, SFs killed three Maoists in 2024, as against four in 2023. Further, at least one Maoist was arrested in 2024, as against two such arrests in 2023. There were no arrests in 2022. At least four Maoists were arrested in 2021 and one in 2020. 74 Maoists have been arrested since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documenting data on LWE-linked violence across the country. SFs’ success on ground has led to improvements in the security situation in Madhya Pradesh. No civilian fatalities, a crucial index of security, were registered in 2024, while one such fatality was recorded in 2023. Civilian fatalities have followed a cyclical trend since March 6, 2000, with a a maximum of three in 2021. At least 14 civilian fatalities have been recorded since 2000. Other parameters of violence have barely been registered by the rebels in Madhya Pradesh. No incident of arson was reported in 2024, as well in 2023. The State has recorded a total of 10 such incidents since March 6, 2000. The last incident of arson was carried out on May 22, 2022, when more than 350 bags of tendu (Diospyros Melonoxylon plant) leaves collected by the tribals were set on fire by the Naxalites at the Dadekasa-Bilal Kasa tendu leaves collection centre under the South Forest Division of the Lanji Tehsil (revenue unit) in Balaghat District. Likewise, no incident of explosion was reported in 2024, as well in 2023. In fact, the State has recorded just one blast since March 6, 2000, on December 11, 2001, when the erstwhile People’s War Group (PWG) cadres blew up the government guest-house at Samnapur in Balaghat District. Maoists also failed to issue any bandh (general shutdown) call in 2024, as well in 2023. The State has recorded a total of six such calls since March 6, 2000. The last such call was issued on September 18, 2019, when the CPI-Maoist in Balaghat District protested against the March 19, 2019, ‘encounter killing’ of Maoist leader Jamuna alias Sagan Bai (45) and other members, Mangesh and Nande, by Police and armed forces. Significantly, the number of LWE-related incidents fell from eight in 2023, to six in 2024. All the fatalities in 2024 were recorded from just one District, Balaghat. Similarly, the fatality in 2023 was recorded from Balaghat as well. Further, an analysis of the underground and overground activities of the Maoists in 2024, according to the SATP database, categorized Balaghat District as ‘marginally affected’. In 2023, Balaghat was in the marginally affected category as well. Madhya Pradesh has a total of 52 districts, with Maoists active in this district alone. According to a February 22, 2025, report, the Maoists’ ‘Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone’ was formed by the Maoists as a new front to provide a breather to their cadres in southern Chhattisgarh. However, the ‘MMC zone’ movement failed to take root, mainly owing to the lack of support from local people. While operations against Maoists have greatly intensified in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, Maoists have also not found it easy in Madhya Pradesh, which has often been treated by them as a ‘rest and recuperation’ zone. Coordinated operations by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and intelligence inputs from the Centre have further cornered the Maoists. To address the LWE menace holistically, the Government of India (GoI), on August 6, 2024, also designated Balaghat, along with Mandla, and Dindori in Adhya Pradesh, as LWE-affected districts, in its list of 38 districts from nine States across the country. Following the encounter of February 19, 2025, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav declared, 'there is no place for Naxalism and violent activities' in Madhya Pradesh, adding, Under the guidance of the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, the Honourable Home Minister Shri Amit Shah ji is running a campaign to eliminate Naxalism from the country by the year 2026 and our government is also working seriously in this direction. Maoist efforts for revival in the state, however, have not ended. In order to demonstrate that they were fighting for the causes and rights of locals, CPI-Maoist called for a march to Delhi on January 7, 2025, to support the ongoing farmers' stir through a two-page pamphlet and red banner pasted in the Rupjhar jungles in Balaghat District. The pamphlet, issued under the name of the CPI-Maoist 'Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh Special Zonal Committee,' read, The ongoing farmers' stir is not just the agitation of farmers from Punjab and Haryana but is actually the movement of every farmer in the country, who has already been destroyed or is on the verge of being ruined due to the anti-farmer policies of the Modi government… We appeal to people, farmers and labourers, besides allied organisations, environmentalists, and intellectuals in the three states (Maharashtra, MP, and Chhattisgarh) to support the ongoing farmers movement in all possible ways. We appeal to one and all to stage protests, demonstrations, and road jams in cities and towns; resort to relay hunger strikes; and also, campaign on social media actively. If possible, march to Delhi and Punjab with the slogan, 'Shambhu aur Kanauri border Chalo'. Similar content was also written on a red banner put up by the Maoists on a Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana sign board, in the same Maoist infested jungles of Balaghat district The Madhya Pradesh Police continue to face deficits in capacities for Policing in the State. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, Madhya Pradesh had 121.13 Police personnel per 100,000 population, significantly below the inadequate national average of 154.84. More worryingly, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometres) was just 33.85, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio were well below the sanctioned strength, at 40.67 and 82.82, respectively. The sanctioned strength for the States’ Police was 125,381, while just 104,348 personnel were in position, creating a deficit of 16.77 per cent. In addition, the sanctioned strength of the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State was 305, but just 247 officers were in position, a deficit of 19.01 per cent, considerably weakening the executive supervision of the Force. According to a December 13, 2024, report, more than 6,000 people living in Maoist-hit villages in Balaghat are facing mobile phone network problem. The places where this problem exists, include Mohanpur, Chalisbodi, Kaweli, and Kasangi in the District. The Maoists are losing the little foothold they had in Madhya Pradesh. Addressing the existing lacunae in the State, and the augmentation of security and developmental would help thwart any remaining opportunities for a LWE revival in the region.

Ralph Nader: Trump’s Autocratic Moves Toward Corporate Fascism – ...	Trump has mused publicly about his fondness for Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s 'elected' dictator, and how he accomplished commanding control over his people. Trump and his loyal Trumpeteer and Musketeer cohorts are taking an American-style approach, step by faster step, far ahead of the conventional resistance. Step One is to announce that you are a STRONGMAN ruling by largely unlawful Executive Orders and ignoring the laws that demand congressional action. Step Two is to dominate the news cycle and expand your own 'news' media, such as Trump’s for-profit company Truth Social. Trump is a juggernaut of declarations, attacks on perceived opponents or 'woke' activity, and he lies about conditions in the country and the world, and more lies about his false successes. He has regular meetings at the White House with apprehensive reporters who know they are getting played, but relay his sound bites, often unrebutted to the people (such as his false outbursts about U.S. AID’s activities abroad). Step Three is to always be on the offensive and never admit mistakes or to being wrong or ignorant about anything. This puts the resistance on the defensive, reacting instead of proactively keeping Trump off balance. This tactic is working to keep the hapless Democrats still in disarray, like 'deer-in-the-headlights.' This freeze led to the Democrats’ ignominious defeat on November 5 by the most politically vulnerable GOP presidential candidate ever. The Democrats blew an opportunity to use the two month interregnum between the election and Trump’s inauguration to hold public hearings in the Senate laying down challenges on very popular agendas opposed by the GOP (to raise the minimum wage, expand the child tax credit, increase social security benefits frozen for over forty years, tax the under-taxed, sometimes zero-taxed, super rich and giant corporations, and crack down on corporate crooks exploiting consumers and workers, especially on health insurance and credit transactions.) Instead, the Democrats disgracefully took their vacations and departed with a whimper on January 20th. Step Four is to push ferociously plutocratic redirection, disruptions and suspensions of federal agencies so as to benefit enriching the super-rich like Musk and Trump. This means firing the law enforcers against corporate crime, such as major contracting fraud, and stealing from Medicare, Medicaid, and the bloated defense budget. Step Five is to redirect massive monies (such as from Medicaid) from America’s social safety net to pay for even more military dollars and tax cuts for the rich and big corporations than Trump gave them in 2017. These cuts were never seriously challenged by the Biden Administration or Congressional Democrats like House Ways and Means Chair Rep. Richard Neal (D – MA). This brazen move is so cruel that some GOP Congressional toadies are beginning to quiver since many Medicaid recipients were Trump voters and people are turning out at crowded town meetings to loudly berate the surprised Republicans. Step Six is to deeply consolidate Der Fuhrer’s power inside government and outside countervailing forces. Trump fired top military generals without cause, pushed out the chief lawyers for the three military services and replaced them with heel-clicking loyalists ready to obey any illegal order in violation of the Nuremberg rules. Remember that the unstable Trump has his finger on the nuclear trigger. Throwing out competent civil servants in agencies dedicated to helping Americans in need (Meals on Wheels, Head Start) and replacing them with clenched-teeth Trumpers now wrecking or illegally closing down federal agencies (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) devoted to auto safety, airline safety, workplace safety, environmental, climate, health protection, pandemic preparedness, and consumer protection from relentless profiteering, and protection of fair labor standards and practices. Step Seven is using the withholding of federal grants and spewing of propaganda to reduce important research and free speech on university and college campuses, intimidating and suing the corporate owners of the mainstream media to get in line or else face exclusion from the White House press corps and face FCC investigations of the radio and TV business, including NPR and PBS. Who’s left, you might say, to stop Trump, who is on the road to a deep corporate fascist state? The answer is: THE PEOPLE, taking their sovereign power under the Constitution to protest with specific demands, and to fully use the courts, give backbone to the media and launch a giant 'You’re Fired' march on Washington in the Spring for a groundswell behind Impeachment. Trump is harming all Americans – Red State, Blue State, conservatives and liberals which can bring together a left/right movement changing Congress in the 2026 elections. He is rescinding huge grants on renewable energy projects mostly going to Red States. He is canceling or suspending millions of government contracts to small business contractors or subcontractors. He is unemploying thousands of their workers every day, fueling inflation with steep tariffs, shaking the stock markets, fomenting chaos, anxiety and dread through American households and the business community itself. Will Trump get away with what he is wrecking and self-enriching? Trump and his crew of demolitionists, led by the Musk and his poisonous Tusks recognize no boundaries, no legal or moral limits. My sense is NO. This guess is based on the immediate energy, courage and smart defiance by the growing resistance from all backgrounds around the country. Time is of the essence before the next step toward a dangerous police state arrives. — A CLARION CALL FOR LARGE ORGANIZED RALLIES BACK HOME WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THE CRIMINAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP OF THE TRUMP/MUSK ONGOING WRECKING OF AMERICA AND AMERICANS. CRITICAL PROTECTIVE LIFELINES ARE BEING ELIMINATED IN ALL STATES – RED AND BLUE – endangering the health, safety, and economic, well-being of Americans – workers, small business, the elderly, the infirm, the children, the air, water, and undermines protection against rising epidemics and violent climate damage to communities. TRUMP/MUSK are slashing emergency services provided by our federal workers from the FAA to FEMA to EPA the monitoring of dangerous hotspots of toxic chemicals. TRUMP/MUSK are already unlawfully violating contracts and cutting off millions dollars in federal payments for small business contractors. This, of course, harms the workers in these firms. Efforts for cleaner air and water, and key farm programs are being dismantled. To enrich themselves and other billionaires, TRUMP/MUSK are cutting thousands of skilled IRS investigators focused on big-time tax evasion by the Super-Rich. There is a criminally insane takeover of our government that every day is dictating, without Congressional authority, deadly actions that amount to a dictatorship. TRUMP/MUSK are the 'an enemy of the people.' This is not what Trump supporters voted for. They did not vote for a Kleptocracy that goes after people’s programs and that does nothing to stop the hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate welfare, corporate crime against US taxpayers (such as fraud inflicted on Medicare and Medicaid), and bloated big business contracts with Uncle Sam that are now not being investigated. Saving our country from the cruel and vicious dictatorship seizing our government can only come from the people – Americans of all political backgrounds who show up and speak up at rallies, preferably outside local Congressional offices (with their Senators and Representatives invited) – rural, suburban, urban communities nationwide.. The TRUMP/MUSK overthrow of the existing corporate state, can soon become a POLICE STATE. Actions by citizens must expand rapidly before the egomaniacal, openly lying, vengeful TRUMP throws our beloved country into anarchical convulsions leading to massive disasters. The Founding Fathers freed America from the tyrant King George III and gave us the Constitution to block any future Kings. Trump, who wants to be a King said, 'I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.' Respect the trust bequeathed to us from our first Patriots in 1776 and 1783. Mobilize and galvanize NOW.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHnaW42jO4oa7	2025-03-03T15:58:02-08:00	
Zelenskyy, Trump Spar Anew About Russia’s War On Ukraine	President Donald Trump says the Ukrainian leader’s assessment that the end of Russia’s war with his country 'is still very, very far away' is 'the worst statement' he could have made and that 'America will not put up with it for much longer!' After Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in a heated exchange in the White House last Friday, they sparred again Monday from a distance about a possible end to the conflict. Zelenskyy offered his opinion that the war was unlikely to end soon as he left London Sunday night after winning wide support from European leaders for continued military assistance for Kyiv’s forces and said he expected the same from the United States, Ukraine’s biggest arms benefactor. 'I think our relationship [with the U.S.] will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,' Zelenskyy said. 'I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America' to keep aid flowing. But Trump balked at Zelenskyy’s conclusion, saying on the Truth Social media platform Monday, 'It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S.' 'Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,' Trump said, 'What are they thinking?' Zelenskyy later said on X, 'It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest [as] possible.' 'We are working together with America and our European partners and very much hope for U.S. support on the path to peace,' Zelenskyy said. 'Peace is needed as soon as possible.' Trump has pushed to end the fighting, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian fighters, along with Ukrainian civilians, but Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump is attempting to settle the conflict on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Russia currently holds about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has been slowly capturing more land in fighting in eastern Ukraine. No peace negotiations have been scheduled. Zelenskyy also said Sunday his country remained ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the U.S., and that he believes he can salvage relations with Trump. The two sides were expected to sign an agreement last week during Zelenskyy’s visit, but the arrangement fell apart after the heated exchanges with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine counts on U.S. aid in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion. 'I think stopping such assistance will only help [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' Zelenskyy said. 'And because of that, I think that the United States and representatives of the civilized world, leaders of this world, definitely won't help Putin.' Trump cast Zelenskyy as ungrateful during their Friday meeting and had sought the minerals deal to reimburse the United States for the billions of dollars in aid it has provided to Ukraine. Trump has promoted the need to end the war and has held a phone call with Putin in addition to senior U.S. officials meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss the first stages of a potential peace deal without Ukrainian officials involved in the talks. Trump said Sunday on Truth Social: 'We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our Country - So that we don't end up like Europe!' But after seeing Zelenskyy’s comment about peace prospects, Trump quickly pivoted back to assailing the Ukrainian leader. That followed the talks Sunday in London during which British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told 18 allies that with the United States wavering in its support for Ukraine, Europe finds itself 'at a crossroads in history.' The British leader said that with no guarantee of U.S. involvement to act as a backup military support for would-be peacekeeping forces, 'Europe must do the heavy lifting' in securing peace in Ukraine. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told reporters Monday, 'We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security. ... They have to invest in the capability to do that. They've certainly shown a will.' But Waltz said White House officials remain perplexed why the U.S.-Ukraine minerals mining deal fell apart, saying Zelenskyy 'could have been left with an economic guarantee that would have benefited Ukraine, and I think the world, for a generation. So, it's really confounding to us why we had kind of such hostility coming in.' Unlike in Washington, Zelenskyy was warmly embraced at the summit by many of the European heads of state, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and NATO chief Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy supporters rallied outside Starmer’s residence in support of Ukraine. As the leaders gathered Sunday, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned, 'We urgently have to rearm Europe' and 'prepare for the worst' on the continent. Starmer, when he first greeted Zelenskyy on Saturday, unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. Starmer said Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. The Kremlin said in remarks aired Sunday that the United States' dramatic shift in Europe foreign policy toward Russia is largely aligned with Moscow's vision. 'The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state television that was recorded last Wednesday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHtvZ7qDHkLeF	2025-03-03T15:56:09-08:00	
Xi Warns Of Economic ‘Difficulties’ Ahead Of National People’s Co...	By Xi Zian, Qian Lang and Lucie Lo Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has warned of 'many difficulties and challenges' for China’s economy ahead of the annual session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing this week. In an article published in the ideological party journal Qiushi on Monday -- two days before the congress opens -- Xi warned of the 'many risks and hidden dangers' facing China’s economy, before alluding to the threats of further U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 'At present, the adverse effects of changes in the external environment have deepened, and our country’s economy still faces many difficulties and challenges,' Xi wrote in the piece. U.S. President Donald Trump last month imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports in retaliation for what he said was Beijing’s refusal to stop the outflow of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Beijing then introduced a 15% retaliatory tariff on certain U.S. energy exports to China. Last week, Trump warned he would ramp that rate up a further 10% on March 4. As a presidential candidate last year, Trump vowed tariffs of 'more than' 60% on Chinese imports. Beijing is now 'studying and formulating countermeasures' in the event that those tariffs go ahead, the party-backed Global Times newspaper cited an anonymous source as saying on Monday. 'The countermeasures will likely include both tariffs and a series of non-tariff measures, and U.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,' the paper quoted the source as saying. China’s economic troubles While they mull countermeasures, though, officials in Beijing have maintained they would prefer to forget about tariffs altogether. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press briefing on Monday that there are 'no winners' in a tariff war. 'The U.S. attempt to politicize and weaponize trade and economic issues, levy tariff hikes on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl and create blocks to its normal trade, investment and economic cooperation with China will only harm its own economic interests and international credibility,' Lin said. China is ready to engage in 'dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect,' Lin added. 'In the meanwhile, we will take all measures necessary to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,' he said. The pending trade war comes at a time of economic stress in China. Since the start of the U.S.-China trade war under the first Trump administration, Xi has appealed for restructuring to replace exports with domestic consumption as the main driver of growth. But three years of zero-COVID restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs and restrictions has prompted many manufacturers to relocate away from China and spooked foreign investors. Meanwhile, widespread unemployment and a burst real estate bubble has made life much harder for ordinary Chinese. Those concerns were reiterated in Xi’s article, which pulled heavily from China’s Central Economic Work Conference in December. 'We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence and strive to transform positive factors from all aspects into development results,' Xi wrote, adding that expanded domestic demand isn’t just a quick fix but 'a strategic move.' Growth figures questioned Struggling Chinese exporters told RFA Mandarin that the new tariffs proposed by Trump will further harm their businesses. The head of an electronics factory in Shenzhen who gave only the surname Ge for fear of reprisals said that the value of her company’s exports to the United States has been slashed in half since last October, and that tariffs will make things worse. 'Some taxes are paid by U.S. importers, which pushes up prices,' she said. 'U.S. importers usually pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers, making our goods more expensive.' Ge has cut the number of employees from 17 to just seven, while the sales team has been slashed from 10 to four. 'Chinese exports may lose market share to competitors in Vietnam, Indonesia and other countries as U.S. importers look for other suppliers,' she said. Political commentator Willy Lam told RFA Mandarin there is still hope that Trump won’t carry out his threat to impose tariffs above 60%. 'The 10% increase in tariffs ... is still lower than the rates Trump mentioned in 2024 of 60% or more,' Lam said. 'In general, Trump’s attitude towards Xi Jinping is milder than expected.' Analysts expect growth to be set around the 5% mark during this week’s congress, and there has also been speculation about the possibility of renewed economic stimulus packages. 'The general public in China is short of money,' Lam said. 'Most importantly, they lack confidence in the government right now.' U.S.-based economic commentator Qin Weiping cited falling marriage rates and birth rates as an indicator of low economic confidence, as young people increasingly struggle to make ends meet. 'People have no confidence in the economy, or in the future,' he said. 'So demand for residential property is naturally weaker.... It will be hard to fix the real estate problem because this is a vicious cycle.' The government should consider hiring more graduates as civil servants, Qin suggested, citing the 12.22 million who graduated in 2025 alone, swelling the ranks of the young unemployed. Xie Tian, ​​a professor at the Aiken School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said China’s growth figures were questionable in any case, alleging the numbers were fudged for political reasons. 'No-one believes it -- whether they say it’s 5% or 15% -- because that’s basically impossible,' Xie said. 'If the economic growth rate was 5%, their unemployment rate wouldn’t be that high.' But others noted a growing conundrum in China’s recent efforts to stimulate domestic growth without relying on traditional exports. Qin, the economic commentator, noted Chinese officials appeared increasingly focussed in their official documents on achieving growth through artificial intelligence, which necessitates fewer workers. Only further investment in labor-intensive industries would solve China’s problem of dampened domestic demand, he said, by putting more spending money into the pockets of China’s consumers. 'Give them a level playing field and allow the economy to get on the right track ... which will gradually solve the problem of unemployment,' he said. 'People need to feel that business is good, money is easy to make, and that life is getting better and better.' 'It’s that simple.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHu2hgJ6wVZtu	2025-03-03T15:53:30-08:00	
Saudi Opposition Welcome To Return Home: Head of State Security	Saudi opposition staying overseas are welcome to return home without any fear of punishment, Abdulaziz Al-Howairini, head of the Presidency of State Security, said in an interview on MBC’s 'Hekayat Waad' program during Ramadan. 'Under the directives of the crown prince, if there are no lawsuits filed against you for homicide, theft or assault, and you were misled, the state will welcome you and will not punish you,' he said. 'If a person has not actually committed a crime, but only entertained the thought of it, the state will address this issue and fix it.' Al-Howairini, quoting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said: 'Anyone who decides to return, without having any lawsuits filed against them for assault, homicide, or other violent acts, and if their actions were limited to opposition or they were exploited by haters or received money at some point or were misled, they are welcome to come back without fear of punishment.' He added that the Kingdom’s embassies were fully aware of the new directive, and nationals seeking assistance can contact a designated number (990) where they can provide their name and location and request to communicate with their family members. 'We receive numerous calls, but rest assured, we do not shame those individuals,' Al-Howairini said, guaranteeing the confidentiality of communications.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHt2XSO3H3KkE	2025-03-03T15:50:34-08:00	
Croatia’s Ruling HDZ Regains Majority After Gun-Firing MP’s Relea...	By Vuk Tesija The ruling Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, has regained its slender majority in Croatia’s parliament after Homeland Movement MP Josip Dabro – who is charged with violating the rights of a child and possessing illegal weapons – was released from custody on Monday. He had been in custody since Thursday due to the risk of influencing witnesses. Leaving Osijek prison at around 3:30 p.m., after all the witnesses to the crimes he is charged with had been questioned, Dabro did not give a statement. But he told the gathered journalists that he felt 'like a bullet'. He was detained after videos were leaked of him firing off a Kalashnikov and giving his underage son a weapon. His party, the DP, is the junior partner to the centre-right HDZ whose coalition government remained without a majority for four days, while Dabro was in custody. But its lack of a majority was not put to a test because parliament did not meet during that time. After last week’s parliamentary session at which his immunity was lifted, Dabro said that when he got out of prison, he would reconsider support for the ruling coalition, which holds 75 of the 151 seats in parliament. But according to the Homeland Movement, which stood by its MP the entire time, the stability of the coalition and Dabro’s vote in parliament were not at risk. Berto Salaj, a Political Science Professor at the University of Zagreb, told BIRN that the DP was in no hurry for an early election. 'Their support is very weak. They would like to show themselves to be an important factor, not just a pendant of the HDZ, but they won’t go all the way because they know this means new elections – and then they could disappear from parliament,' Salaj said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHj8jCktGlx2y	2025-03-03T15:47:39-08:00	
‘Victory, Not Surrender’: Seattle Gathers To Show Solidarity With...	Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Seattle on Saturday, rallying in solidarity with Ukraine just a day after the extraordinary Oval Office clash between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Axios described it as 'perhaps the most epic televised foreign policy row in history.' The meeting escalated when Trump and Vance lashed out at Zelensky after he asked what would happen if Putin violated a ceasefire agreement. The hostility from Trump’s team sparked a global outpouring of support for Ukraine, with many world leaders publicly supporting Zelensky. ​In response to a global outpouring of support for Ukraine following the recent Oval Office confrontation, the White House highlighted endorsements from Republican members of Congress backing President Trump's stance. For instance, Representative Pat Harrigan stated, 'America's priorities come first. @POTUS and @VP made it clear—Ukraine's interests are not America's interests.' However, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks with the party and strongly condemned the administration’s handling of the situation, warning that the U.S. appears to be shifting away from Ukraine and aligning itself with Putin’s interests. 'This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine,' Murkowski wrote on social media. 'It ends with a tense, shocking conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.' She further expressed deep concern about what this shift means for American credibility and global democracy. 'I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now, I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.' Meanwhile, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev took to social media to praise Trump's efforts, writing: 'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'' Seattle Shows Support The Seattle rally, adorned with American and Ukrainian flags, featured banners condemning Trump and the trajectory of his administration’s policies. Protesters denounced efforts to strong-arm Ukraine and called on Washington to stand firmly with Kyiv in defense of democracy against Russian aggression. Rev. Father Andrii Matlak of the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Seattle emphasized the significance of standing with Ukraine during these critical times. 'It is important to be with Ukrainians. As the world has shown its support for Ukraine, we want to express our gratitude, to the entire world, from the Ukrainian nation, from our president, and from the soldiers on the front line who are fighting for truth.' He addressed the broader implications of Ukraine’s struggle, stating: 'We are trying to bring that truth to the entire world. What is happening is not okay, and the world needs to understand that we as Ukrainians are fighting for life, not just for survival, but for the future of our generations, for the future of the entire world, and for democracy itself.' Father Andrii concluded his commentary with a blessing: 'May God bless the United States, and may God bless the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian nation.' Kimi Kinoshita, a resident of Bainbridge Island, emphasized her unwavering support for Ukraine. 'We're here because we've always supported Ukraine's right to exist.' Mykola Dolgalov, a Ukrainian living in Washington state, condemned the events in the Oval Office, calling them a travesty and a failure of U.S. leadership. 'I'm here today because what happened in the Oval Office was a travesty. That is not how international diplomacy should be conducted. America must be the leader of the free world, and an American president should never align himself with dictators like Putin.' He emphasized that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations concerning its future. 'We cannot allow negotiations to take place without Ukraine at the table. Ukraine must be strong. Right now, it is not only defending itself—it is protecting Europe and American interests.' Mykola was clear in his criticism of Trump’s handling of the situation. 'What happened yesterday, and Trump’s position in general, is not just bad for Ukraine, it’s bad for America and the entire Western world.' A Dangerous Precedent Seattle resident Tom Davis warned that failing to hold aggressors accountable could set a dangerous precedent worldwide. 'We're supporting Ukraine because if we give countries the impression that they can just grab land without consequences, it will make the world more dangerous for everyone.' He pointed to the potential ripple effects beyond Ukraine. 'China and many other countries could get the wrong idea. If we allow this to happen unchecked, it sets a precedent for future conflicts.' For Davis, the principle at stake is the right of nations to determine their own destiny. 'People need to determine their own future. Self-determination for Ukraine, self-determination for every country.' Maurice Prather, also from Seattle, touched on the importance of defending democracy and standing against tyranny. 'I support Ukraine for a very simple reason—democracy is worth fighting for. When a sovereign country is invaded, appeasement is not an option. The aggressor must be pushed out.' He emphasized that resisting dictatorships has always been a fundamental American value. 'As Americans, we have always fought against tyranny. We have always stood against dictatorships. That is what we should do—and that is what we must continue to do.' An Embarrassment for the Country Bill Bonney, who lives in Sammamish, condemned Trump’s handling of the situation, calling it an embarrassment on the global stage. 'What Trump just did is embarrassing to us as Americans. To think that this is how we are now seen in the international community. It’s disgraceful.' For Bonney, showing up at the rally was about taking real action, beyond just words. 'Coming to something like this is more than just writing a note. It’s about putting your body out there and saying: Yes, I know we are doing wrong if we don’t support Ukraine to the end,' said Bonney. 'Ukraine is helping us maintain democracy in the world. This won’t be over in a week or a month. If Putin is allowed to take Ukraine, he will find a way to move into the next country. Then it will be Europe versus whoever, and eventually, the United States will have to step in.' Standing Up for Ukraine Ukrainian-American Ruvim Burich explained why he felt compelled to attend the rally, emphasizing his deep connection to his community and the importance of standing up for Ukraine. 'I showed up to the rally because I have a deep emotional connection with my community that transcends continents, countries, and political parties.' He stressed that everyone has a role to play in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty, whether on the battlefield, in support roles, or through advocacy. 'As an American-born Ukrainian, I believe it is every individual's responsibility to stand up for what they believe in and make their voice heard.' 'Some have the opportunity to fight on the front lines, some work in support roles, and others create awareness and bring attention to the core issues affecting their homeland,' said Burich. 'Whether locally or abroad, we all have a role to play. I came to bring awareness and to be one of the voices for Ukraine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHpep1FRUe5QQ	2025-03-03T15:43:38-08:00	
Pope Francis Had Two Episodes Of ‘Acute Respiratory Insufficiency...	By Kristina Millare Pope Francis on Monday had two episodes of acute respiratory insufficiency, according to the latest health update from the Vatican. The Holy Father was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 and has since been treated for respiratory infections, double pneumonia, and mild kidney insufficiency, alongside his other chronic illnesses. 'The Holy Father presented two episodes of acute respiratory insufficiency, caused by significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm,' the Holy See Press Office shared on Monday. Gemelli Hospital medical staff performed two bronchoscopies March 3 to 'remove large secretions' from the 88-year-old pontiff’s airways. Though the pope’s medical condition remained stable, though complex, over the weekend, the Holy Father previously experienced a bronchospasm last Friday, which had led to an episode of 'vomiting with inhalation.' The Vatican said the Holy Father was 'alert, oriented, and cooperative' during the procedures and resumed 'noninvasive mechanical ventilation' Monday afternoon. After more than two weeks of hospitalization, Gemelli medical staff said the pope’s prognosis 'remains guarded.' Since the pope’s admission into the hospital, hundreds of jubilee pilgrims from around the world have come to Gemelli Hospital to stop and pray for the Holy Father’s recovery as part of their pilgrimage in the Eternal City.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHh3GV-Nj_x0y	2025-03-03T15:41:09-08:00	
Europe’s Strategic Push For Peace In Ukraine – OpEd	The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has compelled European leaders to take a more active role in developing a comprehensive peace plan aimed at stabilizing the region and enhancing European security. While the United States has played a significant role in supporting Ukraine, recent transatlantic tensions have highlighted the need for a more independent European approach. European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are leading efforts to establish a strategic framework that ensures Ukraine's sovereignty while addressing broader security concerns. A key aspect of this plan is the formation of a 'coalition of the willing,' with the United Kingdom, France, and Ukraine at the forefront of efforts to create a unified peace proposal. This initiative illustrates Europe's increasing commitment to maintaining regional stability through diplomatic, military, and economic strategies, despite the challenging circumstances ahead. An outstanding development in this initiative is the current summit in London, where European leaders convened to discuss a cohesive approach to the struggle. Central to the discussions was the need to strengthen European security capabilities and ensure a continuous flow of aid to Ukraine. The strategic goals outlined in the proposed peace plan include maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity, securing its role in future negotiations, and countering Russian aggression through sustained military and economic pressure. This marks a shift in European foreign policy, as the continent seeks to assert its geopolitical agency rather than relying solely on U.S. leadership. One of the key pillars of the European peace plan is military and financial support for Ukraine. As of early 2025, European countries have collectively committed over €100 billion in military assistance, with France and Germany significantly increasing their security contributions. The UK has also pledged an additional £10 billion in direct aid, further solidifying its role as a key player in the coalition. In addition to financial support, European nations have increasingly provided advanced military equipment, including air defense systems, armored vehicles, and artillery. The rationale behind this substantial investment is twofold: to strengthen Ukraine's capacity to defend itself and to demonstrate to Russia that Europe remains united against aggression. Furthermore, discussions are ongoing about enhancing Europe's defense infrastructure, with EU member states committing to increase collective defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2026. Another significant challenge of the peace plan is the diplomatic effort to maintain strong transatlantic ties while ensuring Europe’s independent strategic direction. The ongoing conflict has strained U.S.- European relations, particularly due to shifts in foreign policy priorities following the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. While Washington remains a crucial ally, European leaders recognize the need to reduce their dependence on U.S. military and financial support. Discussions at the London Summit highlighted the importance of balancing cooperation with Washington while demonstrating Europe’s ability to take decisive action. This approach not only addresses growing skepticism in the U.S. about continued involvement in Ukraine but also serves as a strategic move to enhance Europe’s geopolitical standing. A significant advancement in the peace negotiations is the expectation of a swift ceasefire, primarily focusing on air and sea attacks. European diplomats are advocating for a month-long cessation of hostilities to establish a diplomatic framework for broader negotiations. This ceasefire is intended to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected areas, reduce current military tensions, and facilitate constructive dialogue between Ukraine and Russia. However, skepticism persists regarding Moscow’s commitment to uphold such agreements, given previous ceasefire violations. Despite these concerns, European leaders consider this initiative a crucial step toward alleviating the immediate humanitarian crisis while exploring long-term solutions. The peace plan also addresses the enduring economic stress on Russia. Sanctions have been a critical tool in Europe’s strategy, with recent measures including additional restrictions on Russian energy exports, targeted sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, and efforts to limit Moscow’s access to essential technology. In response, Russia has sought to strengthen economic ties with China, Iran, and India, creating a complex geopolitical dynamic that Europe must navigate carefully. While sanctions have weakened the Russian economy, their long-term effectiveness relies heavily on sustained enforcement and broader global cooperation. European policymakers must also address the economic repercussions within their borders, as rising energy costs and inflation present significant domestic challenges. Despite its strategic vision, the European peace initiative faces significant obstacles. Achieving a lasting settlement with Russia remains one of the biggest challenges, as Moscow continues to demand security guarantees that the West finds unacceptable. Additionally, maintaining unity among EU member states with differing views on the conflict presents a unique challenge. While countries like Poland and the Baltic states advocate for a hardline approach, others, such as Hungary, have expressed skepticism about further escalation. Bridging these differences is crucial for ensuring a coherent and effective European strategy. Furthermore, gaining Ukrainian support for any proposed agreement is essential, as Kyiv remains firm in its stance against territorial concessions. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made it clear that any peace deal must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, a position that aligns with European principles but complicates potential negotiations. An urgent issue is the sustainability of European military and economic aid. As the conflict continues into its third month, domestic political pressures in several European countries may lead to calls for reduced economic commitments. Public sentiment about the war is divided, with some segments of the population expressing fatigue over prolonged engagement. European governments must balance the necessity of supporting Ukraine with the political realities of economic strain and shifting public opinion. Ultimately, Europe’s pursuit of a peace plan for Ukraine reflects its strategic autonomy and commitment to stability. While challenging conditions remain in negotiations with Russia, maintaining European unity and providing long-term military and economic support, the current initiative marks a significant shift in European geopolitical strategy. By increasing defense spending, continuing assistance to Ukraine, and demonstrating a capacity for independent action, European leaders aim to create a future where Europe is both a powerful force in international affairs and a guarantor of regional security. The path ahead is complex, but a united and proactive Europe may hold the key to establishing lasting peace in Ukraine. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.

Putin’s Courts Playing Central Role In Keeping Russians Under His...	Repression in the Russian Federation under President Vladimir Putin is usually thought of as being enforced by the Federal Security Service (FSB) and other security agencies. Putin, however, has made the Russian court system a key part of his repressive apparatus. He has transformed what had been, at least occasionally, the last line of defense of Russians’ constitutional rights into Kremlin agencies whose primary function is to suppress those rights and keep Russians from protesting. Putin has succeeded to the point that he now feels free to gloat about it, praising the Russian judiciary on February 20 for preventing Russians from protesting (URA.news, February 20). He has done so in part by reinforcing Soviet-era practices and increasingly restricting rights through trial by jury and many kinds of appeals that Russian citizens gained after 1991. In part, the Kremlin leader has introduced new practices, including having defendants tried far from home, especially, but far from exclusively, in the case of non-ethnically Russian protesters. This ensures that there are fewer demonstrations in support of such defendants and that non-Russian protestors will face judges more inclined to convict them (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 17). That Putin has had to continue to make efforts in this direction, however, demonstrates that some judges in the Russian judicial system are prepared to uphold the law and that their existence may give some hope for some improvement in the post-Putin era. In a speech on February 20, reviewing the actions of the Russian judiciary over the past year, Putin explicitly linked the actions of judges to peace and stability in his country. If Russians see that the courts are just, he argued, they will see their government as just and not listen to those who call on them to protest (URA.news, February 20). The Kremlin leader said that this is what is now happening. There is good reason to conclude, however, that Putin is overstating his case and that despite his efforts, Russians now view the courts less as dispensers of justice as the 1993 Russian Constitution promised but as agents of Russian state power who, just as was the case in Soviet times, can be counted on to find almost everyone the government charges with a crime guilty and impose draconian sentences. The courts are helping to instill fear, and it is that rather than anything else that keeps people off the streets. To achieve what he has so far, Putin has increasingly restored Soviet-era practices that Russia was moving away from in the 1990s. For example, he has restricted the ability of Russians to choose to have jury trials, quite obviously because Russian juries acquit as many as 25 percent of those charged, while Russian judges currently find far fewer than one percent of those on trial not guilty (Yesli byt’ tochnym, May 23, 2024; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, January 26). He has restricted appeals and has limited the ability of defense lawyers to offer extenuating evidence or seek appeals for their clients (IQ Media, April 18, 2016; Window on Eurasia, January 29). Putin has dramatically increased the number of trials held behind closed doors to a level not seen since Stalin’s time (Mediazona, April 27, 2023). He has moved more cases from the civil courts to military ones, thus increasing the likelihood of conviction and more draconian punishments (URA.news, February 20). He has failed to appoint enough judges—today, there are 20 percent fewer of them than authorized—and has thus encouraged trials to be handled in a rushed and rubber-stamp fashion that benefits prosecutors (Akcenty, February 1). Far more than his Soviet predecessors, Putin has increasingly had criminals tried not in their home areas or where the crimes were committed but far away to limit the ability of their supporters to come and demonstrate on their behalf. Protesters in Ingushetia and, more recently, in Bashkortostan are exhibit A for this practice (Fortanga, April 13, 2021). The greatest innovation of Putin’s courts has been to adopt a system often used in other countries—court and even judge 'shopping.' In the United States, for example, lawyers often seek to bring suits in jurisdictions or before specific judges they believe will be more likely to rule in their favor. Such selection, even by prosecutors, however, is generally impossible in criminal cases. In Putin’s Russia, in contrast, as a new study from Novaya Gazeta Europe that examined thousands of such cases finds, it is instead prosecutors who are identifying jurisdictions and even specific judges who can be counted on to take positions the Kremlin approves of that the state and sending those charged with political crimes to be judged there rather than anywhere else. That study found that there are now jurisdictions and even judges who are viewed as specialists in these crimes, given that they have heard so many cases and because they have a record of handing down sentences that the Kremlin approves of (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 17). Despite the restoration of Soviet-era practices and the introduction of this new one, Putin has not achieved all he wants in the judiciary. There is a great variety of sentences Russian judges hand down in the cases of those charged with the same crime, including politically sensitive offenses (Yesli byt’ tochnym, October 27, 2023). For example, Russian jurists differ widely in rulings about vacating charges if the accused agrees to serve in Ukraine, and they vary in the fines they levy for those who engage in anti-war protests (Sever.Realii, March 15, 2023; Verska, March 1, 2024; see EDM, August 7, 2024). Almost certainly, given his celebration of what he has achieved via the courts so far, Putin can be counted on to try to ensure that Russian courts will play an ever more prominent role in that direction in the future. The enormous size of the Russian judiciary and the Russian Federation, however, likely means that he will not fully achieve his goal of complete subordination and homogenization of that branch of the Russian government. For him, that will be a disappointment or even a defeat, but for the future of justice in Russia after he passes from the scene, such diversity in judicial responses is a hopeful sign that that country will ultimately be able to recover from Putin’s repression.

Eyes In The Sky, Firepower On Demand: The Indian Army’s Growing D...	The Indian Army is undergoing a significant transformation in its approach to modern warfare, with an increasing emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The evolving battlefield dynamics, as evidenced by recent conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan wars, have demonstrated the crucial role of drones in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), precision strikes, and logistical operations. In response, the Indian Army is expanding its UAV fleet and integrating indigenous drone technology to enhance operational effectiveness and maintain a strategic edge. Enhancing Surveillance and Strike Capabilities With persistent security challenges along India’s borders with China and Pakistan, UAVs play a critical role in maintaining continuous surveillance and executing precision strikes when necessary. The Indian Army is actively acquiring long-range, high-endurance drones capable of operating beyond 1,000 km and flying at altitudes exceeding 30,000 feet. These UAVs are designed to provide real-time intelligence, minimize risks to soldiers, and enable rapid response to emerging threats. The need for such advanced drone technology has been highlighted by increasing cross-border infiltrations and evolving hybrid warfare tactics. Currently, the Indian Army operates a fleet of approximately 50 medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones, including the Heron Mark-I and Mark-II, along with Searcher-II drones, primarily used for surveillance and reconnaissance. In contrast, China has over 2,000 UAVs, including combat drones like the Cai Hong-4 (CH-4), CH-5, and Hongdu GJ-11 ‘Sharp Sword’. To bridge this capability gap, India is investing in advanced UAVs with greater operational endurance and strike capabilities. Indigenous Drone Development and Private Sector Involvement As part of India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the Indian Army is prioritizing the development of domestically manufactured drones to reduce dependence on foreign technology. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed UAVs such as the Rustom series, but ongoing efforts are focused on enhancing their capabilities to meet operational requirements. The Archer-NG, an upcoming weaponized MALE drone, is expected to feature an operational altitude of 30,000 feet, a 1,000 km range, and the ability to carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. Additionally, the Indian private sector is playing an increasingly vital role in drone development. IG Drones, a domestic drone technology firm, secured a contract to supply Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) and First-Person View (FPV) drones to the Army. These indigenously manufactured drones, built without Chinese components, are designed for operations in high-altitude and urban environments, offering tactical reconnaissance and logistics support in challenging terrains. Him-Drone Trials and High-Altitude Warfare Recognizing the need for drones capable of operating in extreme conditions, the Indian Army conducted the Him-Drone trials in September 2024 at Wari-La, Ladakh, located at an altitude of 15,200 feet. This event, held in collaboration with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), tested various drone platforms for high-altitude operations. The five categories of drones evaluated included surveillance drones for real-time intelligence gathering, loitering munitions designed to strike enemy targets with precision, kamikaze drones programmed to self-destruct upon impact, logistics drones for transporting supplies across difficult terrains, and electronic warfare drones for disrupting enemy communication and radar systems. The success of these trials paves the way for the Army to procure high-altitude drones tailored to countering threats along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Security Challenges and Countermeasures The increased deployment of UAVs also brings cybersecurity and operational risks, particularly concerning drones with foreign components. Reports of drone hijacking incidents near the Pakistan border have prompted the Indian Army to enforce stricter certification requirements for drone manufacturers. A Technical Evaluation Committee has been established under the Northern Command and Army Design Bureau (ADB) to ensure that drones deployed for military use do not contain critical components of Chinese origin, safeguarding national security. Furthermore, the upcoming induction of MQ-9B Predator drones, under a ₹32,350 crore contract with the United States, marks a significant boost in India’s strategic drone capabilities. These long-endurance UAVs, armed with Hellfire missiles and precision-guided bombs, will enhance India’s ability to conduct surgical strikes and deep reconnaissance missions. Future of Drone Warfare in the Indian Army The Indian Army’s emphasis on UAVs and RPA systems signifies a broader shift towards network-centric warfare. The expansion of drone capabilities, along with the Make in India initiative, aims to establish India as a leading defense technology hub. With increasing investment in AI-driven drone operations, swarm drone technology, and autonomous strike capabilities, India is positioning itself to be at the forefront of modern warfare. As drone warfare continues to shape military strategies worldwide, India’s proactive approach to UAV modernization ensures that the Army remains prepared to counter emerging threats effectively. The integration of indigenous drone technology, combined with strategic collaborations, is set to revolutionize the battlefield, making unmanned aerial systems a core component of India’s defense strategy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5e517TJbm2Z	2025-03-01T17:55:58-08:00	
China Tackles Trump’s Trade War And Global Headwinds – Analysis	China’s political calendar is again focusing on one of the most anticipated events of the year, the Two Sessions. To be held from March 5, these annual meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) are a chance to see where the country is heading strategically. With Beijing encountering more and more difficult international relations, this year’s sessions will focus on both domestic and international issues, especially against the background of the protectionist trade policy and erratic diplomacy of U.S. President Donald Trump. What China does at the Two Sessions will not only define its own economic growth but also influence the world economy as a whole. The main event of the Two Sessions will be the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Qiang. This report will present the main objectives, economic goals, and policy objectives for the next year. Since 2025 marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan in China, much attention will be paid to how effective Beijing has been in achieving its objectives in the previous plan and what adjustments it will make in drawing up its next development plan. The discussions and reports that will be made available during the sessions will help to reveal the general vision of the leadership towards the 15th Five-Year Plan, which will define the future of the country’s economy and technology for several years. China’s economic performance remains central to these deliberations. The country is still expected to account for 21 percent of global growth in the next five years. As the world’s biggest trading partner and an innovative power, its policies are significant for the whole world. But the new economic confrontationalism from Washington—the restriction on Chinese technology firms, the increase of tariffs on electric vehicles, and the pressure on allies to reduce economic links with Beijing—has left China with no choice but to readjust its strategy to maintain its momentum despite these headwinds. Among the subjects to be discussed, China’s strategy of technological self-reliance will be one of the most important. At least twice in the past year, President Xi Jinping has stressed that the country needs to become a technological powerhouse to ensure its long-term economic success. The United States and its allies have restricted semiconductor exports and advanced technology transfer, so Beijing has increased its efforts to develop its own capabilities. Policy measures related to the improvement of the country’s AI, chip manufacturing, and other high-tech industries are likely to be revealed during the Two Sessions. The government is also expected to introduce new incentives and regulatory frameworks to support private-sector players in these areas, reinforcing their role in driving China’s technological transformation. In recent months, Xi has personally engaged with major business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, Huawei’s Ren Zhengfei, and Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, to assure them of the government’s commitment to fostering an environment that enables private enterprises to thrive. These efforts are part of a larger effort to revitalize confidence in China’s economic model as foreign investment is coming under more scrutiny due to geopolitical tensions. New policy measures that will improve market access, decrease bureaucratic delays, and ensure equal treatment are likely to be revealed during the Two Sessions in an attempt to counter the negative impact of Trump’s increasing trade restrictions. Beyond domestic economic policies, the leadership will also address mounting fiscal challenges. The real estate sector, which used to be an engine of growth, has been in a slump for the past few years. Beijing has already been making serious efforts to stabilize the market through the implementation of various stimulus measures, but more policies may be announced to boost this sector. Similarly, the issue of local government debt will be on the main agenda. Since many provincial and municipal governments have financial challenges, the central government will have to find new ways of addressing the debt levels as it continues with the infrastructure spending. Another important area of focus will be the expansion of the domestic market. Having assessed the world’s slow growth and trade risks, Chinese leaders understand the need to accelerate internal demand growth as a shield against the external shocks. The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) in December underscored this priority, calling for aggressive measures to encourage consumer spending, which could include tax cuts, subsidies, or other measures that increase income and consumer confidence. The success of these measures will be closely watched, as China seeks to move from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic consumption. In the political sphere, China is prepared for the continued deterioration of relations with the United States. The return of Trump to the White House has already instigated a new round in the trade war, with his administration imposing new tariffs and compelling its allies to distance themselves from Beijing and its financial projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative. The recent action of Panama severing ties with the BRI at the behest of the United States reveals this larger geopolitical contest. China will now try to find new trade partners and diversify its economic relations to reduce the risks that come with Washington’s hostile posture. As the world’s second-largest economy, China’s policy choices carry global significance. Many developing nations are looking toward Beijing for leadership in the fight against Washington’s protectionism and the promotion of a new, fairer world economic order. Against this background, the Two Sessions are not only a domestic policy-setting event but also a message to the international community that China is ready to lead in ensuring economic stability, innovation, and cooperation. The challenge for China lies in sustaining robust growth while managing an increasingly hostile global environment. The decisions made during the Two Sessions will determine the direction of the country for the next few years; whether it will keep rising as one of the world’s economic powers or whether it will experience some setbacks due to pressures from the outside environment.

Bangladesh Students’ Party To Be Neither Pro-India Nor Pro-Pakist...	The Jatiya Nagorik Party (National Citizens' Party) that was launched on February 28 at a massive rally in Dhaka, aims to establish a 'Second Republic' cleansed of 'fascism'. The students of Bangladesh, who led the mass movement that overthrew Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule in August last year, formed a political party of their own with a massive rally in Dhaka on February 28. Named Jatiya Nagorik Party (JNP) or the National Citizens' Party (NCP), the new outfit pledged to build a 'Second Republic' devoid of any trace of 'fascism' and marked by equalitarianism, inclusivity, and non-exploitation. To emphasise inclusivity, the rally began with recitations from the Quran, Gita, the Buddhist Tripitaka, and the Bible. Equally surprisingly, the Bangladesh national anthem, Amar Shonar Bangla (Our Golden Bengal) composed by Rabindranath Tagore was sung despite a call by the Jamaat-e-Islami to replace it. Through recitations from the scriptures of various religions and singing Tagore's Amar Shonar Bangla, the JNP hopes to refute the charge that it is a front for the Jamaat-e-Islami. The JNP envisages a Bangladesh radically different from the First Republic founded by the Awami League leader and founder of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Utterance of his name or his title Bangabandhu (Friend of Bengal) or his slogan 'Joy Bangla' (Victory to Bengal) is taboo for the JNP. In fact, it has been taboo in Bangladesh at the insistence of the student movement. In August 2024, the Bangladesh judiciary had endorsed the Interim Government's plea that 'Joy Bangla' should cease to be the official slogan of the country. With the result, nobody raised the slogan 'Joy Bangla' at Friday's rally. Instead, the Urdu language 'Inquilab Zindabad' (Victory to Revolution) rent the air. Neither pro-India nor pro-Pakistan Nahid Islam, convener of the party, declared at the rally that 'Bangladesh's political landscape will not accommodate pro-India or pro-Pakistan influences.' He emphasized that the party aims to rebuild the State with a focus on national interests and the well-being of Bangladeshi citizens alone. 'We want to talk about the future. We want to move beyond the past and discuss the possibilities of Bangladesh,' Nahid said. JNP Manifesto The JNP released its manifesto at the rally. Here are excerpts - 'The July 2024 Mass uprising has marked the beginning of our struggle to establish a second republic. To achieve this, we must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy through the adoption of a new democratic constitution.' 'One of our primary goals is to draft a new constitution through an elected constituent assembly. Our second republic will ensure a strong national defence system to protect the nation's interests. Rebuilding broken political, social, economic, and cultural institutions and preserving their democratic nature will be our political priority. Only through these efforts can we emerge as a fully democratic state.' 'We strive to cultivate a political culture where unity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit and competence triumph over dynastic politics at all levels of society and the state. There will be no place for corruption and nepotism in our politics.' 'In our second republic, the voices of the marginalised and disadvantaged communities will be brought into the mainstream. In our republic, the common people—and only the common people—will be the supreme source of power. The robust protection of all their democratic and fundamental rights will be the core principle of our politics.' 'We aim to build a pluralistic and prosperous society by preserving the nation's ethnic, social, gender, religious, and cultural values and diversity.) Our republic will ensure strong protections against poverty, inequality, and the abuse of power.' 'No segment of Bangladesh's population will be excluded or criminalised in our second republic. Instead, every citizen will be given equal importance, and their safety and security will be guaranteed.' 'Economically, we aim to establish a self-sufficient, equitable, and sustainable national economy through the proper integration of agriculture, services, and production sectors. Our economy will be sensitive to life, nature, and the environment.' 'Wealth will not be concentrated in the hands of a select few; instead, the equitable redistribution of resources will be the core principle of our economic policies. We will take firm steps to regulate corporate syndicates and vested interests, safeguarding consumer and public welfare.' ' We will position Bangladesh as a strong regional power through economic advancement, fostering regional cooperation and international partnerships. We will build a modern and sustainable economy prioritising science and technology and fostering an innovation-driven culture.' 'We strongly believe that the July 2024 mass uprising was not just a victory against a fascist regime but also a pledge to shape our future. Let us unite, hand in hand, to build a Bangladesh where every citizen's voice is heard—where the struggle for justice and human rights will be at the heart of politics—where equality and human dignity will form the foundation of the state.' 'Our country, our rights, our future—the second republic is not an unattainable dream. It is our solemn commitment!' Call for All-Party Approach JNP's Chief Organizer (Northern Region) Sarjis Alam said: 'If we want to organize Bangladesh properly, all political parties must unite. Then, the future Bangladesh will be a Bangladesh of unity. Hasina has destroyed all institutions of this country. All political parties must unite to restore these institutions.' 'We must collectively ensure justice for the murderer Hasina. We should not go to police stations to seek the release of any criminals.' 'If the major political parties do not allow smaller parties to move forward, another autocracy may be established. We should learn this lesson from the murderer Hasina.' 'Let us come together, hand in hand, to build a Bangladesh where the voice of every citizen will resonate, where the struggle for justice and human rights will be at the core of politics, and where equality and human dignity will form the foundation of the state,' Sarjis said. Leaders from various political parties, including Ganosamhati Andolon, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the 12-party alliance, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Hefazat-e-Islam, the Labour Party, Jatiya Oikya Front, and the Nationalist Democratic Movement, attended the rally. Interestingly, the Ambassador of Pakistan, Syed Ahmed Maroof, was present but not the Indian envoy. 10-Member Leadership Announced The party's top ten leaders have been announced. Former information adviser Nahid Islam is the Convener, while Akhter Hossen is Member Secretary. Samanta Shermeen and Ariful Islam Adeeb have been chosen as Senior Joint Conveners, while Tasnim Jara and Nahida Sarwar (Nova) will be Senior Joint Member Secretaries. Nasiruddin Patwary has been appointed chief coordinator, with Abdul Hannan Masud as joint coordinator. Additionally, Sarjis Alam will be the chief organizer for the northern region, while Hasnat Abdullah will be chief organiser of the southern region. Outside Support The JNP has the full backing of the Interim Government led by Prof.Muhammad Yunus who stated this in his interview to the British paper Financial Times. He said that the students had the right to form a party and pursue their goals, because they led the movement against autocracy. The Jamaat-i-Islami is also a backer of the JNP because it needs an alliance to win seats in parliament. Like the JNP, the Jamaat too is virulently against the Awami League, Sheikh Mujib and Sheikh Hasina. Hasina had banned it. The Jamaat had to wait until Yunus formed a government to get the ban lifted. Both JNP and Jamaat are not for immediate elections as they feel that the country's structure and values should be reformed first before holding elections. And both want the Awami League and its legacy, to be removed root and branch first before holding elections. However, the JNP and the Jamaat will clash on the question of Sharia, women rights etc., because Bangladeshi students stand for women's equal participation in all spheres of public activity including sports, while the Jamaat dubs all modernity as haram and has taken to disruption and attacks on modern women. The other point of divergence between the JNP and the Jamaat is over relations with India. The JNP is realistic enough not to antagonise neighbouring India beyond a point. But the Jamaat is resolutely opposed to India on both religious and political grounds. It is anti-secular and pro-Pakistani to the core and envisages a day when Bangladesh and Pakistan become one again. The Bangladesh National Party (BNP) is in a class of its own. It is secular even as it has had an alliance with the Jamaat in the past. Like the Jamaat, it has been very anti-Awami League. But like the Awami League, the BNP is a moderate party which believes in the electoral process. The BNP is not in favour of a ban on the Awami League, unlike the JNP or the Jamaat. The BNP has had a difficult relationship with India because it identified India with the Awami League, Sheikh Mujib and Sheikh Hasina, its rivals for decades. But the BNP has had periods of good relations with India when India had fallen out with Hasina sometime in the 1990s. The BNP is now cultivating the Hindu minority in Bangladesh as the latter is now leaderless given the fact that its protector, the Awami League, has been suppressed and marginalised. The BNP wants early elections and vigorously disputes the prevailing theory that a new system should be put in place before elections are held. For the BNP, this is putting the cart before the horse, as only an elected parliament can draft an acceptable constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvrxF0AU-gMurN	2025-03-01T17:53:30-08:00	
Indonesia’s Strategic Diplomacy: Balancing Global Powers In 2025 ...	Strategically situated in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has long pursued a non-aligned and impartial foreign policy. Amid rising geopolitical tensions among the United States, Russia, and China, Indonesia continues to manage its international relationships pragmatically. By leveraging economic and security cooperation while safeguarding its national interests and sovereignty, Indonesia effectively balances its global activities. Looking ahead to 2025, Indonesia should refine its approach by enhancing economic diversification, maintaining security independence, and exercising diplomatic neutrality to successfully navigate shifting geopolitical dynamics. The cornerstone of Indonesia's foreign policy is the 'Bebas-Aktif' (Independent and Active) doctrine, established during the early years of independence. This doctrine emphasizes autonomy in international affairs and active participation in promoting global peace. In contemporary terms, it translates into a foreign policy that resists alignment with major power blocs, allowing Indonesia to pursue various partnerships that serve its national interests. By adhering to this principle, Indonesia avoids excessive reliance on any single global power and maintains its strategic flexibility in international relations. As a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia plays a significant role among regional and global participants. It employs ASEAN-centric policies to balance external influences, ensuring that relationships with international actors do not undermine local harmony. This approach strengthens ASEAN's centrality in regional governance and promotes collective resilience against external pressures. Indonesia's membership in ASEAN provides a platform for collaboration and conflict mediation without risking subjugation to foreign powers. Continued economic growth is crucial for Indonesia's foreign policy. The country promotes foreign investment and strengthens trade agreements to drive domestic economic development. While seeking security alliances with various nations to enhance its military capabilities, Indonesia remains dedicated to protecting its sovereignty. This multifaceted approach enables Indonesia to successfully navigate the dynamic geopolitical landscape. Economic development remains a priority, and the ability to attract investments while maintaining sovereignty is essential for its foreign policy goals. Indonesia has significantly benefited from its financial and security ties with the U.S. The U.S. is a critical trading partner and investor, with bilateral trade projected to exceed $32 billion by 2025. Defense relationships have been strengthened through joint exercises and training programs, exemplified by the annual 'Garuda Shield' activities, which enhance Indonesia's military capabilities and interoperability with U.S. forces. However, Indonesia is cautious about becoming overly reliant on American military assistance and strives to maintain its strategic autonomy. This delicate balance allows Indonesia to benefit from U.S. engagement without becoming entangled in the U.S.-China competition. Indonesia and the United States share common interests in promoting democracy, human rights, and regional stability. However, Indonesia is careful to maintain its non-aligned status by ensuring that it fosters relations with the U.S. through an independent foreign policy. By 2025, Indonesia should focus on enhancing economic and security cooperation while proactively diversifying trade to reduce overdependence on any single partner. Indonesia's defense and military cooperation with Russia has historical roots in arms procurement and technology transfer. Despite the challenges posed by Western sanctions, Indonesia continues to seek security cooperation with Russia in 2025. These sanctions have complicated arms transactions, prompting Indonesia to diversify its military partnerships and explore alternative defense technologies. Amid these constraints, Indonesia must carefully balance its military initiatives to ensure the continuity of its security modernization program. Economically, Russia is interested in Indonesia's electricity and infrastructure development. However, its financial engagement is limited compared to Indonesia's relationships with larger partners like China and the U.S. As a result, Russia's financial presence in Indonesia is relatively modest, making this relationship secondary. Indonesia maintains a neutral diplomatic stance on global conflicts involving Russia, including the Ukraine crisis, carefully balancing its position to avoid alienating Western allies. In 2025, Indonesia should focus on economic diversification and technological protection partnerships, steering clear of alignment on contentious geopolitical issues. China's position as Indonesia's largest trading partner and investor highlights the importance of their bilateral relationship. By 2025, Indonesia will finalize its membership in the BRICS organization, signifying a strategic alignment with emerging economies. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has further strengthened economic ties, leading to significant investments in Indonesian infrastructure projects. While these financial engagements bring advantages, they also raise concerns about dependency and sovereignty. Maritime issues present significant challenges. Chinese coast guard incursions into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone around the Natuna Islands have strained bilateral relations. In response, Indonesia has increased military patrols and implemented diplomatic measures to assert its sovereignty. This situation highlights the difficulty of balancing economic cooperation with China and addressing security concerns. While there is a Chinese cultural influence in Indonesia, the country remains cautious about maintaining domestic politics and societal harmony. As a result, Indonesia must navigate its relationship with China carefully. Managing relationships with major powers presents several challenges for Indonesia. Geopolitical pressures stemming from U.S.-China tensions require careful navigation of its non-alignment to avoid being drawn into great power rivalries. The growing strategic competition between these powers in the Indo-Pacific further complicates Indonesia's foreign relations. Additionally, economic dependence on China poses risks, leading Indonesia to seek diversification of its trade and investment sources. While China is Indonesia's largest trading partner, excessive reliance on Chinese investment poses a risk to Indonesia's economic sovereignty. Security issues, particularly in the South China Sea, necessitate a careful balance between security cooperation and the preservation of national sovereignty. Indonesia should focus on enhancing its military capabilities without provoking conflicts with regional stakeholders. Domestic politics and public opinion also influence the coverage instructions for remote areas, requiring the government to align its global engagement with national sentiment. Additionally, political debates surrounding influential family members may further affect Indonesia's foreign policy responsibilities in the long term. Indonesia's pragmatic and adaptable approach to remote area insurance is crucial for maintaining sovereignty and advancing national interests amid global power competitions. By effectively combining economic cooperation, security partnerships, and diplomatic neutrality, Indonesia positions itself as a strong and influential player on the world stage. By enhancing exchange diversification, maintaining a managed safety approach, and leveraging its regional relationships through ASEAN, Indonesia can effectively navigate intense power competition. In 2025 and beyond, the country must bolster its diplomatic engagements, deepen military modernization, and strengthen economic resilience to assert its national interests and maintain strategic autonomy in an increasingly complex global landscape. By staying committed to its independence, Indonesia can effectively manage power dynamics while promoting long-term stability and prosperity.

Pride, Horror, And Concern: What Ukrainians Think About The Trump...	By Serhiy Stetsenko (RFE/RL) -- The heated White House exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vice President JD Vance has touched many Ukrainians in many different ways. Some felt a surge of pride in their wartime leader, while others tempered that pride with growing unease over the future of U.S.-Ukrainian relations -- and what that could mean for their country's three-year war against Russia. 'Raising Your Voice In The Oval Office' For Andriy Veselovskiy, the former Ukrainian ambassador to the European Union, however, the dominant emotion was sheer horror. 'I'm sorry I agreed to do this broadcast with you, because I'm in a very bad mood after what I saw,' Veselovskiy told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on February 28. 'Raising your voice in the Oval Office at the vice president and the president and interrupting both of them is not a style that can help Ukraine's interests.' Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump on February 28 ended in acrimony after a tense exchange of words in the Oval Office. Shortly afterwards, Zelenskyy left and Trump said the Ukrainian leader was disrespectful and could 'come back when he is ready for peace.' Before the meeting broke up, Trump said that Ukraine would have to make compromises and that Kyiv should be more appreciative of U.S. assistance in the country's war against Russia. Zelenskyy pushed for U.S. security commitments and said that there should be 'no compromises with a killer,' a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Oleksiy Honcharenko, a parliamentary deputy for the center-right European Solidarity Party, shared Veselovskiy's sense of horror, saying it was the 'end of relations with Trump.' Those opinions were echoed on the streets of Ukraine. A woman in Rivne, a city in western Ukraine, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that the widely broadcast White House meeting left a 'super negative' impression of Ukraine, 'because we are a country at war and we need aid from the U.S.' Ukraine's diplomacy, she added, 'should have been professional.' Pride In Their President But for other Ukrainians, however, they felt only pride watching their president's exchange in the White House. 'Honestly, I don't know what the consequences will be for Ukraine, but I am sure that we have shown our strength,' another woman told RFE/RL in Rivne. 'Our president showed that we are strong, we will not bend, and we have our own opinion.' Natalia Serhiyenko, a pensioner in Kyiv, told the Associated Press that 'Zelenskyy fought like a lion.' 'They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation,' she said, but Zelenskyy 'was defending Ukraine’s interests.' Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region that borders Russia, also praised Zelenskyy, telling AP that the Ukrainian president stuck to his guns that there could be no peace deal without security assurances for Ukraine. 'Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians,' Syniehubov said. 'We need only a just peace with security guarantees.' As well as pride, for some Ukrainians there was a sense of anger at how they thought Zelenskyy had been treated. 'We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country,' Artem Vasyliev, originally from Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, told Reuters. How Can Relations Be Fixed? Trump, according to Vasyliev, 'doesn’t understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers.' Whether their reaction was one of pride or horror, most Ukrainians had one common concern: how to repair Ukraine's strained relationship with its most important wartime ally. 'We have to consistently strengthen our ties with Europe and focus on Europe and on ourselves,' a woman told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service from Dnipro, a city in central Ukraine. Former ambassador to the EU Veselovskiy said that Zelenskyy's response should have been more restrained and now doubts that the Ukrainian president will be able to get into the White House at all. Oleksandr Merezhko, a parliamentary deputy from Zelenskyy's Servant of the People party, told RFE/RL that, despite any difficulties, Ukraine had to work with Trump because the stakes were so high. 'We have to reduce the tensions,' Merezhko said. 'There are some connections -- congressmen and senators who have influence on Trump.... We need to immediately get in touch with these people.' Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram that he hoped that 'Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us.' 'Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground,' Klitschko wrote.

Trump’s Slush Fund – OpEd	By Vincent Cook In his February 3 Executive Order, President Trump directed his minions to begin planning for establishment of a 'Sovereign Wealth Fund' that he originally touted in a speech to the Economic Club of New York last September. The fund would be on the order of $2 trillion, investing in things like manufacturing hubs, defense, and medical research. The order states: 'It is the policy of the United States to maximize the stewardship of our national wealth for the sole benefit of American citizens. To this end, it is in the interest of the American people that the Federal Government establish a sovereign wealth fund to promote fiscal sustainability, lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses, establish economic security for future generations, and promote United States economic and strategic leadership internationally.' This order reflects a new anti-capitalist economic orientation of the Republican Party, embracing fallacies that government can somehow be made efficient, that tariffs can perform miracles like saving the fiat dollar from destruction, and that selecting the right executive personnel is a substitute for rule of law. Republicans have evidently forgotten the eternal economic truth that planning not driven by free markets doesn’t work; government shouldn’t be trying to pick winners and losers in the business world. Whatever claim Republicans had to being pro-liberty, pro-Constitution, pro-free market, etc. is gone now. To be sure, it is undeniably true that America is not on a path towards fiscal sustainability and future economic security, and it is losing its economic and strategic leadership in the international arena. However, one does not 'maximize the stewardship' of American wealth by forcing the American people to hand it over to presidential appointees. The fact that numerous other states possess such collectivized investment arrangements (a talking point that Trump repeatedly stresses) is not a valid excuse for America to commit a similar blunder. In a passage from A Critique of Interventionism, making the case that government-controlled enterprises can’t escape the inefficiencies of bureaucratic management, Ludwig von Mises explained how responsible stewardship of capital goods is, in fact, maximized by private ownership of the means of production in conjunction with an unhampered market: The entrepreneur operates on his own responsibility. If he does not produce at lowest costs of capital and labor what consumers believe they need most urgently, he suffers losses. But losses finally lead to a transfer of his wealth, and thus his power of control over means of production, to more capable hands. In a capitalistic economy the means of production are always on the way to the most capable manager, that is, to one who is able to use these means most economically to the satisfaction of consumer needs. A public enterprise, however, is managed by men who do not face the consequences of their success or failure. Mises went on to note how even introducing an element of profit-seeking into government enterprises doesn’t replicate the benefits of a capitalistic economy: Even a profit-seeking public enterprise could not be unbureaucratic. Attempts have been made to eliminate bureaucratism through profit-sharing by managers. But since they could not be expected to bear the eventual losses, they are tempted to become reckless, which then is to be avoided by limiting the manager’s authority through directives from higher officials, boards, committees, and 'expert' opinions. Thus again, more regulation and bureaucratization are created. But usually public enterprises are expected to strive for more than profitability. This is why they are owned and operated by government. Deumer, too, demands of the nationalized banking system that it be guided by national rather than private considerations, that it should invest its funds not where the return is highest, but where they serve the national interest. It is important to note here that Mises neither denied that a principal-agent problem might exist in a private firm nor denied that private firms might have their own issues with bureaucratism; rather, he was affirming that market-based, profit-and-loss accounting is the primary cure for such problems and that government interference with markets and with private ownership is the primary obstacle to profit-and-loss governance of private businesses. Mises perceptively points out how profit-sharing doesn’t curb reckless behavior by managers who have no skin in the game, and how political considerations often override considerations of profitability when government has a large stake in the business. Investors must retain an active role in looking after their own investments and be unhampered by government restrictions and controls for profitability to be a useful feedback mechanism. A myth popular among some non-Austrian economists is that investing can be reduced to an automated, mathematical exercise in diversification and statistical measurement of cyclical risks (e.g., the capital asset pricing model), which, in turn, gives some superficial plausibility to the assumption that handing trillions of dollars over to managers of 'sovereign wealth funds' can be a harmless exercise when organized in the manner of a passive index mutual fund. However, several searing experiences in recent decades such as Enron systematically fleecing equity investors with misleading financial statements or a massive bank credit expansion featuring an unusual concentration in subprime housing mortgages due to regulatory arbitrage remind us that investing can never be safely put on autopilot. American citizens are better off picking their own stewards who serve at their pleasure, rather than blindly trusting governmental stewards they can’t even fire and phony government pretenses of insuring the uninsurable. The wisdom of Mises’s position is further reinforced by the revealing statements made by Trump regarding his political motivations for the fund. Trump stated that the fund might be used to buy TikTok, presumably for the 'strategic' reason that its current ownership is Chinese. It’s bad enough that TikTok would then be managed like the US Postal Service (presumably with all the efficiency and customer service that the USPS is infamous for), but what assurance would there be that the American government’s abuse of TikTok user data or its politicized manipulation of messaging on the platform would be any less malevolent than what is currently practiced by the Chinese Communists? More generally, what is to prevent the fund from becoming a means for funding graft, political machines, and ever more intrusive forms of social engineering on a colossal scale? If one wants to get serious about improving the stewardship of wealth in America and empowering its citizens to have their interests prevail, that wealth should be transferred back into the possession of its rightful owners. Wealth also needs to be liberated from the sort of tax and regulatory regime that favors concentration of stewardship in the hands of Davosian-oriented stakeholders like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street and the funneling of funds into lower-yielding investments. It would also help a great deal if the pursuit of future economic security were to become an individual responsibility again, not reliant upon the unsustainable entitlement obligations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and on the unsustainable inflation of the quantity of fiat dollars by the Federal Reserve. It is the capital-consuming nature of the welfare state and its fiat dollar-financing mechanism that has been steadily eroding America’s economic security and fiscal sustainability and forfeiting America’s leadership on international economic and strategic matters.

The US Government’s Terrible Bird Flu Scheme – OpEd	The unfolding bird flu narrative serves as a chilling echo of the COVID-19 pandemic, starkly illustrating a playbook dusted off and redeployed,' wrote Joseph Mercola in the concluding paragraphs of his Friday article at mecola.com detailing the outrageous actions the United States government has been taking and is planning to take in the name of countering bird flu. Mercola would know. He is a doctor whose insightful comments are followed by many people seeking guidance on how to live healthier. He was one of the rare medical professionals who stood up against the coronavirus fearmongering and crackdown early on by both criticizing the push to inject experimental coronavirus 'vaccine' shots into as many people as possible and educating people about actual coronavirus risk and what they could do for themselves to prevent or reduce harm from coronavirus. This was when the standard line trumpeted by government and media and declared to be 'the science' said that, aside from the experimental shots along with mask and social distancing quackery, prevention and early treatment options did not exist. People were told to put their full faith in the supposedly 'safe and effective' shots and, only after they became very sick, hospitals that often followed protocols that seemed more in line with conveyor belts of death than remediation. The US government has spent over a billion dollars on the killing of 150 million chickens and other birds since 2022 — including over 40 million killed in just December and January — in the supposed effort to counter bird flu, wrote Mercola. This mass slaughter has proceeded little noticed by the public except for its effect in scarcity and increased prices for eggs. The costs are plain to see. But, what are the gains from these US government actions? Mercola argues that any gains are phantom. The killings have, he wrote, caused more problems by both preventing the development of natural immunity among fowl that promises to answer any bird flu threat and increasing the risk of one of the consequences the government claims to be seeking to prevent — bird flu harming people. As with the coronavirus crackdown before, the US government’s bird flu scheme is built upon finding 'cases' of the disease through use of PCR tests with a high rate of false positives. Also as with the coronavirus crackdown, the US government is pushing development and use of experimental 'vaccines' — first for birds and then for people — to save the day. Moderna, a company whose name became well known during the long period of badgering people to take supposedly 'safe and effective' coronavirus shots, comes up in Mercola’s telling of the pharmaceutical actions the US government is pursuing: Bird flu shots are now front and center. In addition to the USDA’s conditional license for Zoetis’ bird flu vaccine for chickens, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agreed to give Moderna $590 million to develop an mRNA vaccine for H5N1 in humans — even though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said bird flu is a low risk to people. Hopefully, the US government will exit from supporting these 'vaccines.' Such a change in course is suggested to be likely by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. last week placing a temporary halt on US government support for a pharmaceutical company’s development of a new coronavirus 'vaccine' pill. But, while Kennedy oversees the Department of Health and Human Services that is involved in development of bird flu 'vaccine' for humans, the 'vaccine' for birds and the mass slaughter of birds is overseen by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) of which Brooke Rollins is the new secretary. Will Secretaries Kennedy and Rollins, both newly in charge of their government departments in February, take action to save chickens and the American people from more outrageous harm arising from the US government’s bird flu scheme ramped up during the previous presidential administration? We have already had more than enough of this terrible coronavirus crackdown sequel.

Trump Takes On The ‘Collective West’ – OpEd	The dramatic scene in the Oval Office on Friday evening signals that President Donald Trump is decoupling the US from the ‘forever war’ in Ukraine that his predecessor Joe Biden left behind. The war is poised to end with a whimper, but its ‘butterfly effect’ on our incredibly complex, deeply interconnected world will define European and international security for decades to come. The western media which is hostile toward Trump, have seized the opportunity to caricature him as an impulsive figure in a role reversal with Zelenskyy. In reality, though, Trump has been literally driven to this point by the Biden administration. The highly charged emotional reaction by the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen commiserating with President Zelensky speaks for itself: 'Your dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.' Trump’s refusal to give Von der Leyen an appointment may partly explain her fury as a woman scorned. Truly, the ‘Collective West’ find themselves at a crossroads and do not know which road to take. Without US air cover and satellite inputs, western troop deployment in Ukraine will be impossible. Even French Emmanuel Macron would agree that his troops will be put through a meat grinder. Both Von der Leyen and Macron had a whale of a time as cheerleaders of Biden’s war but any further adventures in Ukraine will be suicidal, to put it mildly. Ukraine’s military will collapse if Trump freezes support. None of the European powers will risk a collision with Russia. Trump knows by now that the western narrative of Biden’s war is a load of bullshit peppered with falsehoods and outright lies, and that the war erupted only out of the diabolic western plot to poke the bear, which got provoked finally and hit out. The CIA’s coup in Kiev in February 2014 was a watershed event paving the way for a NATO presence on Ukrainian soil. Indeed, terrible things happened, which have been shoved under the carpet — for instance, then German foreign minister (current president) Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s dubious links with the neo-Nazi Ukrainian groups who acted as storm troopers in the 2014 coup. Just think of the grotesqueness of it — a German social democrat patronising neo-Nazi groups! Most certainly, Trump knows that the US deep state had set in motion an agenda to destabilise the Russian Federation and dismember it as the unfinished business no sooner than the Soviet Union was dissolved. The Chechen War has no other explanation. In fact, Putin has accused accused US agents of directly aiding the insurgents. Again, the Bill Clinton administration floated the idea of NATO expansion as early as in 1994. It came out of the blue but was obviously a work in progress since the disbandment of the Soviet Union. By the mid-nineties, even Boris Yeltsin understood that he was played nicely. The return of Evgeny Primakov to the Kremlin and Yeltsin’s overture to Beijing were the surest signs of a course correction. Those familiar with Soviet history had known all along that Ukraine would be the theatre where the US would try to seal the fate of Russia. If further confirmation was needed, it came with the CIA’s colour revolution in Ukraine in 2003 where the election was rigged (as is happening in Romania today) and carried to a third round till the proxy emerged victorious and surely, Viktor Yushchenko brought the NATO membership issue to the table. At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, George W. Bush insisted that the alliance formally offered membership to Ukraine! Today, Britain’s MI6 calls the shots in Kiev. Zelenskyy admitted recently that much of the money given by Biden simply ‘disappeared’. Sordid tales of massive kickbacks and corruption are galore. Biden ignored them. The Biden family’s involvement in Ukraine’s cesspools is widely known. Contrary to his pledge earlier not to do so, Biden felt constrained finally to grant a presidential pardon to son Hunter Biden so that he wouldn’t end up in jail. Suffice to say, Zelenskyy’s ‘strategic defiance’ stems out of his quiet confidence that western leaders — starting with Boris Johnson and Biden — who have been fellow travellers in the gravy train during the past three years of the war are beholden to him till eternity. The axis between Zelensky and his European Union supporters is cajoling Trump, pressuring him and flattering him in turn to get him on board the bandwagon so that the war rolls on for another four years. Last week alone, the presidents of France and Poland and the British prime minister descended on the White House on after another seeking assurance that the war in Ukraine will continue. But Trump has refused to oblige. Zelenskyy and his European backers want a ‘forever war’ in the western border lands of Eurasia, the traditional invasion route to Russia. And last week he again ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine. He also pointed to the ongoing talks on 'major economic development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia.' Trump repeated last week that the war could be ended 'within weeks' and warned of the risk of escalation into a 'third world war.' Basically, he realises that this is an unwinnable war, and is apprehensive that a prolonged war may transform into a quagmire sinking his presidency and derailing the grand bargain he hopes to strike with the two other superpowers, Russia and China, to create synergy for his ambitious MAGA project. Trump has chalked up 2026, the Quarter Millennial of the United States Declaration of Independence, for hosting the leaders of Russia and China on American soil to celebrate the high noon of his quest for world peace. The European political elites weaned on the liberal-globalist ‘rules-based order’ cannot understand Trump’s deep-rooted convictions and his abhorrence of war. The big question now is wether the unprecedented fracas in the White House yesterday could backfire on Zelenskyy, since Washington has significant leverage vis-a-vis Kiev and given the latter’s heavy dependence on the US for some of the critical elements of its defence. Following the Oval Office argument, Zelenskyy has issued a lengthy statement admitting that it is 'crucial' for Ukraine to have Trump’s support. A patch-up cannot be ruled out but the transatlantic system has received a big jolt, as the overwhelming majority of European countries have voiced support for Zelenskyy. In fact, there hasn’t been a solitary voice censuring Zelenskyy. Britain kept mum. Keir Starmer, UK prime minister is hosting a meeting of European leaders on Sunday which Zelenskyy is due to attend. It is unlikely that Europeans will push the envelope further In this dismal scenario, the best hope is that Zelenskyy’s ouster, which seems probable, will not be a violent bloody event, considering the power rivalries within the regime in Kiev. At any rate, his replacement may not be a terrible thing to happen since it would necessitate holding the long overdue election and lead to the emergence of a legitimate leadership in Kiev, which has now become a dire necessity for what Trump would call ‘common sense’ to prevail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr6kUytPUlTdM	2025-03-01T17:41:07-08:00	
Ukraine’s Diplomatic Crossroads: The Need For Strategic Rethinkin...	The international security landscape is about to witness an unexpected turnaround and a stark realization of the realities on the war front. Undoubtedly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has put to test the battle readiness of the involved parties and the extent of diplomacy that could potentially alter the situation for better or worse. The horrendous situation on the battlefield in Ukraine represents a strategic failure of the West, conveniently ignored due to self-serving agendas. However, it is time to revisit the origins of this conflict and leverage the lessons learned to formulate a robust playbook for future international security management. As President Trump stated in numerous forums, the Russian invasion of Ukraine could have been avoided if the West had analyzed the underlying issues and taken timely action to prevent any aggressive maneuvers by Russia. However, even after the invasion, numerous opportunities for negotiation arose but were subsequently ignored by the West. On several occasions, President Zelenskyy was reportedly pressured by Western powers to forgo negotiations and continue the war to reclaim territories from Russia. Additionally, the prevailing notion that President Putin cannot be trusted without a security guarantee from the West, backed by the United States, further complicated the negotiations. Despite continuous support from the West, this perception and lack of cohesive strategy led to strategic decay without recourse. It is a well-documented fact that Russia invaded Ukraine, labeling its actions as a 'special military operation.' This operation, according to Russian claims, aims to demilitarize and 'denazify' Ukraine, ostensibly to protect Russian-speaking populations in the Luhansk and Donbas regions, while preventing Ukraine from becoming a NATO member for security reasons. Conversely, the West seized this opportunity to punish Russia through Ukraine, rallying behind the slogan 'as long as it takes' but failing to anticipate the desired outcome. Regrettably, Ukraine now finds itself in a diplomatic stalemate due to ideological differences among the stakeholders. While the United States is striving to end the war in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, influenced by the West, continues to object, asserting that President Putin cannot be trusted and demanding a security guarantee. This perception is likely to further deteriorate the situation, rendering Ukraine untenable and potentially jeopardizing military assistance from the United States. In light of this situation, Ukraine must assert its independence and critically analyze its needs during negotiations while engaging in mutual dialogue with United States leadership. Ukraine should prioritize its national security and interests over European security as a secondary objective in future negotiations. The West must recognize that Ukraine should not be utilized as a means to obscure its own vulnerabilities. It is essential that Western nations do not depend on Ukraine to fulfill their security objectives. Instead, they should address their own strategic weaknesses directly and develop independent security strategies. Furthermore, leveraging Ukraine to achieve broader geopolitical aims not only undermines Ukraine's sovereignty but also risks prolonging the conflict and worsening the humanitarian crisis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5PJf0VOjsVH	2025-03-01T17:37:46-08:00	
Robert Reich: 10 More Reasons For Modest Optimism – OpEd	Since I offered you 10 reasons for modest optimism last week, discontent with the Trump-Musk regime has surged even further. America appears to be waking up. Here’s the latest evidence — 10 more reasons for modest optimism. 1. Trump’s approval ratings continue to plummet. The chief reason Trump was elected was to reduce the high costs of living — especially food, housing, health care, and gas. A new Pew poll shows these costs remain uppermost in Americans’ minds. Sixty-three percent identify inflation as an overriding problem, and 67 percent say the same about the affordability of health care. That same poll shows the public turning on Trump. The percent of those disapproving of Trump’s handling of the economy has risen to 53 percent (versus 45 percent who approve). Disapproval of his actions as president has risen to the same 53 percent versus 45 percent approval, which shows how essential economic performance is to the public’s assessment of presidents these days. The Pew poll also shows 57 percent of the public believes that Trump 'has exceeded his presidential authority.' By making the world’s richest person his hatchet man, Trump has made more vivid the role of money in politics. Hence, a record-high 72 percent now say a major problem is 'the role of money in politics.' Other polls show similar results. In the Post-Ipsos poll, significantly more Americans strongly disapprove of Trump (39 percent) than strongly approve of him (27 percent). Reuters, Quinnipiac University, CNN, and Gallup polls show Trump’s approval ratings plummeting (ranging from 44 percent to 47 percent). In all of these polls, more Americans now disapprove of Trump than approve of him. 2. DOGE is running amusk. DOGE looks more and more like a giant hoax. This week, reporters found that nearly 40 percent of the contracts DOGE claims to have canceled aren’t expected to save the government any money, according to the administration’s own data. As a result, on Tuesday DOGE deleted all of the five biggest 'savings' on its so-called 'wall of receipts.' The scale of its errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that appear to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government. DOGE has also had to reverse its firings. On Tuesday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Douglas A. Collins celebrated cuts to 875 contracts that he claimed would save nearly $2 billion. But when veterans learned that those contracts covered medical services, recruited doctors, and funded cancer programs as well as burial services for veterans, the outcry was so loud that on Wednesday the VA rescinded the ordered cuts. After hundreds of nuclear weapons workers were abruptly fired, the Trump administration is scrambling to rehire them. After hundreds of scientists at the Food and Drug Administration were fired, they’re being asked to return. On Wednesday, Musk acknowledged that DOGE 'accidentally canceled' efforts by the U.S. Agency for International Development to prevent the spread of Ebola. But Musk insisted the initiative was quickly restored. Wrong. Current and former USAID officials say Ebola prevention efforts have been largely halted since Musk and his DOGE allies moved last month to gut the global-assistance agency and freeze its outgoing payments. The teams and contractors that would be deployed to fight an Ebola outbreak have been dismantled, they added. DOGE staff are resigning. On Tuesday, 21 federal civil service tech workers resignedfrom DOGE, writing in a joint resignation letter that they were quitting rather than help Musk 'dismantle critical public services.' The staffers all worked for what was known as the U.S. Digital Service before it was absorbed by DOGE. Their ranks include data scientists, product managers, and engineers. According to the Associated Press, 'all previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.' Finally, Musk’s conflicts of interest are bursting into the open, and it isn’t a pretty sight. The FAA is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul a communications system integral to its air traffic control system — and awarding the contract to Musk’s Starlink instead. Why? A team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days. And Musk himself has been criticizing Verizon’s platform on his social media company, X. Senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch to Starlink, so Musk’s team is now seeking help to secure the deal from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau. Could Musk’s financial motive be any clearer? 3. Tesla is in deep sh*t. Americans outraged by Musk’s outsized role in the Trump regime are targeting Musk’s Tesla. Many Tesla owners are feeling buyer’s remorse — their cars are vandalized or they become publicly shamed by strangers upset with the car company’s CEO. Others are putting anti-Musk bumper stickers on their cars. A video from musician Sheryl Crow that received over 20 million views on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook features the singer waving goodbye to her Tesla Model S, as Andrea Bocelli’s 'Time to Say Goodbye' plays in the background. 'There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,' Crow wrote in the caption. 'So long Tesla.' Last weekend, thousands demonstrated outside of Tesla dealerships from Philadelphia to Seattle to register their outrage with Musk’s political power. The #TeslaTakedown campaign page on Action Network has listed 46 upcoming events at Tesla dealerships and charging stations around the country over the next week. Another organizing platform, Mobilize, includes another 32 events. Union pension funds are getting involved. Randi Weingarten, president of the giant American Federation of Teachers, has called on the CEOs of the nation’s six largest asset management firms to review Tesla’s current valuation. 'This is about safeguarding workers’ retirements,' she said in a statement. 'Just this week we saw Tesla stock continue to sink faster than a Cybertruck in quicksand as European sales fell off a cliff. So, we knew we needed to act.' 4. The oligarchy has never been more exposed. An important aspect of the era we’re in is that a record share of the nation’s wealth is in the hands of a small group of people who are now revealing themselves to be remarkably selfish, shameless, and insensitive to the needs of America. This is a further reason for modest optimism because as the oligarchy exposes itself for what it is, the dangers it poses to average people become more apparent — and the odds increase of a fierce public backlash to it. On Wednesday, at the same time Elon Musk (the world’s richest person) was lecturing Trump’s Cabinet about the importance of decimating the federal workforce, Jeff Bezos (America’s second-richest) was telling staffers at The Washington Post that henceforth the Post’s opinions would focus on defending 'personal liberties and free markets' and opposing viewpoints would not be published. The Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, promptly resigned, as he should. When oligarchs talk of 'personal liberties and free markets' they mean their own liberties to become even richer and more powerful, as the rest of America slides into worsening economic insecurity and fear. When the oligarchs speak of 'freedom,' what they actually seek is freedom from accountability. All this is becoming more apparent than ever. 5. People are rising against corporate power. For all these reasons, a backlash is beginning. Popular rage that this country is now run by an oligarchy, a small group of billionaires and corporate elites, is surging. Today’s 'economic blackout' has enlisted millions of Americans who have stopped buying and thereby demonstrated our power. Meanwhile, protests are breaking out against big predatory corporations. On the eastern shore of Maryland, a bright red Republican area, 20,000 have signed a petition demanding an investigation of Delmarva Power, a subsidiary of utility giant Exelon, for overcharging them. That’s almost 5 percent of Delmarva’s entire customer base. The same anger is mounting in New York City at Con Edison. And in St. Joseph, Missouri, at Evergy. When House Republicans were in their home districts last week, they were deluged with angry questions about corporate power, Elon Musk, and big money. A few Senate Republicans even explained to their constituents that they voted to confirm Robert Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services because he’s 'hated' by Big Pharma. Meanwhile, Bernie is back. While not running for president again, 83-year-old Bernie Sanders this week launched his 'National Tour to Fight Oligarchy' — to overflow crowds in deep-red Nebraska and Iowa. Bernie is showing that even in red America, opposition to oligarchy and Trump is becoming the dominant view of a large swath of the public. Record-breaking crowds are also appearing for other notable progressives. A record-sized group showed up to Representative Jim McGovern’s town hall. The same thing happened in Massachusetts with Senator Elizabeth Warren. 6. As Trump and Musk trade Social Security and Medicaid for big tax cuts for the rich, Americans will go ballistic. The budget plan passed by the House this week — at Trump’s urging — gives billionaire oligarchs and giant corporations the lion’s share of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. To offset the $4.5 trillion, the plan includes severe spending cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and Social Security. Seventy-two million Americans rely on Medicaid, half of them children. Forty-two million Americans receive food stamps — many who aren’t paid enough to put food on the table. Federal workers at the Social Security Administration learned Wednesday that a plan was already underway to cut 50 percent of staff, as well as 1,200 field office locations. The move is likely to affect tens of thousands of employees across the country and millions who rely on the agency for monthly checks that keep them afloat. Such deep cuts to SSA, already at historically low staffing, will cause significant degradation of services, very likely including checks missed and individuals dying before their claims can be processed. Why do I include this outrage in my list of reasons for modest optimism? Because if nothing else awakens the slumbering giant of the American people, the Trump-Musk attacks on Medicaid and Social Security to pay for another giant tax cut for the rich will. Polls show unequivocally that Americans across party lines reject tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich. In fact, more than two-thirds — 67 percent — of Americans support higher taxes on billionaires. 7. Democracies are joining together, minus Trump’s America. Since it’s become clear that America has begun allying itself with Russia, the movement of the world’s other major democracies to join forces has been gaining momentum. On February 17, eight European leaders and the heads of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union met. On Wednesday, France’s Emmanuel Macron spoke with the leaders of 19 countries, including Canada, either in person or over videoconferencing. Leaders from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden also joined the conversation. Britain’s PM Keir Starmer is shifting the center of UK foreign policy from the United States to Europe. All of this bodes well for a united front of democracies against authoritarian dictatorships — even though, tragically, Trump’s America is on the wrong side. 8. Negative economic consequences of the Trump-Musk blunderbuss are beginning to appear. The economy is starting to show signs of strain as the Trump-Musk moves to shrink federal spending, lay off government workers, and impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners shake businesses and ricochet across states and cities. Trump’s moves to halt foreign aid and freeze some federal funding have already taken a toll on domestic farmers who export billions of dollars of products as part of American foreign aid programs. Billions of dollars of climate and infrastructure investments that were underway during the Biden administration are now in limbo. Apollo Global Management, an investment firm, estimates that DOGE job cuts could rise to 300,000. When government contractors are included, total layoffs could be closer to 1 million. Economic indicators are showing signs of mounting stress, with much of the anxiety focused on Trump’s tariffs. On Thursday, he said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on March 4 and he would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on China. A survey of consumer sentiment published by the Conference Board on Tuesday recorded its largest monthly decline in confidence since 2021 in February. The drop was attributed to growing pessimism about employment prospects and future business conditions, with concerns about trade and tariffs reaching levels last seen during the 2019 trade wars in Mr. Trump’s first term. This week’s University of Michigan survey of American consumers shows that they expect prices will rise at a 3.5 percent yearly rate over the next decade — the highestrate of consumers’ inflation fears since 1995. A measure of corporate activity from S&P Global published last week showed business expansion slowing in the United States in February as a result of 'uncertainty and instability surrounding new government policies' such as federal spending cuts and tariff-related developments. The National Association of Homebuilders said in its latest report that builder confidence had fallen to a five-month low because of concerns about tariffs, elevated mortgage rates, and high housing costs. Morgan Stanley economists estimate that tariffs will raise inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, by as much as 0.6 percentage points and depress real consumer spending by as much as 2 percentage points. The overall hit to inflation-adjusted economic growth could be as high as 1.1 percentage points. I include these gloomy economic statistics as a modest reason for optimism because they, too, signal the looming end of public support for Musk and Trump. 9. Elections are looking brighter. Add up all of this and elections are looking brighter — and we don’t have to wait until 2026. This is a major election year. If you count all the seats up for election this year at the local, state, and federal levels, there are 100,000 seats open across 45 states. Governors, mayors, city councils, state representatives, judges, school boards — these positions up and down the entire ballot in 2025 — are a vital line of defense against the Trump-Vance-Musk regime. Wisconsin voters will fill the deciding seat on their state’s Supreme Court. This election will have huge implications for the labor rights and voting rights of everyday Wisconsinites. Musk is filling the coffers of the Republican candidate right now, but Wisconsinites won’t let Musk’s big money determine their future. If you live in New York City and don’t like the Trump administration meddling in the federal corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, you have the power to choose a new mayor. The great states of New Jersey and Virginia will elect their next governors — and control of their state houses. On the federal level, Florida will hold two special elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, and New York will hold another later this year. These could affect the balance of power in the House. The sea change is already beginning. On Wednesday, Democrat Eugene Vindman won his House race against the Republican and former army Green Beret Derrick Anderson in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District — a key victory for Democrats as they seek to regain a majority in the lower chamber. In his first term, Trump fired Vindman and his brother, Alexander, who both held senior roles on Trump’s National Security Council, after they raised concerns about Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter. As a member of Congress, Vindman will now help fellow Democratic lawmakers serve as a check on the power of Trump. 10. Adding it all up. Connect the dots: Trump’s ratings continue to plummet. Musk’s DOGE is off the rails and becoming a late-night joke. Consumers are taking out their anger on Tesla. America’s oligarchs are openly defiant and behaving shamelessly. Bernie and other progressive voices are attracting record-breaking crowds. Trump and Musk are attacking Medicaid and Social Security to pay for a giant tax cut for the wealthy. The world’s leading democracies are joining together against dictatorial regimes, including Trump’s America. Economic indicators are trending downward. And elections look brighter. What does this add up to? America is waking up, and it doesn’t like what it’s seeing in Trump and Musk. I don’t want to sound overly optimistic. We have a huge amount of work to do. My purpose in giving you these additional reasons for modest optimism is for you to have a sense of possibility. All is not lost. We are not doomed. The Trump-Vance-Musk regime is filled with incompetence and riddled with treachery. If all of us maintain our courage and resolve, and do what’s necessary, we will prevail.

Trump Gives Zelenskyy Bum’s Rush And Flushes The European Ploy To...	After his mauling from President Trump live on TV and then being booted out of the White House, Ukraine’s Zelensky immediately phoned European leaders. That reaction shows that the Ukrainian actor-turned-president had flown to Washington from Kiev not to merely sign a supposed minerals deal with the U.S., but to inveigle Trump into a trap to escalate the proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. No doubt there is consternation and alarm among the Europeans that their agenda for prolonging the war against Russia is in disarray. Worst still, a furious Trump may now cut Ukraine loose and leave it completely at the mercy of Russia. European leaders are huddling in London on Sunday for an emergency meeting convened by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Zelensky is to attend and be showered with European expressions of support and billions more of taxpayer money. Incredibly, they still champion the impudent conman as a 'Churchillian hero'. The fallout in the Oval Office on Friday was a sordid spectacle. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, tore into Zelensky under the full glare of TV cameras for daring to make more demands for U.S. security guarantees as part of a deal giving American companies access to Ukraine’s alleged mineral wealth, including oil, gas and rare earth metals. The meeting started cordially, but Trump refrained from giving specific 'security guarantees' to Ukraine. Zelensky’s sniveling insistence on getting explicit U.S. commitments for military support following any peace deal with Russia triggered Trump and his officials to rebuke the Ukrainian leader for wrangling in public and not being respectful. After their fireside fireworks, an incensed Trump gave Zelensky the bum’s rush. No minerals deal was signed and Zelensky left Washington empty handed. That’s not the end of it either. Trump later told reporters that Zelensky is not welcome back until he is ready to make the peace with Russia. Trump was astute to the attempted rumble. He told reporters on the White House lawn following the slap-down of Zelensky: 'We want peace. We’re not looking for somebody to sign up a strong power and then not make a peace deal because they feel emboldened. That’s what I saw happening. He wants to fight, fight, fight. I am not looking to get into anything protracted.' Zelensky’s immediate phone calls to French President Emmanuel Macron and the NATO chief Mark Rutte after the White House fiasco is the big reveal here. Days before Zelensky’s visit to the White House on Friday, European leaders had lobbied Trump for U.S. security guarantees as part of any peace deal with Russia. Macron met Trump on Monday. On Thursday, it was Starmer’s turn to ingratiate with Trump. The EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas was also in Washington. Significantly, her meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was abruptly called off 'due to scheduling issues.' The main objective for Macron and Starmer was to extract a commitment from Trump for a military 'backstop' in Ukraine to beef up their proposal to deploy French and British troops under the guise of 'peacekeepers'. The British wanted American 'air cover' for their troops, according to the BBC. Both Macron and Starmer were palmed away with vague nothings despite the bonhomie and compliments, and a British sweetener from King Charles to invite Trump on a royal visit. Trump’s diplomatic overture to Russian President Vladimir Putin, beginning with a phone call on February 12 followed by a high-level meeting of U.S. and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia on February 18, has sent shockwaves across the European NATO members. They feel aggrieved that Trump is going to make a peace deal with Putin without them. The Europeans are still beholden to the propaganda narrative of the previous Biden administration about 'defending democracy and sovereignty in Ukraine from Russian aggression.' Trump wants out of the extravagant mess in Ukraine. He recognizes that the conflict was always a proxy war with an ulterior agenda to defeat Russia. Hundreds of billions of dollars and euros have been wasted fueling a futile proxy war that, as it turns out, Russia is decisively winning. Marco Rubio, the U.S. top diplomat, disclosed in an interview to CNN after the Oval Office spat, that a European foreign minister had told him that 'their plan' was to keep the war in Ukraine going for another year in the hope that it would eventually 'weaken Russia' and make Moscow 'beg for peace.' The callousness of the Europeans and their Russophobic obsession are grotesque. The three-year conflict in Ukraine has cost up to one million military deaths, millions of refugees across Europe, and broken economies, not to mention the danger of it turning into World War Three. Sneakily, the Europeans are covering their desire for continuing the proxy war with a belated apparent concern for making peace and backing Trump’s diplomacy. Macron and Starmer ostensibly commend Trump (after initially being in a flap over this call with Putin) and they talk about 'finding a path to a lasting peace.' However, their seeming offer of deploying French and British soldiers as 'peacekeepers' is a Trojan Horse that has nothing to do with keeping the peace. For its part, Moscow has categorically stated that any NATO troops in Ukraine will not be acceptable and will be attacked as combatants. That is why Macron, Starmer and other European leaders were so insistent on trying to get Trump to give 'security guarantees'. The so-called American military 'backstop' would be a way to escalate the proxy war against Russia. Zelensky was in Washington on a mission to beguile Trump into giving a security guarantee while dangling the bait of a lucrative minerals deal. It was reported that the Trump White House wanted to cancel the meeting for Friday before Zelensky departed from Ukraine on Thursday. But Macron intervened and implored Trump to go ahead with the reception. Zelensky, having got used to being indulged with endless blank checks, thought he could wheedle more out of Trump than just a mining deal. He was expected to extract the direct U.S. military involvement that the European Russophobic leaders want. In that way, the proxy war would escalate and those riding the war-racket gravy train would continue to extort the world’s biggest security crisis. Fortunately, Trump gave Zelensky the bum’s rush and flushed out the European ploy. The irony is that Trump had earlier in the week lavished praise on Macron and Starmer, exalting France for being America’s 'oldest ally' and Britain for its 'special relationship'. Trump might want to radically revise those cliched notions.

‘Right-Wing’ Agenda: The Last Hope For The European Economy – OpE...	The right-wing agenda seems to have finally taken hold in Europe, which can't help but offer a fragile hope of economic recovery after decades of left-wing populist destruction. A new model of economic policy aimed at dismantling the 'welfare state' with its bloated spending, enormous taxes, countless bureaucracies, and unbearable burden of regulating everything and everyone will be - should be - the main goal of the new governments in the major European powers. Not long ago, I saw a great meme in which a cartoon was signed on behalf of a European bureaucrat: 'If you're an entrepreneur and you want to invent, invest and scale something, don't play catch-up with us, because you've already lost - we've already regulated and redistributed everything before you've invented, invested or scaled anything... What is the welfare state in Europe built on? First of all, on cheap natural resources and production from developing countries such as Russia, China and South-East Asia. When global economic diversification became possible, the next problem arose. Once you remove physical production from your country, which maximizes economic growth and wealth creation, and start growing through consumer leverage, services, subsidized technology, government planned redistribution, exorbitant taxes, stifling regulation, huge social subsidies, fan subsidies, and other unproductive expenditures, you are bound to run the risks of inflation, weak currencies, and global political instability that loosen your supposed 'universal' economy. It must always be remembered that the growth of unsecured credit and government spending is the path to collapse: political, economic, socio-cultural. The welfare of people in a country cannot be universal. Equality is a biological absurdity and anthropological dystopia, which in 100 percent of cases leads to withering or catastrophe. This does not mean that there is no need to maximize the welfare of as many people as possible. But that maximization should be based on promoting productivity, not on credit subsidies from the government. The government has simply taken that money from other, more productive and entrepreneurial citizens through regulations and taxes and given it to the 'notionally poor', nurturing social dependency rather than reducing transaction costs and tax burdens. This is exactly what we have in Europe today, from the huge migration problem to the problems of aging and entrepreneurial depression. 'Take everything and divide it' - these are the words of the hero of the story by the Russian classic of literature Mikhail Bulgakov, who wrote about post-revolutionary life in Russia in the early 20th century. These words can be used as the motto of the left-liberal European establishment, which has been in power for the last 20 years. With the development of left-social populism, a policy of false inclusiveness has been imposed in Europe for many years, in reality expressed in unbridled public spending and subsidies to migrants, dependents and minorities of all kinds. Europe has simply forgotten what it means to create wealth through real capitalist competition, free markets, productive efficiency and horizontal exchange. Instead of creating wealth and cultivating human well-being through the growth of private production and the stimulation of business and labor, European authorities have chosen to focus on a refined strategy of the 'sedentary bandit': a policy of confiscation, seizure, and redistribution from the most enterprising and productive - hence rich and wealth-creating - to the less enterprising and productive, hence poor, who do not add value and create a meaningful economic multiplier. The right of the 'strong' has been replaced by the right of the 'weak'. But it is this vicious new paradigm that allows Palestinians from Gaza to slaughter Jews by the hundreds at night, it is this paradigm that allows Europe to bend under the oppression of migrants from disadvantaged regions, it is the right of the weak that allows minorities of all kinds to actually engage in reverse discrimination, it is the right of the weak that imposes quotas on minorities in corporate management, it is the right of the weak that gives birth to hypertrophied social benefits and a whole social class living on subsidies, As a result, we witnessed a tremendous deindustrialization in the Western world, particularly in Europe, the disintegration of the manufacturing sector and its transfer to third countries. But what was the replacement? That's right - bingo! - inflated consumer credit (take out a loan and buy a third TV even if you are a beggar on subsidies, because you have a guaranteed income from the state!), high taxes on surviving businesses, bureaucratic regulatory restrictions and exorbitant growth in government spending. No sane person would ever invest in such a crazy business model, such a lame duck. This is actually confirmed by the investment activity in European economies - it is at a very low level. This economic model is upside down. It focuses on social spending, willfully ignoring the fact that social welfare is a consequence of productivity growth, which is only possible if there are appropriate incentives for business, capital and entrepreneurship. It is business - free, willing and able to maximize profits - that is the source of wealth. If the state - political power and bureaucracy - stifles business, but at the same time increases consumer credit leverage and social subsidies that are not backed by productivity - the name is political populism and elementary cheating, and I would say political crime. This is real dark Marxism. This is exactly what the European authorities have been doing for the last two decades. 'We badly need a more loyal and business-friendly policy,' said Klaus Geissdoerfer. Mr. Geissdoerfer is CEO of EBM-Papst, one of the world's largest industrial fan manufacturers from Germany and leader in its industry. Golden words! Let's restate them with the same meaning: we need less bureaucracy, less taxes, less government spending, less corruption, less government. We need a cheap but efficient state. We need a referee, not a player as referee! Geissdoerfer has repeatedly submitted various petitions to the government and self-regulatory organizations, Other representatives of his industry and the German engineering industry as a whole have supported him. The essence of these petitions is that hypertrophied bureaucracy in Germany hinders the development not only of old big business, but first of all venture projects, start-ups, young entrepreneurs and innovation in general. This seriously hinders the development and penetration of technology. This state of affairs is a natural consequence of the economic policies of the notorious 'welfare state', where the bureaucracy and rent-seeking political entrepreneurs run up deficits by sucking up the budget and making huge social expenditures through exorbitant taxes and a growing mandate to redistribute wealth. They will never want to give it up voluntarily, they will try to neatly change the institutions and social contract 'appendices' to suit themselves. Well then, we shouldn't be surprised by Javier Millay with his chainsaw to destroy 'big government', Trump with his 'hell's angel' for the American bureaucracy in the person of Ilon Musk, the rightward lurch in Europe with the increasing popularity of right-wing parties: the pendulum has swung the other way, thank God. EBM-Papst earns $2.6 billion a year, but management says the company is 'suffering in Germany' as its domestic revenue has been steadily falling due to exorbitant taxes and regulatory burdens. Specifically, last year's drop was 4.1%. 'We have a lot of talented people and we have good companies in Germany, but we don't have the opportunity to develop intensively and on a large scale because of the government's policies, because the government just sucks all the juice out of the business,' Geissdoerfer states. Here's a blatant example of the inefficiency of European bureaucracy. Reducing energy consumption to combat climate change under the 2023 law requires employees of German companies, somehow involved in industrial sectors, to make similar reports on what the company is doing to comply with the new law. Welcome to ESG and the Green Agenda, one of the greatest scams of the left-populist political establishment, cloaked in socialist welfare slogans in their quest to maintain and expand control of the budget as a source of personal rent. 'Now, instead of actually caring about the environment, our employees are forced to fill out paperwork and report every day, dealing with documentation instead of producing energy-saving equipment,' says Geissdoerfer, noting the significant drop in KPIs and business performance due to the burden of reporting to regulators. What is the investment attractiveness of such a business? Let's turn to another case study. The Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, a steel company that produces precision parts for mechanical engineering, particularly for the automotive industry, pays twice as much per kilowatt-hour for energy in Germany as it does at its facilities in the United States - New Jersey, Maine-Sterling and Kentucky. The company's CEO, Mr. Ulrich Flatke, states that this is a huge 'competitive setback' for businesses in Europe and a reduction in productivity, which naturally affects the welfare of European workers. The reasons for this are obvious. These are all consequences of left-Keynesian German government policies that have led to Germany's heavy reliance on cheap energy from Russia and cheap manufacturing outsourcing to China. When China and Russia grew into cyclopean autocracies, German business was in dire straits. The German economy is in a dramatic recession, contracting for two years in a steady recessive vector. At the end of 2024, it grew by just 0.3% compared to pre-pandemic 2019. Over the same period, the US economy grew by 11.4% and China grew by 25.8%. One after another, German industrial giants are laying off staff, cutting production, capex and investment programs in an attempt to shift capacity to more business-friendly regions. Mr. Geissdoerfer notes that the investment focus of EBM Papst, headquartered in Mulfingen, has now shifted to other markets - South Asia and the United States - where the company is relocating production, particularly in Connecticut and Tennessee. In addition to the incomparably smaller government - bureaucratic, regulatory and tax - overhang, which promises to get even smaller with the Republican Party in power, the company is protecting itself from import duties that President Trump's administration promises to impose. 'To avoid a complete collapse of the economy and social policy from de-industrialization, we need competitive energy prices and lower taxes,' says Mr. Flatke of the Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group. But for this to happen, we need to reject the populist-left agenda and turn to realpolitik and pragmatism in pursuing our own national interests. I would call this 'country individualism', in the manner of libertarian individualist attitudes. According to Marcel Fratscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, a deep pessimism dominates the investment climate among companies and citizens. No one is investing, no one is inventing, the venture capital and technology startup industries are in a depressed passive state. Public spending, which is a resource for enriching the European deep-state - the bureaucracy and the left-populist establishment - is reaching exorbitant levels, all of which is funding already struggling businesses. In order to make up for the potential loss of personal income due to stagnant business, European governments are increasing government spending and credit leverage that is not backed by productivity. This is a real crime, as it is the generation of tomorrow that will pay the price if this Keynesian-socialist bacchanalia is not stopped urgently today. Eurostat claims that social security payments amount to between 200% and 400% of GDP in European economies. Unfunded government spending is simply enormous and this naturally forms a gigantic inflationary overhang that simply makes citizens poorer by the day. Let's take a look at France, another flagship of the European economy. Giant social and other unproductive spending as dominant economic policies have caused a significant slowdown in economic growth over the past 10 years, generated high budget deficits, and increased social tensions. Hyper-loyal migration policies have only exacerbated these externalities, leading to taxpayer fatigue and creating a subsidy-dependent social group of dependents and potential extremists. We must remember very simple political economy rules. Any increase in government spending is done in the name of national security or social welfare. Spending is done in the here and now, which means more debt and deficits. To balance the budget and avoid default, the government raises taxes and regulatory restrictions to expropriate money from successful economic actors, As the economy grows at the expense of struggling businesses, government spending grows, but the problem is that when the economy starts to tank, spending grows even more, because the government needs to offset potential social discontent. As a result, the budget deficit and debt grows even faster, which means taxes grow, because it is business and the productive part of the population that has to pay for this bureaucratic leftist madness. The words of the French President Mr. Macron that the credit overhang in Europe is insufficient and it can be expanded to boost economic growth are perplexing, This can be directly called untrue if we evaluate all the unsecured liabilities of the EU countries. But these are natural and legitimate words of a political rent-seeking entrepreneur whose main resource for enrichment is the budget and access to redistribution of national wealth, where opportunities for corruption appear, and who is ready to increase the unsecured credit overhang to any size. And after us, a flood - that is the meaning of Mr. Macron's words. But all bacchanalia comes to an end. To slightly paraphrase Friedrich von Hayek, the party of unbridled budget sucking and unsecured borrowing will end, then the morning will come, and with it a brutal hangover, and then we will have to endure a long, long time to get back to normal. That most notorious 'welfare state' in Europe was financed by business and enterprising taxpayers. It was at their expense that the political establishment was able to boast proudly that a fair welfare society was supposedly built in Europe. But now, in times of global Hyper Shift - the erosion of socio-political and economic processes around the world - we can see what in reality was hiding behind the screen of European stability: bureaucratic hegemony, the budget rents of the political establishment and irresponsible conformist international policies. The burgeoning right-wing agenda and the crisis of the European left 'deep state' should put an end to this decline and put Europe back on the path to prosperity and true freedom of citizens from Leviathan. At least, judging by the electoral mood, there is now hope for that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5oDu3lKMwSE	2025-03-01T17:26:28-08:00	
Norway Rethinks €1.7 Trillion Sovereign Fund To Boost Support For...	By Jacob Wulff Wold (EurActiv) -- Norway is considering tapping its sovereign wealth fund to dramatically increase its support for Ukraine amid signs that US military backing is waning. Europe is in crisis mode after a bitter clash between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House, and the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting off all military supplies to Ukraine. Norway is sitting on €1.7 trillion in the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, including an estimated €109 billion in war-related profits from increased gas prices in 2022 and 2023. The Nordic country has so far spent €3.35 billion on support to Ukraine - an amount described on Thursday as 'pathetic' and 'reprehensible' by the editors of major Swedish and Danish newspapers, whose countries, according to the same data, have contributed €5.41 billion and €8.05 billion respectively. 'Norway is one of the few countries that has large amounts of money readily available, and we must therefore multiply our support for Ukraine immediately,' Liberal Party leader Guri Melby said on Saturday. Norway's support should be increased 'significantly' and 'fast', Norway's former Conservative prime minister, Erna Solberg, said in a statement. 'The government can safely assume there is will in Parliament to give more,' she added. The Liberal Party and the Socialist Left Party called for an emergency parliamentary session, but Euractiv understands they are now waiting for the government's proposal instead. Norway should spend 3% of GDP on defence, currently at around 2%, by 2030, Sylvi Listhaug, leader of the conservative Progress Party, Norway's second-largest in recent polls, said today. The leader of the Greens, who are currently polling at 2.7%, reiterated their proposal that Norway should pledge €85.5 billion to Ukraine. 'We will present a proposal to increase Ukraine support for parliament soon,' said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who will also attend tomorrow's meeting of European leaders in London. Time to tap the bank? Since 2001, Norway has carefully followed a budgetary rule of spending no more than 4% and then 3% of its sovereign wealth fund each year. The rule was introduced by Jens Stoltenberg's first cabinet with broad cross-party support. Known as a former NATO secretary general, Stoltenberg is now Norway's finance minister, just as the rule comes under scrutiny. The idea of using the fund more actively to support Ukraine and European defence spending is gaining ground in Norway. One idea is to convert some €300 billion of the fund's €450 billion in liquid bonds into European defence bonds, on the condition that the money is used exclusively to build Europe's defence. On Friday, Solberg said Norway must increase its use of 'oil money' to improve the country's defence. High-ranking members of her party previously called for stricter rules on how the money can be spent. 'Peace is more important than shortsightedness and inflation,' she said. But Stoltenberg warned against tampering with the budget rule. 'It is a dangerous idea to break the budgetary rule to give more money to Ukraine,' he said on 7 February. Numbers? Even without breaking the rule, Norway has deep pockets. 'We currently have a proposal in the Storting to increase support by 100 billion Norwegian kroner this year,' Sveinung Rotevatn, deputy chair and responsible for financial policy in the Liberal Party, told Euractiv. For 2025, this would increase support for Ukraine from €3 billion to €11.5 billion. Norway's Foreign Ministry declined to comment further on how much it wants to increase aid, referring instead to Støre's statement. 'It has become unequivocally clear that all of Europe must shift gears in our support and policy towards Ukraine and to ensure security in Europe,' said Rotevatn. 'All other policies we pursue assume that we are a free and independent country and that we have a functioning international world order,' said Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr_6XzDSqmF9W	2025-03-01T17:24:33-08:00	
Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy Meets With UK Prime Minister Starme...	Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy began his working visit to the United Kingdom with a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 'I want to thank you and the people of the United Kingdom for the tremendous support you have provided since the very beginning of this war. In Ukraine, we are very happy to have such strategic partners,' the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed gratitude for the organization of the upcoming meeting of European leaders in London, scheduled for Sunday. The future of Europe and transatlantic unity is being shaped right now. Russia’s war in Ukraine, the direct threats to all of Europe, and the search for pathways to peace are the key topics of today’s bilateral talks as well as tomorrow’s broader meeting with partners. The Ukrainian President and the British Prime Minister also shared details of their recent visits to the United States. The leaders held extensive discussions on coordination with partners, the implementation of a joint action plan, and concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine’s position and bring the war to an end with a lasting and just peace. A peace that will not allow Russia to use the ceasefire to rearm and attack again. That is why Ukraine, Europe, and the United States must be at the table for any potential peace negotiations. A separate focus was placed on robust security guarantees and the role the United Kingdom is ready to play in them. The leaders reaffirmed a shared vision of what confidence in the future should look like for all. Keir Starmer reiterated that the United Kingdom will stand with Ukraine for as long as necessary. He emphasized that this was the reason why so many people in London took to the streets today to express their support in this way. 'They came out to demonstrate just how strongly they support you, how strongly they support Ukraine. And also our unwavering determination to stand with you and achieve what we both seek – a lasting peace for Ukraine, built on sovereignty and security for Ukraine. This is crucial for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United Kingdom,' the British Prime Minister said. Additionally, in the presence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Keir Starmer, Ukraine’s Minister of Finance Sergii Marchenko (online) and UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves signed a loan agreement between Ukraine as the borrower and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the lender. In October last year, the EU and G7 countries jointly decided to provide loans totaling up to €45 billion to support Ukraine’s urgent budgetary, military, and reconstruction needs. The United Kingdom plans to contribute up to £2.258 billion, which can be used for purchasing defense materials for Ukraine. The loan is provided for a period of 30 years and will be repaid using revenues generated from frozen Russian assets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr14NbGCTJmfg	2025-03-01T17:18:10-08:00	
Mending Of Damaged Georgian-EU Relations Meets Mutual Interests –...	Relations between the EU and Georgia continue to deteriorate. The parties actually admit that the relationship has fallen to its lowest point, and blame each other. The Baltic states have even imposed sanctions and visa bans on Georgia’s top officials. Although, the leadership of Georgia refrains to respond with mirror measures. Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream (GD), which has retained the power for a fourth term in the disputed by the West parliamentary election in 2024, accuses euro-bureaucracy for the deterioration of relations. GD argues that the EU circles are trying to drag Georgia into a conflict with Russia and prepare the ground for a change of power in the country. The concerns of Tbilisi in this respect are not groundless. Remaining one of the main irritants in relations between Georgia and the European Union (EU), the Russian factor is perceived in Tbilisi and Brussels somewhat differently. This difference represents a problem that is unlikely to be addressed under the conditions of the continuing war in Ukraine, and the global confrontation between the West and Russia. The EU’s discontent of GD policy within the country and in relations with Russia predetermined the most recent strict-worded resolution of the European Parliament about Georgia, and harsh resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe(PACE) which encouraged the Georgian delegation to suspend work in PACE. Actually, these European bodies expressed the open non-recognition of the results of parliamentary and presidential elections in Georgia in 2024. These and other punitive measures by the EU, including suspending several programs of cooperation and funding, create a new and very serious barrier in relations, that naturally plays into Moscow’s hands. The EU organizations are concerned over GD's excessively cautious approach to Russia. This approach implies preference for a 'survival policy' over a 'value-based, and the line of a 'sovereign democracy' in relations with the western partners, which the DG has been pursuing in recent years. It is not surprising that Moscow openly supports this policy. In its efforts to regain influence in Georgia, Moscow has applied a range of hybrid warfare tools against Georgia. They range from confessional to economic factors. It seems that the West is not yet in a position to confront them with effective counter-measures, despite the millions spent for this purpose. A transparent audit of the effectiveness of these Western-sponsored programs whose recipients were Georgia’s pro-Western media and non-governmental organizations has probably not been carried out. It is enough to list at least a few factors of this hybrid war, to understand the degree of the threat. The Russian military presence in Georgia's secessionist regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia, hovering like a sword of Damocles over the country, and Georgia's continuing and alarmingly high economic dependence on Russia. They are powerful leverages of Russian influence. According to various estimations, too many Georgian businesses are closely associated with the Russian market, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue and the welfare of at least 700,000 Georgian households heavily depends on Georgia’s relations with Russia. This factor, inter alia, has a significant influence on the electoral behavior of Georgian citizens. During the 2024 parliamentary election, the GD's slogan 'War or Peace'[implying war with Russia] was more popular than the opposition's slogan 'Russia or Europe.' It would not be an exaggeration to say that the actual Georgian 'deep state' is divided into the conditionally 'pro-European' and 'pro-Russian' camps, despite the absence of diplomatic relations with Russia after the 2008 war, and Georgia’s official exit from all Russian-dominated post-Soviet structures. The abovementioned tools maintain Russia's permanent hold on Georgia, not to mention the backstage connections between the influential groups of both countries. The full picture of Russian influence in Georgia remains largely unexplored, despite numerous works on the issue. That said, the EU must consider a full set of factors and the peculiarities of the Georgian national context in its efforts to counter Russian influence and simultaneously mend its worsening relations with Georgia. Breaking the vicious circle in bilateral relations is in the best interest of both sides, if look at the rapidly changing geopolitical circumstances. The EU has a choice between a tough and pragmatic approach to its Georgia policy based on recent events in Georgia and GD actions. The perception of political processes in Georgia as 'half empty or half full' may lead to misreading the actual situation in the country. The demand for a new parliamentary election emanating from certain EU institutions, may not be the best solution, if reckon with a genuine situation in the country. A new election is not a demand of the majority of Georgian electors. Besides, the holding of a new election may lead to new and prolonged political turbulence. It’s easy to guess who will benefit. Furthermore, there is still no convincing proofs of massive fraud in the 2024 poll. The EU's strict stance towards Georgia, including various punitive measures, could urge GD to take protective measures, which may include increase of its multi-vectoral strategy at the cost of the pro-European path. The probability of breeding anti-European sentiments in a substantial portion of Georgian society with long-term consequences, should also be considered. Georgia's transit potential and unique niche in the geopolitical plan for EU enlargement also should not be written off. Georgia is an important link in the transit of energy carriers to Europe, after the closure of the routes through Russia, and also an important link in the mega-project 'Middle Corridor' in which the EU is going to become one of the investors. Georgia is also part of the EU’s promising projects to gradually pull it out of Russia’s clutches. All this requires at least political stability in the country. Thus, its expedient if in the nearest future the EU finally decide and publicly declare its unambiguous attitude regarding the recognition or non-recognition of the results of Georgia's parliamentary election 2024. The EU may be better off embarking on proactive engagement instead of punitive measures. This may include joint measures for searching ways to reduce Russian economic leverage in Georgia, how to make DCFTA more workable and EU financial injections into the industries, that are most dependent on Russia. A comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and efficiency of the EU-funded programs for fighting Russia's 'soft power' in Georgia is long overdue. The past frustration probably should not prevent the EU to reattempt its mediation to defuse a political conflict in Georgia, and not allow Russia to capitalize on it. Given the current complex geopolitical circumstances and high stakes, hardly it would be wise for the EU to stay in an 'autopilot mode' when it comes to its policy in Georgia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr24_aSKIgKZ2	2025-03-01T17:15:20-08:00	
Ho Hum At Sea: Anti-China Hysteria Down Under – OpEd	The conduct of live-fire exercises by the People’s Liberation Army Navy Surface Force (the Chinese 'communists', as they are called by the analytically strained) has recently caused much murmur and consternation in Australia. It’s the season for federal elections, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, thinks he’s in with more than a fighting chance. Whether that chance is deserved or not is another matter. The exercise, conducted in international waters by a cruiser, frigate and replenishment ship, involved what is said to have been poor notice given to Australian authorities on February 21. But the matter has rapidly burgeoned into something else: that what the Chinese task fleet did was mischievously remarkable, exceptional and snooty to convention and protocols. It is on that score that incontinent demagogy has taken hold. Media outlets have done little to soften the barbs. A report by ABC News, for instance, notes that Airservices Australia was 'only aware of the exercises 40 minutes after China’s navy opened a ‘window’ for live-fire exercises from 9.30am.' The first pickup of the exercises came from a Virgin Australia pilot, who had flown within 250 nautical miles of the operation zone and warned of the drills. Airservices Australia was immediately contacted, with the deputy CEO of the agency, Peter Curran, bemused about whether 'it was a potential hoax or real.' Defence Chief Admiral David Johnston told Senate estimates that he would have preferred more notice for the exercises – 24-48 hours was desirable – but it was clear that Coalition Senator and shadow home affairs minister James Paterson wanted more. Paterson had thought it 'remarkable that Australia was relying on civilian aircraft for early warning about military exercises by a formidable foreign task group in our region.' To a certain extent, the needlessly irate minister got what he wanted, with the badgered Admiral conceding that the Chinese navy’s conduct had been 'irresponsible' and 'disruptive'. Wu Qian, spokesperson for the China National Ministry for Defence, offered a different reading: 'During the period, China organised live-fire training of naval guns toward the sea on the basis of repeatedly issuing prior safety notices'. Its actions were 'in full compliance with international law and international practice, with no impact on aviation flight safety'. That said, 49 flights were diverted on February 21. Much was also made about what were the constituent elements of the fleet. As if it mattered one jot, the Defence Force chief was pressed on whether a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine had made up the task force. 'I don’t know whether there is a submarine with them, it is possible, task groups occasionally do deploy with submarines but not always,' came the reply. 'I can’t be definitive whether that’s the case.' The carnival of fear was very much in town, with opposition politicians keen to blow air into the balloon of the China threat across the press circuit. The shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie warned listeners on Sydney radio station 2GB of 'the biggest peacetime military buildup since 1945', Beijing’s projection of power with its blue-water navy, the conduct of two live-fire exercises and the Chinese taskforce operating within Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone off Tasmania. Apparently, all of this showed the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, to be 'weak' for daring to accept that the conduct complained of was legal under international law. 'Now that may be technically right, but that misses the deeper subtext, and that is China is now in our backyard, and they’ve demonstrated that we don’t have the will to insist on our national interest and mutual respect.' There are few voices of sensible restraint in Australia’s arid landscape of strategic thinking, but one could be found. Former principal warfare officer of the Royal Australian Navy, Jennifer Parker, commendably remarked that this hardly warranted the title of 'a crisis'. To regard it as such 'with over-the-top indignation diminishes our capacity to tackle real crises as the region deteriorates.' Australia might, at the very least, consider modernising a surface fleet that was 'the smallest and oldest we’ve had since 1950.' Allegations that Beijing should not be operating in Australia’s exclusive economic zone, let alone conduct live-fire exercises in international waters, served to give it 'a propaganda win to challenge our necessary deployments to North-East Asia and the South China Sea – routes that carry two-thirds of our maritime trade.' The cockeyed priorities of the Australian defence establishment lie elsewhere: fantasy, second hand US nuclear-powered submarines that may, or may never make their way to Australia; mushy hopes of a jointly designed nuclear powered submarine specific to the AUKUS pact that risks sinking off the design sheet; and the subordination of Australian land, naval and spatial assets to the United States imperium. Such is the standard of political debate that something as unremarkable as this latest sea incident has become a throbbing issue that supposedly shows the Albanese government as insufficiently belligerent. Yet there was no issue arising, other than a statement of presence by China’s growing navy, something it was perfectly entitled to do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr4nDZ7Hbdbvs	2025-03-01T17:12:01-08:00	
Walking The Tightrope Of Faith In A World Adrift – OpEd	In the quiet moments of prayer, when the noise of the world fades and the heart turns inward, many of us confront the same haunting question: Is this worth it? The question lingers in the ache of lost friendships, the sting of mockery, and the weight of loneliness that settles like a shadow. To be a young Catholic today is to feel suspended between two worlds, neither of which seems to fully understand you. You are 'too much' for a culture that dismisses sacrifice as backwardness, yet 'not enough' for those who wear faith like a badge of superiority rather than a mantle of love. This is the tightrope we walk—a path that feels precarious, isolating, but also mysteriously sacred. For those of us clinging to the Church’s teachings on chastity, modesty, the sanctity of life, or the Real Presence, the world does not merely disagree with us; it often recoils. To embrace biblical femininity in an age that conflates liberation with rejection of tradition is to invite labels like 'brainwashed' or 'submissive.' To wear a veil at Mass, a silent act of reverence, becomes a spectacle in a world uncomfortable with visible piety. To speak of saving sex for marriage is met with incredulity, as if we have sworn off oxygen. The underlying message is clear: Your values are a threat. Yet the greater wound often comes from within. We watch as friends and family drift from the faith, their once-vibrant belief diluted by the currents of relativism. We encounter fellow Catholics who treat tradition like a buffet, cherry-picking teachings that suit their politics or lifestyle. Online forums dissect our every stance: Why do you veil? Is not that oppressive? Why take issue with cohabitation? Do you not know mercy? The subtext is a quiet accusation: You are making this harder for the rest of us. And so the tightrope narrows. We are torn between grieving those who leave and resisting the urge to shout, 'Come back — this is where life is!' Loneliness compounds these struggles. It is in the empty chair at Sunday Mass where a friend once sat. It is in the family gathering where your convictions are met with eye rolls. It is in the ache of scrolling through social media, bombarded by posts celebrating choices that unravel the very fabric of human dignity. The isolation is not just emotional; it is existential. To hold fast to the truth in a world that worships autonomy is to become a living sign of contradiction. And contradictions make people uneasy. But here, in the stillness, God whispers a reminder: This is not your home. The saints knew this. They walked the same tightrope, their lives a testament to the cost of discipleship. St Maria Goretti, a girl of twelve, chose death over sin. St Thomas More, a statesman, lost his head rather than betray his conscience. Maximilian Kolbe stepped forward to die in place of a stranger. They, too, were called extremists. They, too, were alone in their darkest hours. Yet their stories echo across centuries because they understood: The Cross is not a failure. It is the portal to resurrection. This is the paradox of our faith. The tighter we cling to Christ, the more the world resists us — but the more deeply we encounter Him. In the sacraments, He nourishes us. In the Eucharist, He becomes our sustenance. In confession, He lifts the weight we cannot carry. These are not abstract rituals; they are lifelines. When friends vanish, He remains. When the culture ridicules, He whispers, I endured this too. And we are not as alone as we feel. For every post ridiculing tradition, there are quiet rebellions of love unfolding elsewhere: A college student praying a rosary outside an abortion clinic. A young couple attending Natural Family Planning classes, undeterred by sneers. A teenager is setting up an altar in her dorm room. These stories rarely go viral, but they are written into the fabric of the church. We are part of a hidden communion — saints in the making, scattered like embers in the dark, each of us glowing faintly but collectively holding back the night. The world’s rejection, then, is not proof of our irrelevance but of our purpose. Jesus warned, 'If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world…the world hates you' (John 15:19). Our alienation is a badge of fidelity. Every time we choose the narrow road, we echo the martyrs. Every time we kneel to veil, we join the generations of women who embodied the Church as Bride. Every 'no' to sin is a 'yes' to the God who carved us from His own heart. This does not mean the tension disappears. The tension remains. We will still cry when a loved one leaves the church. We will still wince at the jokes. We will still wonder in weak moments if compromise might be easier. But ease is not the metric of a life well lived. The Cross was not easy. The Garden of Gethsemane was not easy. What sustains us is not the absence of struggle but the presence of meaning. When loneliness grips you, remember: You are part of a story larger than yourself. You are surrounded by a 'cloud of witnesses' (Hebrews 12:1) — saints, ancestors, and ordinary believers who refused to let the world dim their light. You are united to a global body, praying in languages you do not speak, in parishes you will never visit, yet bound by the same creed. Most of all, you are loved by a God who did not spare His own Son to claim you. So keep going. Stay close to the Eucharist, where Heaven touches Earth. Cling to the rosary, your armour against despair. Forgive those who do not understand. Love those who leave. Trust that every small 'yes' to Truth plants a seed — in others, in the culture, in your own soul. The road is hard, but it is not bleak. We walk it with the One who called Himself the Way. And at the end of this narrow path, a promise awaits: 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard… God has prepared for those who love Him' (1 Corinthians 2:9). Heaven is your home. And every step you take — shaky, weary, but resolute — brings you closer.

The Unfinished Ceasefire: Why The Global Community Must Compel Is...	In international politics, ceasefires and peace agreements are delicate and fragile lines that can collapse with the slightest violation or neglect. These agreements not only signal a willingness to maintain peace but also serve as crucial safeguards against escalating conflicts and future wars. Within the complex crises of the Middle East, Israel—one of the persistent parties in these conflicts—has repeatedly demonstrated a disregard for these fragile boundaries. By continuously violating ceasefires and delaying troop withdrawals, Israel undermines the peace process, posing a significant threat to global efforts to establish stability in the region. Such repeated breaches escalate tensions and deepen crises. In this context, the international community cannot remain limited to verbal condemnations; it must take serious and decisive measures to ensure that Israel not only commits to ceasefires in words but also enforces them in practice. This is an opportunity for the global community to reaffirm that peace agreements must be upheld and that no one should be allowed to violate them without consequence. After prolonged mediation efforts, a ceasefire was finally established in Gaza and Lebanon. However, these ceasefires remain fragile and unstable. To transform them into lasting peace, all parties must fully respect and adhere to their commitments. Only through the faithful implementation of these agreements can a sustainable future of peace and stability in the region be envisioned. Otherwise, the ceasefire will remain ineffective, and the peace process will fail from the outset. A firm and enforceable ceasefire is the most critical prerequisite for ensuring stability and preventing further escalation. Israel has a long history of violating ceasefires and peace agreements in the Middle East. From the armistice agreements of the 1948 and 1967 wars to recent ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel has consistently ignored its commitments to withdrawing troops and honoring truce terms. For instance, after the 2006 Lebanon War, despite a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli forces repeatedly violated Lebanese airspace and conducted military incursions. A similar pattern has been observed in Gaza, where, despite ceasefires in 2009, 2012, and 2014, Israel continued bombing civilian areas and conducting military operations while claiming adherence to the agreements. These persistent violations have not only derailed the peace process but have also fueled mistrust and intensified conflicts. Today, the situation remains unchanged. In Gaza, despite international mediation and declared ceasefires, Israel continues to delay the withdrawal of its forces from occupied territories. In Lebanon, the Israeli military still breaches Lebanese airspace and postpones its troop withdrawals. Additionally, Israel has opened a new front of tensions in the West Bank through military assaults and expanding illegal settlements, blatantly violating past agreements and international resolutions. These actions reaffirm that ceasefire agreements can only be effective if all parties respect them. Otherwise, as history has shown, ceasefires and peace accords will continue to be violated. If Israel persists with this approach, the peace process will collapse, and existing crises will only deepen. The international community, particularly European and Arab nations, must take a firm and coordinated stance to ensure Israel adheres to its ceasefire commitments. History has shown that Israel’s repeated violations of ceasefires disrupt the peace process and escalate conflicts. No party can afford to remain indifferent. Regional powers, including key Arab and European nations, as well as the United States, must exert diplomatic and economic pressure on Israel to comply with its obligations. Only through a unified and resolute response can Israel be compelled to uphold ceasefires and withdraw from occupied territories. Without such international pressure, ceasefires will remain unstable, and regional peace will continue to be at risk. Ultimately, enforcing ceasefires is not solely the responsibility of the conflicting parties but also a fundamental duty of the global community and international observers. While the Palestinians have consistently upheld their commitments, it is now the responsibility of the global community to pressure Israel into genuine compliance, transforming ceasefires into lasting peace. Only by ensuring that Israel respects its ceasefire agreements can a full-scale crisis be averted and the path toward lasting peace be secured. This responsibility falls upon those who claim to lead the world in the pursuit of peace and security. 'This is the moment to move from words to action—because history never forgives missed opportunities.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5PXNBU0l5ht	2025-03-01T17:06:49-08:00	
UNICEF Rings Alarm Over Child Abuse Crisis In Pacific	By Sera Sefeti Pacific island children are experiencing 'alarming' violence and abuse, amongst the highest rates in the world, amid a lack of government-funded services, religious and cultural barriers and growing drug use. Seventeen nations meet this week with civil society groups and stakeholders in the Fijian capital Suva for the inaugural Children’s Wellbeing Summit, as reports of human rights abuses escalate. More than half the population of the Pacific islands region is under the age of 24 but a lack of accurate and comprehensive data was highlighted at the summit as an impediment to understanding the enormity of the situation. UNICEF Pacific’s representative Jonathan Veitch emphasised the severity of the crisis at the summit, co-hosted with the region’s Pacific Islands Forum inter-governmental body. 'The levels of violence, abuse, and neglect of Pacific children are among the highest in the world,' Vietch said. 'The statistics we have been discussing over the last few days are alarming.' 'Despite the beauty and richness of the Pacific region, our girls and boys face significant challenges that threaten their well-being,' he added, calling for greater regional collaboration and resource-sharing to strengthen child protection systems. 'It is not only the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do. The impact of child protection on a country’s economic and social development is significant.' UNICEF’s ‘When Numbers Demand Action’ report released last October estimated one-in-three, or 6 million, women in Oceania had experienced contact sexual violence before the age of 18. Papua New Guinea has the region’s largest population, with an estimated 12 million people. PNG’s National Office for Youth and Family Services acting director Jerry Wap echoed UNICEF’s alarm, citing government neglect of support services and law enforcement. 'Over the years, there has been a lot of violence against women, children, and young girls,' Wap told BenarNews. 'It’s unacceptable and goes against our culture and traditions.' 'PNG is a big country, but we only have 5,000 police officers. That is not enough to protect our people. On top of that, we have tribal warsand increasing alcohol and drug abuse,' he said, adding his office has only one protection officer in some provinces. Wap said the lack of reliable statistics was a major challenge in addressing the issue and data from government departments, churches and NGOs needed to be collated to get a 'true picture.' PNG conducted a Census last year, the results of which are highly anticipated after the last credible one was in 2001, but it has been criticized for failing to meet many basic international benchmarks. 'It is very important to have a national database,' he said. 'The government needs to invest in this area.' With a growing young population, the need for action and to place children at the heart of the Pacific’s regional priorities is seen as ever more urgent. Acting PIF Secretary-General Desna Solofa told the summit children should be central to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. 'We must invest in their future by providing them with the opportunities, support, and safe environment they need so they reach their full potential,' she said. The United Nations Human Rights Council’s four-yearly review of summit host Fiji in January highlighted a litany of issues. A U.N. report found Fiji was failing to fully implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, highlighted a 'prevalence' of child abuse and neglect, and recommended actions to end child marriage, prostitution and labor. One of the summit’s most striking presentations was by senior economist Simon Halvey, from consultancy Cornerstone, outlining the financial cost to Fiji. A Cornerstone report for UNICEF found violence against children in Fiji alone costs an estimated FJD459.8 million (US$198 million) annually, equivalent to 4.2% of the country’s GDP. Halvey said that prevention was not only a societal obligation but a financially sound investment. 'I was blown away by that presentation. It made me realize the economic benefits of investing in child welfare,' Kiribati’s Minister for Women Ruth Cross Kwansing told BenarNews. She acknowledged her nation has work to do, particularly in breaking the cycle of violence perpetuated by males. 'In Kiribati, we have a saying that translates to ‘our children are our hearts.’ Once our parents, especially fathers, start to understand the effects that abuse has on our children, they will realize the difference between tough love and discipline,' she said. The shortcomings of faith communities in providing safe spaces for children was also acknowledged by the Pacific Council of Churches. 'The power, trust, and responsibility of faith communities have been abused by some leaders,' said PCC general secretary James Bhagwan. 'There have been instances where we have failed. In fact, we have been responsible.' Bhagwan said the Convention on the Rights of the Child was important, but Western rights-based, legal frameworks can be difficult to navigate in the Pacific. 'It can be very technical and heavy on the head,' he said. 'A holistic approach means we like to use the head, the heart, and the hands; that means using human rights (the head), spiritual faith (the heart), and traditional culture, indigenous knowledge, and wisdom (the hands).'

Perspectives, Challenges Of Ukraine’s Next Election – Analysis	By Tatiana Vorozhko The issue of Ukraine’s next presidential election has emerged as a possible element in the peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that the United States is negotiating. Ukrainian leaders and elections experts argue, however, that holding elections anytime soon would endanger lives and Ukraine’s sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected in April 2019, and the next presidential election was scheduled for March or April 2024. However, martial law has been in effect since Russia invaded the country in February 2022, and Ukrainian law prohibits presidential elections when martial law is in effect. U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted Zelenskyy for not holding a presidential election. In a Feb. 19 post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said of Zelenskyy, 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‘like a fiddle.’ A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Some members of the U.S. Congress and conservative commentators echoed Trump’s demand that Ukraine hold elections to prove its democratic credentials. 'Zelenskyy should hold elections. They are basically under martial law. That’s not good when you claim to be defending democracy. They need to practice it,' Republican Senator Josh Hawley told VOA. Republican Representative Victoria Spartz told VOA that Ukraine should hold 'transparent elections, and that not doing so allows Russia to say, ‘You have an illegitimate president signing these contracts and deals.’' Russia has questioned the legitimacy of Ukraine’s president and government since 2014, well before Zelenskyy was elected to office. During his televised question-and-answer event on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he couldn’t negotiate with Zelenskyy until his legitimacy is confirmed through elections. 'If someone goes to the elections, gains legitimacy there, we will talk with anyone, including Zelenskyy,' he said. Zelenskyy said during a Feb. 23 press conference that he would step down as president if it meant 'peace for Ukraine' but pushed back on the calls for holding elections. 'How can we call an election in which half of the country’s population won’t be able to vote?' he said. 'How can we vote when today, [Ukraine was] attacked with 267 drones?' His major political rivals, former President Petro Poroshenko, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, have also rejected the call for holding elections. According to a February poll, 63% of Ukrainians also reject it. Many challenges Ukrainian election experts say there are many challenges to holding free and fair elections under wartime conditions. It would violate international principles of electoral law, according to Yevhenii Radchenko, a former deputy chair of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. 'Elections must be universal, equal and free. During active hostilities, it is unrealistic to guarantee the safety of any of the participants, and due to massive Russian strikes, a significant part of the electoral infrastructure has been destroyed,' she said. Radchenko, who joined Ukraine’s armed forces, texted VOA from the trenches at the Donetsk front. On Feb. 27, OPORA, a leading Ukrainian nongovernmental organization involved in public oversight and advocacy in the field of elections, issued a statement signed by several other Ukrainian NGOs titled, 'Statement of Ukrainian Non-Governmental Organizations on the Impossibility of Holding Democratic Elections without the Sustainable Peace.' ‘Armed forces or elections’ After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian parliament, as required by the country’s constitution, introduced martial law, which prohibits elections. OPORA chairperson Olga Aivazovska said the purpose of martial law is to preserve the state and mobilize society for defense. 'We have to choose either the armed forces or elections,' she told VOA. Aivazovska noted that Ukraine held elections between 2014 and 2022, when the conflict with Russia was ongoing in eastern Ukraine, but before Russia launched air raids on Ukrainian territory. 'Even if a ceasefire is established, there are no guarantees that Russia would not violate it as it did many times between 2014 and 2022,' she said. 'It can carry out a massive shelling of the Ukrainian territory on election day. It can organize terrorist attacks at the polling stations, killing voters, election workers and observers, or at the minimum, disrupt the process.' Aivazovska said it would be easy to contest an election as illegitimate if only 5% to 10% of the population votes. 'If Ukraine begins the election process without a guarantee of its completion, it means that we are simply giving this tool away to Russia for abuse and manipulation,' she said. Radchenko said that about 14 million citizens — out of a population of 41 million — would not be able to vote, given that the war has dislocated millions of Ukrainians, and nearly a million Ukrainian men and women are serving in the armed forces. According to Aivazovska, it is also unclear how people in areas occupied by Russia, 'where people are subjected to torture, kidnapping and other crimes,' will be able to cast their vote freely, even after lifting martial law. Most of the 7 million Ukrainian citizens who fled the war abroad will also not be able to vote, unless their host countries heavily invest in organizing the process. 'In 2004, the record number of Ukrainians living abroad voted at the polling stations in Ukrainian embassies and consulates — 103,000 citizens worldwide. There are simply no resources available to organize voting for 7 million people,' Aivazovska said. Let Ukraine decide Most of the members of the U.S. Congress interviewed by VOA said Ukraine should be free to decide when to hold its elections. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said the United States and other democracies will encourage Ukraine to hold elections when it can do it safely and fairly, but not when 'Ukrainians are still under invasion by an evil communist dictatorship.' Democratic Representative Eugene Vindman, who was born in Kyiv in 1975, told VOA, 'When 20% of the territory is occupied, when millions of Ukrainians are out of the country, it’s hard to imagine democratic elections representing the majority of the people being held.' Vindman expressed confidence that Ukrainian society will hold elections as soon as it achieves a stable peace. Republican Senator Kevin Cramer said the example of the United States holding elections during World War II is inapplicable because the U.S. didn’t have to fight on its territory. Vindman noted that European countries also suspended elections for the duration of that war. Democratic Representative Seth Magaziner suggested that a strong statement from Trump supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia’s invasion would make it easier for Ukrainians to 'develop a timeline for elections.' Republican Representative Don Bacon pointed out that Russia is in no position to demand elections from Ukraine. 'They haven’t had free elections in 25 years. Putin’s murdered all his rivals. They've been thrown off the buildings. They’ve been poisoned. They’ve been killed in GULAGs,' he told VOA in an email. Katya Andrusz, spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told VOA that at the request of Ukrainian authorities, her office has begun work to ensure that when all the prerequisites are in place, Ukraine can hold elections 'in line with international standards and the commitments Ukraine has made as an OSCE country for holding democratic elections.' 'ODIHR is working with Ukraine in many areas, and we very much appreciate and respect the country’s democratic strength amidst all the ongoing challenges,' she said. VOA’s Kateryna Lisunova contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TTP4DRGWh0FW	2025-02-28T17:26:42-08:00	
China And Angola: From The Pioneering ‘Angolan Model’ To A ‘New’ ...	By Sumie Yoshikawa China has made large loans to African countries with rich natural resources, especially Angola in southwest Africa. China provided 258 loans totaling US$45 billion to Angola, of which US$25.9 billion was invested in the energy sector from 2000 to 2022.1 Chinese loans to Angola amount to more than a quarter of the total loans to all African countries and make China the largest lender to Angola. In return, China has acquired African, and particularly Angolan, natural resources to meet China’s high domestic energy demands. Since the end of its civil war in 2002, Angola has achieved rapid economic growth by building infrastructure and accelerating oil development and its exports with the help of Chinese loans. Angola became the largest African exporter of petroleum to China. Angola has paid the majority of its debt to China in the form of extracted oil. This contractual arrangement, known as the 'Angolan model,' has attracted international attention and criticism.2 Lucy Corkin has argued that despite the importance of the trading of oil for the Sino-Angolan relationship, the arrangement does not bode well for the relationship’s sustainability. Both China and Angola see each other as necessary strategic allies for the foreseeable future, but this may obscure what is an uneasy 'marriage of convenience.'3 Ian Taylor et al. believe the 'marriage of convenience' is experiencing a period of rocky introspection to such an extent as to challenge the notion that China has decisive political sway over Angola.4 The beneficial impact of China’s large loans, however, is limited. The loans enriched only a small segment of Angola’s elite circle and badly worsened corruption. The majority of Angola’s people remained impoverished. The drop in global oil prices since 2014 has left Angola in serious economic distress. Moreover, Angola’s oil production has peaked, and shipments have begun to decline. The 'Angolan model' of collateralizing oil for loans has become increas- ingly difficult to sustain. Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, who took over in 2017, has taken new initiatives during the economic recession and cracked down on the previous administration and its corruption, seeking to restructure external relations. I will consider why and how China invested heavily in Angola’s oil sector, and how the relationship between China and Angola has changed under the new Angolan administration. The 'Angolan Model' and Petroleum A brief review of China-Angola relations and Chinese investments in the latter’s oil sector since the end of the Angolan Civil War is useful. In 1975, Angola gained independence from Portugal when the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) seized control of the capital Luanda and its oil resources and declared independence. Angola then descended into a full-scale civil war between three insurgent organizations: the MPLA, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), each based on different ethnic groups. China initially supported UNITA, which controlled diamond reserves in the inner region. Due to the complex international context of the Cold War, it was not until 1983 that China and Angola established diplomatic relations. With the end of the Cold War, intergovernmental cooperation between China and Angola finally began in the 1990s. After becoming a net importer of oil in 1993, China became interested in importing oil from resource-rich African countries. In the 2000s, China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) began to expand into African countries in full swing. China’s 'going out' strategy encouraged these moves. The Chinese government actively encouraged Chinese enterprises to expand their investment overseas. This strategy contrasted with the 'bringing in' strategy of introducing foreign capital into China, implemented since the reform and opening-up of the 1980s The Chinese government fully implemented the 'going out' strategy after 2000. In Africa, China’s major SOEs targeted mainly two areas: natural resources and infrastructure construction. China has invested heavily in Angola since the end of the civil war in 2002. Initially, Angola sought national reconstruction funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, negotiations between Angola and the IMF stalled due to the lack of transparency in Angola’s finances, especially the balance of payments of the National Oil Corporation, which had supported Angola’s postwar economy. China intervened and lent a hand. In 2004, the Angolan government signed a US$2 billion loan agreement with China, which triggered a massive increase in oil production and the start of Angola’s rapid economic growth. The Angolan government turned to relying on China.5 China provided huge loans to Angola by collateralizing oil. The international community named the contractual arrangement the 'Angolan model.' China agreed on a resource for infrastructure (RFI) deal in which Angola would supply natural resources in exchange for China building infrastructure in Angola. With the formalization of the mining relationship, China received international criticism for 'neocolonialism.'6 Using the Angola case as a model, China has spread RFI deals to other African countries and beyond.7 China’s loans to Angola continued to increase, reaching a cumulative amount exceeding $40 billion. In addition to infrastructure construction related to the oil industry, China has built railroads, ports, and housing by providing loans for these projects. In an important sense China has been deeply involved in nation-building in Angola, but with a significant downside: the Chinese government’s 'going out' strategy pumps large loans into African countries that are at high risk of corruption. At the same time, the oil imported from Angola helps to sustain rapid economic growth in China. Chinese SOEs in Angola’s Oil Sector Let us look at Chinese involvement, including loans, in Angola’s oil industry. Both the Chinese side and the Angolan side of the loan process have lacked transparency, leading to the emergence of several problems. China’s involvement in the Angolan oil sector was built on a cooperative relationship with Sonangol, a major state-owned enterprise with its headquarters in the capital city of Luanda. The three major Chinese oil companies—China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroeum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)—do not operate independently, and their involvement in Angola has been based solely on their relationship with the Sonangol.8 China and Angola first established two joint venture companies, China Sonangol International Holding (CSIH) and China Sonangol International (CSI). In 2004, CSIH and CSI established Sonangol Sinopec International (SSI). In general, the two countries have agreed that the Export-Import Bank of China will provide loans to Angola and that the loans will be jointly administered by the Angolan Ministry of Finance and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.9 A Chinese state oil company, usually Sinopec, will extract Angola’s petroleum in collaboration with Sonangol.10 In addition to the process of public inflows, there is reportedly a 'shadow' financing structure between China and Angola. The China International Fund (CIF) is famous in the oil sector. It is managed by the Queensway 88 group, ostensibly a private Hong Kong-based firm. A US Congressional report claims the CIF is linked to both the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security in China.11 The Gabinete de Reconstrução Nacional (GRN), Angola Reconstruction Agency, has managed loans from the CIF. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled Angola from 1979 to 2017, created GRN in 2005 to facilitate rapid infrastructure reconstruction before national elections. The CIF and GRN institutions are accountable only to the President.12 Both have been operating without the accountability demanded by Western standards, with extremely opaque management and accounting flows and a lack of international observation. One of the biggest proponents of China’s increased involvement in Angola’s oil sector has been dos Santos, widely criticized as a dictator who created one of the most corrupt regimes in Africa. Dos Santos had used Sonangol for fund- raising since 1979. The company reportedly functions for the benefit of dos Santos, his 4 family and friends.13 Many of the key members of the MPLA and Sonangol’s board of directors are connected by blood and friendship to form an exclusive social circle. This group was often called Futunguistas, after the name of one of dos Santos’s presidential palaces. They monopolizing the wealth of Angola’s economic growth. The Chinese SOEs that conducted business in Angola developed personal relationships with the Futunguistas. Contracts between Chinese companies and Angolan elites were not transparent, and corruption was widespread. Much of the profits went to families and associates of dos Santos. In 2015, Chinese authorities arrested Sam Pa, CEO of the CIF, which had promoted business in Angola, on corruption charges related to Sinopec’s oil license bid in Angola. CIF was reportedly complicit in corrupt dealings with the Angolan side in numerous projects in Angola.14 While some of the elite groups had acquired enormous wealth, the Angolan people have remained in chronic poverty and have not been able to benefit from the oil sales. Corruption and social injustice exacerbated civil unrest and led to protests against both Angolan authorities and Chinese companies. The dos Santos administration, however, restricted the activities of media organizations and journalists, silencing criticism of China’s growing role in Angola, serious corruption, labor exploitation, job competition, and other related problems. China developed a special relationship with some of Angola’s elites in the oil sector, allowing money to flow into the country in a manner that remained opaque to the outside world. Problems with China’s Investment in Angola In 2017, dos Santos stepped down after 38 years as President and was replaced by new President Lourenço. At the time of the change of government, Angola was experiencing serious economic hardship, a major cause being the huge loans from China and the burden of repayment. First, the 'Angolan Model' of Chinese loans based on oil has become unsustainable due to the drop in global oil prices and decline in Angolan oil production. The model was initially promising. After China made huge loans to African countries, these African economies began experiencing high growth due to the resource boom. Angola’s economy, in particular, experienced high growth based on the oil business. However, international oil prices started to plummet in 2014, and the Angolan economy fell into chaos. Although the repayment terms of some of the Chinese loans are unknown, many are reportedly linked to the price of oil. The drop in the price of oil means more oil is needed to repay the debt. Angola had to export more oil to China, its largest creditor, than it had before. After expanding its foreign currency borrowing, Angola’s cash flow rapidly deteriorated, and in 2016 it began asking for assistance from the IMF. Angola discussed the condition of accepting reforms to restore its public finances in exchange for receiving financial assistance from the IMF. Furthermore, during the same period, production peaked in most of Angola’s onshore oil fields. Since then, the amount of oil extracted gradually declined. Angola owed China more than $40 billion and was running out of the chief means of repaying the debt. This created incentives for Lourenço to reduce economic reliance on the oil industry and to diversify the Angolan economy. The second problem was the poor governance that had become prevalent in the previous dos Santos administration, exacerbated by the corruption fueled by Chinese loans. Dos Santos and some of his aides who managed Chinese loans and projects had amassed enormous wealth, while the majority of Angolans remained poor. The Lourenço administration launched an anti-corruption campaign immediately after taking office. The campaign was aimed at eradicating the corrupt practices that had ballooned during the dos Santos era. In a symbolic incident, Isabel dos Santos, the former President’s eldest daughter, was removed from her position as CEO of Sonangol. Ministers and state officials close to the former president were also removed due to corruption.15 With ample resources, Angola could have had a much higher average standard of living had the dos Santos regime been interested in spreading the wealth beyond his family and cronies. China shares in the blame. Luanda Leaks, which revealed the corrupt methods by which dos Santos allegedly amassed his $2 billion fortune, also mentions the involvement of Chinese SOEs in a complex web of corruption.16 Chinese SOEs have developed personal relationships with Angolan bureaucrats, but many of the bureaucrats have lost their jobs on corruption charges. At the same time, the Chinese government undertook its own anti-corruption campaign. Chinese SOEs operating in Angola are clearly worse off with the departure of the dos Santos government. Third, Chinese investments did not fulfill the expectations of improving Angola’s technological capacity and infrastructure. Chinese- funded infrastructure projects in Angola were undertaken by Chinese companies, which brought in large numbers of workers from mainland China. Angolan workers were largely excluded. When they were hired, it was mainly simple labor on Chinese projects under Chinese supervisors. In addition, many of the roads, houses, and buildings constructed by Chinese companies were of remarkably low quality. The hospital built in Luanda was abandoned soon after its completion due to fears that it would collapse.17 Faced with numerous problems, the Lourenço administration has been trying to change the country’s strategy. It criticized the investment agreements with China signed by the previous administration and canceled a few. The new administration arrested key figures from the previous administration and promoted anti-corruption measures. It initiated reforms to improve the business environment because Angola needed to attract new private investments to develop its non-oil sector industries. The new administration is trying to rebuild its relations between China and Western countries, strengthening international partnerships. Lourenço has particularly emphasized relations with China and other developed countries such as the U.S., France, Italy, and Japan as strategic partner countries. He has supported a policy of further strengthening cooperation with foreign partners and diversifying Angola’s economy.18 The new Angolan government has concluded that the 'Angolan Model' of loans and oil exports is already unsustainable, and that continuing to rely on it is a threat to the country’s economic stability. Prospects for the China-Angola Relationship To assess the prospects of the relationship, let us first summarize China’s involvement in Angola’s oil market. Most of Angola’s onshore oil fields have matured and the amount of oil extracted has been declining, which means Angola’s further oil production would be conducted in deepwater and ultra-deepwater fields. Chinese SOEs, however, do not have the technical capabilities to drill deepwater oil wells on their own and are forced to partner with experienced major Western oil companies.19 In their current operations in Angola, Chinese companies are still dependent on Western companies with technology. Chinese SOEs do not enjoy a monopoly in the Angolan oil industry, but are merely cooperating with Sonangol and participating in the complex structure of the Angolan oil domain, which involves many major Western companies. Furthermore, China is increasingly looking to the Middle East and Russia for its oil imports. Angola’s oil supplies to China are on the decline. In 2006, Angola overtook Saudi Arabia, albeit temporarily, to become the number one supplier of oil to China. Afterward, Angola supplied as much oil to China as did Saudi Arabia. In recent years, however, China has increased its purchases from Russia and Iraq. This is partly due to China’s growing interest in Russia and the Middle East, as exemplified by China’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the one hand, and its efforts to mediate relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the other hand. Although Angola remains one of China’s top suppliers of oil, Angola’s shipments to the latter have been declining partly because of the renegotiation of the Lourenço government’s debt with China. Worse still, China’s robust demand for oil will face limits. China has been shifting its industrial structure from resource intensive construction and manufacturing to services and consumption. Coupled with the stagnant Chinese economy, China presents many uncertainties as a major market for a supplier such as Angola. Beijing is also becoming more cautious about large loans in Africa and is reducing its investments. Now that China’s ravenous pursuit of resources has subsided, there is no sign of another resource boom similar to the millennium years. African economies will return to a low-growth trend without boosts coming from China. As Sino-African relations expanded rapidly in the 2000s, the 'Angolan model' of repaying Chinese loans with natural resources spread elsewhere on the African continent with similar arrangements. Such loans have come under severe international criticism. Under the Chinese 'going out' policy, irrational economic activities such as China’s cavalierly signing expensive deals with resource-rich African countries in the 2000s have decreased. Many of the loans that China has granted to African countries have become non-performing loans, and the Chinese government expects to force the repayment of these debts. It is possible that the achievement of Beijing’s true objectives in investing in Africa do not require African countries to repay their loans. If so, China may see advantages in continuing to invest heavily in countries such as Angola. However, managing and operating these far-flung assets will saddle China with new and heavy burdens as well as drawing China deeper into Africa’s problems in the future. What does the future hold for China-Angola relations? Chinese loans have been channeled through the state-controlled oil industry in Angola and the political elite of the former President dos Santos. While the projects paid for by the loans seemed necessary and appeared efficient in the short term, they were not politi- cally, economically, or environmentally sustainable in the long term for Angola. The Angolan side hopes to develop its relationship with China from its previous focus on loans to a new paradigm of diversified private investments. This new trend does not mean that the Angolan government is trying to drive China away. Angola is seeking to develop non-oil industries and has been vocal about attracting private investments. As Angola pursues this strategy, China’s role will not necessarily decrease and may increase. Countries that are critically dependent on selling off their natural resources often suffer from fundamental weaknesses in governance. They find it difficult to break away from their dependence sales of non-renewable resources to raise revenue. There are, however, inspiring exceptions. Malaysia, for example, was able to channel income from natural resources to investments in manufacturing. The chances of the Lourenço administration achieving a simi- lar success will be improved if it can be more transparent in the management of its resource sectors, force the bureaucracy to implement the planned economic diversification, prevent corruption, and make the management of its natural resources more efficient. In 2018, Angola signed the 'One Belt, One Road (OBOR)' memorandum in Beijing. The OBOR has expanded beyond traditional infra- structure development. It now includes the Digital Silk Road and the Health Silk Road. China is increasingly targeting high-value markets in African countries, including technology, telecommunications, and green energy. The relationship between China and Angola has been changing with the COVID-19 pandemic,the growth of Angola’s debt burden to China, and the decline of Chinese loans to African countries. Although the relationship between the two countries remains oil-centric, it has been shifting to other areas of investment such as telecommunications technology. Chinese technology giants such as Huawei are helping create the infrastructure needed to develop the Digital Silk Road in Africa. In March 2022, Huawei and Angolan telecom service provider Unitel signed an agreement that will see the former provide a range of green energy solutions to the latter’s operations.20 While oil remains paramount for China and Angola, cooperation between the two countries is gradually expanding into broader areas beyond energy and infrastructure. Economic diversification could be part of a broader reshaping of the relationship that would contribute to more equitable prosperity as well as stable economic development in Angola.

China’s Flyers Flout Aviation Rules With Flares And Flybys – Anal...	By Zachary Abuza It happened again. A Chinese pilot flew his aircraft dangerously close to a foreign aircraft, something that is happening with increased frequency. In the latest incident, on Feb. 19, a Chinese naval helicopter flew within 9 meters (yards) of a small low-flying Philippine plane above the Scarborough Shoal. The Cessna Caravan turboprop plane belongs to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. Scarborough Shoal, situated 120 miles from Luzon, is well within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. The previous week, a Chinese J-16 jet fighter made an 'unsafe and unprofessional interaction,' releasing at least four flares, 30 meters in front of a Royal Australian Air Force P–8A Poseidon anti-submarineaircraft that was flying near the Paracel Islands. China claims the Australian aircraft 'intentionally intruded' into Chinese airspace. A Chinese official described the response as 'completely reasonable, legal and beyond reproach,' and 'a legitimate defense of national sovereignty and security.' In violation of international law, China has drawn straight baselines around the Paracel and Spratly Islands; something that only archipelagic states are allowed to do under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. Countries routinely challenge these excessive maritime claims through naval and aerial freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs). We have seen a pattern of aggressive behavior from Chinese pilots. An October 2023 report by the U.S. Department of Defense documented some 180 unsafe aerial encounters by Chinese pilots in the previous two years, and over 100 additional encounters with the aircraft of U.S. allies and partners. That tally was more than all such incidents in the previous decade combined. Creating unsafe situations Most U.S. Navy aircraft are now equipped with external cameras to document dangerous Chinese encounters. One should recount that the April 2001 EP3 incident that caused the emergency landing and a hostage-like situation for the 24 member U.S. Navy crew, was caused by a Chinese pilot who was unaware of the concept of propellers. The J-8II pilot was killed in the crash. While Chinese pilots are famously aggressive and routinely fly at unsafe and unprofessional close quarters over the South China Sea, the dropping of flares was unseen until around 2022. While using flares to signal an unresponsive airplane at a safe distance is lawful and a signal of escalatory actions, how the Chinese pilots are employing them now is dangerous, unprofessional, and dramatically escalates the potential for the loss of life. On Oct. 5, 2023, a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance helicopter conducting patrols in support of a UN Security Council-authorized sanctions monitoring against North Korea in the Yellow Sea experienced 'multiple passes' at five meters (yards). Three weeks later, a pair of PLA-Navy J-11 fighters made multiple passes at a Canadian helicopter that was conducting routine patrols as the HMCS Ottawa was conducting a FONOP near the Paracel Islands. The Chinese pilots ejected flares during the second flyby, forcing the Canadian pilot to take evasive action. In May 2024, PLA-Air Force pilots deployed flares in front of an Australian MH-60-R helicopter that was flying in international waters in support of UNSC-authorized sanctions monitoring against North Korea. The helicopter had to take evasive actions to avoid the flares. The following month, a Dutch helicopter flying above its destroyer, also in support of the U.N. sanctions monitoring in international waters in the Yellow Sea, was approached by two Chinese jets and a helicopter, which 'created a potentially unsafe situation.' Flares present risks There are major risks from using flares. The first is proximity: If a Chinese pilot is close enough to deploy flares in a way that could cause damage, his plane is already flying at an unsafe distance. Most of the flares used are pyrotechnic magnesium, i.e. a dense mass of inflamed metal that burns at very high temperatures – to perform as decoys for heat-seeking missiles. These flares pose multiple risks to planes that could lead to the loss of human life. For planes such as a P-8, they can be sucked into a jet engine intake. For propeller driven planes, such as a P-3 or smaller surveillance craft, a direct hit on the engine could irreparably damage the propeller. Though the four-engine P-3s and P-8s are both able to fly on one engine, it’s still a risk. There is a greater threat to the helicopter rotors. Though it is unlikely they could get through the rotor blades and into the filtered intake, it’s not impossible. Moreover, the skin of many military helicopters is made of magnesium alloys and is itself highly flammable. Many surveillance and anti-submarine helicopters fly with open doors, and the last thing the crew wants is a flare, ejected out of a plane at an angle, getting inside an aircraft. Another concern is an escalatory threat. To some sensors on aircraft, the flares can appear as missiles. This is in an already tense operating environment, when an aircraft’s counter-measures are being controlled automatically in response to its sensors. Pilots’ perverse incentive structure There is no need to use flares in this way, but someone, somewhere, in the PLA decided that this is tactically a good idea – and a natural escalatory step from the 'thumping' tactics that their pilots routinely conduct. The use of flares is tied to the aggression that we have long seen from Chinese pilots. In their system, aggressive and unprofessional flying is not only not discouraged, but is actually encouraged. While there’s no evidence that there’s a PLA-AF directive that requires pilots to make unsafe encounters, it is clearly what is considered 'commanders intent' to defend China’s 'historical waters and airspace.' In Chinese military doctrine, this is referred to as 'using the enemy to train the troops.' According to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Center for the Study of the PLA-AF, there is not a single incident that they can point to where a Chinese pilot has faced disciplinary action for aggressive flying. In short, behavior that would cost a U.S. pilot his or her wings is encouraged by the PLA leadership. The Chinese Navy and Air Force will continue their coercive and risky operational behavior in the East and South China Seas as they seek to enforce Beijing’s excessive maritime claims, impinging on the sovereign rights of other states or making illegal assertions in international waters and airspace. A flotilla of PLA-N ships has been sailing some 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, Australia. While such passages are lawful, China’s unprofessional and aggressive tactics are meant to raise the costs to deter other states from flying or sailing where international law permits. The law for me, not for thee. Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Mongolia Keeps Mining For Growth Amid Economic Encertainty – Anal...	By Tuvshintugs Batdelger and Nomun Enkhbold Following Mongolia’s 2024 election, a new government faces the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising global uncertainty. Strong export performance and fiscal expansion fuel optimism, but structural challenges may test the country’s resilience. The Mongolian economy is continuing its recovery from COVID-19-related slowdown. Economic growth was 4.9 per cent in 2024, which is significantly lower than the 7.4 per cent growth in 2023 and the average growth rate of 6.4 per cent over the past 18 years. The industrial sector grew by 5 per cent, with the mining sector expanding by 5.7 per cent. But the agricultural sector, which accounted for around 10 per cent of GDP, contracted by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024. This decline is attributed to severe winter and spring weather conditions, known as the ‘Dzud’, which led to the loss of 8.1 million animals — 12.5 per cent of total livestock. Total exports increased moderately by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year, reaching US$15.8 billion, while imports rose sharply by 25.5 per cent to reach US$11.6 billion, both marking historical highs. Export growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in copper exports. The volume of copper exports reached a record 1.7 million tons, up 11.1 per cent from the previous year, while the average border price of copper increased by US$236 per ton, boosting the value of copper exportsby 26 per cent. Though coal export volume grew by over 20 per cent to a historic high of 83.7 million tons in 2024, the price of coal fell by US$25.4 per ton, leading to a 2.3 per cent decline in the value of coal exports. Economic growth in 2024 was fuelled by significant expansion on the demand side. With relatively favourable conditions for commodity exports and a positive outlook of the near future, the state budget revenue and grants increased by 28.7 per cent from 2023, reaching a historic high of 31.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$9.1 billion). Budget expenditure expanded by 34.9 per cent, reaching another historic high of 30.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$8.8 billion). Private consumption and investment also rose by 27.8 per cent and 26.8 per cent respectively in the first three quarters of 2024. Inflation remained within the central bank’s target range, averaging 6.6 per cent in 2024. This was despite ongoing uncertainties in the external environment, capacity constraints in energy, transport and logistics sectors, significant demand-side expansion and negative supply shocks in animal husbandry. The labour force participation rate continued its steady rise, reaching 63 per cent in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent. The rise in exports also improved the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which registered a record high of US$5.5 billion. This milestone is especially significant considering the Bank of Mongolia made payments of around US$1.1 billion in foreign debt. The togrog remained relatively stable against the US dollar throughout 2024. The government’s debt management strategy for 2023–25 stipulates that new foreign securities will be issued solely for the purpose of refinancing existing debt. Following implementation, as well as abovementioned positive changes in the economy, the government’s sovereign bond spread reached the lowest in history — 2.3 per cent — in 2024. As a result, credit rating agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings upgraded the country’s credit rating to B+ and B2 respectively, marking the highest rating in the past decade. Mongolia saw the formation of its first 126-member parliament following the 2024 parliamentary election. The election — based on a mixed electoral system — led to five parties winning seats, with 78 members elected from constituencies and 48 from party lists. Notably, 25 per cent were women — the highest level of female participation in recent generations. Though the Mongolian People’s Party won the majority of seats, it formed a coalition governmentwith the Democratic Party and the HUN Party, giving it a 94 per cent supermajority. The current coalition government is aiming to implement 14 mega-projects in the next four years, having endorsed linking the railway border connection with China — which should boost coal export revenue by 2.8 times — and uranium mining in collaboration with the French ‘Orano’ group. The new parliament finally adopted the Law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund after many years of deliberation. The fund is composed of three sub-funds, designed to accumulate wealth, finance large state investments and support social measures. Budget discussions were notably intense, resulting in the adoption of a zero-deficit budget for 2025. But the Fiscal Stability Law, which has been in effect since 2013, was amended to remove the upper limit on the overall budget deficit, replacing it with a lower limit on the primary balance surplus. The long-term impact of this change has not been fully assessed, nor has its potential to ensure fiscal stability. Looking ahead to 2025, factors such as disruptions in petroleum supply from Russia, a slowdown in Chinese economy, expanding budget spending, spiralling wage increase, surges in electricity and heat prices and the continued impact of the Dzud will continue to put pressure on inflation and economic growth.

The Great AI Shift: The Rise Of ‘Services As Software’ – Analysis	By Nisha Holla Human effort has traditionally driven the adoption of technology services—programmers coding algorithms and business logic into executable programmes, analysts managing data, system integrators deploying and maintaining infrastructure, and consultants optimising enterprise workflows. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a fundamental shift is underway: human-led services are becoming AI-led software. Instead of hiring large teams of human specialists, businesses will increasingly incorporate AI-powered tools and platforms that automate complex tasks once thought impervious to automation and digitalisation. The AI-driven shift is compelling enterprises to reimagine fundamental work at an unprecedented pace. It raises several critical questions about what happens to human labour when AI replaces labour-intensive services, how AI-driven automation will redefine the relationship between enterprises and the software they adopt, and what new opportunities will emerge in a paradigm where enterprise-grade AI takes centre stage. From SaaS to 'Services as Software' The traditional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model disrupted enterprise Information Technology (IT) by replacing expensive, on-premise software solutions with cloud-based applications. Databases were maintained by the SaaS providers remotely, and the per-seat license model evolved rapidly to annuity payments and the rise of Annualised Recurring Revenue (ARR). SaaS has dominated the technology world for the better part of two decades. Today, AI is pushing the envelope by turning services built to be used by humans as ‘self-serve’ utilities into automatically-running software solutions that execute autonomously—a paradigm shift the venture capital world, in particular, has termed ‘Services as Software’ The shift is already conspicuous across industries. AI tools like Harvey AI are transforming the legal and compliance sector by analysing case law and generating legal briefs, essentially replacing human research assistants. The customer support ecosystem that once required large human teams in call centres now handles significant query volumes daily with AI chatbots and virtual agents. Tools like OpenAI's Code Interpreter catalyse industries operating on data analysis and business intelligence by incorporating AI-driven analytics that replace manual data wrangling. Unlike traditional SaaS, which assists human workers, these AI-driven tools replace labour-intensive processes entirely and generate outcomes with minimal human interventions. ‘Services as Software’ therefore eliminates the human + SaaS unit that serves outcomes and replaces this unit with a full-stack AI-led automation that delivers the same outcomes. Convergence of a technological leap and urgent business requirements Several tailwinds have converged globally to accelerate this shift: AI's rapid advancement: The step-function accomplishments of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have made it possible for software to organise, reason, and execute tasks once exclusive to human effort. The democratisation of AI: Open-source AI models and Application Programming Interface (API)-based infrastructure solutions are making cutting-edge automation accessible to businesses of all sizes. Previously, this level of technology access was only available to mega-cap enterprises. Perplexity's launch of Deep Research, which offers near-enterprise calibre AI services at retail prices, is already challenging the AI industry's subscription and paywall formats by driving costs down even further. Enterprise cost pressures: Businesses are actively adopting AI-driven tools to reduce operational expenses and vastly improve efficiency, particularly in high-cost service functions that usually incorporate a significant human labour component. Talent churn and generational shifts: In particular, as the US Baby Boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) retires and the architects of today's systems leave the workforce, and as cross-border technical talent flows are challenged in a new regime of de-globalisation, enterprises are starting to use emerging AI capabilities to rebalance their human workforce requirements. As a result of these aforementioned factors, there has been a global surge in AI-first companies building products and trained models that automate significant components of services-based businesses, and replace traditional approaches to work entirely. Case studies: AI replacing labour-intensive services Customer service and the end of call centres: For decades, outsourcing customer support to human agents dominated the customer service industry. Today, AI-powered voice assistants and chatbots are disrupting the space. Bank of America's Erica AI handles over 2 million customer interactions daily, surpassing 2 billion interactions since its launch in 2018, dramatically reducing reliance on human agents. Airlines and e-commerce companies are increasingly using AI chatbots to resolve queries without human intervention. As generative AI conversational agents improve, which they are at an unprecedented pace, entire call centres could be replaced with AI-driven agents, making routine customer service a fully automated function with higher-order management entailing human effort. Software development and AI copiloting: Software engineering was once thought impervious to automation, but AI-powered agents are rapidly proving this wrong. These tools today perform complex coding tasks. Examples include GitHub Copilot—which helps developers code faster and reduce manual effort, and Cognition AI's Devin—an AI software engineer capable of building and debugging applications on demand. It is unlikely that developers will be replaced entirely; however, AI will dramatically reduce the need for extensive engineering teams, instead transforming software development into a more automated workflow. Legal and financial analysis: These services traditionally relied on high-cost white-collar professionals but are now disrupted by AI agent-driven automation. Law firms are utilising AI legal assistants for research and contract drafting tasks hitherto reserved for junior associates. AI-powered financial models can now analyse company balance sheets, detect fraud, and even generate investment analysis reports, all at a fraction of the time and cost of human professionals. As AI continues to learn, these white-collar jobs with high hourly costs will increasingly become automated. The AI-driven shift brings into question the traditional notion of availing an ‘expert service’. Software development,legal, and financial services are all coveted industries where workers are considered ‘experts’ delivering specialised services. The human role will undergo tremendous redefinition and will require calibrated re-skilling. The new enterprise stack: AI benches and agents running sprints Historically, enterprises purchased software systems that human professionals then produced their work on top of, with these professionals being the primary drivers of work. These software systems became ‘Systems of Record’ (SOR), with enterprise knowledge and memory encapsulated within them, and business continuity preserved via their persistence. With AI now capable of directly engaging with these SORs, human work is becoming secondary, and this shift is fundamentally re-engineering how businesses consume technology. Businesses won't simply replace SaaS with AI-powered tools; they will build the company's processes and systems around these new systems. Instead of hiring marketing agencies, companies will use AI to generate dynamic marketing and advertising campaigns. Businesses will rely on AI-driven quality assurance and control instead of outsourcing software testing, Quality Assurance, and Quality Control. Instead of manual IT support, enterprises will deploy AI-driven monitoring and cybersecurity agents. AI agents will run Human Resource processes and travel bookings. Every business computer will host dedicated AI agents to monitor human productivity and run real-time coordination of enterprise resources, and calendars. The human role in an AI-First future of the enterprise Despite AI's rapid rise and the potential churn in enterprise workflows, processes, and onboarding of labour, human contribution will continue to remain essential in several key areas: AI oversight and governance will remain a human domain. AI systems must be monitored for ethical concerns, regulatory compliance, and bias correction. Humans will have to ensure responsible AI implementation. Creativity and strategic thinking remain human domains. AI can generate insights, but human leaders and collaborators will drive innovation, interpret business contexts, and make strategic decisions. Humans and AI will collaborate in specialised fields. Doctors will use AI for patient monitoring and diagnosis but will continue to oversee patient care. Lawyers will leverage AI for research but still handle litigation. Scientists will incorporate AI into research discovery, hypothesis generation, data analysis, and simulation but define research objectives and experimental paths. Customer experience and relationship management encompass complex problem-solving and trust-building. AI cannot replace these functions but can handle transactional interactions and customer attention acquisition, while escalations will still require humans. Human supervision is necessary for AI training and maintenance, including debugging, updating, and refining data to prevent outdated and incorrect outputs. AI will reshape roles instead of replacing human expertise entirely, just as prior technologies like desktop computing, cloud, mobile, and app-led SaaS did. Human-AI collaboration will become the new normal. The next phase of AI-led automation The shift from labour-intensive services to AI-driven software is already underway with profound implications. AI will not just assist service-based industries, but also replace traditional workflows with automated alternatives. However, rather than eliminating human roles, AI will redefine them, and possibly adjunct them. The most successful businesses will combine AI's efficiency with human judgement, creativity, and oversight. As AI becomes the core of enterprise technology, businesses that embrace automation will gain a significant competitive edge. The question is no longer if services will become software but how quickly industries will adapt—and what new opportunities will emerge. The companies that lead this transformation will define the next era of global technology—one in which AI and human expertise work in tandem to push the boundaries of innovation.

Europe Comes To Washington To Boost Transatlantic Relations – Ana...	By Luke Coffey This week has been eventful in Washington regarding America’s European policy, with several leaders visiting to hold high-level meetings. The week started with France’s President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to the White House, where he met with President Donald Trump, followed by Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. In addition, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas was also in town for meetings. These high-level visits underscore the importance of transatlantic relations and the critical role of the US in shaping Europe’s security and political landscape. At the top of the agenda for every meeting was Ukraine and the broader question of what the US and Europe need to do to achieve lasting peace in the country. The discussions this week follow a set of high-profile American visits to Europe two weeks ago. The frequency and intensity of these engagements suggest that, despite skepticism in some quarters, the Trump administration is committed to maintaining strong relations with key European allies — even though he might take a more unconventional approach. There are several critical observations to make about the meetings this week, which provide insight into how the Trump administration intends to work with its European partners moving forward. Firstly, it is evident that Trump prefers to engage directly with European nation-states rather than deal with Brussels-based institutions such as the EU. His preference for bilateral relationships over multilateral structures is well known, and this week’s meetings reinforced that tendency. Trump gravitates toward America’s oldest and closest allies, such as the UK and France, rather than embracing the EU as a whole. By all accounts, Macron had a very productive and cordial White House visit. The body language and chemistry between the two leaders suggested mutual respect, something that has not always been evident in Trump’s dealings with his European counterparts. Macron, despite ideological differences with Trump, has made a concerted effort to maintain open lines of communication with the US administration, and it appears this strategy is paying off. Unlike Macron, Starmer does not have a longstanding personal connection with Trump. However, he is quickly establishing a working relationship with the White House. Despite ideological differences, both leaders recognize the importance of Anglo-American cooperation, particularly in matters of defense and security. Starmer and Macron came to Washington with concrete proposals for the future security of Ukraine, rather than simply expecting the US to shoulder the burden. Reports indicate that both countries have agreed in principle to the possibility of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine if the situation demands it. Additionally, both have committed to increasing their defense spending, a move that will likely encourage smaller European nations to follow suit. Secondly, if individual European nations had a good week with Trump, the EU as an institution did not fare as well. Trump’s disdain for the EU is no secret. He was a vocal supporter of Brexit in 2016 and has long accused the EU of implementing trade policies that undermine American businesses. This situation has been made worse by some EU leaders who have publicly criticized Trump in the past — comments that the president often takes personally. Trump’s comments this week were particularly sharp, as he suggested that the EU was created to undermine the US. This assertion ignores the historical reality of European integration, which was largely driven by the need for economic and political stability after the Second World War, and was very much an American-led project in its early days. Nevertheless, Trump’s comments reflect his deeply held skepticism toward the European project. This skepticism is not limited to Trump himself but is shared by several of his cabinet members. A clear example of this was the diplomatic snub of the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to meet with Kallas, citing a 'scheduling conflict.' Given the urgency of the war in Ukraine and the EU’s significant role in supporting Kyiv, this move was extraordinary. To cap off a tough week for the EU, Trump announced the possibility of a 25 percent tariff on all goods imported from the EU. This decision, framed as an effort to address perceived trade imbalances, further signals a potential trade war between Washington and Brussels at a time when transatlantic unity is crucial for confronting shared geopolitical challenges, particularly in Ukraine. Finally, it is clear that Ukraine emerged as a big winner this week. Beyond securing continued European military and financial commitments, Zelensky signed an economic and mineral-sharing agreement with Trump after weeks of tough negotiations. Trump acknowledged that Zelensky was a challenging negotiator, and media reports suggest the talks were far from straightforward. However, Trump’s business-oriented approach to diplomacy means he likely respects leaders who negotiate hard. For Zelensky, this agreement is a crucial win. It ensures long-term US-Ukraine economic engagement and brings American businesses into Ukraine in a significant way. By securing American commercial interests in Ukraine, Zelensky has indirectly bolstered his country’s security. Trump himself admitted that the presence of American businesses on the ground would act as a deterrent against future Russian aggression, reinforcing Ukraine’s position even in the absence of a formal US security guarantee. While Trump has been reluctant to extend a direct military commitment to Ukraine, he recognizes that economic ties can serve as a stabilizing force. The meetings and policy outcomes of this week serve as a reminder that Europe remains a central pillar of US foreign policy. This is regardless of the White House’s ideological preferences. The deep cultural, economic, and security ties between North America and Europe cannot be ignored. Even though the Trump administration takes a transactional and sometimes confrontational approach, the fundamental importance of the transatlantic alliance remains intact. This is good for America and good for Europe. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Is Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Indirectly Deepening Chinese Soft Po...	By Gwendolyn Yap In 2024, the Chinese gaming industry achieved record sales of US$44.8 billion domestically and US$2.55 billion internationally, marking its highest earnings since official data tracking began in 2003.[1] As the second-largest gaming market globally, behind the United States, companies in China have produced internationally acclaimed, award-winning games[2] in recent years, such as Genshin Impact (2020)[3] and Black Myth: Wukong (2024).[4] Both narrative-driven role-playing games have been widely praised for their incorporation of Chinese cultural elements, which has played a key role in popularising Chinese culture on the global stage and bolstering China’s growing soft power. Yet, there remains one significant area of the Chinese gaming industry that, despite its rising popularity, is often overlooked in discussions of China’s soft power: the Chinese e-sports industry. Recording a profit of US$3.8 billion in 2024,[5] the Chinese e-sports industry has been rapidly expanding its international influence through games like League of Legends (LoL) (2009) and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang(MLBB) (2016). LoL, originally published by American developer Riot Games in 2009 and acquired by Chinese company Tencent in 2011, is widely regarded as the world’s most popular e-sport, attracting over 100 million viewers for its 2019 world championship.[6] Specifically in Southeast Asia, however, MLBB has taken the spotlight, outpacing LoL’s mobile counterpart, Wild Rift (2020)[7] to become the region’s dominant e-sport. Released by Chinese company MOONTON in 2016, MLBB has consistently ranked among the top two games in Southeast Asia. In 2019, it earned US$502.5 million, with 61 per cent of its revenue coming from the region.[8] Despite a temporary dip in 2020 following the release of Genshin Impact, MLBB reclaimed the top spot by 2022[9] and remained a leading performer in 2024, ranking first in Southeast Asia for revenue and second in downloads, according to the 'State of Mobile Games in APAC 2024' report by SensorTower.[10] As of April 2024, the game has earned US$1.8 billion globally, with 47 per cent of revenue and 67 per cent of its total downloads coming from Southeast Asia. This report implies two things: (1) MLBB maintains a strong player base to drive high revenue; and (2) it continually attracts new Southeast Asian players, proving strong regional interest. Given this, the question arises: how has MLBB been able to maintain its relevance and appeal in Southeast Asia? Although MLBB was recognised as a key enterprise for national cultural export in 2021 and 2022, this article contends that its direct impact on China’s cultural influence has been minimal. Rather, in line with President Xi Jinping’s Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), which emphasises strengthening people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, it appears that MLBB’s parent company, MOONTON, has leveraged the game’s popularity to conduct Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects in Southeast Asia. These efforts represent a new avenue for the distribution of Chinese soft power in the region. WHAT IS MLBB? MLBB is a mobile game in the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre. Available for download on iOS and Android devices, it is a round-based game that typically lasts between 10 to 30 minutes. Players are split into two teams of five, with the goal of securing the opposing team’s tower to gain victory. Like other MOBA games such as Dota 2 (2013) and LoL (2009), MLBB is heavily dependent on strategy and teamwork. However, unlike Dota 2 and LoL, which require a desktop set-up for efficient gameplay, MLBBstands out by being strictly mobile-only.[11] Despite this unique platform, MOONTON has been sued twice—once in 2017 and another in 2022—by Riot Games, the parent company of LoL. Riot Games, owned by Chinese rival Tencent, claimed that MOONTON had infringed on LoL’s intellectual property by plagiarising elements from the game. In 2024, the two companies reached a global settlement.[12] These legal disputes, however, did not hinder MLBB’s popularity, which has only grown since its release. In 2017, the first official MLBB e-sports tournament, Mobile Legends Southeast Asia Cup, was held featuring teams from Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.[13] The event became an annual fixture, expanding to include other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos by 2019. In 2024, with the inclusion of teams from the Middle East and Africa, the tournament was renamed MLBB Mid-Season Cup, aiming to be 'more globalised and inclusive than ever'.[14] As a result, the tournament transitioned from a regional to an international event, alongside the annual MLBB World Championship.[15] Furthermore, since 2019, MLBB has been a regular e-sports medal event in the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games), aligning MLBB’s prestige with that of traditional sports.[16] WHY IS MLBB SO POPULAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA? Based on conversations with existing MLBB players, online forum discussions, and insights from regional video game journalists,[17] four possible reasons driving MLBB’s popularity in Southeast Asia have been identified: (1) instant gratification; (2) accessible infrastructure; (3) localised content and (4) community. By assessing these four possible reasons, this section will showcase how the technical aspects of the game align with the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) proposed by President Xi Jinping in his 2023 address. In the address, President Xi stated how 'modernisation [can be achieved] [by countries through] consider[ing] its national conditions and unique features'.[18] By tailoring MLBB to Southeast Asian culture and infrastructure, the game aids in positioning China as a leader capable of providing accessible technology to developing regions, thereby boosting its soft power. Instant Gratification MLBB stands out with its shorter gameplay duration, as each round lasts only 10 to 30 minutes, compared to games such as LoL or Dota2, which can take up to an hour. This allows players to experience the instant gratification of a win or loss within a short period. As the outcome of each round varies depending on the players involved, this provides just enough fulfilment to encourage users to come back for more. Additionally, the brief gameplay duration makes it easy for individuals to fit a game into their daily routines, such as during lunch breaks or commutes. MLBB’s appeal is also bolstered by the proliferation of gig economy jobs in Southeast Asia in recent years.[19] Mediated by digital platforms, these jobs—such as delivery work, ride-hailing, and freelancers—often come with fragmented leisure time between assignments. As such, MLBB’s short gameplay offers an efficient way for individuals in these roles to pass the time. Through its user-centric design, MLBB showcases how Chinese developers adapt their games to cater to diverse markets, especially one as diverse as Southeast Asia. Accessible Infrastructure MLBB also sets itself apart from other MOBAs by being available on mobile devices, offering portability that allows players to enjoy the game with friends anywhere, without being bound to a desktop computer. This accessibility caters to a wider audience, especially those who may not have the resources to invest in a desktop computer or console. Wong Si Jia, a senior writer at Geek Culture, a Singapore-based tech journalism company, noted that specifically in Southeast Asia, 'countries like Indonesia [and the] Philippines have a high mobile gaming percentage because they have lower spending power than say, Singapore, where PC and console are the main modes of play'. Indeed, the 'State of Mobile Games in APAC 2024'[20] report reveals that Indonesia leads in mobile game downloads, with 835 million downloads between January and April, followed by the Philippines (368 million) and Vietnam (352 million), in second and third place respectively. Aside from its accessibility on mobile devices, MLBB has a compact application size of under 400MB,[21] making it easy for Southeast Asian players to download. This is especially crucial in a region where telecommunication infrastructure remains uneven despite rapid development.[22] In contrast, Genshin Impact demands nearly 3GB of storage, excluding in-game downloads. Reportedly, MOONTON intentionally kept MLBB’s initial application size at 100MB to bridge 'differences in mobile hardware quality across regions' ('「尊重」全球各地区手机硬件的差异').[23] This optimisation not only reduces the time it takes for players to start playing but also the financial cost of maintaining the game on their devices. The attention to the varied telecommunication infrastructure across Southeast Asia, coupled with the earlier point on user-centric design, showcases how the game attempts to bridge technological and economic gaps within the region, further bolstering the GCI initiative. Localised Content MLBB is popular in Southeast Asia also because MOONTON releases content specifically tailored to the region. For instance, they released characters inspired by Southeast Asian history and folklore, such as Lapu-Lapu in 2017,[24] a hero based on the Chief of Mactan Island, who is regarded as the first Filipino hero. In 2019, MOONTON added Badang,[25] a hero inspired by the legendary strongman from the Malay Annals. By introducing these culturally relevant characters, MOONTON strengthens players’ connection to the game, deepening their engagement with MLBB. Beyond in-game characters, MOONTON has also worked to ensure that MLBB tournaments are relevant to the countries where they are held. Lucas Mao, Managing Director of Global Esports at MOONTON, revealed that the company 'customise(s) a strategy for every country in the region, with emphasis placed on understanding local culture and the local community'.[26] To this end, MOONTON has collaborated with local suppliers to facilitate tournaments, departing from the more standardised approach where companies coordinate equipment and software across countries to ensure consistent quality. Reports indicate that MOONTON even holds prayer ceremonies in Cambodia and Indonesia to respect local customs before event set-ups.[27] By choosing localised implementation, Mao highlights that the content produced is more relevant to local fans, aligning with GCI’s aim in fostering 'cross-region dialogue' ('创造跨赛区对话') and increasing engagement with Southeast Asian audiences. Community Since the early 2000s, the MOBA genre, which emphasises teamwork and strategy, has enjoyed popularity in Southeast Asia, with early games such as LoL and Defence of the Ancients (DotA, the precursor to Dota 2) becoming mainstays in the region. In 2022, Chinese company Tencent released the MOBA game Honor of Kings, which has since become MLBB’s direct competitor in the mobile game market. It was even named Best Game of 2024 in Southeast Asia by Google Play.[28]Although Honor of Kings did not reach MLBB’s record-breaking success, its popularity reflects the region’s strong preference for social gaming experiences. In fact, a 2019 study by GameStart found that 60 per cent of Southeast Asian gamers prefer to play with friends.[29] This strong inclination towards community gaming likely contributes to MLBB’s popularity, since the game relies heavily on teamwork for victory. Additionally, the game’s appeal is further intensified by the sense of community built around its tournaments. Due to MOONTON’s localisation efforts, each Southeast Asian country now hosts its own leagues, allowing teams to compete both locally and regionally. This setup enables players to engage with others in their local community while facilitating connections with players across borders. Beyond the matches, fans also reportedly participate in cultural displays, rap battles, singing, and dancing at these events, creating a sense of belonging unique to MLBB tournaments, and cultivates community spirit, unlike other e-sports.[30] MOONTON CEO Yuan Jing remarked that by building a relatable community, players may come to view the game as 'an integral part of their lives' ('生活中不可或缺的一部分').[31] E-sport competitions through MLBB thus become an avenue in which China’s GCI strategy of advocating for people-to-people exchange and cooperation becomes a reality. HAS MLBB BOOSTED CHINESE SOFT POWER IN THE REGION? Joseph Nye’s concept of soft power underscores the strategic role of cultural exports in enhancing a nation’s influence. For China, its burgeoning gaming industry—designated as a key cultural export in national policy—becomes a leverage in reshaping global perceptions and fostering stronger ties with regions like Southeast Asia.[32] While it is true that MLBB was designated alongside Genshin Impact as a key enterprise for national cultural export in 2021 and 2022,[33] it is worth noting that the game itself does not appear to have a strong impact on China’s cultural influence. This can be attributed to two primary factors: the game’s lack of cultural orientation and its incoherent art style. First, MLBB is fully fantasy-inspired and does not place a strong emphasis on culture. As each game lasts only for a short window, there is not much room for players to become deeply invested in character storylines, let alone experience cultural exposure. Second, the lack of cohesiveness in MLBB’s character art style makes it less conducive to cultural assimilation. The game utilises splash art and illustrations from different artists, ranging styles from chibi— ‘cute,’ childlike characters—to Western comic art styles. As a result, the characters do not look like they belong to the same game, which limits the cultural influence any character could have. Additionally, in a separate survey I conducted on the perspectives of Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian players regarding Genshin Impact, the Chinese soft power influence of the game was found to be minimal at best.[34] For context, Genshin Impact is a game that incorporates cultural constructs in its world-building to engage players, but its impact within Southeast Asia has been limited. Given this, it stands to reason that MLBB, which does not focus on cultural engagement to the same extent, would have an even lesser soft power impact on residents there. That said, one could argue that if iconic Japanese games such as Final Fantasy and Super Mario have become symbols of Japanese culture despite lacking direct references to Japan, then MLBB, given its popularity and absence of overt cultural references to China, might similarly achieve comparable soft power success. However, I contend that the effectiveness of Japanese soft power cannot be directly paralleled with Chinese soft power. Japanese soft power is distinctively rooted in a socio-historical condition of being 'culturally odourless,' a term coined by Koichi Iwabuchi to describe the intentional omission of 'Japaneseness' in Japan’s cultural exports, including Super Mario. This 'odourless' approach, which intentionally downplays cultural markers, paradoxically reinforces 'Japaneseness' in its products, making it a central element of Japanese soft power.[35] In contrast, Chinese games often foreground traditional Chinese cultural elements to evoke a sense of 'Chineseness.' Without these cultural references, the game would likely lack a meaningful cultural impact. This approach aligns with China’s broader strategy of promoting a 'national style,' which prioritises the incorporation of 'traditional Chinese culture' to project an 'authentic and unique Chinese national identity'.[36] This is evident in an earlier study of Genshin Impact, which showed that the game’s portrayal of the region Liyue (modelled after China) is closely tied to traditional Chinese cultural elements. However, respondents in the study did not strongly associate the rest of the game’s aesthetics with China, with some even mistaking it for a Japanese game.[37] A further challenge lies in navigating perceptions that Chinese cultural exports are associated with overt nationalism rather than universal appeal, leading to a need for nuanced designs that balances cultural specificity with global accessibility. Against this background, if Genshin Impact relies heavily on cultural indicators to promote Chinese soft power, the absence of such references in MLBB makes it unlikely to replicate the success of games such as Super Mario and Final Fantasy. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) SOFT DIPLOMACY Rather than directly advancing Chinese soft power through the gameplay itself, it appears that MLBB’s parent company, MOONTON, has positioned itself as a cultural and social ambassador for China by leveraging on MLBB’s popularity to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects in Southeast Asia. Like the technical aspects of MLBB which made it popular within the region, these CSR projects align with the GCI proposed by President Xi in emphasising values such as equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness in interactions with other countries.[38] By engaging with local communities, MOONTON’s CSR efforts are instrumental in implementing grassroots diplomacy to foster regional goodwill, representing a new form of Chinese soft diplomacy in the region. Launched in 2022, ‘MOONTON Cares’, the company’s CSR arm, aims to 'empower local communities and create a more sustainable future for all by bringing positive sociological, humanitarian, and environmental change'.[39] Notable projects in 2024 include providing relief to victims of Typhoon Yagi in Myanmar[40] and distributing notebooks in collaboration with the Philippines’ Department of Education.[41]Additionally, MOONTON has supported the establishment of e-sports academies and other support programmes in rural areas. For instance, 14 schools in West Java and Central Java received enhanced internet connectivity and resources for e-sports-related extra-curricular activities.[42] MOONTON has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National University Laguna in the Philippines to implement e-sports and gaming journalism programmes for students.[43] Through these projects, MOONTON positions itself—and by extension, China—as a responsible and empathetic actor in the region. This approach reinforces a narrative of mutual benefit, aligning with China’s broader diplomatic strategy. As Southeast Asia grows its e-sports scene, MOONTON’s strategic partnerships with Southeast Asian governments such as with the Philippine Ministry of Education illustrate how e-sports are becoming an avenue for cultural exchange and soft power. This is also indicated in growing interest among Malaysian officials. In May 2024, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Rural and Regional Development of Malaysia, YAB Dato’ Seri Dr Zahid bin Hamidi, sent off the Malaysian MLBB team to Saudi Arabia for the Mid-Season Cup 2024. At the press conference, Dr Zahid backed the growth of e-sports in Malaysia and requested the Malaysian MLBB players to 'make Malaysia famous'.[44] Additionally, in September 2024, Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim congratulated the Malaysian MLBB team, the Selangor Red Giants, for winning the Mid-Season Cup 2024.[45] The public endorsements from senior Malaysian officials underscore the significance of MLBB as a cultural bridge between China and Malaysia, enhancing bilateral ties through a shared commitment towards growing the e-sports industry. Dorcas Gan, in her article on Southeast Asian e-sports, affirmed the growing interest among government officials, noting that 'gaming, as manifested in its competitive form of e-sports, is increasingly becoming a national affair [in Southeast Asia], especially as it has the potential to boost a nation’s image'.[46] Indeed, in recent years, e-sports tournaments have gained international prestige, comparable to physical sporting events. MLBB’s inclusion in the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) since 2019 exemplifies this recognition, facilitating partnerships between government agencies and the game. For example, the Philippine government recently supported the MLBB tournament, Unity League, held in early 2024.[47] Similarly, Malaysia has just concluded the final tournament of the 2024 season, the M6 World Championship, in late November, in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, and featured a prize pool of US$1 million.[48] As such, MOONTON’s ongoing contributions in this area not only strengthen China’s image as a leading player in the global gaming industry but also promote Chinese-Southeast Asian collaboration. CONCLUSION By assessing the various factors behind MLBB’s popularity in Southeast Asia, this article has demonstrated the extent to which the game and its parent company, MOONTON, have contributed to Chinese soft power in the region. While MLBB’s gameplay itself plays a limited role in advancing Chinese soft power, MOONTON has strategically leveraged the game’s success to launch CSR projects and promote greater collaboration between China and Southeast Asia at both business and state levels. These efforts have indirectly enhanced China’s cultural image in the process. Looking ahead, the sustained popularity of MLBB in Southeast Asia, combined with MOONTON’s ongoing support for the region’s e-sports industry, signals a promising future for Chinese-Southeast Asia partnerships in the gaming sector.

Egalitarian Interventionists: Why Politicians Love ‘Equality’ – O...	By Joshua Mawhorter It is difficult to find a seemingly more unobjectionable term that 'equality' is the modern West and America. Equality is often understood to be an unqualified good and part of the American creed: 'all men are created equal.' The main reasons politicians love 'equality' are because it is supposedly unquestionable in its obvious justice, slippery in definition, and unachievable. Consider the shifting definitions. 'Equality' can mean equality before the law or rule of law—as Thomas Jefferson and others used it—which actually is an limitedly achievable and just ideal, but then the same word can be used to designate egalitarianism (sometimes distinguished by degrees: 'equity,' 'equality of outcome,' 'equality of opportunity'). Rule of law or equality before the law (sometimes even called 'equality of opportunity,' which is actually different from rule of law) is incompatible with egalitarianism. Rule of law means that the law and legal system—though imperfect in providing justice—seek legal impartiality and judge people according to the same standard, not unduly favoring or disfavoring certain individuals. Admittedly, this ideal is never reached by imperfect and limited humans, but it is just and achievable by degree. Egalitarianism—whether called 'equity,' 'equality,' 'equality of outcome,' or even 'equality of opportunity'—is the opposite of rule of law or impartial equality before the law. Egalitarianism necessitates treating unequal people unequally with the hopes of reaching a more equal result. Choosing egalitarian equalism—enforced by the state—results in inequality before the lawand legalizes a caste system against people based on their belonging or not belonging to certain groups which are thought to have or lack certain amounts of power/privilege (see the Intersectionality Wheel of Privilege and Power). When it comes to 'equality,' we have to ask a few questions to assess it correctly: What is it? Can it be achieved? Is it just? Rothbard lays out an explanation that takes the definition of 'equality' seriously and its consequences, There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be 'equal' in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all of their attributes. This means, of course, that equality of all men—the egalitarian ideal—can only be achieved if all men are precisely uniform, precisely identical with respect to all of their attributes. The egalitarian world would necessarily be a world of horror fiction—a world of faceless and identical creatures, devoid of all individuality, variety, or special creativity. Human Nature and Egalitarianism Humans always and necessarily exist in a world of scarcity, change, temporality, finitude, diversity, subjective valuation, judgment, action, and choice. Rothbard writes that, '[mankind] is uniquely characterized by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation; in short, inequality.' Given those realities, there is no reason to expect any two—let alone more—diverse human beings to ever be equal or be made equal, either in exact 'results' or 'opportunities.' Technically, equality is a spatial and mathematical term of measurement. Even if we skip the problem of unique, diverse, humans with varied subjective preferences being calculated by numerical terms of measurement, so-called equality between humans cannot exist in a world of change, diverse space, time, action, and choice. Only non-acting, non-choosing, non-human quantities, existing in a state of static equilibrium, could possibly even get near 'equality.' Why Politicians Love 'Equality' Generously admitting the convergence of some sloppy definitional thinking, not considering the consequences, and a desire to do what is right regarding people in some cases, I believe that politicians and many others love 'equality' because it is seemingly unquestionable and eternally unachievable. In fact, it might be better said that political elites actually love 'inequality' because its continued, stubborn existence allows them to blame others for their moral failures by not being equal. Were it possible—though it is not even theoretically possible—interventionists and political elites would be disappointed if 'equality' was ever reached. They would be out of a job! The supposed obviousness of the justice of 'equality' (egalitarianism) shields it from scrutiny. This allows political elites—who always like to be 'more equal than others' themselves—to violate the rule of law, intervene constantly in the economy, create castes, enrich themselves, and treat people unequally. Whenever inequality is present, it is supposed to be sufficient justification for the fact that some ethical injustice has taken place and intervention is necessary to correct it. Equality and inequality are also supposed to be measurable statistically, which then implies that every statistical disparity represents an injustice that requires redress (especially by the political state). Thus, the elite obsession with data and statistics—every difference is an opportunity. Conveniently for the egalitarian interventionist, Sowell reminds us, 'Statistical disparities extend into every aspect of human life' in Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality? (p. 19). These statistical disparities—for whatever reasons they exist—are irresistible to interventionists. These differences give opportunity for the use of power. Hoppe explains, 'the egalitarian doctrine achieved this status not because it is true, but because it provides the perfect intellectual cover for the drive toward totalitarian social control by a ruling elite.' And Rothbard reminds us that 'ideologues and researchers…dream up and discover new groups that need egalitarianizing.' There are some that see through this and recognize that empowering egalitarian interventionists does not achieve equality, but it does accrue power to these interventionists. This was the disillusionment of former communist Michael Bakunin, I am not a communist, because communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the State, whereas I want the abolition of the State.... (cited by E. H. Carr, Michael Bakunin, p. 356, emphasisadded) Historically, this has led to perpetual revolution to achieve egalitarianism, always further empowering the state. Every difference is supposed to justify a revolutionary overthrow of society, always empowering collectivism. For example, Mao’s China was described the following way in The Messiah and the Mandarins: Mao Tsetung and the Ironies of Power (p. 187), 'Revolution was the proper occupation of the masses, Mao believed, for only through perpetual revolution could he realize his vision of an egalitarian collective society.' The quest for egalitarianism did not make people more equal—though perhaps closer to equal misery—but it did empower the state and lead to millions of deaths. The continual existence of inequality allows for an envious power elite to gain greater power by convincing people that they are on an altruistic quest for justice, defined in terms of 'equality.' Though no two unique individuals are or ever will be equal, especially in a voluntary society, this situation necessitates 'the permanent imposition of a power elite armed with devastating coercive power.' Ironically, in order to make us all 'equal' requires a 'powerful ruling elite to wield the formidable weapons of coercion and even terror' to achieve it. Further, if individuals—A and B—are unequal, the supposed way to 'correct' this is for A to give money to C (state elites), for C to keep quite a bit (making C unequal), then giving some to B. We are also supposed to trust that if we just give these 'compassionate' and 'wise' individuals enough power—making them vastly unequal to us in power, decision-making, and wealth—that social equality will be the result. The English philosopher, quoted by Rothbard on this topic, said, ...the Procrustean ideal has, as it is bound to have, the most powerful attraction for those already playing or hoping in the future to play prominent or rewarding parts in the machinery of enforcement. Further, Rothbard also quoted the Marxist-Leninist sociologist Frank Parkin, noting that he missed the obvious implications of his own statement, Egalitarianism seems to require a political system in which the state [a group of power elites] is able to hold in check those social and occupational groups which, by virtue of their skills or education or personal attributes, might otherwise attempt to stake claims to a disproportionate share of society’s rewards. The most effective way of holding such groups in check is by denying the right to organize politically, or, in other ways, to undermine social equality. This presumably is the reasoning underlying the Marxist-Leninist case for a political order based upon the dictatorship of the proletariat. (Class Inequality and Political Order, p. 183) Egalitarianism versus Rule of Law Equality before the law or rule of law is incompatible with egalitarianism. A society must pick one because it cannot have both. The US is in a constant and contradictory toggle between these two ideals. Appealing to so-called 'equality of opportunity' (if different than rule of law) will not help and, in fact, shares the foundation with egalitarianism—a government elite must create legal castes and treat people with legal partiality to guarantee an 'equal starting-point' (an impossibility for any unique individuals). Politicians, progressives, and other interventionists love 'equality' and 'inequality' because—wherever they find differences in the unique, diverse, varied experience of individuals and/or groups ('classes')—this allegedly provides the opportunity and necessity for intervention, especially by the state, in the name of 'justice.' This so-called 'justice' does the exact opposite of what it claims to oppose—creating castes by legally privileging and/or disadvantaging individuals based on shared classifications. People admit that the goal is worthy and quibble over 'equality of opportunity' versus 'equality of results.' The goal is also never achieved, therefore, following the previous interventions for 'equality' that inevitably failed, the next rounds of interventions are justified. Egalitarianism—often shielding itself under the slippery term 'equality'—cannot be achieved and is not just. The 'government'—really a euphemism and political class of egalitarian interventions—gets to pose as the neutral, compassionate, unbiased referee-rearranger, armed with the right to measure disparities, determine which ones are important, then treat citizens with legal partiality in order to allegedly make us 'equal.'

Pentagon Says Gender Dysphoria Incompatible With Military, Servic...	Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria will soon be processed for separation by their respective services, according to a new policy memorandum from the Defense Department's Office of Personnel and Readiness. In a Feb. 26, 2025 policy memorandum titled 'Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,' the department detailed, among other things, how affected service members will be separated from the military, the use of pronouns, using sex for determining both adherence to standards as well as use of shared military facilities, and cessation of department funding for medical care related to gender dysphoria. 'It is the policy of the United States government to establish high standards for service member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,' the policy memorandum reads. 'This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria.' Service members affected by the policy may apply for and be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis if there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member who directly supports warfighting. If they don't obtain a waiver, service members with gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service and must be processed for separation. Those service members may elect to separate from service voluntarily and will be eligible for voluntary separation pay if they choose that route. Those same service members will also not have to repay any bonuses received, even if they have a remaining service obligation. Service members who choose to be separated involuntarily will be eligible for involuntary separation pay, which is less than voluntary separation pay. Those service members may be required to pay back any bonuses they received. As an example, an E-5 service member with 10 years of service would collect $101,628 in voluntary separation pay, while that same service member would collect $50,814 in involuntary separation pay. Additionally, impacted service members with more than 18 years of service but less than 20 years of service are eligible for early retirement. All service members affected by the policy will be separated with an honorable characterization of service, except where their record otherwise warrants a lower characterization. Additionally, service secretaries will waive remaining military service obligations for those separated under this policy. The policy directs the identification of affected service members within 30 days. Once identified, separation procedures will begin within 30 days. In an executive order in January, President Donald J. Trump made it the policy of the federal government to recognize only two sexes, male and female. That memorandum said that within the federal government, 'sex' will refer to an individual's 'immutable biological classification as either male or female.' In addition to guidance related to the separation of service members with gender dysphoria, the latest guidance also includes direction on terms of address related to sex, the use of sex as a factor in adherence to standards and use of facilities, and departmental funding of medical procedures related to gender dysphoria. Going forward, the policy memorandum says, Defense Department funding will no longer be used to pay for medical procedures associated with facilitating sex reassignment surgery, genital reconstruction surgery as a treatment for gender dysphoria or newly initiated cross-sex hormone therapy. Within the department and military services, service members will use terms of address for one another that reflect their sex, including common customs and courtesies among service members. 'In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as 'Sir' or 'Ma'am') must also reflect an individual's sex,' the policy memorandum states. When it comes to fitness standards, grooming standards, or use of facilities, for instance, the new guidance also requires that sex will be the only determining factor. 'Where a standard, requirement, or policy depends on whether the individual is a male or female (e.g., medical fitness for duty, physical fitness and body fat standards; berthing, bathroom, and shower facilities; and uniform and grooming standards), all persons will be subject to the standard, requirement, or policy associated with their sex,' the policy memorandum reads. In addition to affecting existing service members, the policy memorandum also states applicants for military service and individuals in the delayed entry program who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are also disqualified for military service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TYXPHda3dwWx	2025-02-28T17:05:53-08:00	
Operation Warp Speed: The Good, The Bad, And The Deadly – OpEd	I have been a strong supporter of Donald Trump since the first Super Tuesday primary in February 2016, when he trounced the competition in races held in the heart of the ‘Bible Belt.’ Those results convinced me that if any Republican had a prayer (excuse the pun) of winning the White House, he was the only game in town. One of the key elements of the Trump administration’s response to the Covid pandemic was Operation Warp Speed (OWS). A unique feature of OWS was that it was used, respectively, by Trump’s supporters and detractors to laud or denigrate the initiative, depending almost solely on political party affiliation. This bifurcation even extended to the healthcare establishment, a clear indication that medical science had been eclipsed by political science. In so doing, the physician’s creed, 'First, do no harm' was shredded. The impact on patient outcomes, not surprisingly, was devastating. In an attempt to move the discussion away from political slogans and bumper stickers, and towards a more nuanced assessment, I will examine six major OWS initiatives: Ventilators Masks Disinfectants Hospital Beds for NYC and Los Angeles Repurposed Therapeutics: Hydroxychloroquine mRNA Vaccine Development, Production, and Distribution Ventilators In preparing for airborne pandemics, it had been the consensus for several years that the number of ventilators available would be woefully inadequate. To meet this challenge, Trump pulled every emergency lever at his disposal in order to direct the nation’s manufacturing capabilities towards producing the number of ventilators required. This effort succeeded to the degree that the metrics for ventilator production were quickly exceeded, and a more than sufficient number was produced and distributed. Clearly, this was a logistical triumph…but there’s the rub. It was determined early on that almost all patients with Covid-induced respiratory failure who were placed on a ventilator succumbed. You’d think that someone in authority would have made the observation that ventilators caused harm whenever used, and use of this modality would have ceased. Well, if you thought that, you’d be mistaken. Ventilators were used for months after it was clear that they caused harm. So where does responsibility for this debacle reside? Was it with OWS for supplying too many ventilators or with the healthcare providers who, under cover of perverse incentives, continued to use them? Masks As with ventilators, there was great concern that supplies of masks would be inadequate. Given the fact that more than 100 years of public health policy and practice had demonstrated that mask use outside of healthcare settings was a useless exercise, pulling the trigger on OWS should never have been done. However, when it came to Covid, deliberately fanning the flames of fear overcame sound public health policy, and the trigger was pulled. Sadly, all of the predicted collateral damage that universal masking could cause came to pass (as has been well-documented elsewhere), with none of the purported benefits. An additional adverse consequence that has not been mentioned is to the environment. Between the masks and the plastic straws, I’m surprised there are any sea turtles left! Once again, where does responsibility for this debacle reside? Is it with OWS for supplying a huge number of masks or with the public health agencies that continued to push, and, in many cases, mandated a useless modality that could and did cause harm? Disinfectants In contrast to masks, there was evidence that use of disinfectants in viral pandemics was of value. In the reasonable belief that this benefit would extend to SARS Covid-2, OWS went into action. However, it was very quickly determined that in the case of this particular virus, disinfectant use was of little to no value. So what’s the harm in overproduction and overuse of disinfectants? I can envision three potential harms: Toxicity from absorption of disinfectant chemicals through the skin (via direct contact) or into the lungs (via vapor), especially in children, is concerning. Reduction in the usual contact with environmental organisms that helps to maintain a healthy immune system could cause severe illness from normally non-virulent pathogens. Resources could have been diverted to modalities of proven benefit. For almost 5 years, I have touted the addition of UV lighting to HVAC systems at indoor public venues as a means of mitigating this virus, other airborne organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment, and future airborne pandemics. What a lost opportunity! For a third time, where does responsibility for this potential debacle reside? Is it with OWS for oversupplying disinfectants or with the public health authorities for not calling a halt as soon as it was recognized that these products were not needed in the quantities ordered? Hospital Beds for NYC and Los Angeles Talk about a major missed opportunity for OWS to provide benefit! Soon after lockdowns were put in place, the governors of New York (Andrew Cuomo) and California (Gavin Newsom) were in a panic, believing that there would be critical shortages of hospital beds in NYC and Los Angeles. In response to this need, OWS was implemented. The number of beds delivered and the speed of delivery exceeded the seemingly impossible demands of both governors. Tragically, these beds were barely utilized. In the case of NYC, elderly patients were sent to nursing homes while still shedding virus, instead of to the hospital beds that OWS had made available. It has been estimated that 12-15,000 excess deaths ensued from this practice, although it could be more, given the roadblocks that were erected to hide the data. To think that this ghoul (Cuomo) will likely run for NYC Mayor, and could actually win, is beyond disturbing! Repurposed Therapeutics: Hydroxychloroquine In contrast to the missed opportunity for an OWS win for patients with hospital beds, there was a deliberate takedown of a likely effective therapeutic when it came to repurposing and mass distribution of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Where have we heard the expression ‘takedown’ used before? Through off-label prescribing, HCQ was empirically found to be effective in treating Covid, if used within 4 days of the onset of symptoms. Somehow, Trump became aware of this medication and was a driving force in getting it approved under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Once that happened, OWS kicked in to ramp up production and distribution. Tragically, this effort was short-lived. The attacks on the safety and effectiveness of HCQ came rapidly, driven by more sinister motives. Safety concerns revolved around the development of prolonged QT interval on EKG, which could potentially cause sudden death, and non-specific toxicity. The fact is, for approximately 50 years, HCQ was routinely used as prophylaxis in people traveling to countries where there was an increased risk of malaria. The drug would be started two weeks prior to travel, and it would be continued until two weeks after returning home. Despite the fact that billions of doses of the drug were prescribed over the decades and EKGs were never routinely done, even in people with known heart disease, cardiac problems were never reported. Further, in treating Covid, the HCQ dose was less than that prescribed for malaria prophylaxis, and for a much shorter duration (~5 days). However, studies were done using much higher HCQ doses, which, not unexpectedly, produced toxic side effects. The effectiveness of HCQ was challenged by doing studies in the wrong patient populations, most prominently in patients who were already sick enough to be hospitalized. In an act of statistical sleight-of-hand, a large study was done looking at patients treated between 1 and 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The pooled results showed no benefit. However, when the data were reexamined by an enterprising statistician, it was discovered that patients treated beginning on the 1stor 2nd day after symptom onset obtained considerable benefit, and patients treated beginning on the 3rd or 4th day after symptom onset had lesser, but definite benefit. It was only after treatment was started after the 4th day that HCQ was ineffective. Why would the public health establishment deliberately exaggerate the risks and ineffectiveness of HCQ? Here’s where the more sinister motives come into play. It was because the goal was to obtain EUA for the mRNA vaccine that was being developed. Since EUA can only be used if there is no other therapeutic, HCQ had to be discredited. The fact that Trump had touted it was used to good effect. Besides, the profits to be derived by the pharmaceutical companies from an mRNA vaccine were huge, while HCQ was a generic that would generate little revenue. In addition, liability for these companies, as with all vaccines, would be zero. Come to think of it, wasn’t the definition of a vaccine changed in order to label mRNA shots as a vaccine? Talk about a perfect storm of evil! mRNA Vaccine Development, Production, and Distribution Here, I take a somewhat contrarian view, in that I don’t believe that mRNA vaccine development can be credited to OWS, although I do believe that production and distribution were OWS initiatives. My contrarian view regarding mRNA development stems from the fact that clandestine gain-of-function research had been going on for years, where viruses were being manipulated for infectivity and virulence at the same time as counteracting vaccines were being developed. I’m not aware of any information regarding the timeline for these processes to unfold, and it occurred before OWS was conceived. On the other hand, mass production and distribution of the vaccine clearly fell under the OWS umbrella. Given the logistics of producing and worldwide distribution of billions of doses of a product with strict refrigeration requirements was heroic. I recall stating back in the fall of 2021 that this effort was comparable to D-Day preparations. I still believe that that is a valid comparison. However, in what will likely turn out to be the worst case of unintended consequences in history, this logistical miracle has succeeded in poisoning the planet at a rate that has never been seen before…and we won’t know the full impact for several more years! In this instance, some of the culpability can be placed on OWS, in that the evidence of extensive batch contamination that is now irrefutable can be attributed to the emphasis on speed over safety in the production process. However, even if the product had been 100% pure, it wouldn’t have mitigated the damage. The product itself was not safe! More definitive evidence of harm is already starting to emerge, as I predicted in my most recent Brownstone Journal post on February 18, 2025: 'Hope for the Healthcare System.' More evidence of harm will be forthcoming. Putting all of this together, OWS, as a logistical exercise, was a spectacular success and a shining example of how the administrative support infrastructure is capable of performing at a high level when properly led. Trump deserves credit for providing that leadership. Unfortunately, with the exception of the hospital beds, and distribution of HCQ, the projects for which OWS were tasked were fatally flawed. Responsibility for those failures rests solely with the public health establishment. While I’m well aware (largely through the excellent investigative reporting done by Brownstone Journal writers) that the Dept of Defense (DOD) took control of the Covid response within a couple of weeks of the lockdowns in March 2020, it does not get the public health establishment off the hook. When confronted with an agenda that was contrary to professional, ethical, and evidence-based standards, these public health officials had a duty to push back, and in the absence of DOD reversal, they should have resigned and gone public with their concerns. Watching Dr Robert Redfield, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention go on his ‘apology tour’ strikes me as being 1,500 days late, and $16 trillion short (the amount of wealth that was transferred to the top 1% as a result of these disastrous policies); not to mention the millions of people whose health was permanently damaged or whose lives were lost. Are there OWS actions that can reverse this disaster? The Trump agenda post-inauguration has certainly been moving at warp speed. Hopefully, it will extend to the healthcare establishment.

Rubio’s Rise: Can He Steer Trump’s Foreign Policy Vision? – OpEd	Marco Rubio first appeared on a prominent stage as a candidate for the presidency in 2016. During that election cycle, criticism of him unfolded actively on social media. The label 'Little Marco' was applied, echoing Trump’s taunt, alongside a comparison to a 'community organizer' for the Republican Party. Opinions held that Rubio’s career, built from youth much like Obama’s, lacked what many would deem a real job outside politics. Some viewed Rubio’s ascent as orchestrated by the Republican National Committee, filling a demand for Hispanic representation within the party. Perspectives dismissed him as a political lightweight, dubbed a 'Zero,' a creation of party engineering rather than merit. Over time, Rubio proved that early perception was overstated. As a senator, Rubio developed political experience and demonstrated that he was not just a figurehead or a convenient representative for the Hispanic community. He became an active and effective legislator, particularly focused on foreign policy. His record of co-sponsoring legislation aimed at condemning aggressor nations such as Russia, Iran, and China showcased his commitment to defending U.S. interests on the global stage. Rubio’s stance on China was notably assertive. He co-introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, S.3176, on January 9, 2020, which became law on December 23, 2021, as Public Law No: 117-78. This legislation aimed to block goods made with forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region from entering the U.S. His consistent warnings about China’s geopolitical threat, economic expansion, and Wall Street’s role in amplifying Chinese influence over U.S. markets clarified his view: China was not a benign partner but an adversary challenging American dominance. On Iran, Rubio maintained a firm line. He co-sponsored the bipartisan MAHSA Act, S.2626, introduced on August 1, 2023, named after Mahsa Amini, whose death in Iranian police custody sparked global outrage. The bill sought sanctions on Iranian officials for human rights abuses and passed the Senate in October 2023, though it awaits enactment. Rubio also pressed for stricter enforcement of existing sanctions, especially amid reports of Iran acquiring materials from China to boost its missile capabilities. Russia has been another key focus of Rubio’s work. He backed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, H.R.3364, signed into law on August 2, 2017, as Public Law No: 115-44, targeting Iran, North Korea, and Russia for actions undermining U.S. security. Rubio was outspoken in supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and opposing Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, recognizing the Kremlin’s expansionism as a direct challenge to Western security and U.S. leadership. His IMPAIR Russia Act, S.3733, introduced on March 2, 2022, aimed to impose sanctions after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Though it didn’t pass independently, its measures shaped broader sanctions efforts. Likewise, S.4937, introduced on September 22, 2022, barred U.S. recognition of Russian sovereignty over Ukrainian territory, reinforcing Kyiv’s integrity; it stayed in committee but influenced Senate views. Rubio co-sponsored the Ukraine Security Partnership Act, S.3522, introduced by Senator Jim Risch on February 3, 2022, offering military and economic aid to Ukraine before Russia’s full-scale invasion. It fed into larger aid packages, signed into law on April 21, 2022, as part of Public Law No: 117-128. Trump’s decision to appoint Rubio as Secretary of State came as a surprise to many. Yet, his nomination received overwhelming bipartisan support—unlike many of Trump’s other appointments. Rubio’s record and experience made him a reassuring figure for both allies and those concerned about the direction of U.S. foreign policy. His confirmation reflected recognition of his competence and knowledge in foreign affairs, even by those who had once dismissed him as inexperienced. Despite his strong credentials, Rubio now faces the complex reality of serving in the Trump administration. The 'America First' approach often clashes with Rubio’s established foreign policy views. The administration’s leniency toward authoritarian regimes like Russia and its disregard for traditional alliances places Rubio in difficult positions, where his personal convictions frequently conflict with the directives coming from the Oval Office. The Russia-Ukraine war is a prime example of this tension. Despite Rubio’s consistent support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, as Secretary of State, he has been forced to echo the administration’s calls for both Russia and Ukraine to make concessions. This stance, aligned with Trump’s preference for ending the war quickly, risks legitimizing Russia’s territorial ambitions. Observers noted Rubio’s visible discomfort during meetings with Russian officials, signaling his internal struggle with policies that contradict his core principles. Also, Rubio appeared visibly distressed during an unusual and intensely heated exchange between Zelenskyy, Trump, and JD Vance at the press conference. The strain became even more evident when the administration instructed the U.S. representative at the United Nations to align with nations like North Korea and Belarus in opposing a resolution supporting Ukraine. Rubio, who had spent years condemning Russia’s aggression, now finds himself standing by policies that undermine his previous positions. Rubio also faces challenges from the administration’s combative approach toward America’s allies. Trump’s trade wars and punitive tariffs on traditional partners like Canada likely appear counterproductive from Rubio’s perspective. As someone who understands the strategic importance of alliances, he likely views alienating Canada as a strategic error that weakens U.S. influence and undermines collective efforts to confront global threats. Regarding European nations, there is no doubt that they must contribute more to common defense. However, the U.S. should demand this without humiliating its partners. We are all representatives of Western civilization, and no treaty with Russia or China can replace these alliances in the foreseeable future. Rubio’s legislative work has consistently reflected this understanding. Rubio co-sponsored S.J.Res.4 on January 17, 2019, requiring Senate approval for NATO withdrawal, enacted on December 19, 2023, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, Public Law No: 118-31, affirming his NATO stance amid Trump-era doubts. Rubio’s journey from a young senator to Secretary of State reflects his personal growth and political evolution. However, surviving within the Trump administration will require balancing political loyalty with personal integrity. Rubio’s future depends on how he navigates these challenges. Will he adapt to Trump’s policies, setting aside his previous beliefs to remain in line with the administration? Or will he choose to voice his concerns, risking political consequences—even resignation—if the conflict between his convictions and Trump’s agenda becomes irreconcilable? It will be interesting to see whether he quietly conforms, prioritizing political survival, or takes a stand, demonstrating that some principles outweigh career ambitions. The hope is that Rubio’s core principles will fuse with Trump’s bold style to form a 'good cop-bad cop' partnership that restores America’s greatness on the global stage and reinforces Western civilization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TUlIQVIBAOiw	2025-02-28T16:57:46-08:00	
Four Takeaways From The Disaster In The Oval Office – Analysis	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- It could hardly have gone worse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s White House visit had a lot of potential. It could have produced a mineral-resources deal that would have roped Ukraine and the United States together, at least on paper, and given U.S. President Donald Trump more incentive to support Kyiv in its defense against the Russian onslaught. It could have brought some clarity on what kind of security guarantees, if any, Washington is prepared to offer Kyiv in the event of a cease-fire or peace deal with Russia. And if nothing else, Zelenskyy and Trump could have buried the hatchet after a remarkable exchange of criticism last week. Instead, the hatchet came out again, sharper than ever. Zelenskyy departed the White House early – the minerals deal left without signature and a joint press conference canceled -- after being berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance in what was by many accounts an unprecedentedly acrimonious meeting before journalists in the Oval Office. The remarkable exchange did not just raise doubts about the fate of the natural-resources pact. It added to already towering uncertainty over the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine and over the prospects for any kind of a deal that would halt or end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Here are four takeaways from the disastrous meeting. The Damage Could Be Severe The minerals deal that Trump and Zelenskyy were due to sign was only a framework agreement, and analysts said that at this point, its value would be mainly symbolic: A chance for both presidents to claim diplomatic victories and a way for the Trump administration to justify past and possibly future aid to Ukraine after raising questions about whether it should continue. Trump had hailed the draft deal as an important step on what remains a faint path toward peace in Ukraine. So, whether it eventually gets signed, and when, will say a lot about the chances that Kyiv and Washington can work together on a potential cease-fire or peace deal with Russia. Beyond the agreement on minerals, though, the bigger question is whether the United States will turn sharply away from Ukraine – cutting off or curtailing the military aid that is still ongoing, for example, or moving further ahead with efforts to agree with Russia on a cease-fire or peace plan for Ukraine while abandoning Kyiv. The Split Could Last Long -- Or Possibly Not The contentious meeting in the Oval Office marked a stomach-churning descent on a rollercoaster of relations between Trump and Zelenskyy, which have been fraught since shortly after the latter’s election in 2019. But it may not be the end of the ride. It occurred just when it seemed like the damage done by their earlier exchange of criticism, in which Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and Zelenskyy suggested Trump has succumbed to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s propaganda, had been repaired. Asked on the eve of Zelenskyy’s visit about his 'dictator' accusation, Trump replied: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.' And for Zelenskyy, the desire to secure further U.S. aid and the hope for security arrangements underpinned by U.S. power are unlikely to go away regardless of the bad blood generated by the acrimonious White House visit. So, despite the way the jaw-dropping spectacle played out, there’s a chance -- however small -- that the wounds could be patched up. The U.S.-Europe Rift Could Widen Ties between the United States and most of the European Union have been tense since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20, with stark differences over policies toward Ukraine and Russia as well as over an array of other matters, from trade to liberal values. The unease was underscored when Vance lit into Europe in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, saying its own internal processes posed a greater threat to its welfare than Russia, China, or any other outside actor did. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer preceded Zelenskyy with visits to the White House this week, seeking to narrow the gulf –- particularly on the issue of what to do about Russian aggression and the war in Ukraine. Had Zelenskyy’s meeting gone well, it could have brought greater U.S.-European unity as well. But the opposite may occur following the Oval Office dispute, which brought transatlantic tension rushing back as many European leaders voiced solidarity with Ukraine. In a post on X in Ukrainian, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen urged Zelenskyy, 'Be strong, be brave, be fearless,' and assured him he 'will never be alone,' adding: 'We will continue to work with You for a just and lasting peace.' A Blow To The Chances For A 'Just Peace' When Zelenskyy and European leaders speak of a 'just and lasting peace,' they mean a peace that does not favor Russia and weaken Ukraine, leaving it under Moscow’s thumb or vulnerable to future Russian attacks. When he phoned Putin on February 12 and sent top officials to meet with their Russian counterparts in Riyadh six days later, upending the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Moscow over its invasion, Trump ignited fears in Kyiv and Brussels that a lopsided peace deal might be forced on Ukraine. Had it gone well, Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump could have helped dispel those concerns -- the Ukrainian president said it was important that Trump was meeting with him before meeting with Putin. But it didn’t go well at all, and now those concerns are likely to grow stronger again.

The Result Of Inaction: Ignoring The People Led To This – OpEd	Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President, far-right groups are rising around the world. These voices present a major threat, not just to the democracy they claim to revere, but also to social cohesion, minority groups, and the natural world. Intolerance and tribalism are their common currency—social poisons that foster division, fuel hate, and ignite violence. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany was reunified, and the Soviet Union began to unravel. It was a moment of jubilation in Germany and throughout the West. Democratic governments, which had been rapidly growing after World War II, seemed to have reached their final triumph with German unification. In the following years, democracy was embraced by much of Eastern Europe, Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and apartheid was dismantled in South Africa after more than 40 years. It was a remarkable time—one filled with tremendous optimism, a belief that the world had finally turned its back on repressive methods and that real change was possible; that a new era was beginning. Thirty-five years on, that feeling of hope has been well and truly extinguished; the ideal of democracy is in peril, and a suffocating shadow is spreading across the world. The global rules-based order is under attack, extremism and authoritarianism seem to be on the rise, and societies in many Western countries are perhaps more divided and polarized than ever before. Extremism and inequality The appeal of the far right is the result of a number of interconnected factors. Inequality is a major ingredient—wealth and income inequality, but also unequal access to good-quality housing, education, healthcare, and opportunities, as well as cultural activities like concerts, exhibitions, theatre, etc. Up until the late 1980s and early 1990s, levels of wealth and income inequality were comparatively low, but by the mid-2000s, disparities had grown substantially. In 2016, Oxfam reported that 'runaway inequality has created a world where 62 people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world’s population—a figure that has fallen from 388 just five years ago.' But instead of working-class groups uniting in calls for social justice, the primary consequence, as French economist Thomas Piketty observed, was (and continues to be) ‘the rise of various forms of xenophobic ‘populism’ and identity-based politics.’ Inevitably, inequality has moved in only one direction: it is now even more extreme. Poverty is growing in many countries, while the number of billionaires increases year on year. According to Oxfam, ‘Global billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion in 2024, three times faster than the year before, equivalent to roughly $5.7 billion a day. Meanwhile, according to the World Bank, the number of people still living in poverty—around 3.5 billion—has barely changed since 1990.’ In fact, the number is increasing.' For the 99.9%, inequality is part of the economic instability under which they live, and economic uncertainty is another major factor in the appeal of far-right groups. After the 2008 financial crash (the impact of which is still being felt), support for far-right groups grew. This is consistent with the fallout from previous financial crises. Research examining around 100 such events since 1870 found that 'far-right parties are the biggest beneficiaries of financial crashes… after a crisis, the share of the vote going to right-wing parties increases by more than 30 percent.' Now we come to immigration—more accurately, the politicization of immigration. This is perhaps the single biggest factor driving people into the arms of far-right political parties and figures. It stems from a narrow sense of individual and national identity, fueling negative attitudes toward multiculturalism—particularly, but not exclusively, in relation to people from Muslim countries. These fearful attitudes are eagerly exploited and inflamed by ambitious right-wing politicians, with the aid of conservative mainstream media and propaganda spread via social media. Immigrants, asylum seekers, refugees, and economic migrants have become scapegoats for economic hardship, unemployment, stagnant wages, and the breakdown of public services. Far-right parties amplify these substantial social issues and, instead of highlighting the systemic failures (Neo-liberal policies) and political mismanagement, including the mishandled impact of globalization, they point the finger at foreigners. Blame and distrust of ‘the other’ for a nation’s ills is not only unjustified and perverse, but it also allows far-right protectionism and flag-waving tribalism to flourish. Migrants are condemned and accused of failing to integrate, of importing foreign ways of life, and of weakening—rather than enriching—the adopted country’s culture. Social division and hate are the intertwined aims of the far right, and increasingly, of panicked centre-right political parties desperate for voters. In addition to attacking foreigners, LGBTQ+ people are increasingly scapegoated by far-right politicians pushing a conservative agenda. The result is a rise in hate speech and an ‘unprecedented surge in violence against LGBTQ+ people in 2024 across Europe.’ A recent report shows that this victimization is a growing issue in Europe and Central Asia, where ‘governments are using anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric to justify restrictions on free speech, civil society, and fair elections.’ This is how widespread suppression begins and fascism takes hold—first, silence so-called ‘minority groups’; then, expand control based on spurious security and social concerns to include everyone It’s not too late These are unquestionably transitional times as we move from a crumbling way of life into ‘the new.’ While they are undeniably dangerous and filled with uncertainty, they also present tremendous opportunities. The choice of how we move forward is ours: unite and prosper, or remain divided and endure increasing adversity. Humanity is confronted with a series of extremely challenging, interconnected crises, with the environmental catastrophe being by far the most severe. If the global trend toward extremism continues, the bold actions needed to tackle the pressing issues of our time—particularly climate change and ecological collapse—will not be taken, allowing these crises to worsen. In large part, it is the failure of progressive forces worldwide to address systemic failings over decades that has allowed the far right to gain traction and spread its poison. The economic crash of 2008/09 played a role in the rise of the far right and the narrowing of perspectives within the center-right. However, like all such events, the crash presented an opportunity to reimagine the socio-economic system along more just and sustainable lines. Instead, the corrupt greed of bankers was rewarded with bailouts, while the people were punished through austerity and wage cuts. For fifty years or more, the division between those advocating for evolutionary change (think of the Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, or the global environmental movement) and those determined to maintain the unjust status quo has been clear. Demands for peace, economic justice, climate action, and more have been consistently ignored. As a result, year after year, the chasm between these two groups has widened; attitudes have darkened, and as governments have become more extreme, suppression has been legitimized. Had there been a more open, creative response to the energies of the time, the march toward the far right—currently taking place in opposition to the natural order of things—would not have happened, and we would be living in a completely different world. Even now, at the eleventh hour, that opportunity still exists; resistance is entrenched, making the task harder and the need for men and women of goodwill to unite more urgent than ever: the future of our societies and the planet depend on it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TdEgazzIRWOq	2025-02-28T16:46:00-08:00	
What Does German Election Mean For Ukraine?	By Ekaterina Venkina (Eurasianet) -- The incoming conservative-led government in Germany will face daunting challenges as it confronts a rapidly changing security environment in Europe while trying to protect Ukrainian sovereignty. On the one hand, there is 'an autocratic, perhaps even totalitarian aggressor' in the Kremlin, and on the other, 'an unpredictable actor within the system of checks and balances' in the White House, Timm Beichelt, a professor at the European University Viadrina, told Eurasianet. The 'aggressor versus friend' dichotomy has disappeared, and an unprecedented shift in Germany’s trans-Atlantic relations is occurring, Beichelt added. This is the situation now facing Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting. After winning the federal election February 23, his center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) now must engage in difficult talks on forming a government with the likely coalition partner being the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Only after a government is in place will Merz be able to address the security conundrum. Merz has made it clear that his immediate foreign policy priority is strengthening European defense capabilities as quickly as possible 'so that we can really achieve independence from the US step by step.' He has previously toyed with the idea of a new European defense alliance, hinting at the possibility of persuading France to extend its nuclear umbrella over Germany. On February 23, he went so far as to ask whether, at a NATO summit in June, 'we will still be talking about NATO in its current form' or whether 'we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.' 'It is a completely different constellation now,' Beichelt said. 'So, it might be time for the German government to look at [the Treaty on European Union] and somehow spell out to what extent this could actually be an operational mechanism' to bolster European defense capabilities. According to Zsuzsanna Végh, a program officer at the German Marshall Fund, Merz’s government will strive to act as 'a driving force behind strengthening the defense agenda within the EU.' This transformation, she added, will take time. In the meantime, what to do about Ukraine? As Merz tries to form a stable German government, the Trump administration is trying to cut a Ukraine deal with Russia that could place Europe in a precarious security position. By all appearances, the White House is willing to agree to a ceasefire agreement that is highly beneficial to Russia. After talks with Trump in Washington, French President Emmanuel Macron said a truce could come within weeks. 'The United States is moving forward without Europe right now because it sees the EU as a minor player on the field,' Végh said. There is not much Merz can do presently to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities. In December 2024, he promised to supply long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine if he became chancellor. The question is whether he will now go ahead with these deliveries, in a symbolic gesture to demonstrate Berlin’s leadership on the Ukrainian agenda as Kyiv has entered the fourth year of war. Végh believed that circumstances have become much more complex and that 'the context itself is changing rapidly.' Members of the Free Democrats (FDP), a centrist party that did not make it into parliament, have called on Merz to act immediately. But as early as December, he indicated that Berlin would not act 'unilaterally' on the missile-supply issue, but only in close consultation with Washington and European allies. 'The move would also have to be approved and decided by the new coalition government between the CDU, its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD,' Végh added. The negotiations to form a government promise to be complicated, but a grand coalition will likely not mean a significant shift on Germany’s Ukraine stance. Leading Social Democratic Party politicians, including Lars Klingbeil and Boris Pistorius, have been stoutly pro-Ukraine. Pistorius, the outgoing defense minister, has been an outspoken critic of Russia, and earlier in February said it was 'regrettable' that the Trump administration 'has made public concessions to [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin before [ceasefire] negotiations have even begun.' One of the key issues on the table is the reform of Germany’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake. Defense spending is becoming increasingly important given the security gap Germany and Europe face as the Trump administration’s rapprochement with Russia grows. 'The goal is not to remove the debt brake altogether, but to create room for fiscal maneuver,' said Nils Diederich, a German Social Democratic Party politician and political scientist. The conservative bloc, the Social Democrats, and the Greens will not have the two-thirds majority in the new parliament to push through the reform. And the Left Party would only support an increase in defense spending if it were linked to social improvements. These potential difficulties in getting the changes through, whether in this or the next parliament, make the question of Germany’s ability to fund its growing defense ambitions while balancing this with support for Ukraine all the more challenging. Meanwhile, amid mounting financial strains, a growing rift with the US, and difficulties on the Ukrainian front, experts believe Berlin’s Central Asia policy under Merz’s leadership will remain on the back burner. Beichelt does not expect a drastic departure from the regional course set by the outgoing government. 'I don’t see any reason why Germany should withdraw from the Z5+1 format it has established with all five Central Asian states. It is a useful framework,' he said. Beichelt believes the format contributes to the German government’s view that multilateralism is the way forward. 'The fact that Trump is now turning to bilateralism is an encouragement for Berlin to invest even more in multilateral formats,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TfNkVyX-PEsM	2025-02-28T16:41:45-08:00	
With US Support In Question, Ukraine Leans On Europe	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Donald Trump's reluctance to grant any security commitments to Ukraine as a part of a deal to gain access to its mineral wealth has prompted Kyiv to contemplate pushing European countries to provide a ‘net of guarantees’, several Ukrainian officials told Euractiv. Kyiv’s main goal would be a European presence in Ukraine – a peacekeeping force backed by the US - to provide deterrence against Russia. Though Washington has said it would not commit to specific security guarantees, Ukrainian officials expect the US to support Kyiv’s efforts to seek support elsewhere, including from Europe. On the side of so-called ‘soft guarantees’, Kyiv hopes that foreign companies wanting to invest in the country – especially Americans and those from heavyweight European countries – would lobby their governments to protect them from Russian attacks. With much of the country’s mineral wealth located in areas under Russian occupation, they could also serve as a bargaining chip with Western countries interested in mining those resources. EU fast track A roadmap with an accelerated timeline for Ukraine's EU accession could serve as another soft assurance for Kyiv. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this week said Ukraine could become a member even earlier than a previously floated target date of 2030 if the country continues speedy reforms. 'A change of procedure could open the way for a change to reduce the vetoes in the accession process and allow proceeding faster on merit, rather than waiting for vetoing countries like Hungary,' an EU official told Euractiv. Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, who has repeatedly spoken out in favour of bringing Ukraine in as soon as possible, has previously floated the idea of moving towards qualified majority voting for a large part of the accession process. 'Hard guarantees' As part of so-called ‘hard guarantees’, Kyiv wants to focus on ramping up its own armed forces, future NATO membership and European peacekeepers. Ukraine repeatedly said it would not accept limits or a 'significant reduction in Ukraine’s army' in the future, restrictions on the acquisition and development of weapons, or abstaining from defence industry cooperation with Western countries. Ukraine’s request for a European peacekeeping force will be the hardest to negotiate as most questions about size and rules of engagement remain unanswered. Ukrainian officials say European peacekeepers could, instead of directly monitoring the frontline, be stationed in key parts of the country protecting sea ports or critical infrastructure. A Ukrainian DMZ? While the discussion centres mostly on 'boots on the ground,' Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stressed that 'securing Ukraine's sky and sea is equally, if not more, important.' 'Land, sky, and sea must all be in focus,' he added. The idea resembles the calls for a ‘no fly’-zone from the early stages of Russia’s war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv earlier this week he hoped a UK-organised defence summit on Sunday and an extraordinary EU summit next week in Brussels could clarify what Europe could practically provide. A comparison cited by Ukrainian military officials is the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that demarcates North Korea from South Korea. Whether European countries are prepared to commit the necessary resources to such an engagement – the US has had troops stationed in South Korea for more than 70 years – is another question.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TbJZ3tATHmkc	2025-02-28T16:37:30-08:00	
North Korean Hackers Behind Largest Ever Financial Theft	By Jamin Anderson The largest known financial heist in history has been perpetrated by a North Korean state-backed hacker group, according to experts. The heist against Dubai-based Bybit – which claims to be the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume – took place on Feb. 21, during which $1.5 billion was stolen. Several crypto security research firms have now attributed the attack to Lazarus Group, a well-known hacking group that has been involved in other high profile attacks dating back over a decade, including thefts from banks across the world and a hack of Sony Entertainment in 2014. Lazarus, which works under North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, now primarily targets virtual asset exchanges and financial institutions, using the stolen funds to develop missiles and as a means of raising foreign currency for the North Korean regime. The cyber attacks have prompted a series of indictments, sanctions and warnings from the United States, South Korea and other countries. North Korea has never acknowledged a connection to Lazarus. Various factors, including an analysis of how the stolen assets were being laundered, points to North Korea, according to Elliptic, a U.K.-based cryptocurrency security research firm. That assessment was backed by the FBI, which referred to the hack as 'TraderTraitor' in a public service announcement on Wednesday. The stolen $1.5 billion is approximately $160 million more than the total amount stolen by North Korea in cryptocurrency hacks last year, according to research firm TRM Labs. Laundering efforts The FBI asked that exchanges and other entities block transactions from a list of blockchain addresses that TraderTraitor actors have been using to launder the stolen cryptocurrency. A blockchain is an online public ledger where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded. ByBit has offered a financial reward to anyone who reports an attempt to launder the assets. 'We are taking a stand to ensure that every transaction is visible and every hacker is held accountable,' he said. 'Our multi-pronged offensive is a clear message: if you steal, you will be found, and justice will be swift.' Investigators can now quickly track crypto transactions, according to Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at cryptocurrency analysis and security company Chainalysis. Chainalysis has so far helped freeze over $40 million of the stolen funds, while Elliptic has assisted in freezing $243,000, both firms said. 'Industry-wide improvements in compliance make it harder for bad actors to cash out,' Fierman told Radio Free Asia. 'What’s remarkable about crypto is that the eyes of the ecosystem are on the funds as they move through the blockchain,' he said. 'This level of visibility wouldn’t be possible in traditional financial markets.' Even so, the hackers have been able to launder more than $400 million through various digital assets, according to Ari Redbord of TRM Labs. The laundering process includes transfers through intermediary wallets, conversion into different cryptocurrencies and the use of decentralized exchanges, he told RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TTQiPXg-0Q6P	2025-02-28T16:32:13-08:00	
Commemorating USAID – OpEd	On February 5, the story of the most successful U.S. foreign policy project of all time officially ended with a terse message on the USAID website. The United States Agency for International Development was established in November 1961 by John F. Kennedy as part of restructuring U.S. foreign aid programs in the context of the confrontation with the Soviet Union. Remarkably, USAID was the first U.S. organization provided long-term social and economic support to other countries, and some programs have been in operation for decades. The agency's average annual budget - more than $50 billion - was larger than the GDP of 90 countries around the world. This made USAID the world's leading official aid agency, both in relative and absolute monetary terms. Approximately 1% of the U.S. federal budget was allocated to fund the programs of this organization. To date, more than 100 countries around the world received humanitarian aid from USAID. In 2023 alone, the agency disbursed more than $72 billion, more than 16 of which were sent to Ukraine. Jordan, Afghanistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Jordan, Ethiopia, and Somalia have also received significant payments. USAID provided considerable development assistance to Ukraine, where, according to various sources, there were between 40 and 115 programs with about 11,000 employees and a total budget of about 2.5 percent of the country's GDP. The agency's activities were varied: USAID ensured much of the country's energy and food security, supported democracy, human rights, legal, anti-corruption, social, medical, and educational projects, and promoted media development in Ukraine. Despite all its social and public importance around the world, the agency has been heavily criticized. In fact, the biggest and most vicious blow to the organization was delivered by Elon Musk as part of Donald Trump's fight against Democratic influence. Musk, who was appointed to head the Office of Government Efficiency, made USAID one of his main targets, accusing the agency of inefficient spending and working in close collaboration with the CIA. Both allegations are difficult to prove or deny without evidence. However, misuse of funds in such a large organization with a serious budget is unfortunately not surprising and certainly has its place. But in light of the overall performance of the agency, it would make more sense to conduct a serious audit of the company's operations and identify mismanaged spending than to shut down the organization entirely. Washington also promotes its own agenda with humanitarian aid. Some would call this a conspiracy theory, but it's naive to believe that foreign policy is not controlled by intelligence agencies. By suspending the agency, Trump is not only depriving Ukraine of aid, but also the most vulnerable poorest countries in Africa and the Middle East. Trump isn't the first to try to rationalize government spending. In 1982, the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, initiated the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, better known as the Grace Commission. The goal of the commission was to analyze the efficiency of government spending and find ways to reduce the budget deficit. More than 2,000 volunteers from the private sector, including top executives from major U.S. corporations, were part of the commission. They examined 2,000 federal programs and focused on eliminating inefficiencies and duplication, adopting private sector management techniques, reducing bureaucracy and simplifying processes, and increasing transparency and accountability. However, the results of the Commission's work were disappointing: out of 2,478 recommendations, the vast majority were not implemented. In particular, the state was not ready for such large-scale reforms. Officials were concerned about the excessive focus on privatization of state functions. As a consequence, current efforts to reduce government spending, which has been on the rise around the world, could have an impact on key aspects of U.S. domestic and foreign policy According to the commissioners' plan, if all the recommendations were implemented (which, according to some economists and officials, seemed unrealistic), it was planned to save 1.9 trillion dollars by the year 2000, while Musk, without much thought, declared his ability to reduce budget expenditures by 2 trillion dollars. In addition to blatant populism, Musk's statements reveal overt lobbying for big business. Unfortunately, the political challenges of 2025 did not allow USAID to operate in the same way. Undoubtedly, the United States will not abandon such a large and effective soft power tool. However, the concept and principles of its work, as well as the scale of its assistance, will certainly be reviewed. It has already been announced that the agency's activities will be taken over by the US Department of State. Due to Trump's desire for isolationism, and in an effort to increse his own power, hundreds of millions of people around the world are at risk of being deprived of support, which will affect the state of their civil rights and freedoms, the volume and quality of consumer baskets, as well as access to information. Born out of the reforms of the 1960s, USAID fell victim to similar reforms in 2025. Unable to withstand the pressures of the political environment, the agency faded into oblivion, ending an era of foreign policy prosperity that lasted more than 60 years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TdybhY9v9IG4	2025-02-28T16:26:59-08:00	
Lebanon PM Demands ‘Full Israeli Withdrawal’	By Najia Houssari Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam on Friday called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the country, and promised residents of border villages a safe return home and reconstruction of their properties. Salam was speaking during a visit to the border area amid a partial Israel withdrawal. However, Israeli troops continue to occupy five strategic hills in the region, blocking the road connecting the border areas. Salam said on Friday that the Lebanese army 'is carrying out its responsibilities to the fullest, reinforcing its deployment with determination and resolve to uphold stability in the south and ensure the safe return of our people to their villages and homes.' He said that 'the army is the entity in charge of defending Lebanon and accordingly, it should preserve the country’s security, protect its people, and safeguard its sovereignty and the unity and security of its territory.' After his government won a confidence vote in parliament this week, Salam visited the army’s barracks in Tyre and Marjayoun, as well as Khiam and Nabatieh. Ministers and Maj. Gen. Hassan Aoude, the acting army commander, accompanied the prime minister. The visit came hours after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz claimed in a statement that 'Israel has received a green light from the US to stay in the buffer zone in southern Lebanon.' He said that 'our forces will stay indefinitely in the buffer zone, south of Lebanon.' The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the Israeli defense minister’s claims, saying that 'the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon clearly stipulates that Israel must withdraw from the south, including the five strategic points.' Salam was taken to the Benoit Barakat Barracks in Tyre by military helicopter. The Lebanese PM and his delegation held a meeting at the sector’s headquarters with Brig. Gen. Edgar Lawandos, commander of the southern Litani sector in the Lebanese army. Salam said that the government 'is committed to supporting the Lebanese army, by expanding its manpower, upgrading its equipment and training, and improving service conditions, to enhance its defensive capabilities.' He also condemned 'any attack on UNIFIL,' in light of the Feb. 15 violence on the Beirut Airport road. Protesters — angered by the denial of landing clearance for an Iranian plane — attacked a UNIFIL convoy heading to the airport, injuring the deputy commander and his escort, who were both taken to the hospital. Salam said that 'firm action' will be taken to arrest and hold those responsible to account. 'We are taking all necessary measures to ensure it does not recur,' he said. Salam commended UNIFIL’s role as a peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the south since 1978, with 'many of its members sacrificing their lives to fulfill its mission.' He praised UNIFIL’s 'close cooperation with the army and Lebanese authorities to implement UN Resolution 1701, to enhance the security and stability of Lebanon and the south.' On Thursday, the Government Commissioner at the Military Court, Judge Fadi Akiki, charged 20 people, including four detainees and two minors, with involvement in the attack on the UNIFIL convoy. The charges included 'attempted murder of the convoy’s members by burning the vehicle, assaulting the security forces and forming a group to undermine the authority and steal money worth $29,000 that was in the wallet of the UNIFIL deputy commander who was leaving Lebanon and returning to his country at the end of his mission.' Following his visit to the military barracks, Salam met with a delegation from the border town of Dhayra. Residents staged a protest outside the barracks to voice their suffering to the prime minister over the Israeli forces’ incursions into their lands, especially the destroyed southern neighborhood. Salam promised the delegation that ministers will work to ensure 'a safe return to your homes as soon as possible, and a commitment to the reconstruction process for the residents to return with dignity.' He said: 'Before receiving the confidence vote, the government started to mobilize all Arab and international support to force the enemy to withdraw from our lands and the so-called five points; There is no real and sustainable stability without Israel’s complete withdrawal.' From Khiam, where he surveyed the Israeli destruction, Salam said: 'We will only accept the complete withdrawal of the enemy from Lebanon, as Israel has repeatedly violated our sovereignty and land.' In Nabatieh, several protesters criticized the prime minister for failing to thank 'the resistance and only expressing gratitude to the army in the south.' Another protester questioned 'the possibility of reclaiming the occupied hills through dialogue.' Salam’s visit to the south coincided with further Israeli airspace violations over Lebanon, as Hezbollah held funerals for 130 people, including party fighters and civilians killed in Israeli airstrikes during the recent war. Trucks carried dozens of coffins along the road to the towns of Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab on Friday. Israeli forces stationed at border positions, meanwhile, carried out intensive patrol operations toward the outskirts of Aitaroun ahead of the funerals. Israeli violations also extended to the Bekaa, with aircraft flying at low altitude over Baalbek and northern Bekaa. On Thursday, airstrikes targeted a Hezbollah official and another person in a pickup truck in the city of Hermel, killing both. Later, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that one of the victims was 'Mohammed Mahdi Ali Shahin, a Hezbollah operative responsible for acquiring combat equipment along the Syrian-Lebanese border since the Israel-Lebanon agreements came into effect.'

By Hannah Brockhaus Pope Francis began noninvasive ventilation on Friday after experiencing a respiratory crisis that led to a 'sudden worsening' of his condition, the Vatican said. According to a Feb. 28 medical bulletin from the Holy See, after a morning spent in prayer, receiving the Eucharist, and doing respiratory physiotherapy, Pope Francis experienced in the early afternoon 'an isolated crisis of bronchospasm' — a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs, causing wheezing and coughing. The incident led to 'an episode of vomiting with inhalation' aggravating his breathing, the Holy See said. After his airways were suctioned, the pope was put on a noninvasive mechanical ventilator 'with a good response on gas exchange,' the communication said, adding that Pope Francis remained 'alert and oriented' and cooperative throughout the procedures. Friday marked two weeks in the hospital for the 88-year-old Pope Francis, who is suffering from double pneumonia, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory conditions. In the two weeks since Pope Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14, doctors have continuously refrained from giving a prognosis, emphasizing that the situation is 'complex.' The Holy See Press Office had said on Thursday that the pope’s health was 'improving' under oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy treatment. He continues to do work from the hospital.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TcaXxAyuUs_h	2025-02-28T16:15:09-08:00	
Iran Open To Talks But Won’t Bow To Pressure, Says Pezeshkian	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reaffirmed the country's willingness to engage in negotiations but stressed that Iran would not yield to pressure from global powers or enter talks under coercion. 'We should not be afraid of sanctions,' Pezeshkian said on Thursday, referring to US President Donald Trump's National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which aimed to cut Iran’s crude exports to zero. 'Some argue that there is no choice but to negotiate with them [the United States]. We have not refused negotiations, but we are not supposed to capitulate to bullies,' he added. Speaking at a meeting with directors of state bodies in southwestern Tehran Province, Pezeshkian criticized nations that claim to uphold human rights while carrying out military attacks that kill civilians. 'They tell us not to possess missiles and munitions so that they can bomb us whenever they want, leaving us unable to defend ourselves,' he said. The president reiterated that Iran does not seek conflict and aims to coexist peacefully with other Muslim nations in the region. 'Iran has not created tensions in the region. Israel is directly responsible. It is the Zionist regime that commits acts of aggression everywhere and fears no consequences due to US support,' Pezeshkian said. He also condemned the United States for imposing harsher sanctions while simultaneously calling for dialogue. 'They have tightened all sanctions and now claim they want talks. First, prove that you are genuine about dialogue, and then we can talk,' he said. Pezeshkian urged national unity to tackle economic challenges and work towards the goals outlined by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. He also emphasized boosting economic ties with neighboring countries to reduce reliance on sanction-evasion tactics. 'We do not need to circumvent sanctions, since we can strengthen our economy through cooperation with neighbors and expansion of regional trade,' he said. 'All we need is to simplify border trade regulations so that producers and economic players can easily export and import goods,' Pezeshkian added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TY-a1IJ0ETa2	2025-02-28T16:12:34-08:00	
Strengthening Pacific Security: US Shiprider Agreements – Analysi...	By Ray Joseph Shiprider Agreements and the US Coast Guard (FPRI) -- Early last year, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) cutter Harriet Lane, with Vanuatu maritime law enforcement officials on board, conducted an expeditionary patrol that moved through Vanuatu’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The United States and Vanuatu have a shiprider agreement. The USCG conducted a dozen joint vessel boardings with its Vanuatu law enforcement counterparts. During the vessel inspections, the Vanuatu officials found 'violations in half of the dozen foreign fishing vessels they boarded, including fish catches in their coolers that were not recorded in their logs, lack of proper records for crew transfers between ships and captains fishing under licenses not issued to them.' One Vanuatu official lauded the patrol as 'significant and beneficial.' This patrol is part of a US strategy that utilizes shiprider agreements to accomplish US and partner countries’ security objectives in the Pacific. Shiprider agreements allow larger maritime countries to partner with smaller countries to enforce maritime laws, combat IUU fishing, enhance security, and reinforce sovereignty. The United States currently has agreements with twelve Pacific Island countries, with the most recent deal signed in May 2023 between Papua New Guinea and the United States. The United States and several Pacific Island countries also expanded the range of pre-existing shiprider agreements, including Samoa, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The United States should continue to expand shiprider agreements in terms of breadth and frequency of use, ensuring it has access to the region, denying China access, and providing value to partner Pacific Island countries. Maritime Security and Tailored Shiprider Agreements Benefits Shiprider agreements bring value to Pacific Island nations by leveraging US capabilities that would otherwise be unavailable. Some of those capabilities include domain awareness, enforcing maritime laws in vast hard-to-reach EEZs, combating increasingly sophisticated IUU fishing operations, conducting humanitarian and disaster aid missions, and providing general security. IUU fishing significantly impacts regional economies, with losses ranging from $10 billion to $23.5 billionannually. A recent Congressional Research Service report states, 'Over half of the world’s tuna is harvested in the Pacific,' highlighting the region’s importance. It is difficult for smaller nations to combat IUU fishing without outside resources due to the vast swath of ocean territory. The United States and, specifically, the US Coast Guard have the tools necessary to ease some of that burden. The United States finds value in regularly enforcing maritime laws, promoting territorial sovereignty, and solidifying bilateral relationships by being a good Pacific neighbor and ensuring it has an increased presence in the region. The United States also demonstrates that it is capable and should be the partner of choice when countries weigh cooperating with either the United States or China. Each Pacific Island country has a diverse set of objectives and a different degree of tolerance for US involvement. The United States uses multiple variants of agreements to meet the needs of each country. Recent Variants The United States recently signed new and expanded pre-existing agreements that allow more flexibility. One example is the more flexible and expansive agreement between the United States and Samoa. The updated agreement allows the US Coast Guard to board and inspect vessels in Samoa’s EEZ at Samoa’s request. A recent addition to the US shiprider program is Papua New Guinea (PNG). In May 2023, Papua New Guinea and the United States signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), which included a shiprider provision. There have been at least three joint patrols since the signing of the 2023 DCA. The three patrols, conducted by three different USCG cutters, included two PNG law enforcement officials on each patrol. The focus of the patrols was countering illicit maritime activities. According to a US Embassy press release, the onboard PNG officials 'decided which vessels to board, and what action to take when violations were found.' This version of a shiprider agreement relies heavily on the partner nation and is a first step in cooperation. An example of a more advanced shiprider agreement is the one the United States now has with the Republic of Palau. The two countries signed an expanded bilateral agreement that allows the USCG to enforce maritime laws in Palau’s EEZ without a physically present shiprider. The new agreement does not replace a physically present shiprider but rather 'augments enforcement capabilities,' according to the US Coast Guard. Another version of the expanded shiprider agreement was signed with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The US Coast Guard’s capabilities are more valuable to the FSM because its EEZ is more than one million square miles, and the FSM does not have the capacity to enforce all its maritime laws fully. Similar to the agreement with Palau, boarding and law enforcement are allowed without the presence of officials from the Federated States of Micronesia. Going Forward In September, the United States held its fourth annual Shiprider Symposium in Honolulu. The symposium brought together Pacific Island shiprider partners along with relevant maritime agencies and organizations. The purpose of the week-long meeting was to 'gather and share best practices, exchange information among subject matter experts, and foster collaboration and understanding among participating nations,' according to a US Coast Guard press release. For a shiprider agreement to be effective, the United States must be responsive to partners’ needs. Holding annual events and symposiums is a good practice that institutionalizes interactions, ensures best practices are spread, and allows all partners to be responsive to challenges or opportunities. A less remarked upon motivation for the United States conducting joint patrols is denying China potential inroads into the security framework of many Pacific Island countries. It is easy to see why the United States looks to provide maritime security capabilities after the China–Solomon Islands security deal. China’s partnering with Pacific Island police forces is potentially a significant challenge for the US and Australian regional security framework. One way to combat China’s influence is to get there first and demonstrate the utility of US capabilities and the benefits of a strong relationship with the United States. One note of caution: the United States should be responsive to any sovereignty concerns, be careful not to overstep, and make sure the USCG has a collaborative relationship with the partner law enforcement agencies. To be an effective partner, the US Coast Guard must have the support it needs to carry out the mission. The United States has taken an important step by adding a medium endurance cutter, the Harriet Lane, to the Pacific area of operations to augment current USCG forces. The new cutter allows the United States more time on station where it can aid in maritime and fisheries law enforcement. To fully realize the benefits of engagement in the region, the United States should continue to expand the frequency of Coast Guard and Navy patrols through the EEZs of countries in the shiprider program. One patrol a year might be beneficial, but it risks being seen as a novelty or a photo op; a more regular and routinized presence will yield better results. Conclusion The United States uses shiprider agreements to grow and secure ties with Pacific Island countries. These agreements benefit both parties and make it more difficult for China to make inroads in the region. The United States should look to negotiate and sign agreements with regional countries interested in the program and seek to sign expanded agreements where the United States proved valuable to its partners. As the Pacific Partnership Strategy suggests, shiprider agreements are a valuable part of a broader framework that puts the United States in a more advantageous position in the Pacific and provides tangible benefits for local partners as the Indo-Pacific becomes a greater geopolitical focal point.

Myanmar: A Nation Drowning In Drugs Crisis – Analysis	By Windia Soe Myanmar, once known for its rich landscapes and cultural traditions, is now grappling with a relentless narcotics crisis. Key Takeaways: 1. Political instability, involvement of various armed groups like UWSA and AA in drug smuggling, and weak law enforcement have fueled mass drug production and human trafficking. 2. Youth and internally displaced populations suffer from soaring addiction rates, worsening health crises, and economic instability. 3. Harsh drug laws punish minor offenders while major traffickers operate freely, undermining harm reduction and rehabilitation efforts. The country has become a major hub for methamphetamine production, exacerbated by political instability and economic collapse. This crisis is destabilizing entire regions, with widespread drug addiction affecting families and overburdening fragile healthcare systems. This article explores the origins of Myanmar's drug scourge, reflects on past failed interventions, and considers potential pathways toward a more hopeful future. How did Myanmar go from opium fields to a heroin hub? The history of narcotics in Myanmar is tragically intertwined with the nation's past. Opium poppies were introduced to northeastern Myanmar by Chinese traders centuries ago, but it was during British colonial rule (1824-1948) that opium cultivation significantly expanded. Driven by Chinese demand, the British established a lucrative monopoly, making opium a key part of Myanmar’s economy. By the late 19th century, regions like Kokang and Wa became synonymous with opium production, solidifying Myanmar’s role in the global opium trade. Independence in 1948 brought little relief, as ethnic insurgencies erupted, with many rebel groups turning to opium cultivation for funding—creating a cycle where the drug trade fueled insurgency, which in turn protected and expanded the drug trade. By the 1970s, Myanmar had become a major heroin producer, with heroin refined in border areas—particularly under the control of Kuomintang-linked groups. Its legacy highlights the ongoing challenges Myanmar faces in combating narcotics today. The Rise of a New Scourge: The Methamphetamine Era While opium dominated the 20th century, the 21st century has seen Myanmar become a major methamphetamine producer. The scale of this production dwarfstraditional opium output and unleashes a flood of highly addictive synthetic drugs across Southeast Asia. Record-breaking seizures of 190 tonnes of methamphetamine in East and Southeast Asia in 2023 paint a clear picture of Myanmar's central role in this illicit trade, creating a massive headache for neighboring countries like Thailand and China. Already burdened by decades of conflict, Shan State has become the epicenter of this illicit industry in the Golden Triangle, transforming into a global hub for ice and Yaba production. By 2010, drug production in Shan State shifted from heroin to meth, driven by the UWSA militias and other ethnic armed groups. Before the 2021 coup, the Aung San Suu Kyi-led civilian government also highlighted the involvement of militia groups like the Arakan Army (AA) in drug smuggling as a key source of their funding. Infrastructure improvements, such as upgraded roads and expanded trade routes to neighboring countries, have also unintentionally facilitated the trafficking of precursor chemicals into Myanmar and drug exports to international markets. Recent reports indicate that Myanmar has now surpassed Afghanistan as the world's top opium producer, with estimated opium yield has risen to 22.9 kilograms per hectare, surpassing the previous record of 19.8 kilograms per hectare set in 2022, highlighting the adaptability and scale of Myanmar's drug production networks. How the 2021 Coup Fueled the Methamphetamine Crisis? Following the February 2021 coup, Myanmar plunged into widespread unrest, violent crackdowns, and economic collapse. As poverty and unemployment soared, many farmers in Shan and Kachin States turned to opium cultivation for survival because of the lack of alternatives. Meanwhile, lawlessness intensified in conflict-ridden areas like Shan State, where armed groups capitalized on the chaos by expanding drug production as a key source of financing. These groups seizedtrafficking routes, protected meth labs, and taxed the drug trade, using the profits to fund their military operations and political influence. The UNODC reported a surge in methamphetamine production, with traffickers exploiting weakened state authority. In 2023, authorities in Thailand seized 648.9 million Yaba tablets (a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine) and 26.4 tonnes of crystal methamphetamine, compared to 395 million Yaba tablets and 17.6 tonnes of crystal methamphetamine in 2019. Opium cultivation rose by 18% from 2022 to 2023, reaching a total area of 47,100 hectares. A Threat to a Generation Given the above complex interplay of historical, political, and social factors, Myanmar’s escalating narcotics crisis is harming youth and endangering future stability. Cheap and highly potent synthetic drugs like Yaba and 'ice' have infiltrated communities across the country, from urban centers to remote villages. Young people, particularly in Shan State, are especially vulnerable due to their proximity to significant drug production areas. Addiction rates are soaring, especially among youth and internally displaced persons, as a coping mechanism for trauma. A meta-analysis shows that 26.4% of displaced populations suffer from depression, linking forced displacement to substance abuse. In ethnic areas, addiction ranges from 40% to 85%, with a 40% prevalence among refugees. In Kachin, where mining is prevalent, 5% of men aged 15–49 inject drugs—far above the national 0.3% rate. Weak regulatory oversight in urban centers has also fueled rampant drug use. 'Happy Water' has surged in popularity among young people. Distributedthrough a supply chain originating in conflict zones near Myanmar’s borders, it is readily available in nightlife venues like bars, clubs, and KTVs, where private Hi Rooms serve as hubs for drug sales and consumption. Once a luxury, these drugs have become alarmingly affordable since the 2021 coup, making them more accessible than ever. The consequences are catastrophic. Addiction and imprisonment rob the futuresof youth, destabilizing families and weakening economic security. Methamphetamine use and injecting drug use are driving Myanmar’s worsening HIV epidemic, tuberculosis, overdose epidemics, and hepatitis C, especially in Kachin State, Northern Shan State, and Sagaing Region, with HIV prevalence among drug users exceeding 50% in some townships. In response, families are left to address youth drug use on their own with little central government support, sending children to ethnic armed group treatment centers or big cities to escape addiction—often exposing them to exploitation and trafficking, further worsening an already dire situation. Regional and Global Threat Myanmar's escalating drug crisis extends far beyond its borders. Myanmar's strategic location between China and India, along with its position within the East and Southeast Asian drug market, makes it highly vulnerable to the narcotics trade. Myanmar’s post-coup turmoil has turned it into a global methamphetamine hub, with armed groups and militias—often linked to military officials—profiting from the trade. A steady influx of precursor chemicals from China and India has fueled mass production, flooding neighboring countries with cheap, highly addictive drugs. Record meth seizures in Thailand and China highlight the crisis, straining law enforcement and healthcare systems. The drug trade funds armed conflict destabilizes governance, and fuels violence. Beyond Asia, Myanmar’s meth reaches as far as Australia, where 70% of crystal meth on the streets originates from the Golden Triangle. Poppy seed podsEfforts and Challenges to Combat Narcotics Myanmar has tried to combat narcotics through national policies and international collaboration by participating in regional initiatives like the Mekong MOU on Drug Control. The 1974 Narcotic Drugs Law aimed to curb drug production and trafficking through a ban on illicit crop cultivation, mandatory addict registration and treatment, and severe penalties. Despite amendments in 1983 and 1988, the law remained ineffective and was replaced by the 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law. In 2018, Myanmar introduced the National Drug Control Policy with UNODC support, emphasizing a balanced, evidence-based, and health-focused approach. This policy incorporates public health, harm reduction, alternative development, and human rights considerations. In Myanmar, harm reduction programs, such as needle exchange initiatives and opioid substitution therapy, have been instrumental in reducing HIV and hepatitis C transmission among PWID. Between 2003 and 2019, the distribution of sterile needles and syringes and the number of individuals on methadone maintenance therapy increased significantly. Moreover, community-driven harm reduction efforts in Kachin and Shan States, including education, clean syringes, and rehabilitation, have shown promise. However, Myanmar's efforts to combat narcotics are hampered by inconsistencies between its laws and policies. The outdated 1993 Narcotic Drugs Law primarily targets small-scale farmers and drug users while failing to dismantle major trafficking networks. This punitive approach contradicts the objectives of the 2018 National Drug Control Policy, which emphasizes harm reduction and rehabilitation. Effective reform requires updating drug laws to align with modern harm-reduction strategies and strengthening regional cooperation to combat trafficking. Conclusion Myanmar's drug crisis is deeply rooted in historical, political, and socio-economic factors. To address Myanmar's drug crisis, it is essential to dismantle trafficking networks, shift to rehabilitation for low-level offenders, and expand harm reduction programs. Enhancing regional cooperation, limiting precursor chemicals, and providing sustainable economic alternatives will reduce militias' reliance on drug profits. Only through a coordinated, multifaceted approach can Myanmar hope to break its dependence on the drug trade and foster a more stable, prosperous future.

Inside The Ukraine-US Minerals Deal (It’s Not What You Might Thin...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Think the deal announced between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine’s valuable rare minerals is a big deal? Read between the lines. Or the fine print. Or both. The agreement -- technically a framework for a deal, not an actual legally binding contract -- was hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a 'very big deal,' and he said it would 'recoup' some of the billions of dollars of weaponry and aid Washington has provided Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s all-out invasion. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was scheduled to be in Washington on February 28 to sign the papers, described it as 'framework agreement' and said it would help ensure U.S. support for Ukraine’s continued fight. 'This deal could be a great success, or it could pass quietly,' Zelenskyy told a news conference on February 26. 'And big success depends on our conversation with President Trump.' 'It is important for me and all of us in the world that America's assistance is not stopped,' he said. At the heart of the agreement – 17 clauses, four pages in English and Ukrainian, signatures of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko – is a proposed joint fund, that will be financed by future revenues from extraction of valuable minerals in Ukraine’s subsoils. But the agreement is just an intention to set up the fund, not its actual legal establishment, experts noted. It’s unclear when exactly that will happen. That also means there’s still plenty of wiggle room about how it will actually look. The framework also talks about future revenues, rather than current income streams, which appears to compartmentalize income from entities like Naftogaz. The state energy giant contributes as much as 15 percent of the government’s budget. It also stipulates that Kyiv is expected to contribute 50 percent of revenues from future state-run resource projects into the fund. Money from the fund will be targeted at projects inside Ukraine: 'to increase the development, processing and monetization of all public and private Ukrainian assets including, but not limited to, deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials, infrastructure, ports, and state-owned enterprise.' That’s a change from previous drafts, which had initially said the money would go toward paying for U.S. weapons and aid, something Zelenskyy had objected to. Moreover, it will take years before those sorts of infrastructure projects can be realized – possibly long after Trump is out of office. 'The deal is far too vague to have any economic meaning while Ukraine is still at war and for the foreseeable future thereafter,' said Maximilian Hess, a political risk analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a Philadelphia-based think tank. 'But if it does give Trump the headline win that he desires and sees support for Ukraine continue, then it’s a very good deal for Ukraine,' he told RFE/RL. Mykhaylo Samus, who directs the New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv, agreed that what’s most important is the final deal. In the meantime, he said, both Trump and Zelenskyy get to portray it as a win. 'From the Ukrainian side, it’s an attempt to stop this confrontation with the Trump administration,' Samus said. 'For Trump, he wants to show he’s got a result. It means Trump could say ‘we’ve got compensation for our taxpayers [for supporting Ukraine]. It’s an attempt to say something to the American electorate: ‘You see we’ve got another a victory.'' ‘Reasonable, Fair, Definitely Not Neocolonial Or Imperial’ Zelenskyy has a fraught history with Trump, going back to the first time Trump was impeached by U.S. lawmakers in 2019. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.) Since Trump’s return to the presidency, the Ukrainian leader has labored to ensure that backstory did not disrupt the supply of weaponry that his armed forces are desperate for. Trump has insulted Zelenskyy, called him a dictator, wrongly suggested that Ukraine started the war, and demanded a new presidential election as soon as possible.Add to the mix: a powerful push within much of the Republican Party to pull back U.S. foreign aid commitments around the world. Enter Ukraine’s minerals, both so-called rare earth minerals and other valuable metals, like lithium and titanium. Rare earth minerals are coveted for use in defense technologies, as well as things like batteries, computers, and mobile phones. Lithium is also a major component for batteries; titanium is used in airplane manufacturing, among other things. Trump administration officials, who see the United States in competition with China for access to the valuable minerals, have prioritized locking down supplies. That’s why Greenland has been a priority. Now Ukraine is as well. As with the language in the agreement, there’s some question about exactly how much rare, valuable mineral wealth Ukraine has in the first place. Ukraine’s Geological Survey says the country has substantial amounts of rare earth and other valuable minerals; a good proportion of that is located in territories under Russian control, however. Moreover, the U.S. Geological Survey suggests those reserves may be exaggerated. A research report by S&P Global also cast doubt on the Ukrainian estimates, saying they are based on decades-old surveys. Ukraine’s lithium, titanium, and even uranium deposits are more established, as are its oil and gas holdings. In a small victory for Zelenskyy and his negotiators, the agreement calls for the revenues in the Joint Reconstruction Fund to promote 'the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine'— although the deal says that will be defined only in the final fund agreement. That’s a change from earlier drafts, and remarks by U.S. officials, who suggested the fund’s revenues would instead go toward repaying some of the costs of the U.S. supplied weaponry. For observers, Ukrainian or otherwise, the deal is a small victory for both leaders. 'Economically, this is a solid opportunity to pull in outside capital—potentially generating several billion in reinvestment every year,' Natalia Shapoval, an economist with the Kyiv School of Economics, said in a post on X. 'Politically, it’s a gamble: Zelenskyy’s administration is trusting that deeper economic ties might eventually yield better security commitments. For now, I would say, Ukraine proceeds with cautious optimism.' Tomas Kopecny, the Czech government’s envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, called it a 'success of diplomatic negotiations for both countries.' 'The deal itself, I find reasonable, fair, definitely not neocolonial or imperial,' he told RFE/RL. 'The deal itself is basically a way how to make American enterprises and American business and American government interested in the reconstruction of Ukraine not only on paper, but also through concrete financial and investment schemes.' No Security Guarantees The Zelenskyy government – with long memories of the failed 1994 Budapest Memorandum fresh in their minds – has long hammered on the need for security guarantees, to help avert any future Russian aggression. But any obligation committing Washington to Ukraine’s protection or security is a major non-starter for the Trump administration. However, in what one observer suggested was a diplomatic 'masterpiece,' the agreement does in fact include a security clause – 'The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace' – but it doesn’t commit Washington to anything. Previous drafts did not include that clause. Trump told reporters at the White House on February 25 that the agreement gives Ukraine 'military equipment and the right to fight on, and originally, the right to fight.' However, at a meeting with Cabinet officials a day later, he repeated his insistence that the United States would not be providing security guarantees. 'I’m not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much,' he said. 'We’re going to have Europe do that.' 'I'm hoping and praying that this is what Trump needs as sort of the window dressing to say 'OK, we're going to help Ukraine now’,' said Ed Verona, an expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington who worked for energy and mining firms in Russia and also explored investments in Ukraine. Zelenskyy 'managed to get himself a better deal than the first two drafts that were submitted. And so he's keen to go to Washington, sign off and say, ‘OK, great,’' Verona told RFE/RL. 'And hope that maybe this assuages Donald Trump. And Trump will be able to say, ‘See what I've got. They signed on this agreement. This is good for America.’' RFE/RL Europe Editor Rikard Jozwiak and North America correspondent Todd Prince contributed to this report.

What You Need To Know About Philippine Vice President Duterte’s U...	By Jason Gutierrez The Philippines, arguably one of Southeast Asia’s freest democracies, is heading toward a trial that could lead to the removal of an impeached official – Vice President Sara Duterte. Complicating matters are shifting alliances that have long-characterized Filipino politics, with the upcoming midterm elections in May shaping up to be a battle between Duterte and her former ally, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sara Duterte, the 46-year-old daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, is the first Philippine vice president to be impeached. The Senate will convene as an impeachment court and likely tackle the complaint after Marcos delivers his annual address to Congress in the second half of July. Before then, Filipinos will vote on May 12 to fill 12 of the 24 Senate seats and all 317 House seats. Here’s what you need to know about the impeachment process and what’s at stake: Why was Sara Duterte impeached? On Feb. 5, the House of Representatives impeached Duterte on charges of violating the constitution, graft and corruption and of plotting to assassinate Marcos, his wife and the House speaker. Duterte was alleged to have misused U.S. $10.6 million when she served as education secretary under Marcos. She’s denied all the allegations and has promised to face off against her detractors in the Senate. 'The only thing I can say at this point is: God save the Philippines,' Duterte told reporters after House members voted for the articles of impeachment. While Marcos has distanced himself from the VP’s impeachment, Duterte and her supporters have asked the Supreme Court to stop the political proceedings. It has yet to rule on her petition. When will the trial start? Senate President Francis Escudero has announced that the impeachment trial is to begin after Marcos delivers his fourth State of the Nation Address, which the constitution mandates be delivered on the third Monday of July. How long will the proceedings last? There is no fixed date as to how long an impeachment trial can last and the case would depend on the number and quality of witnesses. In 2012, an impeachment trial of the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona lasted nearly half a year. Over a decade before that, the 2001 impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada, a former action movie star, abruptly ended when his allies prevented the unsealing of evidence against him. Public anger snowballed into a popular revolt that forced Estrada out of office. He was subsequently jailed on massive corruption, but was later pardoned. When is an official impeached? The House needs a vote of only one-third of its sitting members to impeach a sitting official. Following such a vote, Articles of Impeachment would be sent to the Senate, or the upper chamber, which would convene itself into an impeachment court to 'try' the case. A vote of at least two-thirds (16 members) of the Senate is needed to convict. If this were to occur, the impeached official would be removed, and the Senate, with its members acting as senator-judges, could impose additional penalties including permanent disbarment from holding public office. Who will replace the vice president if she loses? If Duterte is removed from office, Marcos could nominate her successor from among the ranks of the Senate and the House. His choice would then need to be confirmed by votes in both houses. Duterte is the fifth official in the Southeast Asian nation to be impeached after Estrada, Corona, an ombudsman and elections chief. Only Corona was convicted, while the others resigned rather than be subjected to a protracted political process. Will the trial be held publicly and what are the implications? An impeachment trial in the Senate would be held under full media scrutiny for accountability’s sake – but while the senators are called upon to be impartial, analysts said clear political battle lines had already been drawn. Duterte’s father, tough-talking former leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose legacy in office was marked by his administration’s bloody war on drugs, is leading the senatorial campaigns of opposition candidates. The slate includes sitting senators Christopher Go – who served as Rodrigo Duterte’s chief aide – and his former police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, who enforced the drug war. They are joined by Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, the former president’s spiritual adviser who is campaigning from jail while fighting sex-trafficking charges involving minors and adults, and House member Rodante Maroleta, a staunch defender of the Duterte family. What happens next? The Southeast Asian nation is no stranger to political infighting, but an impeachment acquittal could give breathing space to Sara Duterte, who remains popular especially in the south and has flirted with the idea of running for president in 2028. Marcos is constitutionally prohibited from running again. If she were to be convicted, Marcos would be in a unique position of being able to pick her successor. He could select a loyalist from the lower House where his cousin, Martin Romualdez, is the speaker and his son, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, is a ranking member. Analysts have noted that the impending impeachment trial is a clear sign that the once-valuable political alliance between the Marcos and Duterte families, which led to a big win in the 2002 national polls, has come to a bitter end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50-ZY4soGc93-	2025-02-27T17:31:32-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russia Launched Largest Drone Salvo S...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Battlefield Assessment The Kremlin launched its largest drone salvo since it began its full-scale invasion three years ago. The strike package included 267 Iran-designed Shahed loitering munitions and decoy platforms alongside Iskander ballistic missiles and North Korean KN-23 tactical ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses and electronic warfare assets intercepted most of these munitions. Russia launched its projectiles from multiple positions, including some in occupied Crimea and its embattled Kursk region. As previous editions of this report have detailed, Russia’s use of Shahed drones, which has increased significantly since late 2024, is made possible by the growing production capacity of the joint Russia-Iran drone plant in Tatarstan. Since September 2024 Russia has launched at least 1,000 Shahed drones each month. In both November 2024 and January 2025, the Kremlin fired over 2,500 loitering munitions at Ukrainian population centers. On the ground, battlefield trends continued to favor the invaders. Russia maintained an offensive footing on every front, incrementally gaining territory in multiple locations. In Pokrovsk, Russian units secured tactical gains. Russian forces in Kurakhove pressed forward with mounting attacks from multiple axes of assault. The Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed that its combat formations captured the tactically important village of Ulakly. Further clashes raged in Chasiv Yar but produced minimal change in territorial control. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has been fighting with gritted teeth to hold the line. Ukraine’s 71st Brigade recently repelled a Russian push near Pokrovsk, inflicting heavy material losses and casualties on the invading forces. Last week, the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade also turned back a large-scale attack from the Russian 155th Marine Infantry, a formation notorious for committing war crimes during the initial stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Both parties launched separate tactical offensives in parts of the Russian region of Kursk, currently occupied by Ukrainian forces. Yet while the Ukrainian push there seems to have paused, Russian forces continue their attempts to recapture lost territory. As in previous weeks, heavy drone warfare activity surged across Ukraine, with social media platforms littered with visuals of drone engagements. North Korean forces also continued to operate in theater. The United Kingdom’s Defence Ministry reported that North Korean personnel have returned to their combat posts following a rotation period in which they suffered thousands of casualties. Open-source intelligence suggests that the North Korean military has combat deployed Bulsae-4 mounted anti-tank guided missiles in Kursk. A non-line-of-sight (NLOS) weapon with an estimated range of 6.5 miles, the Bulsae-4 is particularly dangerous against heavy armor. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continues to highlight new models of distributed military capacity-building for the digitalized information environment of the twenty-first century. Recently, the Georgian Legion, a volunteer formation predominantly manned by ethnic Georgians, launched an online crowdfunding campaign to procure Kaspar S2 jammers. Anti-Kremlin Chechen units fighting alongside the Ukrainian Armed Forces have also resorted to campaigns on YouTube and X to raise money for their droneprogram. Ukrainian brigades and battalions have written the playbook for future generations of fighters on how to use social media to generate funding and improve public communications. 2. New Revelations of Russian War Crimes Emerge More evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine continues to surface. A recent study from the Financial Times found that Russia’s extrajudicial killings of Ukrainian prisoners of war stem from a policy propagated by the highest echelons of the Russian military. The Russian high command has also condoned and directed the deliberate shelling of churches, schools, and hospitals, the abduction of Ukrainian children, and the systematic torture and oppression of Ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also released the report from its recent visit to Ukraine. The organization’s findings confirm that riot-control agents have been used throughout the war, though the group’s mandate does not allow it to identify by whom. States signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) are required to declare all riot control agents possessing toxic chemicals, and the CWC prohibits the use of riot control agents in a conflict. The OPCW’s findings reinforce recent reports that Ukrainian border guards captured Russian quadcopter drones equipped with K-51 chemical grenadesfilled with CS gas, a chemical compound used as a tear gas and riot control agent. K-51 was the principal riot control grenade used by the Soviet Red Army. The K-51 that the Russian military possesses is more powerful than police-grade variants of the compound and can be lethal. This report will continue to monitor Russian war crimes and reports of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Europe Can’t Blame Everything On Russia – OpEd	Western mainstream political parties continuously blaming Russian meddling for electoral failures are increasingly out of touch with voters – at least US Vice President J.D. Vance seems to think so. Vance criticized the ‘Russian meddling’ narrative in his visit to Munich. All countries, irrespective of their political theater, attempt to influence voter preferences in other countries through their intelligence apparatus and its NGO and media assets. A fortiori, not every election that does not go the way of the EU ruling elite can be attributed to the machinations of the Kremlin. Political parties attributing electoral defeats to Moscow are disconnected from their constituents, the US vice president said. There has been a 'retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' It seems that EU politicians would rather suppress dissent than reflect on their actions. Ahead of attending the Munich Security Conference, Vance urged Western politicians to acknowledge the rise of anti-establishment politics. He criticized attempts to dismiss viewpoints on issues such as traditional values and immigration by those who attribute them to 'misinformation.' 'If your democratic society can be taken down by $200,000 of social media ads, then you should think seriously about how strong your grip on or how strong your understanding of the will of the people actually is,' Vance said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, notably popularized the tactic of blaming Russia following her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election – a claim Moscow has consistently denied – and the FBI later admitted was a fraud (hoax). The US vice president argued that mainstream parties in the EU are 'kind of terrified of their own people.' He pointed to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which despite electoral success struggles to find coalition partners since centrist factions label it 'far right' – extremist. Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, ignited controversy in Berlin by endorsing the AfD. In response, the German government accused the billionaire of election interference, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz stating that freedom of speech does not encompass the promotion of 'extreme-right positions.' In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68.2 billion), pending a review of its alignment with US national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump’s administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Established in 1983, it is officially a nonprofit organization that, ostensibly, provides grants to support democratic initiatives worldwide. However, over the years, it has faced allegations of covertly influencing political outcomes overseas, with critics arguing that it has taken over covert functions previously handled by the CIA, particularly those aimed at undermining and in some instances overthrowing foreign governments. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. The Center for Renewing America, a research organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a policy paper on February 7, accusing the NED of functioning as the 'tip of the proverbial spear for heightened CIA and State Department efforts to foster political revolution in Ukraine.' The report claimed that the NED had funneled tens of millions of dollars to a myriad of Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests and 'advanced both the ‘Orange Revolution’ (2004) and ‘Maidan Revolution’ (2014) that paved the way for the current Ukraine-Russia war.' The NED has also faced accusations of sponsoring 'color revolutions' in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and of funding opposition groups in Belarus, Serbia, and Egypt. The funding freeze on the organization comes as part of broader measures by the Trump administration to cut foreign spending. Earlier this month, Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given responsibility for finding ways to cut excessive federal spending. Musk singled out NED immediately, calling it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization' that needs to be dissolved. Trump’s 'executive pen,' however, does not stop with the NED. Further oversight included a crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington’s primary vehicle for funding political projects abroad. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through Washington’s primary agency for funding political projects abroad -- USAID. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk – who previously branded USAID a 'criminal organization' – Fico voiced concerns over what he described as 'gross interference' in Slovakia’s political landscape. 'It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,' Fico wrote in a letter shared on X on Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received US funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to 'eliminate these foreign networks' that interfere in the country’s domestic affairs. The US spends more on humanitarian aid than other countries by wide margins, though foreign aid spending is under 1% of the federal budget. The US provides some amount of aid to most countries, including nearly every country in Africa and Asia. Many polls have recently found that a majority of Americans believe the US is spending too much on foreign aid, including for Ukraine. This is a drama that will surely play out in the midst of Trump 'taking Gaza,' the Ukraine proxy war with Russia and the global array of punitive tariffs orchestrated between the US, Canada, Mexico, China and the EU. But more importantly, how will the EU respond? Will it continue its 'retreat from values' it has historically shared with America? Will it heed the entreaty from the US vice president to embrace anti-establishment reality and cease suppression of dissent contrary to the narrative of establishment elites? Will it entrench further into protectionist, establishment mentality? The European Union is at a crossroads.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50_jHGWBAzRll	2025-02-27T17:24:47-08:00	
A Practical Way To Protect The Worldwide Trading System – OpEd	By Patrick Barron In a previous essay, I pointed out that it is very likely that the US will isolate itself from the worldwide trading system due to its past—frankly unlawful—actions to steal the assets of other countries and the increasing assault on the purchasing power of the dollar. My goal was to recommend actions that the US government could adopt to reassure its trading partners that neither outright theft of assets or decline in the purchasing power of the dollar could happen. My two main recommendations were that the US readopt a gold standard and, one, move its gold to a neutral country when dollars could be exchanged for gold and, two, move the SWIFT messaging system for international trade settlement to a neutral country also. Although I believe that these actions would save the dollar and the worldwide dollar trading system, the likelihood of either happening is very slim. So, what to do? Moving SWIFT to neutral hands, say the Swiss, undoubtedly would be more acceptable for US statesmen than moving our gold reserves overseas. So, barring that solution, we must think outside the box, so to speak. What can we do to reassure our trading partners that we will pay for their exports to us in stable money? Settle International Trading Accounts in Gold The answer is to not settle in dollars at all, but settle in gold. In other words, revive the worldwide gold standard for international trade. The mechanism for accomplishing this feat has been proposed by Alasdair Macleod. The BRICS countries have discussed using a basket of currencies, which might include some gold. But Alasdair Macleod believes that this is impractical and not a stable solution. He has proposed a much simpler mechanism. With his approval, I quote him directly, As an alternative, I proposed an independent and new issuing authority for BRICS which would take in gold from member nations and issue gold substitutes in return based on Isaac Newton’s idea of 40% backing. So for every 100 tonnes deposited, a CB would get reserves in gold substitutes to the tune of 250 tonnes equivalent. My reasoning was that a central bank would be happy to increase its reserves in this fashion appearing as a balance sheet asset, against which commercial bank reserves could be held (liability to the CB) thereby guaranteeing the value of credit issued by the banking system denominated in the new currency. The purpose was for international trade settlement rather than replacing national currencies, but national currencies could be linked to it at a fixed exchange rate should a nation so desire. A gold vault and a gold bank would be established in, say, Switzerland. Each BRICS country would send enough of its gold reserves to the gold vault that it could settle its net trading position in gold credits through the gold bank. Notice that the settlement would be only its 'net' position. Some days a country’s net position might be negative, meaning that the gold bank debits that country’s account. But some days the net position would be positive, meaning that the gold bank would issue a credit. It would be up to the participating countries to send enough gold to the gold vault only for anticipated net debit positions. If a country ran persistent net negative positions, which would be settled in gold, it would have to send more gold to the vault and probably reform its internal economic policies, such as raising interest rates to increase savings and moderate loan demand. The market itself would dictate and enforce these moves, not any single or combination of nations themselves. Bankers will notice that international trade settlement is little different in application than the way that commercial banks settle check and electronic clearing each day either through a local clearinghouse or, most likely, through their reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank. I’m sure the mechanism is the same in all developed countries. Checks presented for payment reduce the bank’s clearing account balance, whereas checks presented against other banks increase the clearing balance. If a commercial bank runs persistent net debits, it has to send reserves to its Fed account. It does this by selling assets, probably US Treasury Bills, calling in loans, or even borrowing reserves via the Fed Funds Market from other commercial banks who have excess reserves. Hierarchy of Methodological Individualism It’s all part of human action based on methodological individualism. Participants at all settlement levels desire to be paid in a sound medium of indirect exchange. The lowest level of settlement is trade between individuals. Your son wants to be paid for mowing the lawn, for example, but he may be willing to accept borrowing the family car in lieu of payment. However, if your neighbor’s son did the work, he’ll require cash. This is the first, base level of settlement. The second level of settlement is between banks. The first indication that a bank is having financial trouble is that it runs persistent debits at the clearinghouse. Individuals and businesses that borrowed and spent more than the bank’s available pool of savings must moderate their spending. This relieves the daily settlement pressure on their local commercial bank. The third line of settlement is between central banks. Persistent debit settlements by central banks are the first indication of a nation’s growing financial insolvency. Internal economic reform in the form of higher interest rates, lower government expenditures, and minimum economic regulations are required in order to stop the outflow of gold. If earth ever traded with aliens from outer space, the issue would be the same. The Earth’s Bank for International Settlements would have to find some intergalactic medium of exchange that would be acceptable to Earthlings and to Martians! Stated another way, we may say that country A trades with country B, but the underlying reality is that certain people in country A trade with certain people in country B. International settlement is merely an aggregation of lots of individual trades. The Trickle-Down Benefits of an International Trade Settlement System Based on Gold In effect, the world would be back on a gold standard for international trade. There is every reason to believe that this process of trading and settling internationally with gold would trickle down to intra-country trades. Although countries would not interfere with one another’s internal policies, a country that failed to produce real wealth would not be able to export enough to buy sufficient gold to pay for its imports. In other words, a nation’s internal currency would be tied to gold, making international trading terms, which are denominated in gold, easier to understand, and making forecasting future currency needs easier to predict. Companies would find it more accurate to predict the likelihood of future profits. All this would flow naturally from the international gold settlement system. America needs to anchor its currency in gold in order to trade internationally. This would force the federal government—which has papered the world with fiat dollars—to balance its bloated and unsustainable budget. There is little appetite for countries to expand or even maintain trade with America unless they were paid in sound money (i.e., gold). A wise American government would agree to join such a system and not try to force other countries to use the dollar by threatening them with tariffs and sanctions. Such bullying tactics may appear to work in the short term, but they are not the basis for long term success. Americans may not realize it, but they need access to the worldwide trading system, which means that they need to join other nations in a single worldwide trade settlement system. In the long run, America cannot afford to be isolated economically. About the author: Patrick Barron is a private consultant to the banking industry.

Apple Takes A Bite Of Trumponomics – OpEd	By Andrew Moran For the economic observers keeping track, Apple can be added to the growing list of multinational corporations pledging to invest billions of dollars in the US economy. Is the iPhone maker ultra-bullish on Trumponomics, or is the tech juggernaut attempting to avoid the new administration’s tariffs? It could be a bit of both, as President Donald Trump has vowed to implement a pro-business climate, and Apple is trying to diversify its global supply chain away from China. A Bite of the Big Apple The big Apple is allocating its capital to the Lone Star State. In a Feb. 24 announcement, the company confirmed that it will open a new facility in Texas designed for artificial intelligence (AI) servers as part of a broader $500 billion investment in nearly two dozen states over the next four years. The 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility will be located in Houston and will create servers for Apple Intelligence, an AI personal assistant for its line of products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. It plans to initiate operations in 2026. In addition to the new AI-related location, Apple will allocate part of the money to collaborate with US suppliers and produce content for its media streaming service, Apple TV+. It will double its US Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, bolster its domestic research and development investments in silicon engineering, and launch a new Michigan-based manufacturing academy. On the labor front, the tech giant intends to hire approximately 20,000 new employees nationwide. Most will be dedicated to AI and machine learning, research and development, silicon engineering, and software development. 'We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,' Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. The White House, meanwhile, called it a 'landmark' step in resuscitating US manufacturing. Trump has been attracting a tsunami of private investment in the United States following his November electoral victory. Over the last couple of months, his administration has already secured approximately $1.7 trillion of investments from US and foreign businesses: Saudi Arabia will dump $600 billion in the US economy over the next four years. The Stargate Initiative, led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, will park $500 billion in the United States to revolutionize the nation’s AI infrastructure. SoftBank announced that it will put $100 billion toward US investments, focusing on AI. Dubai property billionaire Hussain Sajwani will pour $20 billion into building data centers across the country. Japan’s Nippon Steel will no longer try to acquire US Steel but will invest the $14.1 billion in the United States. While it is more than likely that these companies and individual billionaires will utilize the subsidies in the former administration’s Inflation Reduction Act or US Chips and Science Act, it should be noted that Trump did not bribe investors with taxpayer-funded resources. Put simply, the federal government is not paying these entities to create jobs or construct facilities – they are doing so in the confidence of Trumponomics. Or, in Apple’s case, it might want to avoid tariffs. A Tariff Worm Inside the Apple Traveling on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump had a simple message for companies: ship US jobs overseas and pay hefty tariffs, or build your product in the United States and avoid these levies. Is Corporate America listening? Siri was indeed hearing what the president asserted, though Apple has been navigating the turbulent global trade system since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Over the years, as Liberty Nation News has reported, corporations have been diversifying their worldwide supply chains. The reasons vary, from avoiding trade disputes to responding to public health crises. The biggest victim of this international initiative has been China. The largest beneficiary? Before Trump 2.0, the likes of India, Thailand, and Vietnam were the victors. Now that the old sheriff has returned to his position, the equation is elementary enough: China is still hurting, but the United States could revive its global manufacturing dominance. It is no secret that Tim Cook has depended less on China for either production or consumption. China is now the primary location for about one-third of Apple’s suppliers’ production sites, down from nearly half in 2019. For shoppers, Apple’s shipments in Beijing fell by 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. But while the tech behemoth has set its sights on India, a new challenge has arisen: tariffs. The White House recently announced reciprocal tariffs on all US trading partners. With India maintaining one of the highest tariff rates in the world, Trump is poised to target the world’s fifth-largest economy, though the two sides could iron out a deal beforehand. Still, if the administration follows through on its threats in the spring, Apple and a plethora of other companies might need to purchase a lifetime supply of Tylenol to remedy their headaches. Winning Is Cook playing the long game by reshoring operations in the United States? Sure, labor costs might balloon, but executives may deduce that paying more is better than mitigating uncertainty in the global economy. Whatever the motive, Trump is already following through on a key campaign pledge, and he is achieving this lofty objective without relying on taxpayers as a crutch.

Beware Of Federal Education Policies: Even If You Like Them – OpE...	By Kerry McDonald It’s an exciting time in American K-12 education. Families now have many more choices about where, what, how, and with whom their children learn. Founders are embracing an entrepreneurial spirit when building new schools and the kind of educational spaces that families increasingly want. School-choice policies that enable education funding to follow students continue to expand nationwide, with 33 states now offering some form of private school choice. These school-choice wins should be applauded, as they enable more families to exit a mandatory district-school assignment for other settings if they wish. What shouldn’t be applauded, however, are federal school-choice policies—or federal education policies in general. Let’s remember that there is no constitutional role for the federal government in education, which is why the US Department of Education should be eliminated. The only areas in which the federal government could arguably have any influence in K-12 education are in the District of Columbia, and in schools overseen by the US Department of Defense and the Bureau of Indian Education. Everything else, constitutionally, should be left to the states. Linda McMahon, President Trump’s pick to lead, and possibly to dismantle, the US Department of Education, asserted this in her recent confirmation hearing, explaining that she intends to help President Trump 'return education to the states where it belongs.' The key is to reduce the size and scope of the federal government’s role in education—not to enlarge it. Even when we support certain programs or policies—such as school choice—we should speak out against the implementation of these policies at the federal level, including President Trump’s recent school-choice executive order. The Cato Institute’s Neal McCluskey wrote a great piece on this topic, stating that 'even though expanding freedom for families is highly desirable, the Constitution must come first.' Trump’s other recent education executive order on 'ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling' is similarly problematic. By activating the US Departments of Education, Defense, and Health and Human Services, this order aims to end federal funding for schools that promote 'anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation’s children,' specifically related to race and gender. As with school-choice policies, K-12 curriculum and content decisions should be a state issue—not a federal one. Federal funding for K-12 education is less than 15% of the roughly $900 billion that American taxpayers spend each year on K-12 public schooling. That spending should be dramatically reduced at the federal level across the board, but emboldening Washington, DC, to chime in on specific K-12 curriculum decisions sets a dangerous precedent. Just prior to the 2020 presidential election, I wrote an article here at FEE: 'If You Don’t Want a Biden ‘1619 Commission,’ You Should Oppose Trump’s ‘1776 Commission.’' I argued then, as I do now, that the federal government should not be in the curriculum business and that—constitutionally—states are the ones to grapple with these issues. Yet, in this new executive order, Trump is resurrecting the 1776 Commission and pushing for obligatory 'patriotic education'—which frankly sounds like something out of North Korea. Some could argue that the federal government is currently entangled in education policy—even if it shouldn’t be—and therefore influence on K-12 curriculum is appropriate. But a primary objective for those who believe in the decentralization of government power should be to weaken the federal role in education and let states manage K-12 schooling. The current administration has promised to shutter, or at least shrink, the US Department of Education, but these recent executive orders only serve to expand the federal government’s unconstitutional role in education, giving it even more control over what and how children learn. That may be okay with some parents while President Trump and the Republicans are in power, but what about when the political winds inevitably shift and the Democrats are again in charge? We should direct our energies and enthusiasms to advocating state-based school-choice policies that enable families to exit an assigned district school for other options that may be more aligned with their personal values and their children’s needs. I spend most of my time interviewing and writing about the entrepreneurial parents and teachers who have created innovative, low-cost schools and related learning models, and the families who benefit from them. I have interviewed parents who left public schools for other options because they didn’t like certain conversations and curriculum around gender and sexuality that they thought were inappropriate for their young children. Similarly, I have talked with parents in states that have passed bans on 'critical race theory' and related content in public schools who felt that they weren’t able to have open and honest discussions about race and ethnicity, and their important intersection with history and culture. They, too, left the public schools for other education options that were more aligned with their values and viewpoints. Freedom of exit and choice are fundamental to a free society. We don’t force our neighbors to eat at the restaurants or shop at the stores that we prefer. We recognize that a free market for goods and services is characterized by variety, choice, and abundance—allowing us to satisfy our individual preferences in myriad ways. We are finally starting to enjoy this variety, choice, and abundance in K-12 education. At the state level, we should push for expanded school-choice policies that enable more families to select an educational option that reflects their individual needs and preferences. At the national level, we should push for a constrained federal government that doesn’t control our lives or those of our children.

Fiendish Experiments: Trump’s Guantánamo Bay Migrant Detentions –...	Guantánamo Bay has been a fiendish experiment in US law for decades. The fiendishness lies in the subversion. Operating as a naval base in Cuba, this contentious facility has been the site and location for the cruelties of paranoia and empire, a place where such laws as due process are subverted, and the presumption to innocence soiled. In this contorted way, the civilian and military branches have mingled and corrupted, the result proving a nightmare for legal authorities keen to ensure that such a facility does, at the very least, observe that sad, dusty relic known as the rule of law. Legal sharpshooters have been baffled by the latest experiment with the facility, this time from the Trump administration and its efforts to use it as a detention centre for unwanted migrants. On January 29, the US president directed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security 'to take all appropriate actions to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity to provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States'. Furthermore, the secretaries were directed 'to address attendant immigration enforcement needs identified' by the departments. The first flight transferring migrants from US soil to the facility took place on February 4 this year. The intention is to house up to 30,000 people, but it is already clear that not all, contrary to what the president claims, are 'the worst criminal aliens threatening the American people.' Some have been found to be of a 'low-threat' category, hardly the sort to terrify the peace of mind of your average US citizen. Yet again, we find himself inhabiting a world of dismal illusions. Such an authorisation can hardly be said to fall within the all too conveniently expansive 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which focuses on the interminable prosecution of the formerly known Global War on Terror. The MOC is its own beast, a separate instrument controversial for 'housing' (as opposed to 'detaining') its residents. It is located on the Leeward side of the base and was created to house Caribbean migrants interdicted at sea in the 1990s. The entities relevant to running the MOC are the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) responsible to the Department of Homeland Security. Interdicted migrants are assessed to see if they deserve 'protected' status, one that is granted if the individual has a genuine fear of harm arising if they are returned to their country or origin. Historically, during the phase of their assessment, migrants receive a basic set of services in healthcare, housing, education, and job training. The use of the island to deal with immigrants has been a blighted practice undertaken by US administrations since the 1970s. The Ford and Carter administrations held Haitians at the base as they awaited asylum interviews. After a cessation of immigration detention onsite under the Reagan administration, the unsavoury practice was resumed in 1991. Again involving Haitians, only this time in greater numbers, given the military coup, some 12,500 were transferred to a shoddy, makeshift camp. Under Bill Clinton’s presidency, the camp was emptied, but the rights of those interdicted was systematically stripped to enable them to be repatriated. In 1994, the camp, in all its squalid ingloriousness, was reopened to house Cubans and Haitians in their tens of thousands. The issue of valid authorisation is not a mere semantic quibble. Trump’s actions have consequential disturbances to the rule of law. The administration is seemingly pushing, not merely a smudging of the categories in terms of dealing with migrants, but their obliteration. What we are left with is a nasty mixture of terror and malfeasance, a point that utterly repudiates basic protections offered by the UN Refugee Convention. Nor is it clear whether the administration can legally carry out these measures. The MOC migrants being transferred will not be deprived of legal rights afforded them under the US Constitution, which include access to the judicial system and legal counsel, due process protections which cover arbitrary or indefinite detention, the right to appropriate conditions of confinement, and the right to seek release from unlawful detention. It is also important to distinguish those immigrants interdicted at sea who seek asylum in the United States, and those already on US soil. A case is currently pending on the issue before US Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, D.C., though a court date is yet to be set. In terms of both cost and logistics, this detention measure is also untenable. It has been estimated that the average cost for an immigration detention bed will be quintupled from its current annual total of $57,378. Ensuring access to legal counsel and guaranteeing humane treatment will also present a nightmarish scenario for the authorities, given the scale of the expansion sought by Trump. So far, lawyers from the Justice Department have unconvincingly claimed that the limited availability of phone calls to counsel located off the base was a 'reasonable and consistent' measure when it comes to the 'temporary staging' of migrants with final deportation orders to other countries. The Trump administration’s waspish approach to unwanted immigrants replicates the pattern of deterrence and demonisation used by other countries (member states in the European Union and Australia comes to mind) that have treated unwanted arrivals as an interchangeable commodity with political objects and national security: the terrorist, the hardened criminal, the deviant, the immoral figure best barred from entering their borders. But at the very least, a firmly established legal system, if mobilised correctly, has some prospect of sinking this hideous experiment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE504jwOP08pqdw	2025-02-27T16:55:19-08:00	
DRC: Romanian Mercenaries Leave After The Bloody Fall Of Goma	They disembarked buses and gathered in a long line at Rwanda’s Kigali International Airport. Some wore stern expressions, others laughed and made small talk. Some appeared to be in their 20s, others looked middle-aged. Most wore beards. The Democratic Republic of the Congo hired these Romanian mercenaries to help secure the country’s restive eastern region, where the M23 rebel group has made a violent resurgence. They were flying back home in early February, a couple of days after the M23 seized Goma, capital of the North Kivu province, following a bloody battle. One of the mercenaries told Rwandan newspaper New Times that he had worked for a private company for more than a decade and had been deployed to DRC for two years as a military trainer. 'I only work with military, which the highest rank was Lieutenant, Corporal, or something like that,' said the man, who spoke anonymously. 'As a trainer, being employed by a private military company, I was involved in training the government military to teach someone to do something. I think, yes, I did my job on my part. When M23 [were] approaching Goma, OK, we seek protection from the U.N. [United Nations] in Goma.' Another mercenary said he has a medical degree and worked in the DRC as an instructor. 'The payment was made by the contract by the one who hired us, and I cannot give you the numbers because it depends on what we were doing,' he told New Times. 'The terms were very simple. It’s three months with one month off.' The mercenaries were among those fortunate to have survived the battle. According to the World Health Organization, 900 bodies were recovered from Goma’s streets, about 3,000 people were injured and thousands forced to flee the North Kivu province. 'The human toll is staggering,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 'We and our partners are struggling to assess the full extent of the situation.' The Romanian mercenaries left as the M23 continued advancing. In early February, the group broke a ceasefire when it seized the South Kivu mining town of Nyabibwe. The town is a commercial hub more than halfway between Goma and Bukavu, capital of South Kivu. 'There have been clashes since 5 a.m., and it was at 9 a.m. that the town fell into the hands of the rebels,' a civil society representative anonymously told Reuters. 'They’re in the center of the town at the moment.' Between January 26 and February 12, more than 3,000 people were killed in the fighting, 2,880 injured, and more than 500,000 displaced, adding to the 6.4 million people already internally displaced, the U.N. reported. From Nyabibwe, the M23 engaged Congolese forces in Lubero, administrative center of North Kivu’s Lubero Territory, in mid-February. After breaching the defensive line of Congolese forces in Ihusi, the rebels advanced towards the South Kivu town of Katana, 11 kilometers from Bukavu’s airport, which the rebels seized on February 14. The M23’s presence in the DRC has been a longtime source of tension between the DRC and Rwanda, which is accused of backing the rebels. Kigali denies this. As the Romanian mercenaries departed in early February, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said the DRC’s recruitment and use of European mercenaries violated a 1977 Organization of African Unity convention and a 1989 United Nations convention. At least 20 peacekeepers, including 14 from South Africa, have been killed in the fighting between the M23 and Congolese forces, according to Anadolu Agency.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50__IMdCVDzTh	2025-02-27T16:49:29-08:00	
A Cruel Hoax: The Political Economy Of Anti-Immigration – OpEd	Deporting immigrants may deliver electoral wins to politicians if voters have been sufficiently cultivated by years of demonizing and scapegoating them. For its victims, the cruelties involved are horrific. Yet such deportation makes little sense economically. It represents a nationally self-destructive program based on a faulty grasp of immigration economics. What once 'made America great' (at least for the majority white population) were its successive waves of immigrants. What underscored the American economy's strength was its ability to absorb and integrate those waves despite frictions among them: a genuinely productive melting pot. My American schooling through my PhD stressed such points. What then reversed such a positive understanding of immigration? What converted immigration instead into an urgent danger to American greatness? What lets Trump pose as 'protecting' us by sharply reducing immigration and massively deporting immigrants? (By 'immigrants' I mean the vast majority of people who are poor and join the working class at low levels of pay. Foreign-born U.S. residents comprise about 14 percent of the total population or roughly 46 million. About 12 million of them are undocumented.) Answers to such questions lie in the political economy of immigration. Yet those answers and the political economy that generates them are stunningly absent from popular debates and consciousness. The Republican party's recent years of anti-immigration rhetoric plus the immigrant deportation policies in place across the last three presidencies illustrate that absence. Many politicians from both the Republican and Democratic parties support deportation as the necessary response to the 'costly invasions' of immigrants (often equated to criminals). Yet evidence for this demonization program has been very scarce. Its proponents seem largely ignorant of the actual economics of immigration. Most immigrants coming to the United States are young adults. The young can best manage migration's hardships and dangers. They can most readily fill the hardest jobs at the lowest pay that their desperate and vulnerable circumstances force on them. The undocumented among them are the most vulnerable. They dare not complain to the police or other government officials when employers take advantage of them and abuse them. Immigrants often send portions of their wages ('remittances') back to the countries they left. Remittances help care for children, the elderly, and others who remained there and partially compensate those countries of origin for losing their emigrants' productivity. Before adult immigrants arrived in the United States, their upbringing was financed by their countries of origin. Their families and governments spent considerable sums feeding, clothing, sheltering, educating, etc., them from birth to 15-18 years of age. They 'invested' in their young people but obtained little income from that investment because the young adults migrated to the United States. Their years of productivity benefited the U.S. economy, not the economy of the countries that invested in them. In contrast, people born and raised in the United States face heavy economic costs for the U.S. economy before they become working adults. U.S. families partly defray those costs (food, clothing, and shelter). The federal, state, and local governments defray other parts of those costs (public schooling, public services, etc.). Since relatively few U.S. adults emigrate, the U.S. economy reaps their adult productivity as a return on its investment in their upbringing. Added to that payoff, the United States secures the productivity of immigrants they did not invest in. Since many of the countries immigrants belong to are often among the poorer countries, the immigration of their citizens to the United States represents a subsidy from and by the poor nations. Migration not only reflects the international inequalities of global capitalism but it also worsens them. Migrants' countries of origin lose the adult productivity they need most. Migration transfers those benefits to the rich countries that need them the least. That 'great' American past that MAGA celebrates comprised many decades of massive and successive waves of immigrants. Impressive U.S. GDP growth in the 19th and 20th centuries owed more than a little to the subsidies provided by immigrants. Early waves of immigrants stimulated economic growth that in turn attracted, welcomed, and incorporated later waves. Each immigrant wave struggled, and most of them eventually achieved rising wages; some even rose out of the working class to become employers. Immigration and growth facilitated each other in a cycle that many found 'exceptional.' As each immigrant wave arrived, its members mostly endured the worst jobs and the lowest pay and lived in the worst housing and neighborhoods underserved by public services, such as inferior schools for their children. When the next wave arrived, its members accepted the same. The economic growth that earlier waves of immigrants contributed to eventually enabled their struggles for better jobs, pay, and housing to succeed. That growth also enabled the later waves of immigrants who replaced the earlier ones at the lowest rungs of the nation's social ladder. Thus, almost all immigrants could reasonably foresee better years ahead. The United States could boast about a remarkable degree of 'social mobility.' Carefully exaggerated by 'rags to riches' fables like those in the many novels of Horatio Adler (1832–1899), working-class belief in social mobility served social peace and often blunted socialism's appeal. This analysis has so far treated migration in terms of its national or macroeconomic effects. Migration also has microeconomic effects: its impact on the employee-employer relationship. Immigrants usually work for less pay than native-born employees will accept. Undocumented immigrants accept still less. Because immigrants can represent a real competitive threat, the native-born, better-paid workers can fear, resent, and oppose their presence. Demagogues often see opportunities to obtain votes by reflecting and reinforcing that resentment and opposition. If the migrants display 'racial' differences, demagogues can integrate racism (traditional or new) to aggravate the competition between immigrant and native-born employees. Employers have often played immigrants against native-born employees and undocumented immigrants against both. Employers' divide and conquer methods have prevented united actions by native and immigrant employees and blocked or destroyed labor unions and strikes. On the other hand, in recent years, significant portions of the U.S. labor movement have revived partly by pointedly unifying immigrant (documented and undocumented) and non-immigrant employees and, thereby, defeating employers. Not surprisingly, some employers, worried about a reviving labor movement, cultivated a backlash to reinforce divisions among employees. Demonization of immigration appealed to them. Denunciations of and demands to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitments became popular covers for and companions to anti-immigrant agitation. In the United States, recent presidents have sought votes by using hostile words and actions against immigrants. Those presidents' plans and resulting deportations responded to several years of large immigration. Political demagogues and racists played their usual roles. Trump lifted them into his campaigns and presidencies. His second term targets the most massive deportation in U.S. history. U.S. employers will regret the deportations' reduction of profitable and low-wage immigrant employees (and especially undocumented employees). Of course, employers retain their usual alternative of automation: replacing ever more workers with computers, robots, and AI. Millions deprived of government jobs (via Trump, Musk, and DOGE) will join those technologically displaced to compete for shrinking job opportunities in the U.S. private sector. The Trumpian objective is a working class cleansed of immigrants, unions, and DEI sensitivities. It is a MAGA world that has successfully resubordinated most non-whites, women, immigrants, and all others deemed inferior by the likes of Trump and Musk, and those they select. Immigration always served chiefly the needs of U.S. capitalism. Migration was always costly, dangerous, and painful to the migrants who mostly lacked other ways to survive. The U.S. working class was often threatened by immigration and thus saw it negatively, but it lacked the political power to stop it. On the other hand, the working class also appreciated the survival and opportunities immigration offered their families and ancestors. In that way, they saw immigration positively. Over several recent decades, slow, uneven economic growth redistributed U.S. wealth and income upward. A declining U.S. empire coupled with rising global competition (especially from China), climate change's mounting effects, and consequent global conflicts drove large migrations to the United States just as its jobs, incomes, and opportunities were being squeezed. Immigration's perceived negative effects came to outweigh the positive ones. Enough of the U.S. working class's sympathy for and appreciation of immigration declined to give right-wing demagogues their latest big opportunity. The demagogues exploited the changed conditions and attitudes of the United States working class to shake up U.S. politics. Daily executive orders have undone the formerly stable political consensus of alternating GOP and Democratic governments during the upswing of the U.S. empire in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since then, as the U.S. empire and capitalism commenced their mutually reinforcing decline, Republicans and Democrats turned ever more harshly on each other. Their old political establishment crumbled in bitter conflicts. Immigration became one flashpoint, one way to define a new political direction out of the decline that no party politician could dare admit to. Trump has so far best grasped the opportunity to ride an extreme position on immigration—mass deportation—to power. However, since it will soon become apparent that deporting immigrants solves little and worsens the U.S. decline, the political project's prospects are dubious. Much the same applies to other projects envisaged by him and Elon Musk. These include the neocolonialist plans to take over the Panama Canal, Greenland, and Gaza, and make Canada the 51st state of the United States. These also include imposing tariffs around the world and disconnecting the United States from global efforts related to climate change and health initiatives (WHO). Abandoning the Ukraine war and shifting its costs onto the Europeans may provoke their resistance and reactions frustrating Trump and Musk in unanticipated ways. As with immigration, the political economics of other Trump-Musk projects (and much of Project 2025) raise similar profound questions about their logic, blind spots, and unintended consequences. The deep contradictions of anti-immigration—and other projects—are not overcome by hiding them under the veneer of slogans like 'America First.' We continue to experience the American version of what 'declining empire' means. About the author: Richard D.

Trump Noncommittal On Peacekeeping For Ukraine As He Meets Britis...	By Patsy Widakuswara President Donald Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House Thursday to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and bilateral trade ties, amid the U.S. leader’s tariff threats on Europe and demands that the continent rely less on Washington for its security. Ahead of their meeting, Trump was noncommittal on providing any security guarantees for Kyiv, including on a proposed U.S. 'backstop' to support European peacekeepers to enforce a potential truce between Ukraine and Russia — a condition Starmer required. 'I hope we have that problem where we could worry about peacekeeping. We got to get there first,' Trump told reporters at the White House Wednesday. 'Peacekeeping is very easy. It's making the deal that's very tough.' Differences remain among European allies on any future deployment of troops to Ukraine. The U.K. supports a French-led proposal while other nations including Poland have ruled it out. 'I'm absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen, we need security guarantees,' Starmer said Wednesday, adding that Britain will do its part to support the measure as part of a Ukraine peace deal but only with a U.S. backstop. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects any suggestions of a peacekeeping troop deployment to Ukraine. He said Thursday that 'Western elites' are trying to disrupt the newly established dialogue between Moscow and Washington. In recent weeks Trump has launched direct negotiations with Russia to swiftly end the war without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies, both of whom he has increasingly criticized. He has drastically reversed U.S. policies under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, whose administration’s stance on the war was to 'support Ukraine for as long as it takes,' and 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,' when it comes to peace negotiations. Pushed to clarify Trump’s position on sending peacekeepers, a senior administration official speaking on background to reporters Thursday said that there are 'concerns' about putting troops on the ground at a 'post-Minsk I level of conflict, even post-Minsk II.' The official was referring to the 2014 and 2015 agreement aimed at ending fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, neither of which were sustained. The official said there would be less concern to send troops if the conflict is 'dialed down to a functional ceasefire,' as the U.S. wants, and even less with 'a broad based, consensual peace settlement among the parties.' The type of force deployed will depend on the political settlement to end the war, the official said — a 'tradeoff' that Trump and Starmer will focus on. A key message for Starmer to reinforce is that Europeans must be part of any peace discussions, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund’s (GMF) Geostrategy team. 'Because it would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the strategic reflections,' she told VOA. Boosting defense Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, also reiterated his stance that Europe should 'step up,' insisting that American taxpayers 'shouldn't be footing the bill ... more than the Europeans are paying.' In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S. government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In what appears to be a move to appease Trump, on Tuesday, Starmer announced an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the nation's GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP. Starmer aims to further boost defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election. The prime minister acknowledged that the decision to ramp up defense spending was 'accelerated' as Trump moves to negotiate with Moscow and makes clear he is reducing U.S. support for Europe’s security. The visit is a challenge for Starmer as he seeks to balance the U.K.'s interests with those of its European allies while engaging with an unpredictable U.S. administration. 'The most important thing is, do these guys get along? Do they have a common vision?' said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution about Trump and Starmer. That, he told VOA, could signal the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO’s support. 'If that's the case, then we're in a good position to try to promote a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,' O’Hanlon added. On Wednesday Trump signaled Ukraine should 'forget about' a path toward NATO membership and that it should not expect much from Washington. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much — we’re going to have Europe do that because we’re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor,' he said. Aside from negotiating with Moscow, Trump is also pushing Kyiv for a deal that would allow American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by the Biden administration to support the country’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump at the White House on Friday. Tariff threats Starmer is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump is threatening more, saying the European Union has been 'very unfair' to America. Starmer is 'in a bit delicate position' as the U.K. is not part of the European Union single market, said GMF’s Weber. 'So, for him, the question is basically averting the situation where there are U.S. tariffs, and of course also trying to appease Washington in that regard, while he’s also not going on a super confrontational line with the European Union,' she said. British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday she was confident that U.S.-U.K. trade and investment would not be derailed amid Trump’s tariff threats.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50z9FIVIytyu3	2025-02-27T16:41:52-08:00	
US Condemns Thailand’s Deportation Of 40 Uyghurs To China	By Kunnawut Boonreak for BenarNews and Pimuk Rakkanam for RFA The United States condemned longtime ally Thailand for deporting 40 ethnic Uyghurs to China on Thursday, warning that the men risk facing torture when they return to the northeastern region of Xinjiang, which they fled more than 10 years ago. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision violated international agreements and ran counter to Thailand’s own commitment to protect human rights. Thailand also faced a barrage of criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups. The men had been held in Bangkok’s Immigration Detention Center since 2014 after attempting to escape Beijing’s persecution through Thailand. Uyghurs in China’s vast Xinjiang region have been subjected to widespread human rights abuses, including detention in massive concentration camps. Beijing denies that. Thailand also has strong ties with Beijing, the region’s dominant economic player. China is among the top trading partners and foreign investors in Thailand, and its leading source of foreign tourist arrivals. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms Thailand’s forced return of at least 40 Uyghurs to China, where they lack due process rights and where Uyghurs have faced persecution, forced labor, and torture,' Rubio said in a statement on Thursday. 'As Thailand’s longstanding ally, we are alarmed by this action, which risks running afoul of its international obligations under the U.N. Convention Against Torture and the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,' he said. 'This act runs counter to the Thai people’s longstanding tradition of protection for the most vulnerable and is inconsistent with Thailand’s commitment to protect human rights,' Rubio said. It’s unusual for the U.S. to condemn the actions of a treaty ally like Thailand is such strong terms. Ties between the two nations date back more than 200 years. At his Jan. 15 confirmation hearing to become the top U.S. diplomat, Rubio had directly called on Thailand not to deport the Uyghurs. U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Türk said the deportation is a clear violation of international human rights laws and standards. 'This violates the principle of non-refoulement for which there is a complete prohibition in cases where there is a real risk of torture, ill-treatment, or other irreparable harm upon their return,' Türk said in a statement. UN failed to protect them The Germany-based World Uyghur Congress, or WUC, said Thailand has lost credibility internationally must be held accountable for what it said was a violation of human rights. The group also blamed the U.N. refugee agency, saying it had 'failed in its mission to protect a vulnerable group exposed to great danger and to transnational repression.' WUC president Turgunjan Alawdun said the fate of the men was unclear and that 'they could be subjected to the worst possible punishment.' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates called the deportation a 'massive human rights violation.' 'As each minute passes, it becomes clearer that the Thai government has finally done the unthinkable by forcing at least 40 Uyghurs asylum seekers back to China to face torture in custody, long prison terms, and likely death,' he said in a statement. 'What’s also clear is Thai officials involved in this forced return, using blacked-out trucks and a barrage of lying denials, have the blood of these Uyghur men on their hands,' Robertson said. Lin Jian, spokesman for China’s Ministry of Affairs, told a regular press conference in Beijing on Thursday that the repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and common practices. 'It is a step taken by the two sides to jointly combat human smuggling and other cross-border crimes,' he said. 'The lawful rights and interests of individuals concerned are fully protected.' Lin went on to say that Uyghurs in Xinjiang enjoy economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. 'Some political forces and institutions fabricate and spread Xinjiang-related lies for no other reason than destabilizing Xinjiang,' he said. Reversal A rights group said in early January that reports from the men indicated that Thai authorities were preparing to deport them, but Thailand repeatedly dismissed the concerns and said there was no plan to do so. But early on Thursday, human rights activists and a Thai media outlet reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok’s main Immigration Detention Center after 2 a.m. and headed north towards the city’s Don Mueang airport. An elevated highway to the airport was blocked off to other traffic as the trucks passed, a human right activist said. Media later cited a flight tracker app as showing a chartered China Southern Airlines flight left Don Mueang at 4.48 a.m. The app did not give the flight’s destination but it later showed it had landed in Xinjiang. China later reported that 40 'illegal immigrants' had been sent from Thailand but it did not identify them as Uyghurs. On Thursday afternoon, Thai police chief Kitrat Penphet confirmed that the 40 Uyghurs had been deported. He said Chinese authorities wrote to the Thai government to assure it the men would be taken care of. 'They promised to ensure their safety and conduct health examinations when they arrive in Xinjiang,' he said. 'After the government received the letter, we considered it according to human rights principles,' Penphet said. 'Then the government held a meeting through the National Security Council, which subsequently resolved to repatriate the Uyghurs.' Kitrat said 'the extradition of illegal immigrants' was normal. 'It’s no different with the Uyghurs. How many more years should we detain them? They should be able to return home,' he said. Thailand has been holding a total of 48 Uyghurs, and the Turk said he believed eight remained in detention. Questions for government Thai opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang said the government had questions to answer. 'What is the Thai government doing? The prime minister must answer to the people urgently,' Kannavee said in a post on Facebook. 'They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long. There must be a better way out.' A Thai court has been considering a petition filed by a Thai lawyer for the men to be freed. It said last week it saw merit in the petition and had asked for more information from authorities and scheduled the next hearing for March 27. 'Thailand has laws preventing people from being sent back to face danger,' said Sunai Phasuk, a senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, referring to a 2022 law on the prevention of torture that contained a provision on non-refoulement. 'It means the government is not only violating international law but also its own domestic laws,' he said. The 48 were part of a cohort of more than 350 Uyghur men, women and children, who left China in the hope of finding resettlement abroad and were stopped in Thailand. Turkey did accept 172 of them while Thailand sent 109 of them back to China in 2015, triggering a storm of international criticism for the decision. Nontarat Phaicharoen and Jon Preechawong in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50yCbvh2Vx6BW	2025-02-27T16:39:12-08:00	
Monkeys Infected With Transmissible Diseases Are Trucked Across U...	Experimenting on monkeys is cruel—and keeping them is a threat to public health. 'Ramadewa looked at the numerous troops of monkeys. They were at ease and happy and showed their liveliness. All their movements, their noisy voices, their way of sleeping on branches made him happy just to look at them.' —Verse 151:V1, Kakawin Ramayana I saw macaques for the first time along the river's edge on the island of Borneo in 1983. I was in a boat with scientist and conservationist Dr. Biruté Galdikas on our way to the orangutan rehabilitation and research site she established on the island. I was 17, had never traveled outside the United States, and knew nothing about primates. Dr. Galdikas, who celebrated her 50th anniversary of orangutan fieldwork and conservation in 2021, took a chance on me. I spent my first few weeks learning how to move around in Borneo's tropical rainforest, trying to keep up with the orangutans, who are big, brilliant, and brightly colored apes. They are extraordinary, and taking your eyes off them is hard. Nevertheless, my attention often wandered to another of the reserve's primates—the troop of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). These slender monkeys with variegated green fur and striking facial hair bounded on all fours through the trees, with their long, slim tails acting as a counterbalance. Keystone Role in Ecosystems Macaques are seed dispersers, predators, and prey, making them a keystone species in the edge environments they occupy; remove them from the forest, and you risk a cascade of ecological consequences. I could reliably find them within half a mile of the river's edge, where they spent their days foraging, grooming, swimming, and sleeping. They also routinely wandered into our camp, easily navigating the 'edges' we had opened in the forest. The adults were fiercely protective of the infants and juveniles. The troop gathered at a large sleeping tree along the river each evening before dark. When everyone was accounted for in this troop of 30 highly social and intelligent macaques, the members would huddle together for warmth, safety, and companionship. The months I spent in Borneo collecting observational data on macaques eventually led me into an academic and research career. Throughout this time, I focused on how infectious diseases move between human and macaque populations and the consequences for primate conservation and public health. Members of the genus Macaca, with their unsurpassed ability to inhabit the edges that humans create when we alter the environment, are the most geographically diverse and successful nonhuman primate group in the world. Multiple species of macaques are naturally distributed throughout Asia. Macaques have also successfully colonized Mauritius and Florida, while North Africa is home to a single species known as Barbary macaques. Exploitation for Biomedical Research The primate biomedical research community has relentlessly targeted three species of macaques: long-tailed, rhesus, and pigtailed. Ironically, macaques' remarkable ecological and behavioral adaptability has increased their visibility, ultimately putting their lives at risk. Countries like the U.S. are increasingly using them in experiments to advance human health. However, primates caught up in the experimentation pipeline have consistently proven to be poor models for human health research. One reason for this is that their biology differs significantly from ours. Furthermore, the presence of unintended and/or undetected pathogens and the immune-crushing stress of captivity distort results, making data unreliable. Decades of primate research have failed to deliver meaningful advancements for human health, while modern, human-relevant methods are proving far more effective and ethical. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) database, more than 1.5 million long-tailed, rhesus, and pigtailed macaques have been exported from Asia and Mauritius to laboratories around the world since 1975. In 2022, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species elevated long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques to Endangered. The Cruelty of Capture and Transport These monkeys have been relentlessly trapped in urban and semi-urban areas. They have been grabbed as their sleeping trees were cut down and netted as they tried to swim away. Entire troops have been captured after being isolated in the one tree that remained in a crop field. Untold numbers of adult macaques have been beaten to death as they tried desperately to hold onto their infants or protect their friends while they were being captured to be used for experimentation. More deaths followed as they were stuffed into rice sacks, wire bags, or wooden boxes after they were captured. The 1.5 million exported macaques were the 'survivors' of these ordeals. The actual number of macaques extracted from Asia and Mauritius is much larger; captive-born and wild-born macaques form the 'breeding stock' of the 'monkey farms' in Asia and Mauritius. The stress of capture, the horrific conditions in which the macaques are kept, and their exposure to pathogens while in captivity have led many of them to die from disease. These monkeys are then 'replaced' with more wild-caught macaques. In January 2022, a truck transporting over a hundred macaques crashed in Danville, Pennsylvania. The macaques had traveled nearly 10,000 miles from Mauritius. Images of the cramped, airless wooden crates used for transport have exposed this industry's cruelty, secrecy, greed, and danger. The crash was so violent that some crates burst open, and three monkeys escaped into the surrounding area. Representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did a risk assessment and decided that the three escaped macaques be shot on sight. News coverage of the situation spread around the world. People wanted to know where the monkeys had come from, where they were going, if they carried diseases, and if there was anything to fear. The CDC's lack of transparency about the status of the surviving monkeys or even the locationof the CDC-approved quarantine facility to which they were headed is disturbing. The CDC reports that between 2013 and 2023, more than 285,000 macaques were imported into the U.S. These monkeys arrived by plane in hundreds of shipments. From the port of entry, they were loaded into trucks and sent to the approved quarantine sites for a mandatory 31 days of isolation, testing, and observation. Public Health Risks Before 1975, there was no federally mandated quarantine program for imported primates despite the arrival of primates infected with viral hemorrhagic fevers, tuberculosis, deadly diarrheal diseases, fatal diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, and herpes B—a zoonotic macaque virus. However, the CDC's mandated quarantine, which has not changed significantly over the past decades, still only requires that imported primates be screened for tuberculosis and 'monitored for signs of illness that could represent a zoonotic disease (a disease that can spread from animals to humans).' Not all the monkeys make it out of quarantine alive, and tuberculosis infections that the CDC screens for are often missed and show up months or years later, threatening public health and further undermining the utility of these monkeys as biomedical models. Post-quarantine, the surviving monkeys are dispersed to commercial facilities and laboratories around the country, all too often still infected with diverse strains of tuberculosis or deadly bacterial pathogens that the CDC admits cannot be detected with its established protocols. Certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs) that PETA obtained from agriculture departments in numerous states give a further glimpse into the extent of monkey transport across the U.S. CVIs are required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture when monkeys are transported across state lines. PETA has pieced together a monkey transport map. Each line represents the journey the monkeys made between the lab, breeder, or importer that sold them and the facility that purchased them. PETA has yet to uncover more routes, many of which have been used multiple times since 2018. Pause for a moment and consider the magnitude and cost of this monkey madness: The next disaster like the one that happened in Danville, Pennsylvania, in which a truck crashed while transporting monkeys could happen in your community. No one is safe—the monkeys are on the move even before they arrive in the U.S. Separated from their family and friends packed into small wooden crates, they are terrified, cold, and hungry. Some die in transit as they are moved by trucks and planes across the globe. In these vulnerable and stressed conditions, they are likely immunocompromised, increasing the risk that they will shed pathogens that can cause human diseases. Even the experimenters have acknowledged that the large colony of monkeys at their facilities—in places such as Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina, and California—threaten public health. Legal and Ethical Challenges In late 2022, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice unveiled indictments stemming from a five-year undercover investigation in Cambodia. The operation uncovered a large-scale international scheme in which tens of thousands of wild-caught long-tailed macaques were illegally smuggled into the United States under the guise of being captive-bred. This 'monkey-laundering' operation not only violated wildlife trafficking laws but also exposed the grave consequences of such illegal trade and the billion-dollar industry backing it. The capture and trafficking of wild monkeys inflicts horrific suffering on the animals, threatens wild populations with extinction, and compromises scientific research by introducing undocumented and potentially sick animals into the primate experimentation pipeline. Macaques are ostensibly being rounded up from forests and urban areas to provide us with lifesaving treatments and vaccines. But it doesn't work that way—macaques aren't furry little humans with long tails. Their immune systems and biology are very different from ours. Despite decades of promises and hundreds of thousands of dead monkeys, experiments using monkeys have not resulted in effective vaccines for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, or other dreaded human diseases. COVID-19 experiments have shown the scientific community how irrelevant and often misleading monkey studies are. Between 2008 and 2019, more than 700,000 'specimens' (i.e., blood, tissue, and body parts) from an unknown number of long-tailed macaques were exported from Asia—this is in addition to the 450,000 live long-tailed macaques who were shipped out for use in biomedical experiments. A study published in February 2022 concluded that the extraction of macaques from Asia for use in biomedical research is a multibillion-dollar industry. A Call for Change However, progress has been made in the right direction. As of March 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has halted the importation of monkeys from Cambodia captured from the wild for U.S. laboratories. Imports are effectively suspended for up to two years, as the FWS now requires a DNA test—yet to be developed—to prove that monkeys were bred in captivity, ensuring protection for these animals in the meantime. Still, this is a small victory, and much more remains to be done. Macaques are extraordinarily resilient animals, but we're pushing them over the edge. Experimenting on them is cruel and leads to unnecessary suffering and death. Our abuse of these animals needs to end.

Portugal And Spain’s Different Bites On Meat Consumption	By Maria Simon Arboleas and Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro (EurActiv) -- The Iberian Peninsula is a culinary powerhouse – think Spanish jamón and Portuguese bacalhau – and ranks among the EU’s top consumers of meat. But as the global debate over animal products heats up, along with the climate, Spain and Portugal are taking very different bites out of the issue. With the livestock sector accounting for over 80% of the EU’s total agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the World Health Organisation (WHO) calling for a shift to 'more plant-based diets,' eating habits have become highly political. The EU is also heavily relianton imports of protein crops, such as soybeans, to produce feeds for animals. In this context, the Iberian Peninsula provides an interesting laboratory of trends. Portugal is taking a significant step towards a greener diet: the country is set to become the second EU nation, after Denmark, to launch a national strategy promoting plant-based foods. As part of its newly released national energy and climate plan, Lisbon vowed to promote a 'low carbon diet' with less consumption of animal proteins to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector and promote healthier nutrition. 'It’s very bold,' said Joana Oliveira, director of ProVeg Portugal. Even more striking, Portugal’s government is led by the centre-right People’s Party, part of the European People’s Party (EPP) – a group that has long resisted even engaging in the debate over a reduction of animal protein for sustainability or health reasons. The political climate isn’t exactly friendly to change, either. Under pressure from the EPP and farmer protests, the Commission shelved plans for an EU-wide sustainable diets framework last year. More recently, an EU advisory group called for more plant-protein production and less reliance on animal products, but the Commission largely ignored the advice in a strategy released last week, avoiding explicit commitments to a plant-based protein strategy. Portuguese MEP Paulo Do Nascimiento Cabral, from the EPP group, told Euractiv that Brussels could draw inspiration from Lisbon's approach, which he said was rooted in a 'balanced and integrative nutritional policy.' Meat and identity politics Just across Portugal's border, in Spain – one of Europe’s last left-wing bastions – things couldn’t be more different. The debate over meat’s environmental impact only hit the mainstream in 2021. Spain’s socialist PM Pedro Sánchez publicly contradicted his consumer minister, Alberto Garzón, for slamming factory farming’s environmental impact and negative health implications of high meat consumption – but never went as far as calling for vegetarian diets. Sánchez’s categorical response still lingers in Spaniards' minds as one of the most iconic quotes of his tenure: 'For me, a perfectly cooked medium-rare chuletón [steak] is unbeatable.' Farming minister Luis Planas doubled down and said comments on the health effects of meat are 'as wrong as sugar kills.' For Samuel Brea, a Spanish researcher on public perceptions of agricultural markets at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO), Europe’s most progressive government taking a conservative stance on food is deeply tied to identity politics. 'Meat is part of the national identity (…) if you don’t eat jamón, it’s almost as if you’re not Spanish,' Brea said. 'And that’s a tough thing to challenge, especially in politics -there’s very little to gain.' But it’s not just about Spanish identity, Brea added. Meat-based foods are also deeply embedded in regional identities, from veal cachopo in Asturias to fuet in Catalonia. 'I do think politics here does a good job of reflecting society. We’re not really in a situation where Spanish society is demanding more action,' said Brea. Labelling pioneers Far from supporting a shift towards a more plant-based diet, Madrid has only chosen to timidly acknowledge some consumer trends that favour alternatives to meat and dairy in its new National Food Strategy, which was unveiled in December. The blueprint notes that Spanish consumers are increasingly picking meat alternatives, driven by 'health, environmental, and animal welfare concerns,' with a striking 55% rise in products like tofu and seitan since 2018. The only mention of a greener diet is a subtle acknowledgement that the emerging plant-based food sector 'must have its place in the market' due to rising demand, but it does not commit to boosting domestic production or improving access to such products. While some EU countries lead the push for plant-based foods, Madrid has pioneered the opposite, being among the first to impose legal restrictions on using terms such as burger or sausage for veggie products that mimic them. Long before France’s court saga over the veggie steak ban, Madrid passed a law in 2014 defining more than 80 meat products, effectively banning their use for plant-based alternatives. Now, Spain is planning to go even further and assess whether it is necessary to modernise the legislation after a recent ruling from the EU’s top court on the matter, sources of the Spanish Agriculture Ministry told Euractiv, The secret lies in the framing For Brea, the key to preventing a reactionary response to measures like Portugal’s lies in how the changes are framed – notably, avoiding presenting the meat sector as the culprit. In this line, MEP Do Nascimiento Cabral said that his country would ensure 'the coexistence of diverse food sources' and not exclude meat and fish, which he said were 'essential components' of the country's cultural and culinary heritage. The Portuguese government pledges to encourage the production and consumption of leguminous crops, saying this could help ensure 'crop self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.' As the latter concept has gained political traction in the EU, its mention could be read as a wink to farmers’ role in feeding the country. NGOs also present the upcoming plan as an opportunity for the agricultural sector. 'Legumes are deeply rooted in Portugal’s culinary culture, yet the country produces only 14% of the legumes it consumes,' said Oliveira. 'This presents a clear opportunity for farmers to expand production.' But Portuguese farmers are not so happy with the government's wording. While welcoming measures to increase the production of plant proteins, the Confederation of Portuguese Farmers said it rejects this is done 'to the detriment' of animal proteins. While waiting for the new strategy to materialise, Oliveira urges an overdue update to the country’s 20-year-old dietary guidelines to include alternatives like tofu and plant-based drinks. Elsewhere in the EU, nutrition recommendations have already moved in this direction. Meanwhile, Brea notes that this could be a chance to recover Spanish food traditions. 'Tradition doesn't have to be chorizo and morcilla [black pudding], but a chickpea stew or fried aubergines from Córdoba are tradition at its best.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50483ZgXm-4UF	2025-02-27T16:33:30-08:00	
The Priorities For Rebuilding Syria’s Economy – OpEd	After more than a decade of war, destruction and economic collapse in Syria, the country’s new government faces an urgent and formidable challenge: rebuilding the nation’s shattered economy. Years of conflict have devastated infrastructure, displaced millions and left the country struggling with widespread poverty, inflation and a crumbling financial system. For Syria to move forward and achieve long-term stability, economic recovery must be a top priority. One of the most significant obstacles to rebuilding Syria’s economy is the severe impact of Western sanctions. These restrictions, imposed over the years due to the war and political developments, have crippled Syria’s ability to trade, attract foreign investment and access global financial networks. Lifting these sanctions — a process started by the EU this week — is essential for economic revitalization, as it would allow Syria to engage in international commerce, rebuild industries and improve the daily lives of its citizens. Regional support, particularly from Arab nations, is playing a crucial role in assisting Syria’s recovery, with efforts focused on restoring trade ties, providing investment and helping Syrians regain financial stability. Beyond lifting sanctions and securing regional partnerships, Syria’s government must implement comprehensive economic strategies to stimulate growth, create jobs and restore essential services. Revitalizing key industries, rebuilding infrastructure and stabilizing the Syrian pound are necessary steps to ensure a sustainable recovery. The Syrian economy has suffered one of the most severe contractions in modern history. According to reports, Syria’s gross domestic product shrank by 84 percent between 2010 and 2024. The nation’s currency has drastically devalued, leading to hyperinflation and making everyday goods unaffordable for most citizens. In 2023, it was reported that more than 90 percent of Syrians were living below the poverty line, struggling to afford food, medicine and other basic necessities. The country’s energy sector, once a crucial part of the economy, has suffered immense losses. Oil production has declined significantly, forcing Syria to rely on expensive fuel imports. Additionally, the destruction of infrastructure, including roads, power plants and water systems, has made industrial recovery even more challenging. Without a functioning economic system, businesses cannot operate efficiently and foreign investors will remain hesitant to engage with Syria due to the risks involved. As a result, one of the most pressing steps toward economic recovery is the lifting of Western sanctions, which have placed severe restrictions on Syria’s ability to rebuild. These sanctions have frozen Syrian assets abroad, blocked financial transactions and limited the country’s access to international markets. Lifting these sanctions would have an immediate and significant impact on Syria’s economy. It would allow businesses to engage in international trade, making it easier to import essential goods and the raw materials needed for reconstruction. Additionally, easing financial restrictions would enable Syrians to receive remittances from relatives abroad — an important source of income for many families who are struggling to survive. There have been discussions within the EU about easing sanctions and some were lifted on Monday, including restrictions on state-owned banks and investments in Syria’s energy and electricity sectors. These steps are crucial, but a broader lifting of sanctions is necessary to create real economic momentum. To rebuild its economy, Syria must attract investment, particularly in key sectors such as infrastructure, energy and manufacturing. Infrastructure reconstruction is essential for restoring normal economic activity, as roads, ports and communication networks are necessary for trade and industry to function. Investment in the energy sector is also critical. Syria’s electricity grid has been severely damaged, leading to frequent power shortages that make industrial and commercial activities difficult. By securing investment in power plants and alternative energy sources, the government can provide reliable electricity to businesses and households, improving overall economic stability. Manufacturing and agriculture are two other sectors that require substantial investment. Restoring factories and supporting small businesses can help create jobs and stimulate local economies. Similarly, rebuilding the agricultural sector will ensure food security and reduce the need for costly imports. In addition, encouraging both domestic and foreign investors to participate in Syria’s reconstruction will require significant policy reforms. The government must create a business-friendly environment by ensuring legal protections for investors, streamlining bureaucratic processes and guaranteeing stability in financial regulations. Without such reforms, potential investors may remain reluctant to engage with Syria’s economy. A fully functioning transport network is also vital for economic recovery. The destruction of roads, bridges, railways and airports has made it difficult to move goods and people efficiently, further hindering trade and investment. Rebuilding highways and roads would allow agricultural and industrial products to reach markets more easily, reducing costs and increasing profitability for businesses. Restoring railways would enhance trade efficiency, making it easier for goods to be transported across the country and into neighboring markets. Additionally, reopening and modernizing Syria’s major ports would boost international trade, allowing the country to export its products and receive essential imports more efficiently. Investment in transport infrastructure will also have long-term economic benefits by creating jobs, stimulating demand for construction materials and improving the overall efficiency of business operations. The collapse of the Syrian pound has led to inflation, making daily life increasingly difficult for citizens. Restoring confidence in the national currency is essential for economic recovery. This requires sound financial policies that promote stability, control inflation and encourage investment. Encouraging the use of banking services within Syria and strengthening financial institutions will further contribute to economic stability. Many Syrians have lost trust in the banking system due to war-related economic instability, so rebuilding confidence in financial institutions is a necessary step toward recovery. Finally, Syria’s economy can greatly benefit from increased regional and international trade. Restoring trade partnerships with neighboring countries and reestablishing commercial routes can help Syria reintegrate into global markets. Several Arab nations have already shown an interest in helping Syria regain economic stability. Strengthening these ties can lead to trade agreements that facilitate the movement of goods, reduce tariffs and encourage business collaborations. By improving its trade relations with regional partners, Syria can gain access to new markets and benefit from foreign investments that support key industries. The reopening of trade routes, border crossings and customs facilities will be crucial for Syria’s economic recovery. Facilitating smoother trade transactions with neighboring countries will help businesses thrive and create new opportunities for economic growth. In sum, Syria’s economic challenges are immense, but they are not insurmountable. The key to recovery lies in a multifaceted approach that includes lifting sanctions, attracting investment, rebuilding infrastructure, stabilizing the currency and strengthening trade relations. By prioritizing economic growth and implementing sound policies, Syria’s new government can create a foundation for stability, prosperity and a better future for its people. The road to recovery will not be easy, but with the right strategies and international cooperation Syria can rebuild its economy and offer its citizens the opportunity for a more secure and prosperous life.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50x6KlferGs33	2025-02-27T16:14:08-08:00	
Spanish Bishops: Conditions For Pope Francis To Resign Are Not Me...	By Nicolás de Cárdenas The secretary-general and spokesman for the Spanish Bishops’ Conference (CEE, by its Spanish acronym), Bishop Francisco César García Magán, expressed his conviction that the conditions for the resignation of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized for 14 days due to health problems, have not been met. Asked at the end of the meeting of the conference’s standing committee, García explained that the resignation of the pontiff is provided for in Canon 332.2 of the Code of Canon Law, with the only requirement that 'it be free and be formally expressed.' García also pointed out that it is public knowledge that in 2013, the year he became pope, Francis gave the then-Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, 'a signed letter with his formal resignation in case of impediment.' 'I signed it and told him: ‘In case of impediment due to medical reasons or whatever, here is my resignation. You already have it.’ I don't know who Cardinal Bertone gave it to, but I gave it to him when he was secretary of state,' the pontiff revealed to the Spanish newspaper ABC in 2022. The CEE spokesman pointed out in this regard that 'these conditions are not being met because the impediment to which the pope was referring was when it is linked to a mental limitation, a mental impediment. What the pope has now are illnesses typical of age.' 'As he has said on occasion, the Church is not governed with the knees but with the head, with the help of the Holy Spirit,' added the prelate, who, after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, considered that, if Pope Francis made the same decision, 'it would not be new.' The bishops’ spokesman also stressed that 'we are not in a pre-conclave period; far from it' and made an appeal to the people of God to 'intensify prayer for the healing of this pope' and to do so 'with affection and communion.' This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE507y51QE7HLhO	2025-02-27T16:08:59-08:00	
Counting 100 Blessing A Day Enriches Your Life – OpEd	Psalm 100:4 says: 'Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to God and praise his name.' And Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 responds: 'I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their work—this is a gift of God.' A daily counting of our blessings is an age-old religious advice that actually does help improve our mood and mindset. One reason that the blessings strategy works is because it begins to counter the hard-wired tendency we have as humans to notice and remember the negative more than the positive. There's a strong evolutionary reason why we think this way: it's vital for our survival. So, we hardly notice if a cat is following us up the street, but if it was a lion we certainly would. Our brains are primed for danger in order to keep us safe. Which is good, except that in a world of constant news of war, suffering, hatred and division – all of which we can instantly access on our phones – this negativity bias can overwhelm us with unneeded negative worries and anxiety. One way of influencing people to think positively about their lives is to teach them the importance of saying blessings for the many things they experience, both in their ordinary daily and weekly life, and at occasional extraordinary times. It is a Mitsvah (Jewish religious duty) to say blessings at every meal over food and drink. Every morning when we awake it is a Mitsvah to say several blessings because various parts of our mind and body still work. During daily prayer there are 18 blessings, and there are blessings for the weekly celebration of the Sabbath. There are also blessings to say for special occasions, for our sages urged us to thank God for as many blessings as we can, since the more blessings you can say, the more blessed you are. Indeed, Jewish tradition maintains that everyone who is able to say 100 blessings a day is truly blessed. Among the special occasion blessings there is a blessing for seeing a non-Jewish sage and another one for seeing a Jewish sage. There is a blessing for hearing good news and another one for hearing bad news in accordance with Rabbi Huna's view that we need both joy and suffering to experience 'very good'. Here are a few examples of blessings for special occasions: On beholding fragrant trees:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, creator of fragrant trees. On seeing trees in blossom:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, whose world lacks nothing we need, who has fashioned good creatures and lovely trees that enchant the heart. On seeing an unusual looking person:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, who makes every person unique. On the Divine value of pluralism and human variety when seeing a large number of people:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, the Sage of esoterica, for just as no person's opinion is like that of another, so their faces are different from one another. On seeing evidence of charitable efforts:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who clothes the naked. On seeing people who overcome adversity:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who gives strength to the weary. Understanding that suffering, sorrow and even death do not nullify the basic goodness of the world God has created, and training oneself to see all the blessings that surround us, are two of the many ways the Torah tradition in Judaism teaches Jews to have a positive and optimistic view of both the natural world and the human world we live in. But although individuals can train themselves to make their lives joyful and holy, some would say that civilization has corrupted the world of nature with sin, lust, greed, violence and immorality. It is true that prior to the creation of self conscious moral creatures the world was free of evil. However, the world also lacked good for there were no creatures who could choose to do good and not evil. (Angels in Jewish thought have no free will and are thus inferior to humans.) It is possible to think of nature as always pure and modern civilization as always a corrupting influence. Indeed, this seems to be a popular view among many western ecology activists. An important Jewish teaching concerns the outcome of human history. Most ancient philosophies saw human history as cyclical. Others saw the cycle as a declining one, with each age followed by a more degenerate one. The present age was often dire and getting worse. The Prophets of Israel (from the 10th century to the 5th century B.C.E.), especially Isaiah, introduced God's assurance of a Messianic Age to come when all nations will achieve international peace, prosperity and justice. How can people, especially Jews, believe in a Messianic Age after all the world went through in the 20th century? Human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last century than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations exploded and birthrates declined. Technology produced both worldwide prosperity and pollution at the same time. Knowing all this, how can we look upon the future with optimistic hope? Are the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday; or are both occurring concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Many who believe in the Biblical vision of a Messianic Age use the insights of the Prophets of Israel to provide guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals sweeping society. Usually it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized. I will focus on some positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with a positive messianic vision of the Jewish Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the transformation of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age.The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. The Messiah refers to an agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (and there may be two or three such agents) will be a human being, a descendant of King David, with great leadership qualities similar to Prophets Moses or Muhammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. Where does a Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) Now that a large part of the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel, and resurrected a Jewish State, one might think that rebuilding a temple of the site where Solomon originally built one almost 3,000 years ago, would be relatively simple. But a Muslim Shrine, the Dome of the Rock, presently occupies the site. Often erroneously called the Mosque of Omar, it is not a mosque and it was not built by Omar. It was built in 691 by Abd-Al-Malik and it is regarded by Muslims as the third holiest site in the world. Any attempt to replace the Dome of the Rock would provoke a Muslim Holy War of cataclysmic proportions. There is, however, open land on the Temple Mount, and a small broadcast Jewish house of worship could be built 600 feet north of the Masjid al-Aqsa, near the Dome of the Rock provided that Muslims would cooperate. Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important. Anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its leadership to be the Messiah and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5), 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him. For it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings the Messiah will surely have arrived, and God's Kingdom will be established. This is the most optimistic and positive vision one can have and one that we can all work for together. As Prophet Isaiah 41:10 says: 'So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.' And best of all Proverbs 11:25 states: 'A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.' Counting blessings leads to generosity, which results in personal and communal growth. As we express gratitude, God uses us to bless others, creating a cycle of mutual enrichment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE509Zq1YHa6Gi2	2025-02-27T16:03:31-08:00	
Improving Relationships Between Dads And Daughters… It’s A Walk I...	A simple walk in the park could hold the key to unlocking a close and loving relationship between fathers and daughters, a new study has shown. Research carried out by the University of Essex’s Dr John Day has found taking part in or just discussing physical activity provides a common ground for the two to develop deep emotional connections and transform the stereotype of distant dads. The study found that a societal shift in what it means to be a dad, combined with increased focus to exercise to maintain health, has led to physical activity providing a platform for the relationship to thrive. Dr Day, of the School of Health and Social Care, said: 'My research shows daughters have always sought for a way to grow closer to their dads, while this has only recently become more of a focus for fathers. 'From a father's perspective, physical activity can simultaneously function as a method of upholding a masculine identity while performing one-to-one parenting, so they feel much more comfortable in this environment.' The study, published in Families, Relationships and Societies journal, involved interviews with 14 women born between 1950 and 1994. Those born in the 1950s largely discussed how their dads fulfilled the role as the provider for the family, and remained somewhat on the periphery as a parent. But daughters born in the 1980s and 1990s were raised in social conditions that allowed them to realise and build more emotionally connected relationships with their fathers. They recalled stories of how they had bonded with their dads while taking part in activities such as walking, swimming and cycling. Both the health and enjoyment benefits of physical activity were raised by the younger women taking part in the study, but some also spoke of how they distanced themselves from any attempts from their dad to make the activities competitive. Despite the transformation, those interviewed indicated the relationship between daughters and dads was still structured around the preferences of the latter. 'Key factors associated with fatherhood that have enabled this transformation are the increased prominence of involved fatherhood ideals and physical activity becoming a parenting and health-related practice that fathers feel comfortable performing and talking about,' said Dr Day. 'Crucial to this is the UK context, where intimate interdependence is indicative of sought after relationships and a public health context where physical activity participation is championed to reduce non-communicable disease.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50zXUzSm7OO-v	2025-02-27T15:59:46-08:00	
Iran’s Unconventional Naval Platforms – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu Iran’s Drone Carrier Program: An Overview To help address its conventional military industrial disadvantages, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been converting commercial vessels into drone carriers and naval missile launch platforms. Tehran has outfitted basic commercial ships with carrier decks and asymmetric offensive weapons such as combat drones, bomb-laden unmanned boats, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. These new platforms appear capable of wreaking havoc in the region. Since Tehran modifies these vessels with predominantly commercial components, traditional arms control measures are ineffective at restricting their construction. While Tehran cannot match its adversaries’ technologically superior aircraft carriers and helicopter landing docks, these makeshift vessels allow Iran to imperil regional maritime shipping and threaten the United States’ naval presence in the Middle East. Iran Commissions Its First Drone Carrier In early February 2025, Iran’s first drone carrier, the IRIS Shahid Bagheri, officially joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy. The inauguration ceremony was held in the city of Bandar Abbas, strategically positioned on the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s new naval platform might look technologically and structurally inferior to modern aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels. But a careful assessment of the vessel’s design philosophy reveals that Iran has taken the lessons from the success of its Yemen-based Houthi proxy and implemented them at a larger scale. Like the Houthi arsenal, these makeshift drone carriers are designed to create tactical advantages and strategic leverage. The Shahid Bagheri was formerly a container ship, the Perarin. With a length of 787 feet and a takeoff runway of approximately 570 feet, the Shahid Bagheri is well-equipped to support a variety of Iranian drones, including loitering munitions. Vertical takeoff platforms can launch from and land on the carrier without any special modifications. The vessel also boasts a unique design feature: an angled flight deck, akin to a ski jump, that points toward the vessel’s starboard edge. This design allows the flight deck to extend beyond the Perarin’s chassis, lengthening the runway and allowing larger drones to launch from the carrier. Nonetheless, satellite imagery shows that the design of the carrier’s flight deck leaves little room for heavy aircraft recovery operations, since any landing errors could damage the vessel. It is unknown whether the craft has barrier recovery or arrested landing features to protect the ship and crew in touchdown and abort incidents. A Closer Look at the Shahid Bagheri The Shahid Bagheri provides its operators with a broad range of robotic warfare options. In her debut, she carried two subscale variants of the Qaher unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), one 60 percent smaller and the other 25 percent smaller than the Qaher’s original airframe. While it is not known whether the larger variant managed to take off from the platform, the smaller Qaher launched successfully. The Ababil-3, which can carry guided munitions or function as a kamikaze drone, also took off successfully from the carrier. The Atlas sub-variant of the Ababil-3 has a fortified airframe that allows it to carry a greater payload. Notably, the Houthis have used a kamikaze variant of the Ababil family, the Qasef. The Shahid Bagheri also had a Mohajer-6 UAV onboard during its launch ceremony. Designed by Qods Aviation Industries, the Mohajer-6 drone incorporates composite plastic materials to reduce its weight. The aircraft is equipped with a laser rangefinder and electro-optical infrared sensors. It can conduct automated takeoffs and landings and carry jamming and electromagnetic sensor payloads, important capabilities for combating electronic warfare operations. Finally, it has a line-of-sight control range of 120 miles and a ceiling of 18,000 feet, which lets it evade the engagement envelopes of most low-altitude short-range air defenses. Most analysts estimate that the drone can fly for around 12 hours, though some have reported it can last as long as 24 hours in the air. The Mohajer-6 is also the first variant of its class certified for guided munitions like Qaem-1 glide bombs. The Russian military used a limited number of Mohajer-6 drones in Ukraine to coordinate attacks, particularly over Odesa. The Shahid Bagheri can also launch Shahed baseline loitering munitions, unmanned surface vehicles for asymmetric naval warfare operations, and, theoretically, unmanned underwater vehicles. The IRGC has used the invaluable combat experience it gained from the Houthis’ drone and missile strikes against the US Navy’s assets in the region to develop these disruptive capabilities. With its drone carrier fleet, the IRGC can replicate the Houthis’ highly attritional combat operations on a larger scale. Iran’s floating bases can attack targets with mixed strike packages consisting of naval drones, loitering munitions and aerial drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, and underwater robotic warfare platforms. Such an arsenal would threaten any maritime grouping in the Middle East. Seaborne Missile Platforms Iran’s power projection fleet can also carry anti-ship, air-defense, and land-attack missiles. The Shahid Mahdavi, a floating missile platform, was built on the container ship Sarvin and is roughly the same length as the Shahid Bagheri. This platform features helicopter pads along with ballistic missile launch positions. In 2024, the vessel test-fired Fateh-baseline ballistic missiles, likely the longer-range Dezful variant. The Houthis demonstrated that coastal anti-ship ballistic missiles can be effective even against moving targets. A floating Iranian missile and drone carrier would stress regional air and missile defenses to a considerably more worrisome extent. Apart from the Shahid Bagheri drone carrier and Shahid Mahdavi missile platform, the Islamic Republic fields the Makran, formerly a crude oil tanker, as a forward-base ship with rotary-wing naval aviation support features. Tehran also uses the Shahid Roudaki, another former container vessel, as a drone and missile launch platform. Tehran’s fast-growing fleet of floating drone and missile carriers is boosted by spy vessels such as the Saviz and the Behshad, which were also converted from container vessels. Equipped with intelligence capabilities and command-control features, these platforms play a vital role in providing Iran’s drone-carriers and floating missile bases with targeting data in real time. The Geopolitical Impact of Iran’s Disruptive Naval Capabilities In its 2019 report on Iranian military power, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) concluded that unmanned aerial vehicles are Iran’s most rapidly advancing air power capability. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 vindicated the DIA’s findings, as the Kremlin pounded Ukraine with Iran-made Shahed loitering munitions. The Houthi militia, meanwhile, showed what Iranian anti-ship missile technologies can accomplish when used alongside robotic naval warfare assets. The DIA assessed that Houthi activities in the Red Sea reduced maritime traffic in the region by over 90 percent. This affected the global economy severely, as 15 percent of global shipping transits the area, and alternate routes add roughly 11,000 nautical miles and $1 million of fuel per voyage. The Houthis’ attacks also proved lucrative: the militia allegedly made $2 billion per year by extorting and strong-arming shipping companies. Iran’s drone carriers could do even greater damage to global shipping and maritime trade, particularly if the IRGC coordinates with its Houthi proxies. Worse, Iran’s drone and missile capabilities are more potent than they have ever been. Lessons from Yemen and Ukraine have provided Tehran with invaluable real-world knowledge. And because Iran has diversified its logistics network with commercially available components, traditional arms control frameworks can do little to stop this threat. Many in the West have long thought that dialogue and diplomacy could tame Tehran’s hostile ambitions. Shahed drones buzzing over Ukrainian skies, Houthi projectiles targeting Red Sea shipping, and Iranian proxies sowing instability throughout the Middle East proved these assumptions to be groundless. Absent a more realistic Western approach to Iran, Tehran’s new unconventional naval platforms threaten to further destabilize the region.

US Paris Climate Agreement Exit Will Hit Africa Hard – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo On his first day in office, United States (US) President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw his country from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement. This latest plunge of the US climate change rollercoaster may be the most impactful yet. The Paris Agreement was initially met with resistance from the US, followed by enthusiasm. Under George HW Bush, a strong environmental agenda was supported at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, followed by a unanimous Senate rejection of Kyoto Protocol ratification during the Bill Clinton era. Then there was the first Paris Agreement withdrawal during Trump’s first term, followed by an enthusiastic return under Joe Biden. The latest withdrawal will take effect in one year and continue for at least three more, depending on the 2028 US presidential election outcome. Unlike the previous exit, which lasted only 107 days before Biden rejoined the agreement in 2021, there is now a reasonable time for significant harm to global climate action efforts. These impacts will be felt at multiple levels and in four main areas. The first is direct funding support. In its continued moves to weaken the United Nations system, US support for other countries and non-state actors to fully implement the Paris Agreement will be limited or seized altogether. Unlike the US’ previous exit, there is now enough time for significant harm to global climate action efforts An early casualty might be developed countries' US$300 billion pledge at COP29 in Baku. This may extend to the US being a lower-profile player in replenishing global funds like the Green Climate Fund to the tune of US$4 billion, and the new Loss and Damage Fund. The US’ dismissive stance on climate change, combined with Trump’s insistence that North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries increase their defence spending amidst heightened global insecurity, may see climate funding reduced in the developing world. This has grave implications for the mitigation and adaptation ambitions, and in particular, the needs of African countries. An example is the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) which facilitate the movement to low-carbon growth in Africa. Two African countries, South Africa and Senegal, have operational JETPs, and pilot plans are underway for three more – Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco. The outlook for these energy transitions is grave in the short term, as the US has, to date, been a principal partner. The second impact of the US withdrawal is the gap it will leave in global institutions. After climate change sceptic David Malpass was appointed World Bank president in Trump’s first term, Biden used the position's vacancy to install climate action embracing Ajay Banga as head. Many progressive policy changes followed, including loan and grant packages for the close-down and repurposing of coal-fired power stations in South Africa. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners The World Bank Detox Development report is also highly innovative. It proposes redirecting already dedicated fossil fuel subsidies towards low-carbon energy sources, keeping the subsidies under the energy security banner – but with a renewables and nuclear character. There may also be funding possibilities for the damage caused by climate disasters, and investments in climate adaptation to help vulnerable communities cope. Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ mantra and its supporting measures put this World Bank proposal at risk. Recent COPs and the 2023 Climate Finance Summit have made it clear that national and especially multilateral development banks should lead the global climate finance drive. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners. Hopefully, there will be sufficient pushback from the European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank and the New Development Bank (BRICS Bank). If that happens, the African Development Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa may be encouraged to continue their climate aspirations. Commercial banks are also vulnerable to policy shifts back to fossil fuel investments. A market opening for fossil fuel chain investments, initially in the US and then beyond, could see the formula for easier profits compared to renewable energy investments becoming attractive to commercial bank investors and shareholders. Key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at this year’s BRICS and G20 summits The third effect of the US’ Paris Agreement exit relates to the country’s role as an active negotiator in COP meetings while its withdrawal is pending. Given that it questions the UN’s value generally and its climate position in particular, the US could retard already sluggish efforts to secure more commitment for mitigation targets, adaptation financing and reasonable compensation for loss and damage. This will affect poor countries the most, whose contributions to the global carbon budget are negligible, if any. The impact will go beyond lower levels of financial aid, and into the domains of reduced technical assistance and capacity building. Africa – a vulnerable region with the highest concentration of least developed countries globally – will feel the brunt immediately. Fourth, Trump’s stance on the climate issue has disturbingly garnered support in other countries. The most visible to date has been Argentina, where President Javier Milei, a self-declared Trump ally, has said he will consider leaving the Paris Agreement. Others may follow, weakening the climate multilateral platform. The best chance to get this train back on the rails is at COP30 in Belém, Brazil in November. There is still room and hope for a more robust agreement on climate action. To achieve this, key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at plurilateral forums in 2025 – the BRICS summit under the Brazilian presidency in July and the G20 summit under South Africa’s presidency in November. The G20 Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors meeting this week in South Africa will also be significant. The alternative is reduced climate action and a faster slide to global climate catastrophe – with Africa and the developing world as the first victims.

Malaysia’s Reform Aspirations Clashed With Political Realities In...	By Kai Ostwald After focusing on political survival in 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim entered 2024 with ambitious plans to restore Malaysia’s standing as one of Asia’s leading economies and middle powers. Economic growth exceeded expectations — fuelled in part by a surge in foreign investment — particularly in the semiconductor sector, the Malaysian ringgit saw a modest recovery and Anwar’s active diplomacy elevated Malaysia’s global profile. Yet 2024 also demonstrated that ambition alone is insufficient to overcome Malaysia’s entrenched political divisions. Anwar’s government, constrained by an unwieldy coalition and the volatile pull of identity politics, struggled to advance significant reforms. Race and religion remained potent political flashpoints. In March, a convenience store inadvertently sold socks embossed with the word ‘Allah’, triggering viral outrage. Several political leaders used the incident to paint Anwar’s government — and its Chinese-majority coalition partner, the Democratic Action Party — as insufficiently protective of Malay-Muslim interests. Even the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a key member of the ruling coalition, saw its Youth Chief join the fray, highlighting the coalition’s internal tensions. In May, Universiti Teknologi MARA — a university historically reserved for ethnic Malays and other bumiputera — proposed temporarily admitting students from other ethnic backgrounds to its postgraduate cardiothoracic programme to address a critical shortage of qualified surgeons. The backlash was swift, with students and Malay nationalist groups mobilising in protest. In August, former prime minister and opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin was charged with sedition for appearing to question a royal decision which followed the 2022 election. While his comments drew public criticism, the sedition charge itself reignited debates over selective prosecution. After years of politicising Malaysia’s race, religion and royalty, identity-based populism has become a force unto itself, with no clear way to contain or navigate it in pursuit of substantive reform. Another former prime minister, Najib Razak — serving time for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal — remains a political liability for Anwar. Though popular within UMNO and its base, he is widely denounced as a kleptocrat elsewhere. In February, a Pardons Board unexpectedly halvedNajib’s sentence and slashed his fines, fuelling backlash from the public and government. Anwar’s predicament is unenviable — he needs UMNO’s backing to govern, but Najib’s preferential treatment undermines his reformist credentials. Beyond politics, Malaysia faced compounding crises in late 2024. Severe flooding in the northern states displaced hundreds of thousands, while sporadic shortages of local white rice deepened food security concerns. Transnational haze persisted and a string of incidents, from power outages in East Malaysia to a tourist vanishing into a Kuala Lumpur sinkhole, exposed pressing infrastructure gaps. None of these challenges have easy fixes. Still, Anwar may find some relief in Perikatan Nasional’s waning momentum. The opposition, which surged in 2023, has been increasingly fractured. Merdeka Center polling also suggests strengthening support for the government, which could give Anwar more manoeuvring room in 2025. The upcoming Sabah state election will be another key test of his coalition’s stability. Malaysia’s foreign policy in 2024 reflected ongoing strategic balancing. Anwar sought to maintain ties with both China and the West while amplifying Malaysia’s support for Palestine, often through sharp critiques of Western hypocrisy and the rules-based international order. Mid-year, he announced Malaysia’s application to join BRICs while making high-profile visits to Beijing and New Delhi, prompting speculation about Malaysia’s geopolitical realignment. That interpretation is premature, as Malaysia continues to seek strong ties with the United States and other Western partners. Malaysia’s relationship with China, while robust, has had tension. A leaked Chinese diplomatic note ordering Malaysia to halt exploration in its own South China Sea exclusive economic zone underscored the complexities of this balancing act. Anwar, who made dozens of international trips in 2024, frequently spoke off-the-cuff to build rapport with global leaders while also addressing domestic concerns. Many of his statements, shaped by shifting political pressures, reflect tactical positioning rather than a cohesive foreign policy shift. Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship will be a pivotal test for Anwar’s leadership. Expectations are high for meaningful progress on regional challenges, particularly the crisis in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea. Failure to secure tangible results could deepen ASEAN’s fragmentation, prompting member states to pursue mini-lateral alternatives. Simultaneously, Malaysia must build momentum for the successor plans to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint — frameworks that will shape the region’s future. Negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area upgrade are set to conclude under Malaysia’s leadership, giving Kuala Lumpur leverage in shaping their final forms. While loftier objectives — such as finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct or facilitating Timor Leste’s formal ASEAN accession — may prove elusive, Malaysia’s Chairmanship will be central to shaping the agenda and fostering consensus. With global politics in flux, Malaysia’s ambitious 2025 agenda will require not just bold leadership, but also pragmatic goal setting, stronger coordination and effective delegation. These may be Anwar’s real tests.

How Can The Study Of Hierarchy/Heterarchy Influence The Future? –...	How new information changes theories. Hierarchies are a familiar form of human organization where individuals and groups of high social status are ranked above others and make decisions. Some examples are an oligarchy, a small group of committed individuals (sharing religion, wealth, etc.); an absolute monarchy that controls all the levers of power; and an activity that requires a clear chain of command (armies and firefighters) for a rapid and coordinated effort. Another form of human organization is a heterarchy, where individual and group status is based on behavior, values, and the willingness to work for the common good; decisions are taken cooperatively. (An earlier version of this article originally appeared as an entry for Heterarchy in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1) Examples of heterarchy are elected national assemblies, unions and guilds, or a group activity whose leaders have the requisite knowledge for the required tasks. These are bare-bones characterizations—a continuum—rather than a one-or-the-other condition; sociopolitical governance is usually a mix, with strict rules for certain purposes and more flexible rules for others. Taken together, the two terms aid the examination of all sociopolitical systems and the study of how decisions are mediated and change over time. A Traditional View of Social Complexity Since archaeology's founding as a discipline in the 19th century, most interpretations have assumed a linear progression from small, early, and 'simple' societies to those that were more populous, appeared later in time, and were 'complex.' Such a definition of complex (having more administrative levels) is in contrast to the definition of complexity in nonlinear systems (more richly networked). Political systems were assumed to have greater stability the more they tended toward tiered hierarchies of power. In 1962, the American cultural anthropologist Elman Service introduced a framework classifying evolutionary stages of social and political organization into four categories: band, tribe, chiefdom, and state. He focused on the managerial benefits of the theory, which posits that chiefdoms arose due to the advantages of centralized leadership and culminated in the formation of states. In this model, leaders offer tangible benefits to their followers who consolidate the leader's power and support the expansion of bureaucratic organizations. Since Service formulated this model of complexity in human societies, dissatisfaction with both the model and the underlying assumption has grown considerably. Scholars2 have complained about the definition of these categories; the lack of clear evidence in the archaeological record; the failure of much archaeological data to fit a cultural evolutionary model; and the objectionable and persistent association with racism and colonialism. Most egregious is the assumption that ancient peoples and contemporary non-state groups are somehow less intelligent and creative than citizens of nation-states. This has played directly into Eurocentric convictions that conquest and colonial takeover were a favor to 'backward' peoples. Today, scholars realize that throughout the course of human history, there were many different forms of self-governance. The root problem has been the definition of complexity. Service understood complexity as many levels of governance, each subordinate to the one above (tiered). Heterarchies have many links (networked) of shifting importance over time. A tiered administrative system describes the formal organization of states but, even in states, the social scaffolding is better revealed when governance is seen as a network, with both official entities (departments) and unofficial ones (groups and individuals who can fulfill various functions). Heterarchy Reflects Real-Life Flexibility Introducing the concept of heterarchy into the study of societies has helped to understand puzzling activities and structures that are found in the past and the present. It is not necessarily a replacement model so much as a complementary one; studying the interplay between the two systems can be particularly instructive. First, the hierarchy-heterarchy relation admits both temporal and spatial flexibility. For example, governmental heterarchies can become more hierarchical over time, and vice versa, without collapsing. Heterarchical relationships among elements at one spatial scale or in one dimension (for example, members of the same club) may be hierarchical at another scale (the privilege of seniority in decision-making). Heterarchy is both a structure and a condition. Applying the concept of heterarchy to the study of ancient and existing societies is likely to have many uses, and exploration has begun in some areas: heterarchies of scale, heterarchies of power, and heterarchies of values. Heterarchies of Scale Spatial analysis in archaeology facilitates the study of shifting configurations of occupied areas, how they were used by their inhabitants, and how socially equal households were. Service was operating under a general assumption common among archaeologists that, over time, increasing group size was related to its complexity, defined as the size of habitation and evidence of growing political centralization, elite activity, and social stratification. In the early 2020s, excavations in Eastern Europe revealed that there were cities of up to 320 hectares (almost 800 acres) with a population of 10,000 people as early as the fourth millennium BCE but, as inequality increased, the cities lost population and were abandoned. These large population aggregations in the past found mechanisms to reduce inequality but, when that ability diminished, people left.3 Heterarchies of Power Power relations are demonstrably the most complicated and important aspect of the governance of human societies. It is particularly important to know how power shifts occur and under what conditions various power distributions constitute stable and unstable configurations. Studying this would greatly assist the study of change and perhaps explain how certain forms of governance can be associated with histories of stability and instability. Addressing the decreasing capacity of macro-states to control political and economic processes in a globalized world, political scientists have also found the concepts of heterarchy and complex systems useful in moving past failing paradigms.4 Heterarchies of Values Power relations are predicated on systems of values that, as conditions change, are ranked and reranked in their importance by individuals, groups, and organizations. Neuropsychologist and cybernetician Warren McCulloch, who examined cognitive structures in the brain, called this collective organization a heterarchy.5 He demonstrated that the human brain is not organized hierarchically but adjusts to the reranking of values as circumstances change. McCulloch contrasted a hierarchy of (ranked) values with a heterarchy of values that defied both ranking and predictability. For example, an individual may be against abortion rights but support the death penalty (or vice versa). McCulloch's 'nervous nets,' the source of the brain's flexibility, are structurally similar to the adaptive capacities of fluidly organized and highly communicative groups. McCulloch's insight into the autonomous nature of information and communication in the brain revolutionized its neural study; it also solved major organizational problems in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer design. It is quintessentially human to make nimble cognitive leaps among scales.5 1 Crumley, Carole L. (2007). 'Heterarchy.' In International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.

ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model – Analysis	By Yang Xite The global economic landscape is undergoing profound restructuring. As major economies repeatedly fall into the 'stimulus-rebound-weakening' fluctuation cycle during the pandemic recovery, and as the marginal benefits of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus continue to diminish, a fundamental question has emerged: Has the underlying logic driving economic growth undergone a systemic shift? Over the past decade, multiple rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve have failed to replicate the V-shaped recovery seen after 2008. The Eurozone's negative interest rate policy has quietly faded during the energy crisis. Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy has consistently failed to achieve the 2% inflation target. These phenomena collectively point to a confusion within the economics community: Why has the classical model, based on the input of production factors, become increasingly difficult to use to explain the growth dynamics of the real world? This disconnect between theory and practice is particularly evident in China's economic transformation. In 2024, fixed asset investment across the whole society grew by 3.2%, retail consumption grew by 3.5%, and the goods trade surplus hit a new high of USD 767.9 billion. According to the traditional 'three pillars (investments, consumptions, exports)' model, this should have resulted in a strong recovery. However, the subjective experience of micro-level entities sharply contrasts with the macro data. The manufacturing PMI has been below the threshold for five consecutive months, youth unemployment remains high, and the capital market's risk appetite continues to stay low. This paradox suggests that latent variables, not captured by traditional models, are reshaping the economic system. In this context, ANBOUND's senior researcher proposed ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model, creating a new observational dimension. This model groundbreakingly incorporates the relationships between three key factors: technology, reform, and culture, into the analysis framework. While global central bank governors are still debating the end point of interest rate hikes, this model has quietly revealed that the essence of modern economic growth has already evolved from a 'quantitative approach' driven by factor accumulation to 'ecoefficiency' based on system coordination. Specifically, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model builds upon the traditional 'three pillars' framework and constructs an analytical framework of 'three bases and three multipliers', decomposing economic growth into three fundamental indicators: investment, consumption, and net exports, as well as three multiplier coefficients: technology, reform, and culture. The first three indicators serve as direct statistical measures of economic output, reflecting the data relationships and manifesting as explicit economic momentum. The latter three represent multiplier effects, showing coefficient relationships that amplify or diminish the impact of the first three, together forming the dynamic system of economic growth. This reveals the complexity of economic growth, especially in the current context of China's economic transformation. Ignoring the regulation of coefficient relationships could lead to policy design falling into the problem of treating symptoms but not the root causes. From the perspective of the theoretical lineage of economics, traditional growth models, such as the Solow-Swan model and New Growth Theory, primarily focus on the interaction between the input of production factors and technological progress, with little consideration of the institutional variables specific to China. The unique value of ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model lies in its ability to integrate not only the classical theories on capital, labor, and technology but also the role of government actions through reform and cultural factors within the system. For example, through reform and innovation, the Chinese government can strengthen areas such as fiscal policy, industrial planning, and institutional innovation. This can directly stimulate investment (such as infrastructure projects), indirectly boost consumption (such as tax reductions to promote domestic demand), and even reshape the structure of net exports (such as the Belt and Road Initiative, BRI). Therefore, it is important to emphasize that ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model is not a simple extension of traditional quantitative economic models. Its core lies in revealing the driving logic of economic growth through system coordination, facilitating the design of policies that can effectively stimulate economic growth. Between 2000 and 2024, China continued to rely on investment-driven growth in the face of external shocks, but this approach to regulation often came with side effects such as overcapacity and mounting debt. The root cause of this lies in the lack of deep consideration for reform to optimize investment efficiency. If policy returns are solely focused on short-term GDP numbers, while neglecting long-term goals such as industrial chain security and technological autonomy, it could lead to a vicious cycle of 'investment - unfinished projects - re-investment'. This has already led to profound lessons in areas like semiconductor manufacturing and the photovoltaic industry. The key to breaking this dilemma lies in the coordination of the three multiplier coefficients, namely technology, reform, and culture in ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model. First, technological innovation, as the core variable of the coefficient relationship, plays a crucial role through multiple pathways. According to ANBOUND Technology Innovation Transforming Productivity Model as discussed by ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan, the multiplier effect of technology on the economy can be realized through three modes: industry returns, policy returns, and capital returns. Taking industry returns as an example, China's manufacturing sector has enhanced its value added per unit of investment from RMB 1.8 / RMB invested in 2012 to RMB 2.4 / RMB invested in 2024, which is empirical evidence of the technology coefficient amplifying investment effectiveness. However, the capital return pathway faces significant distortions in China. The technology sector in A-share has been systematically overvalued in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, and although the registration system reform has accelerated the IPO process, the market's focus on 'financing over investment' has resulted in capital being unable to effectively nourish the real economy. This highlights that the activation of the technology coefficient relies not only on the intensity of research and development investment, with China’s R&D expenditure as a share of GDP in 2024 is 2.7%, but also on accompanying institutional reforms to streamline the transformation chain from 'laboratories - capital markets - industrial applications'. Secondly, the economic value of the cultural coefficient is often underestimated, yet it is closely related to consumption. It deeply participates in economic operation through implicit mechanisms such as shaping consumption preferences, brand premiums, and innovation ecosystems. On the demand side, the role of cultural identity in driving consumption upgrades has become increasingly significant. For instance, the market share of Chinese trendy brands in areas such as clothing and cosmetics has risen from 28% in 2018 to 47% in 2024. Behind this shift is the cultural coefficient reshaping the consumption logic of 'Made in China - Chinese Brands - Chinese Values'. On the supply side, cultural factors indirectly influence total factor productivity by affecting the quality of human capital. For example, the localization of 'craftsmanship spirit' in the Yangtze River Delta region has resulted in a patent conversion rate for high-end equipment manufacturing that is 12 percentage points higher than the national average. More profoundly, the cultural coefficient factor also defines the ethical boundaries of economic growth. When the concept of 'nature is wealth' is translated into institutional practices such as carbon trading markets and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments, culture becomes the underlying operating system that harmonizes growth with sustainability. Finally, the effectiveness of the reform coefficient is primarily reflected in its ability to optimize the coordination of the three key data relationships. Taking China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) industry in 2024 as an example, the government implemented a series of combined policies, such as phasing out subsidies (adjusting the consumption coefficient), financing for charging infrastructure REITs (leveraging social investment), and strategic reserves of lithium resources (stabilizing net export costs). As a result, the industry saw an 18% growth in fixed asset investment, while the consumer market penetration increased to 35%, and exports of power batteries surpassed USD 12 billion. The success of this multi-objective coordination lies in the government's shift from being a 'direct intervener' to a 'system operator'. For instance, the country’s Ministry of Finance prioritized special bond funding to support the construction of tech parks, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released space for private investment through its negative list management, and the cultural department’s IP incubation programs promoted cultural and tourism consumption. After the cumulative effect of these various policy tools, the economic benefits generated far exceeded a simple sum of individual measures. Currently, the key to breaking through China's economic challenges lies in how to rebalance the coefficient relationships under the 'threefold pressure'. On the investment side, the use of local government special bond funds needs to shift from 'quantity' expansion to 'quality' improvement, enhancing the industrial relevance of new infrastructure through the infusion of the technology coefficient. On the consumption side, the cultural coefficient should focus on resolving the people’s paradox of 'having income but not daring to spend', in order to unlock medium- to long-term potential by fostering emerging business models like those catered for senior citizens and immersive experiences. On the net export side, the reform coefficient needs to reshape the BRI cooperation model, turning cultural identity into institutional public goods, such as mutual recognition of standards and co-governance of intellectual property. Crucially, these three coefficients are not independent. Technological breakthroughs rely on government-led basic research investments, such as reforms. Cultural soft power construction needs to be empowered by technological means. Meanwhile, the improvement in government governance resulting from reforms is closely linked to institutional innovations within a cultural context. This interconnectedness requires that policy design go beyond departmental perspectives and seek the optimal solution within the interactive framework of 'technology-reform-culture'. In this regard, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model provides a systematic foundation for understanding China’s 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as creating a more potential-driven, flexible window for correctly assessing the future prospects of the country's economic growth. Therefore, this model is not intended for academic purposes alone, but rather to define the future trends of economic growth, creating the necessary conditions and opening up pathways for that future development. Final analysis conclusion: Looking through the perspective of the new stage of high-quality development, the practical significance of ANBOUND's Economic Growth Model is becoming increasingly evident. It signals to decision-makers that economic growth is not just a 'data race' but also a 'coefficient revolution'. As the marginal returns of traditional growth drivers decline, breakthroughs in technology to push the productivity frontier, reforms to reconstruct incentive-compatible mechanisms, and culture to activate social capital will become key to overcoming the middle-income trap. Historical experience shows that any single dimension of growth faces a ceiling. The United States’ over-reliance on capital returns has led to industrial hollowing out, while Japan’s technological strength has been constrained by cultural isolation, which weakens its innovation vitality. China's path to breaking through lies in leveraging its institutional advantages to weave a 'six-dimensional network', deeply integrating the sharpness of technology, the precision of reform, as well as the cultural aspect.

The Future Of The US In Europe: A Proposal – Analysis	By Aaron Stein (FPRI) -- US President Donald Trump is a radically transparent person but still manages to surprise. After promising for years that he would put pressure on Ukraine to agree with Russia to halt fighting, Trump has recently followed through. He directed his administration to extort the Ukrainian government for a natural resources agreement, ostensibly to 'pay back' the American taxpayer for military assistance, and called on Europe to provide a military force to occupy the country to deter a Russian resumption of fighting after any agreement is reached. Trump’s demands have caused a serious fissure in transatlantic relations. It is essential to understand the roots of these fissures so that the US-European relationship can evolve to meet the moment. Trump is remarkably consistent, and elements of his worldview have become mainstream, particularly his demand of Europe to do more for itself so that Washington can focus on the Indo-Pacific. The Obama administration first announced the 'rebalance' towards Asia in 2011, which continued during the first Trump administration, accelerated under former President Joe Biden, and will likely fully mature during Trump’s second term. The 'rebalance' always included a basic tradeoff: The United States would de-emphasize its commitments in the Middle East and Europe in favor of a reallocation of forces in Asia and Australia. For nearly to two decades, American officials have extolled their European counterparts to spend more on defense, settling in recent years on asking for an increase in spending to 5 percent of GDP (with 30 percent of total defense spending allotted for new procurements). This call came after years of disquiet about Europe’s failures to live up to the 2014 NATO agreement in Wales to increase defense spending to 2 percent of total GDP. Europe has been slow to respond but spurred by Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and now the shock of a second Trump administration, the urgency to increase defense spending has increased. This urgency, however, has come with deep concern about the future of European security and whether or not Trump will sell out Europe to Moscow. It also may be impossible for Europe to meet under current fiscal rules. Germany remains hampered by its refusal to alter the debt brake (at least for now), France’s fiscal situation is less than ideal, and the United Kingdom remains mired in the self-induced malaise brought about by Brexit. The 5 percent figure is currently more than the money spent on defense in the United States, so any such increase would entail a longer-term plan for getting there. It would also entail significant changes to Europe’s social contract. It may also be necessary, if European nations want to follow through on their renewed pledges to be more autonomous from the United States. There is also a different option: to agree at the next NATO summit to increase defense spending to 3.5 percent and to try and shape the future of the security of Europe—in cooperation with the Trump administration—in mutually beneficial ways. The increase may not be easy, but it is worth trying. I believe there is still a way out of this crisis, but it requires Europe to follow through and spend more and ask Washington for specific things to enhance regional security. The United States can defend Europe through a smaller presence. Europe can spend more. It is time to think about how to do this. A Straightforward Policy The Trump administration’s Europe policy is remarkably straightforward. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth described it bluntly: The United States is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail … As the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front. Together, we can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and Pacific respectively. The good news is that the administration has told anyone who will listen that it remains committed to the defense of Europe. Hegseth was very clear, telling his counterparts, 'The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop.' However, the shift in US priorities has raised a basic policy problem almost every administration has had to navigate since NATO’s founding: how to reassure European leaders that Washington would fight for European security if a localized conflict did not directly impact American continental security. This is where the Trump administration has fallen woefully short. In a social media post, Trump extolled Europe for 'failing to bring peace' and suggested that 'Ukraine is far more important to Europe than it is to us … We have a big, beautiful ocean as a separation.' This isolationism would suggest America cannot be trusted. This feeling of betrayal is made worse by Trump’s desire for a rapid peace agreement with Russia about Ukraine, which has thus far seen his administration’s talking points tilt towards those from the Kremlin. This incongruity needs to be addressed with better messaging from Washington and can be done in ways that align with Trump’s worldview. A Very Clear World View Trump has had very consistent views on foreign policy. In an interview with Playboy in 1990, Trump (speaking about himself in the third person) was very blunt about his approach towards US adversaries and allies: He [Trump] would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn’t trust anyone. He wouldn’t trust the Russians; he wouldn’t trust our allies; he’d have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we’re defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing … We’re being laughed at around the world. If this sounds familiar, it is because the man hasn’t really changed at all in nearly four decades. He has a very black and white approach to global security, believing that the United States has to have a strong military that is not tasked with defending allies, nor specifically looking to fight adversaries. He also has a healthy aversion to nuclear conflict, telling Playboy and the New York Times, almost three decades apart, virtually the same thing. I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people believing it will never happen because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit. Now, compare to his thoughts in 2016. Look, in the perfect world everybody would agree that nuclear would, you know, be so destructive, and this was always the theory, or was certainly the theory of many. That the power is so enormous that nobody would ever use them … And, you know, we have been under the impression that, well we’ve been, I think it’s misguided somewhat, I’ve always felt this but that nobody would ever use them because of the power. And the first one to use them, I think that would be a very bad thing. And I will tell you, I would very much not want to be the first one to use them, that I can say. Trump is neither articulate, nor diplomatic, but he is very consistent. The basic outline of his foreign policy, therefore, is easy to understand: Trump does not view alliances as additive to US power unless allies can defend themselves; Russia is not to be trusted, but also not to be unnecessarily quarreled with, and nuclear war should be prevented at all costs. However, Trump’s zero-sum approach to diplomacy also provides clear opportunities for European actors. It is naive to suggest Trump’s policy is simply more of the same from America. It is not. His policy vis-a-vis alliances is an anathema to how the US-European defense partnership is currently structured and explains why so many are now concerned about the future of the transatlantic partnership. I understand the anxiety. However, it is important not to fall into the trap of manifesting an outcome that does not need to happen. At their core, Trump and his foreign policy cadre are asking Europe to defend itself with America acting as a backstop to deter, with nuclear weapons, further Russian aggression. Hegseth did not say so directly during his recent trip to the continent but overtly implied it when he said that NATO 'will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on the continent.' This division of labor, it appears, will involve Europe assuming the conventional defense of Europe, with Washington providing nuclear guarantees, along with some elements of continued conventional assets. The question, then, is how to make the US nuclear guarantee more credible, even if such actions could raise the risk of nuclear conflict. The solution is actually a dual-track approach to US-Russian dialogue, of the type favored by Trump, alongside a clear vision of how nuclear guarantees could be additive to the 'division of labor' approach the administration favors. The test case is Ukraine, where the administration is seeking to deploy European troops in the country if an agreement on a ceasefire can be reached with Russia. The Trump administration, however, has refused to specify whether or not any European presence in Ukraine would come with a US security guarantee.Hegseth has said the troops would be deployed outside of the NATO structure and, therefore, not be covered under the Washington Treaty’s mutual defense clause. This could work with some combined European force under the leadership of a European general and be structured in a way similar to the ad-hoc coalitions that Washington has cobbled together for every military endeavor it has launched since the end of the Cold War. However, it appears that both France and the United Kingdom would condition any such deployment on a US security guarantee backed by US platforms based in Poland or Romania. Options for Mutual Defense Ground Forces and Limiting National Caveats The basic outline does provide Europe with a way out of this crisis with Washington. It is absolutely vital for France and the United Kingdom to offer up at least a division of troops to be deployed in Ukraine. Without providing a specific military proposal, Europe may be pushed to the side and only presented with a final outline of requirements by Washington. These troops need to be garrisoned near the front line and have very clear rules of engagement and clear reporting lines. One of the many concerns I have is that a multinational European force will be bogged down by bureaucracy, beset by national caveats and rules about how they can be used, thereby making the force impotent from the start. Somebody needs to be in charge and national caveats about how to use force minimized from the start. This will require a strong European leader and all parties to the European-led force to agree to subordinate national commands to a non-American leader. This will be tough. The Trump administration would be very wise to consider deploying special forces with these European brigades to augment capabilities and, importantly, to train Ukrainian units in the country. Air Support, Space Assets, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance The United States Air Force should also consider deploying aircraft from Lakenheath, England to Poland to support this European force. Europe should be asked to provide tanker support in Poland, thereby allowing for a smaller number of jets to patrol the NATO-Russian border. These jets would also be on-call for Allied troops in contact situations to support European troops in Ukraine. Finally, any European force in Ukraine would be almost entirely dependent on US-provided space assets, as well as unmanned aircraft to monitor the line of contact. These assets should be deployed in support of the European force, ideally based out of Poland (or Germany) and be modeled on the myriads of air operations America and Europe have launched together over the past three decades around the world. This approach should also include a robust role for US contractors, who are critical for the servicing of Ukraine’s armed forces. Air and Missile Defense There is also a role for NATO. The Alliance has provided augmented air and missile defense to Turkey for more than a decade. The deployment of both Patriot and SAMP/T missiles in Turkey was spurred by the Syrian civil war spilling over the border. Bashar al-Assad is now deposed. Ankara now occupies Syria. There is simply no reason to continue to deploy European missile defenses on a border that Ankara now controls. The mission should be repurposed, with NATO providing air and missile defense interceptors in Poland. The combination of these missile interceptors, alongside US and European Air Forces, should spur renewed debate about how best to patrol Ukrainian air space in the event of a ceasefire. The obvious model to pull on would be the multinational air defense of West Germany during the Cold War, complete with a dedicated reporting structure, established air corridors, routes for Allied jets to transit in and out of, and procedures to intercept any aircraft that crossed the line of contact. This all can be done from a hub in Poland, with US support, and in ways that does not require anything more than a slimmed down special forces presence inside Ukraine. A multinational air defense would also obligate the United States to NATO’s territorial defense—a goal Trump and Hegseth have both said they would honor—and help to extend those guarantees across the border into Ukraine. Finally, there is a way to tie the future of European security to Trump’s future policy agenda in ways that could be additive to the settlement of Ukraine. The early warning infrastructure for current and future US missile defenses is deployed throughout Europe. There also are two interceptor sites in Poland and Romania. These facilities are important for the administration’s 'Golden Dome for America' missile defense concept, where Hegseth has said future Pentagon budgets should spend more funds. The Role of Nuclear Weapons The final proposal is a bit more controversial but would also fit with US priorities over the next four years. If the United States is serious about providing nuclear guarantees for Europe without a large troop presence, it should consider soliciting European opinion about deploying more nuclear weapons in Europe. As of now, Washington has approximately 200 gravity bombs stored on five airbases in Europe. The weapons are not really usable in a crisis, and instead, the security of the Alliance is guaranteed by US long-range forces deployed on submarines and in the continental United States. The United States should propose deploying a nuclear armed, ground launched missile for deployment in Europe. The Typhon launcher can carry both the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles. The Tomahawk could be assigned a modernized nuclear warhead and be deployed in Poland or Germany. The return of more usable nuclear weapons in Europe would have an obvious deterrent effect on Russia and put more 'American skin in the game' without a dramatic increase in troops. The role of nuclear weapons could also raise the stakes of a Russian violation in Ukraine and, ironically, more tightly tether the United States to the future of Europe. The defense of Europe would take on a more pronounced nuclear dimension, ensuring that any conflict that expands beyond Ukraine’s border could 'go nuclear' and therefore risk catastrophic escalation to include strikes on the US homeland. This fear of escalation would require the United States to think about future security on the continent, perhaps assuage some European concerns, and fit with Department of Defense funding priorities. France should consider a once-a-year European-only nuclear exercise modeled on NATO’s annual Steadfast Noon exercise. The basic idea would be to integrate the European Air Forces into a simulated nuclear strike mission. The exercise would obviate the need to deploy French nuclear weapons outside the country (a very unlikely scenario) or undercut the US nuclear guarantee to the continent. NATO agrees every time it rewrites its strategic document that the ultimate security of the Alliance is American nuclear weapons deployed primarily on submarines and inside the United States. The Allies have agreed that French and British nuclear weapons 'have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly' to Alliance security. France has overtly suggested that it is ready to have such a discussion, but too often these calls lead to a fracturing of European opinion rather than a serious debate about the future of nuclear deterrence on the continent. The transatlantic relationship is changing rapidly. It is vitally important to think about how to manage the change so that the Alliance endures and adapts. There is a clear pathway forward to ensure the United States remains engaged, Europe remains protected, and a ceasefire in Ukraine is enforced. There is also a way to do this that advances the European project, continues to roll back Russian revanchism, and works within the quirks of Trumpism. The United States is finishing its pivot to Asia, but it can and should be able to defend the continent with a more pronounced European effort and additive US capabilities.

Judicial Adventurism Can Imperil Democracy – OpEd	The only period of legal authoritarian rule in India was June 1975–March 1977 following the declaration of an Emergency by Prime Minister (PM) Indira Gandhi. I happened to be back in India, based in New Delhi, doing archival and interview research for my PhD. The experience of the overnight transition from a rambunctious democracy to which argumentative Indians had taken with gusto, to a stifling and oppressive rule by state fiat, was deeply and permanently sobering. It led to my first academic article on returning to Canada, ‘The Fate of India’s Parliamentary Democracy’ (1976). Looking back at that now, I expect I would temper my harsh criticisms of PM Gandhi. For in fact the constitutional crisis arose from an Allahabad High Court verdict, confirmed by one Supreme Court justice that was appealed but not heard before the Emergency came into force. She had won a decisive victory in the 1971 general election with 68 percent of seats in parliament. I would now be strongly opposed to the judges vacating a clear verdict on a technicality of violating electoral laws which, if applied across the board, would have led to almost all parliamentarians losing their seats. But my main point in recalling that incident and leading with it is that the issues of constitutionalism and the boundaries between law and politics and the institutions of the judiciary, legislature, and the executive, have preoccupied me for half a century in both their philosophical abstractions and practical applications. Importantly, my opinions have changed in the sense that at the end of the day, I’ve come to believe that politicians and the political process pose less of an institutionalised threat to people’s freedoms, liberties, and speech than unelected, unaccountable, and unsackable judges who often, in the guise of interpreting laws, don’t hesitate to make – and make up – laws. Indeed in India in the end it was the voters who dealt Mrs Gandhi a crushing electoral defeat in 1977 for all the thuggish excesses under the Emergency, but then brought her back decisively in 1980 when they discovered just how incompetent the other lot of rabble-rousers were. Law, Politics, and Norms in International Affairs Human rights courts have become the place where democracies go to die. Law, both within and among nations, is an effort to align power to justice. All justice systems rest on a dynamic interaction between law, politics, and norms. Politics is about power: its location, bases, exercise, effects. Law seeks to tame power and convert it into authority through legitimising principles (e.g. democracy, separation of powers, due process), structures (e.g. legislature, executive, judiciary), and procedures (e.g. elections, trials). Law thereby mediates relations between the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful. No one is above the law in democracies; everyone is subject to the laws that apply without fear or favour to all. But equally, everyone is under the law and law protects everyone. Only when both conditions apply is everyone equal under the law. The greater the gap between power and authority, the closer we are to anarchy, to the law of the jungle where might equals right, and the greater is the legitimacy deficit. Unlike national courts, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) are not embedded in a broader system of democratic policy-making. There are no political checks on them. In a national system, the office of the prosecutor functions within a well-established structure of state governance. In the international system, neither the ICJ nor the ICC was established as part of a centralised system of world government. The ICJ regulates only interstate relations. The ICC has jurisdiction over the nationals of state parties and, in some contested contingencies, can exercise jurisdiction over non-party nationals also. But in doing so it displaces the state as the conduit of democratic representation and provides no alternative mechanism for democratic governance, which has landed it in deep trouble with the Trump administration vis-à-vis Israel. In the idealised conception, the constitution encapsulates and articulates the social purpose of a state. The laws and institutions of state give practical content to the social purpose and work together to that common end. The closest equivalent to a constitution for the international order is the Charter of the United Nations adopted in 1945. But there is no world state whose social purpose can be found in the purposes and principles spelt out in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter. In The United Nations, Peace and Security (Cambridge University Press, 2006), I described the UN as ‘a symbol of an imagined and constructed community of strangers’ (p. 369), but also noted that the Founders’ ‘vision of a world community equal in rights, bound by a common vision and united in action is still to be realised’ (p. 359). The last great reform effort faltered in 2005 in part because of the erosion of the sense of community as the UN membership had almost quadrupled since its creation in 1945 with the addition of almost exclusively non-Western newly decolonised nations. Nor is there a world government with its own legislature and executive. The General Assembly and Security Council are very inadequate equivalents. Moreover, the Security Council, dominated by the five permanent members, is not elected by the Assembly, not answerable to it, and not dismissible by it. The UN does have a secretariat but it doesn’t have its own law enforcement agencies nor its own military force. Instead, it is dependent on member states’ cooperation for these tasks. Nor does the UN have its own elaborate structure of a multi-layered judiciary from lower courts to an apex court exercising civil, criminal, and appellate functions. Comparable, for example, to the Australian constitution which deals with ‘The Judicature’ in Chapter III, Chapter XIV of the Charter does list the ICJ as ‘the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,’ incorporates the court’s Statute as an annex, and describes it as ‘an integral part of the present Charter’ (Article 92). In communist systems, courts are not just an integral part of the structures of state, but an equally integral part of the communist party regime. Independence of the judiciary from the party is incompatible with the organising ideology of communist rule and unimaginable in practice. Thus it is that China’s ICJ judge Xue Hanqin, a vice president of the court, is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a former director general of the department of treaty and law in China’s foreign ministry. No surprise then that, consistent with Chinese policies, in 2019 she ruled that the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean should be returned by Britain to Mauritius and in 2022 was one of only two judges to dissent from the majority judgment calling on Russia to suspend the invasion of Ukraine. The second dissenting judge was Russian. As for the ICC, why should it have authority over constitutionally legitimated democracies like Australia, Israel, or the US? But if the ICC cannot claim authority over democratic countries, can it fairly claim jurisdiction over non-democracies like China and Russia? At the other end of the spectrum lies the UN Security Council as the sole enforcement arm of international criminal justice should ICJ and ICC decisions be defied or disrespected. Unfortunately, the Security Council’s democratic credentials are exactly zero and its successful resistance to meaningful reforms has greatly eroded its legitimacy. Having multiple layers of national courts and judges means that by the time it gets to the apex court, there is greater distance of the judges from the location, events, time, and passions of the crime. In addition, the apex court’s judges benefit from the facts already elucidated and arguments canvassed and clarified in the lower courts. Australia’s Cardinal Pell was found guilty in a unanimous jury verdict; this was upheld by a two-to-one majority by the Victorian Court of Appeals but overturned in a unanimous High Court judgment. The international system lacks such essential safeguards, with only one ICJ and ICC each. This multiplies the possibility of wrongful verdicts with no recourse to appeal. Law, Politics, and Norms in National Affairs The UN system’s legitimacy deficits notwithstanding, a rules-based international order offers the prospect of normative protection, albeit less than foolproof, for the weak states against the predatory instincts of powerful states. The international rule of law is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for regulating the use of force and levelling the playing field for small and great powers. Domestically, a firmly established rule of law offers more reliable protection for the poor, weak, and marginalised members of society than the discretionary beneficence of an enlightened despot. The gap between the normative structure and power equations exists within nations as well, but to a significantly lesser degree in democratic countries. In apartheid South Africa, judges routinely denied reality staring them in the face to uphold a system of criminal injustice against blacks and Asians. In Canada, courts have succumbed to the pressure of racialised justice and apply what are called Impact of Race and Culture Assessment reports (IRCAs) in sentencing. The justification is that these will help judges better understand how poverty, systemic racism, and discrimination might have influenced and constricted the life choices and trajectory of the convicted offender. In a further subcategorisation of this racialised justice, clients who self-identify as black do not need an endorsement from the court to obtain an IRCA report, but self-identifying members of other racial communities do. In the US it’s generally acknowledged that filling a Supreme Court vacancy is of more long-term consequence than a presidential election. The nomination battles in the Senate are conducted more along ideological lines disguised in the language of legal qualifications of the nominee. The remarkable reliability of predicting the vote of most justices along the conservative-liberal divide on most precedent-setting important cases belies the myth of the impartial majesty of the legal system interpreting and applying independently objective laws. Within Western countries, the reality of mass immigration plus a difference in birth rates between native and immigrant groups means that the Third World has come to the West and diluted the pre-existing social cohesion and cultural community, to the extent that one existed. The contrast with the continuity of cultural cohesion in low-immigration, low-crime, and high-trust Japan that I witnessed firsthand during almost a decade of living in Tokyo is striking. In recent years a clear divide has emerged between the ruling elites and their peoples in the welcoming versus increasingly hostile attitudes towards continuing mass immigration. Not only is the legal clerisy, including lawyers and judges, part of the ruling elite. In addition, it too has been captured by the prevailing nostrums of the centre-left ideology during the long march through the institutions. In Australia, we saw this most clearly in the failed Voice referendum in October 2023 which would have given special recognition to Aboriginal Australians by inserting an entirely new chapter in the constitution. Lawfare and Activist Judiciaries Imperil Democracy Laws simultaneously act as both a licence and a leash. On the one hand, in their permissive function they enable individuals, authorised agents of the state, businesses, and organisations to engage in particular behaviours. On the other hand, in their restrictive function, they set out limits to what the various actors may do, transgressing which puts them beyond the safety of the law. The rights and responsibilities of the different actors as prescribed in law are the bedrock of the rule of law. Constitutional governance and the rule of law in turn are essential underpinnings of democratic politics. There is a corollary. If there is an imbalance between the licence and leash attributes of law, if laws make it either all too easy or impossible for the government to govern, then democracy can end in tyranny, with all or too much power concentrated in the government at the expense of citizen’s liberties; or its opposite, anarchy, with a complete collapse of the functions of government. In recent years I have become increasingly apprehensive at the weaponisation of law to paralyse governments, by human rights lawyers in particular, albeit not exclusively so. An essential component of the democracy project has been to transition nations of people holding power into nations of laws. Law seeks to tame the arbitrary and capricious exercise of power. Democracy seeks to make the holders and wielders of power chosen and dismissible by the citizens and the exercise of power subject to the consent of the people. ‘Judicial romanticism’ is the belief that judicial activism is the solution to all social-political conflicts and ills. It is a conceit of judicial romanticism that law can never be appropriated to serve the ideological worldviews of the juristocracy and in the process frustrate the functioning of democratic politics. Regional and global institutions of justice like the European Court on Human Rights, the ICJ, and the ICC worsen the anti-democratic pathology by not being grounded in local culture and values and physically located at considerable distance from ‘We, the people.’ The end result is that the rule of law is corrupted into the bastard child of a rule by lawyers. Within nations, Western democracies have reached an inflection point on mass immigration. The highly charged issue is proving decisive in shaping electoral outcomes from the US to the UK, Italy, The Netherlands, and Germany. One would think that this should make judges all the more cautious in venturing into the political minefield. Wrong. Pushed by voters to take back control of porous borders, governments are often frustrated by courts that buy activist lawyers’ suits alleging breaches of national, continental, and international human rights laws and conventions. USA Gwythian Prins of the LSE uses the metaphor of Trump as the captain of an ice-bound ship of state who is dynamiting the pack ice with linked and sequenced charges to break free. The shock waves from the explosions are being felt around the world. The Democrats’ weaponisation of the justice system against Trump during the Biden administration was so cynical that in the end it backfired spectacularly and proved more politically damaging to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than to Trump. Having lost the presidency and Senate to the Republicans and failed to win back the House, Democrats have turned to lawfare to frustrate Trump’s voter-mandated second-term agenda. Why? Because the vigorous campaign to disinfect the DC swamp with sunlight is proving fatal to the swamp-dwelling bureaucracy. Trump’s blizzard of executive orders to implement his campaign promises of cutting back on government inefficiency, waste, and corruption have been countered with a flurry of lawsuits from panicked unions and Democrats that have produced some stay orders. The nationwide injunctions could bring Trump’s frenetic implementation schedule of his agenda to a stuttering halt. The institution and practice of national injunctions inevitably encourage forum shopping to lodge a case in a jurisdiction and with a judge likely to be sympathetic to the complaint. Yet there is a legal case to be made, as per a well-cited 2017 article by Samuel L Bray in the Harvard Law Review, that a federal court should give a plaintiff-protective but not a national injunction. The latter is a relatively recent innovation in US jurisprudence: ‘a federal court’s power to issue injunctions is restricted to a specific defendant’s conduct only with respect to a specific plaintiff.’ Another risk is that the injunctions might be playing into a calculated strategy of provoking lawsuits that will clarify the executive’s right to control the bureaucracy, including the so-called independent agencies that have sprawled over the last century and blur the legislative-executive-judicial boundaries. This might prove to be the most effective route to reining in the administrative state. Congress has seeded a veritable forest of regulatory agencies that perform executive and quasi-judicial functions that are free of executive control and judicial oversight, reporting only to Congress. It might be an idea for those attempting to block Trump’s ability to govern through court injunctions to look again at some of the poll findings on what voters liked about Trump: he doesn’t care what others think, says what he means, and does what he says. Vice President J D Vance, who is proving to be an articulate, cogent, and telegenic champion of the Trump agenda, tweeted on 10 February: ‘Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.’ It has had 63 million views. On 9 February, Trump himself commented that judges interfering with the executive’s political agenda was ‘a disgrace:’ ‘No judge should…be allowed to make that kind of a decision’ whereby ‘a president can’t look for fraud and waste and abuse.’When asked directly by an ABC News reporter on 11 February whether he would comply with a judge’s adverse ruling, Trump replied: ‘Well, I always abide by the courts and then I’ll have to appeal it. But then what he’s done is he slowed down the momentum.’ This has produced conniptions among Democrats and their cheerleaders, frothing that Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis. Set aside the memory of Biden openly boasting a year ago that the ‘The Supreme Court blocked’ his student loan debt relief plan ‘but that didn’t stop me.’ Separation of powers means there are limits to the jurisdictional overreach of all three branches, including the judiciary. Who holds the judiciary accountable to its limits? To claim that any reminder to the courts to stay in their judicial lane and not stray into the legislative and executive lanes risks a constitutional crisis, is to make the judiciary the sole arbiter of its own reach and limits, as well as that of the other two branches. Nice job if you can get it. Maybe Trump should launch a campaign to Make America Governable Again. A constitutional cleanup, not a constitutional crisis. UK PM Keir Starmer is already firmly stuck with the public belief that he is operating a two-tier justice system and has become known as Two-Tier Keir. Starmer’s Attorney General Lord Hermer, a human rights barrister colleague and close personal friend, is in a class of his own in the portfolio of cases involving allegations of breaches of international human rights law by the UK. His roll call of clients included the former leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attacks, an al-Qaeda chief linked to the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, a willing ISIS bridedemanding the right to return to Britain, and a Pakistani terrorist who plotted to bomb a Manchester shopping centre. Most recently, Hermer is reported as supporting an Oxford don, who backed the claim of Mauritius against the UK in the Chagos Islands case, as the UK’s nominee to the ICJ. Announcing Professor Dapo Akande’s nomination last year, Starmer said he was ‘personally committed to strengthening international rule of law and the institutions that support it.’ Some UK verdicts have been so outrageous as to make one wonder if judges are trolling the public and daring the government to reverse some of their incendiary rulings. Rulings just this month have granted a Gaza family of six right of entry under a family reunion scheme enacted for Ukrainian refugees, as if there are not already enough Jew-hating residents; stopped an Albanian criminal’s deportation because of his ten-year old son’s distaste for foreign chicken nuggets; granted asylum to a woman who, having failed eight times to gain asylum, joined a Biafran terrorist organisation and reapplied because of risks to safety if returned to Nigeria, with the judge acknowledging she’d joined the group solely ‘to create a claim for asylum;’ prevented deportation of a Pakistani man incarcerated for child sex offencesbecause depriving his children of their convicted paedophile Dad would be ‘unduly harsh;’ allowed a convicted paedophile, sentenced to more than five years imprisonment, to stay in Britain because he would face ‘hostility’ if deported back to Zimbabwe; and aborted attempts to deport another convicted paedophile Sri Lankan because, being gay, he could face prosecution in his home country. Europe In a similar vein, Gavin Mortimer argues in The Spectator that the judiciary is fuelling Europe’s immigration crisis. An Italian court ordered 49 migrants who had been sent to Albania after a sea rescue to be brought to Italy, the third judicial frustration in four months of PM Giorgia Meloni’s efforts to curb illegal immigration. A French court overturned the deportation order of a convicted Algerian with two failed attempts to enter illegally. An angry Interior Minister asked: ‘Should our law protect dangerous individuals or protect French society against dangerous individuals’? Germany suffered the death of a police officer in Mannheim in June by an Afghan; the deaths of three people in Solingen in August stabbed by a Syrian asylum seeker; a December car attack on a Magdeburg Christmas Market by a Saudi refugee that killed five people; and a stabbing in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg in January by an Afghan asylum seeker who killed two. Vice President Vance in his remarkable speech on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference, referencing the car attack on a trade union rally in Munich the previous day by a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker who killed a 37-year-old mother and her two-year-old daughter and injured 37 people, asked: How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction? He received an answer of sorts the very next day. A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker took a knife to a crowd in Villach, a southern Austrian town, killing one 14-year-old boy and wounding five people. The serial attacks associated with refugees and asylum seekers solidify the sentiment that Germany is adrift in uncharted waters. They fuel public support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, one of whose members was convicted last year of incitement to hatred for repeating official statistics showing Afghan migrants are disproportionately likely to commit serious sexual offences. The AfD is routinely castigated as far-right, a descriptor that is fast proving to mean ‘Too Right’ or ‘Totally Right.’ Vance’s meeting with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, in conjunction with his failure to meet one-to-one with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, was deeply symbolic. Optics matter. Vance’s message to the European leaders in the audience, in capitals across Europe, and in Brussels, was: democracy means listening to the people and responding to their concerns. In effect their sniffy reply was: Opinions may vary on that. Australia One of the best examples of the dangers of judicial activism by woke-infected Australian judges is the Love decision. In 2020 Australia’s apex court decided in a 4-3 split verdict that two men, neither of whom was born in Australia or was an Australian citizen but both claimed Australian Aboriginal ancestry, were not aliens and therefore could not be deported as non-citizens for having served over a year each in prison for violent assaults. The majority judges’ reasoning explicitly included Aboriginals’ inalienable connections to the lands and waters of Australia, irrespective of their citizenship status. Any Australian who still believes that the Albanese government has not been influenced by electoral calculations in its kid-glove treatment of anti-Semitism, hate speech, and violence against Jews is ripe for being sold one of the most iconic opera houses in the world, on the steps of which the current wave of soft policing of hate-spewing anti-Semitic protests was first witnessed and the images went viral around the world. How appropriate is it for NSW chief justice Andrew Bell to publicly criticise Elon Musk as the man ‘who attacked the Australian government’s attempts to regulate the flow of misinformation and disinformation?’ As The Australian’s Janet Albrechtsen commented, instead of trying to play the role of chief censor, ‘‘The only person Bell should censor is himself.’ Conclusion Allister Heath, editor of The Sunday Telegraph, wonders just when British democracy gave way to ‘a tyranny of the human rights lawyers.’ The Telegraph itself argued in an editorial on 12 February that judicial overreach has made Britain ‘almost ungovernable.’ It added: ‘Through a series of decisions and unintended consequences reaching back decades, the judiciary of this country has been permitted to consolidate power at the expense of other branches of the state. This must now be wound back.’ When PM Starmer and Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch both criticised the Gaza family decision as wrong, Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr huffily declared herself to be ‘deeply troubled.’ Their criticisms, she said, were ‘unacceptable’ because any public criticism fails to ‘respect and protect’ judges. Yeah, right. The politicians were not demanding the judge be sacked. Justice Carr is demanding that the two major party leaders self-censor any criticism of judicial decisions inside Parliament. To avoid criticism, judges need to be better educated on the boundary between interpreting laws and dictating policy, or else resign from the bench and run for public office with their own policy platform. It’s the politicised quality of the judgments that is lowering public esteem for the judiciary, not the fact that political leaders are responding to that public disquiet. As this article documents, the problem is far more widespread across the West than just the UK. In the 2019 Reith Lectures, the distinguished former Supreme Court judge Lord Jonathan Sumption issued a warning against ‘law’s expanding empire.’ He’s been sobered by how the European Court of Human Rights has acquired powers well beyond its treaty. In an article for The Law Association of New Zealand on 3 November 2023, he cautioned: ‘We have to have a minimum of fundamental rights in order to function as a democracy. That I accept. But if we place too many rights beyond the reach of democratic choice, then we cease to be a democracy just as surely as if we had no rights at all.’ This article was published at Brownstone Institute. A shorter version of this was published in the Spectator Australia magazine on 22 February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JsfSmomCUuMz	2025-02-26T17:04:02-08:00	
Yes, Marx Advocated Violence And Political Repression – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed I was recently taken aback by a lengthy piece that I read (very oddly) in the Wall Street Journal. Jacob Berger is a professor of philosophy at Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He authored an article in the WSJ on January 23 entitled 'Why MAGA Folks Should Read Marx,' in which he wrote: '[G]iven the history of murderous communist regimes like Stalin’s Russia, Mao’s China and Pol Pot’s Cambodia, it is tempting to infer that Marx encouraged tyranny. But Marx did not advocate violence or political repression, and he would be appalled by the atrocities committed in his name. He pressed for revolution, but he envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic, like the Velvet Revolution that freed Czechoslovakia from Soviet rule in 1989.' The Marx to whom Professor Berger was referring was Karl, not Groucho. So, I read that paragraph again, thinking perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me. Karl Marx 'did not advocate violence or political repression'? That is not my recollection, and I think I’ve read everything the bohemian scribbler ever wrote, whether with pens or crayons. He 'envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic'? Did I miss something in all that Marxist stuff I read? Marx called for a 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' Can dictatorship ever be consensual and serene? My good friend and Spectator editor Paul Kengor urges people to read The Communist Manifesto. That’s where Marx and his sugar daddy collaborator Friedrich Engels attacked capitalism and sketched their vision for a socialist/communist future. Paul echoes a famous quip from Ronald Reagan: 'How do you tell if someone is a communist? He’s someone who reads Marx and Lenin. How do you tell an anti-communist? He’s one who understands Marx and Lenin.' What seemed to be unadulterated revisionism in Professor Berger’s article prompted me to take up Paul’s suggestion. I read The Communist Manifesto again for probably the third or fourth painful time. I arrived at the inescapable conclusion that Professor Berger does not understand it. Despite left-wing academia’s frequent embrace of Marx, The Manifesto comes across to a reasonable and thoughtful person as mindboggling nonsense. It’s gobbledygook writ large as if cooked up by nincompoops. It’s the sort of thing one would expect from a witch doctor who misdiagnoses the problem and then prescribes all the wrong medications, who thinks the patient who suffers from a toothache needs his feet removed. The Manifesto consists of one oversimplification after another: Everything, including what and how a person thinks, reduces to the rigid economic 'class' into which he was born. Everybody is either an oppressor or a helpless lump of the oppressed. Life is all about conflict. The book’s generalizations are so sweeping and unsupported as to be ridiculous and meaningless, such as the claim that if you are a male capitalist employer (a 'bourgeois' in Marx’s pejorative terminology), you see your wife as nothing more than 'a mere instrument of production.' At the same time, you and your fellow male capitalist employers 'take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.' People are thus reduced to caricatures and homogenized in the Marxian blender so that no exceptions can corrupt the preconceived stereotypes that serve the Marxian narrative. At one point, Marx and Engels sputter this fatuous bunk: 'But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit.' That’s right. 'Not a bit,' the two pseudo-intellectuals proclaim. Nobody anywhere knows of anybody working for wages who owns a thing after they get their paycheck. Nobody has ever seen or heard of a worker who saves and invests, starts a business, or improves his economic condition by accumulating property. Oh, I thought, I’m sure Marx and Engels have footnoted this. I’ll look at the bottom of the page to discover the source of this absurdity… Oops, no footnotes. None! The authors of this spleen-venting screed labeled a 'manifesto' expect you to take their word for it. And you’d better not disagree because, they assert in shameless arrogance, 'The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination.' Let’s return to the paragraph I cited from Professor Berger’s article. He wants us to believe that Marx was a peaceful fellow. In re-reading The Communist Manifesto, I looked for anything indicating Marx opposed violence. I found otherwise—on page after page. Marx despised religion but postured as a prophet. History is marching inevitably toward a communist future in which all government would magically 'wither away' after a period of a socialist 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' He never explained what would prompt anybody with total power to suddenly proclaim of his own volition, 'See you later, I’m outta here.' Did Marx know this by using tarot cards, palm reading, or a Ouija board? Did he read animal entrails? From where did his super-confident knowledge of the future come? Don’t ask me. I don’t believe in witchcraft or soothsaying folderol. But it’s obvious from The Manifesto that Marx (and his pal Engels) saw violence to achieve the communist objective as a given. Consider this paragraph: The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible. Can centralizing all instruments of production in the hands of the State be achieved peacefully? Professor Berger may think so, but Marx did not. Read on: Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production. That’s word salad for 'We’ll have to kick the s— out of a lot of people.' The Manifesto claims that 'the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.' Perhaps Marx somehow saw a future Professor Berger skipping over that, so he reinforced it with this assurance: '[Y]ou reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.' Marx criticizes socialists who do not understand the necessity of revolutionary violence. They naively 'wish to attain their ends by peaceful means' that he says are 'necessarily doomed to failure.' Does this paragraph from The Manifesto make you think of the non-violent Mahatma Gandhi or a maniac with violent proclivities? In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.…They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. The 'forcible overthrow' of not some but 'all existing social conditions.' How could Professor Berger get away with claiming that a man who put his name to such a chilling statement was a peacenik? Perhaps the most famous part of The Manifesto is the list of pithy declarations of what the communists want done—known as the 'Ten Planks' of the document. Are they mere helpful tips for better living, or are they prescriptions for the violence that Professor Berger denies? Let’s look at just a few of them: Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. How is this 'abolition' supposed to happen? Either everybody voluntarily hands over their belongings to the government, or the government shows up with guns and seizes them. The former is children’s fairy tale stuff; the latter is the only realistic option, and it is hardly non-violent. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. Don’t pay your taxes. You’ll find out whether taxes are voluntary contributions or not. You won’t even have to read The Communist Manifesto to discover what Marx intended here. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. How do you keep Mom and Dad from passing stuff on to their kids? Give them a pamphlet explaining why they shouldn’t? Good luck with that. I think you’d better bring guns. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. Nothing to see here. Surely Marx intended for such confiscations to be 'mostly peaceful' at the least. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. Once the government takes over radio, television, the newspapers, the Internet, and every other method by which we convey our thoughts or our bodies, it will allow us to say anything and go anywhere we want. Wake up, Professor Berger. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. When Marxists are in charge, you’re damn well gonna work. It might even be as a peon in some big, conscripted farm army. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.Remember the scene in the 1985 film The Killing Fields, in which Cambodian communists forced city dwellers into the rice patties? They took Marx seriously. He wanted the state to decide where you live and work. Can that possibly be a non-violent exercise? Alas, methinks I belabor the point. Read Paul Kengor’s The Devil and Karl Marx if you need more evidence that Karl Marx was not just a Red Mr. Rogers. Will someone at Lycoming College call out Professor Berger for intellectual malpractice? Maybe some of his fellow academics? I’m not holding my breath. About the author: Lawrence W.

President Trump’s Ukraine Policy: The Art Of The Deal – OpEd	When President Trump was running for election in 2024, he said he’d end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. That hasn’t happened. Lately, he’s called Ukraine President Zelensky a dictator and even blamed him for starting the war with Russia. It seems he’s tilting toward Russia in his attempt to negotiate an end to the war. President Trump wants a personal victory in that dispute, and for him, a victory would be the end of the war. It matters little to him whether the war ends with Russia pulling out and leaving Ukraine with its old boundaries, or with Russia taking full control of Ukraine, or something in between. He isn’t taking Russia’s side, or Ukraine’s side. He wants a win for himself. At least some of his recent negative comments about Ukraine were intended to lower Zelensky’s expectations about the war’s outcome. That’s the art of the deal. Push for a hard bargain that gives negotiators much less than they would expect so that you can make concessions to make everyone feel like they got a good deal. If Putin thinks the war could go on forever, it will put more strain on the Russian economy and cause unrest at home. He may also worry that Russia will have to pull out without gaining land. At the same time, Zelensky may fear that Ukraine could lose all the territory that Russia claims. Because of these concerns, there is a chance for both sides to negotiate a deal that is better than these outcomes. Meanwhile, President Trump wants to declare a victory by seeing the war end, regardless of its outcome. He has repeatedly stated his goal of ending the war and never stated what he thought would be a just outcome. From a foreign policy standpoint, President Trump may be leaning toward Russia to strengthen Russia’s ties to the US and weaken the bond between Russia and China. But that may not be realistic, especially because everyone—including President Trump—knows that four years from now, someone else will be residing in the White House. The big problem with allowing Russia to keep any of the occupied territories is that it sends a message to Putin that he can use the Russian military to take territory from other sovereign nations, but President Trump apparently does not see it this way. The best outcome from the standpoint of global security would be for NATO to agree that Ukraine can never join in exchange for Russia agreeing to Ukraine’s original boundaries. That may be a tough sell, but President Trump, the deal-maker, could make it appear to be a victory for both sides. The bottom line: President Trump wants a deal, and when it happens, he will declare it a victory for himself, regardless of the terms of the deal.

The Gold At Fort Knox Was Stolen From Americans – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken In recent days, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Senator Rand Paul, and some others have pressed for an audit of the US gold reserves, with a special focus on the gold at Fort Knox. This is perfectly reasonable given that the US gold reserves—which are the property of the US Treasury and not the Federal Reserve—have not undergone even a partial audit in at least forty years. Part of the reason for the audit is to discover if any of the gold has been stolen. The US Mint, the government agency that acts as custodian of the gold, has reported for many years that the official size of the gold reserve is 8,133.46 metric tons of gold. Since there has been no audit in so many decades, though, the Mint’s position is essentially 'trust us, bro.' Trusting federal bureaucrats has never been a particularly wise policy, and this is why there are ongoing demands for some sort of transparent audit. If the total size of the US’s gold holdings is revealed to be a number below the official number, then it will just be the latest reminder that there a great many thieves and incompetents among the people running the US federal government. After all, if there is less gold than reported in the US gold reserves, it was presumably stolen at some point. This would be a fitting destiny for the US government’s gold since much of that was stolen to begin with. When I say 'stolen,' I don’t even mean in the sense that 'taxation is theft' and that the US bought the gold using tax dollars. In truth, the way the US Treasury acquired much of its gold hoard is even more underhanded than ordinary taxation. Rather, it is likely that most of the gold at Fort Knox, as with the US regime’s gold in general, is gold stolen from ordinary Americans as a part of Franklin Roosevelt’s efforts to end the gold standard and confiscate private gold holdings in the United States. That is, the US gold reserves are a legacy of the way the US government reneged on its promises to redeem US dollars in gold. Rather than pay out the gold that was owed to holders of US dollars, the US government hoarded it instead. That stolen gold is what the auditors will be counting if the US government ever allows an honest accounting of the Treasury’s gold reserves. Where Did the Gold at Fort Knox Come From? In his 1994 article for The Journal of Economic Education, economist William C. Wood writes that 'the Fort Knox depository is now an artifact of gold standard days.' He then adds, 'The gold currently in Fort Knox came from the melting of Depression-era gold coins, from lend-lease arrangements in War II, and from government operations under the gold standard.' That reference to 'Depression-era gold coins' is telling. Most of those gold coins were likely the coins confiscated from private owners by the US government following Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102 which outlawed the private ownership of gold. Few Americans owned gold bars, of course, and the gold that was in non-institutional private hands was mostly gold coin. Roosevelt’s edict required that private citizens hand this gold over to the US government in exchange for what was effectively below-market prices. And what if you would rather not give up your property to the US government? Too bad. Moreover, private banks and the central bank held gold in the form of coins for dollar holders who, prior to confiscation, would occasionally present US dollars for redemption in gold. This is, in part, the gold in Fort Knox that that Wood classifies as gold held for 'government operations under the gold standard.' After 1933, however, banks did not need to hold onto any gold coins for this purpose since Roosevelt’s effort to end the gold standard included a prohibition on banks paying out gold. So, these coins ceased to have an immediate market value among banks. Where did all these gold coins end up? Most ended up with the US Treasury after the Treasury seized the Federal Reserve’s gold in 1934. Evidence of this can be found in the nature of the gold that is now held at Fort Knox. Wood further explains that the gold there is not the type of gold usually found in gold bars used for international transactions: 'The gold resulting from melting of coinage has considerably lower quality than the ‘fine’ or ‘good delivery’ gold commonly used in international trade. The majority of the gold in Fort Knox is the lower-quality coin gold.' The legacy of the US regime’s gold theft is not limited to the coins that happened to be in private hands in 1933, however. Much of the gold that is in the US gold reserves today is gold that would have been paid out to the private sector had the US government not reneged in its promises to pay war bonds in gold. The 1934 Default on Gold-Based Liberty Bonds Every time there is a debate over the so-called 'debt ceiling,' various servants of the US regime like Jerome Powell or Janet Yellen claim that 'the United States has never defaulted.' This is a lie. Arguably, it was a default, in the broad sense, when Roosevelt’s regime refused to make good on its obligations to dollar holders under the gold standard. The US also defaulted in a formal and legal sense when it refused to pay its World War I Liberty Bonds in gold as promised. Specifically, in 1934, the United States defaulted on the fourth Liberty Bond. The contracts between debtor and creditor on these bonds was clear. The bonds were to be payable in gold. This presented a big problem for the US, which was facing big debts into the 1930s after the First World War. As described by John Chamberlain: By the time Franklin Roosevelt entered office in 1933, the interest payments alone were draining the treasury of gold; and because the treasury had only $4.2 billion in gold it was obvious there would be no way to pay the principal when it became due in 1938, not to mention meet expenses and other debt obligations. These other debt obligations were substantial. Ever since the 1890s the Treasury had been gold short and had financed this deficit by making new bond issues to attract gold for paying the interest of previous issues. The result was that by 1933 the total debt was $22 billion and the amount of gold needed to pay even the interest on it was soon going to be insufficient. So how did the US government deal with this? Chamberlain notes 'Roosevelt decided to default on the whole of the domestically-held debt by refusing to redeem in gold to Americans.' In other words, thanks to its profligate deficit spending, the US government was running out of gold by the early 1930s. So, the regime defaulted on the gold bonds. The gold that would have passed into private hands was hoarded by the federal government and declared off limits to the public. Much of that gold remains in the US gold reserves today. Defaulting on International Gold Obligations Not all of the US Treasury’s gold is stolen from ordinary Americans. Some is stolen from foreign governments. Another illustration of the dishonesty of the 'we never defaulted' narrative is the fact that the US government defaulted in 1971 on its obligations to foreign government under the Bretton Woods system. That is, rather than pay what was owed to foreign governments, the US government once again decided to steal this gold and simply said 'tough luck' to everyone with a legal claim to the gold. Or, as Treasury Secretary John Connally said at the time, the dollar 'is our currency, but it’s your problem.' US Gold Reserves: A Legacy of Theft and Lies Like most everything else the US government 'owns,' the gold in the US gold reserves is there due to many years of lies, gaslighting, and deception. The gold is there because the US regime defaulted on its debts and reneged on its promises to back dollars in gold. One could argue that the gold stolen from foreign governments was not as egregious in the same way as the gold confiscation of 1933 and 1934. That’s arguably true since the gold 'owned' by foreign central banks was largely founded on defaults and thefts resulting from the abolition of the gold standard in those countries years earlier. Even if this is the case, the fact that Bandit A (the United States government) robbed Bandit B (i.e., foreign governments) that hardly makes Bandit A a hero. If a true auditing team is ever allowed to actually examine the US regime’s gold, it will be examining the evidence of crimes from long ago. The auditors will be counting the gold stolen from our ancestors to enrich the state and its friends.

DOGE’s Dollars To The People – OpEd	President Trump is considering a plan to send 20 percent of the money saved by DOGE back to Americans in the form of household tax refund checks. As the people should know, a similar plan has already been performed in, of all places, California. California Dollars Then In 1987, Gov. George Deukmejian took $1.1 billion in surplus state money and sent rebate checks to taxpayers. The governor was pleased to 'protect this money for the taxpayers' and honor, 'the spending limit enacted by the voters through the initiative process,' a reference to the People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, Proposition 13 on the 1978 ballot. At the time, soaring property taxes burdened working families and threatened to toss the elderly out of their homes. While this was going on, the state enjoyed a budget surplus of $2.5 billion that would rise to more than $7 billion, about half the state budget. Gov. Jerry Brown blasted Proposition 13 as 'a rip-off' but it passed in a landslide, with 65 percent of the vote. Gov. Brown then proclaimed himself a 'born-again tax cutter' and proclaimed support for the measure, which did not 'cut' taxes. The measure only limited the rate at which property taxes could be increased. Proposition 13 mandated no new state spending and required no new state government hires. Even so, politicians and bureaucrats blame the measure for fiscal problems that actually stem from waste and fraud. The People’s Initiative had been in place for more than a decade but did not prevent California from boasting a budget surplus in 1987. That year, Gov. Deukmejian refunded surplus money to the people. The checks were signed by State Controller Gray Davis, elected governor in 1998 and recalled in 2003, giving way to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. No payback to the people occurred under him or any governor since. In 2017, recurring Gov. Jerry Brown branded as 'freeloaders' those who opposed a transportation package that nearly doubled Californians’ gas taxes. So Brown, a three-time presidential candidate, wasn’t a 'born-again tax-cutter' after all. California Dollars Now The administration of Gavin Newsom, elected in 2018, deployed some of the highest income and sales taxes in all 50 states. In the style of Proposition 13, embattled Californians fought back with the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which gave voters the final approval on future taxes and fees imposed by state and local governments. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the Nov. 5, 2024 ballot, but Gov. Newsom and mentor Jerry Brown teamed up to get it taken off the ballot. Under Gov. Newsom, no money from any budget surplus would be coming back to taxpayers. That leaves government waste as a source for the funds—in the style of the DOGE plan. On this front, California abounds in possibilities. If University of California President Janet Napolitano can hide $175,000,000, as intrepid state auditor Elaine Howle discovered, there could be a lot more left to find. The UC’s vast DEI bureaucracy, which violates the voter-approved California Civil Rights Initiative, is another possible source of funds for the people. California’s vaunted bullet train is well into the billions, with no riders but a Sacramento headquarters and three regional offices. The unelected Coastal Commission rides roughshod over property rights and does nothing to mitigate wildfires. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) does little to mitigate pollution but punishes the workers by ramping up the cost of gasoline. Such counterproductive, unaccountable bureaucracies could form a source of reparations for the people. George Deukmejian, who passed away in 2018, showed that it is possible to return money to the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place. If Gov. Newsom follows suit, that could slow the exodus of workers and businesses from California and perhaps prompt some to return.

US Shows Interest In Bolstering Ties With Central Asian States	(Eurasia.net) -- When it comes to Eurasia, the Trump administration has acted quickly to reverse the foreign policy of its predecessor, underscored by moves to foster a rapid thaw in relations with Russia. But there is one Biden-era legacy that the Trump State Department seems intent on preserving, an initiative to increase US influence in Central Asia known as the C5+1 format. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the US interest in building up the C5+1 framework during a February 21 talk with Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov of Uzbekistan. According to a State Department spokesperson, Rubio 'discussed continued cooperation, including through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, in support of a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' The main driver of US interest in Central Asia is the region’s abundant natural resources, not only oil and natural gas, but also minerals and rare earths used in high-tech devices and for clean energy and defense purposes. A geographic consideration may also factor into the US policy calculus: Central Asian states sit on China’s western border, and an avowed aim of Trump’s second term is containing Chinese global economic influence. Rubio in his discussion with his Uzbek counterpart specifically mentioned that 'the United States looks forward to working with Uzbekistan to highlight mutually beneficial opportunities for investment in critical minerals and US civil nuclear energy technologies.' Saidov indicated that Uzbekistan was eager to engage with the United States, describing his conversation with Rubio as 'candid and productive.' In a statement posted on Telegram, he added that Uzbekistan would work to expand bilateral ties 'in all spheres without an exception,' focusing on 'building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions [and] ensuring prosperous development.' Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are considered the lynchpin states within the C5+1 context. Then-secretary of state John Kerry initiated the C5+1 format in 2015. But the Biden administration significantly elevated the framework’s status by convening the first-ever presidential-level summit of C5+1 leaders in 2023. The following year, the Biden administration launched a related initiative, dubbed the B5+1 process, to specifically promote trade and investment. The Rubio-Saidov discussion indicated that the United States will remain committed to backing Uzbek efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organization. Prior to Trump’s return to the White House, the two countries inked an agreement in December to expand mutual market access. US officials at that time hailed the Uzbek government’s 'significant progress' in opening the country’s economy. The February 21 talks also confirmed that Uzbekistan will work with the United States on the repatriation of illegal Uzbek migrants. Rubio thanked Saidov for Uzbekistan’s 'cooperation in curbing illegal migration.' Seven Uzbek deportees arrived in Tashkent on February 24, Uzbek media reported. The US has reportedly shipped additional Uzbek deportees to Panama and Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan is taking the lead on regional efforts to engage the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Tashkent hopes that by pulling Afghanistan into a closer trade orbit with Central Asia, Uzbek officials and their counterparts from other regional states can increase their negotiating leverage with the Taliban on matters of regional concern, in particular Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa canal, a project that could upset Central Asia’s already delicate water resources balance. A high-level Taliban delegation held trade talks in Tashkent on February 22 resulting in agreements covering railroad improvements, the creation of a free trade zone on the Uzbek-Afghan frontier, de-regulation of agricultural exports, mining and oil & gas development and a power transmission line project.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JjJmys_ymek1	2025-02-26T16:50:14-08:00	
The Start Of A US Government Exit From Supporting Coronavirus Sho...	Even people who took one, two, or three experimental coronavirus 'vaccine' shots during the height of the coronavirus scare are saying 'nope' to taking any more 'boosters.' Yet, behind the scenes, the United States government has kept funding companies in the pharmaceutical industry to continue developing new iterations of the unpopular 'vaccines.' This situation may be changing. A new action by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. puts a temporary halt to US support for the development of a pill form of coronavirus 'vaccine.' This could be the start of an exit of the US altogether from aiding coronavirus 'vaccine' development and, possibly, from aiding other drug development as well. Emma Colton provided in a Tuesday Fox News article details regarding how Kennedy 'issued a 90-day stop-work order on Friday related to the HHS contract with American biotech company Vaxart Inc., which is working to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine that can be taken orally.' 'Kennedy and other health officials,' further wrote Colton, are 'set to examine the study’s initial findings over the next 90 days before deciding on next steps.' This pause, Colton notes, prevents Vaxart from invoicing of the US government for 230 million dollars for clinical trials. The US government has been a key participant in the experimental coronavirus shots push. President Donald Trump helped ramp it up with the creation of Operation Warp Speed to develop coronavirus shots and then inject them quickly into as many people as possible. President Joe Biden and politicians on the state and local level also sought to increase 'demand' for the shots by imposing mandates that people take them in order to keep their jobs, enter stores and other locations, or otherwise proceed with their ordinary activities. Kennedy’s initiation of a pause in Vaxart support, as well as his previous action indicating the US government will move from promoting that people take vaccines to encouraging people to exercise informed consent in regard to vaccines, suggest a major shift in US policy is underway. Since Friday, the price of Vaxart stock has been down about 30 percent. While this share price drop likely would have worried prior Health and Human Services secretaries who saw themselves as partners with the pharmaceutical industry, Kennedy seems to have other motivations that involve instead placing emphasis on priorities including advancing the health of Americans and ensuring his department has independence from special interests — including pharmaceutical companies.

Anthropology For Kids And Visual Assembly Are Reimagining Work, E...	These interactive books and events encourage fresh perspectives on long-standing social systems. in adapting to societal change, and mental health issues that can lead to suicide and mass shootings. The challenges associated with inflexible thinking have become more evident post-pandemic. 'While rates of depression, anxiety, and mental health conditions have increased in the general population during this time of rapid change, individuals with greater inflexible thinking have had the most difficulty adapting to our continuously changing environment,' explains Psychiatry Online. No one is insusceptible to cognitive inflexibility. The Society for Personality and Social Psychology theorizes that 'once you've become accustomed to a particular simplification of reality, you will have trouble switching to a new one even when it would be more useful to do so. Switching is hard because it takes effort to reconfigure how to think about a problem.' The works of artist and writer Nika Dubrovsky encourage flexible thinking, particularly in how we perceive firmly established social structures. Her project Anthropology for Kids hopes to inspire young people to think outside the box on subjects like work, jobs, education, food, money, beauty, and art. The importance of this work is underscored by evidence suggesting that efforts to increase cognitive flexibility early in life may have lifelong benefits. Anthropology for Kids's books are inspired by what the website refers to as the 'democratic Soviet children's literature.' This genre, invented in the 1920s, served 'as a means to communicate with the general population in a language that everybody could share.' Anthropology for Kids's books contain spaces for readers to fill with drawings and writings. This is intended to provoke thought on 'questions that every human needs to have an opinion on,' Dubrovsky says. In 1990, Dubrovsky immigrated to the U.S. from Saint Petersburg, Russia. As a migrant in New York and the mother of a young boy, she 'spent a lot of time trying to figure out how the education system works in the U.S. and what education is [in the first place],' she explains. Dubrovsky's late husband, the anthropologist and author David Graeber, helped expand her knowledge of anthropology, which she saw as 'the best possible education for kids, because that's the way to [stop] reproducing all of our patriarchal, Eurocentric ideas about things like family, money, and property.' The spirit of open-ended anthropological inquiry meshed well with Dubrovsky's background in contemporary art, which Walker Art Center's website describes as art that 'reflects the complex issues that shape our diverse, global, and rapidly changing world.' The site adds that 'many contemporary artists explore personal or cultural identity, offer critiques of social and institutional structures, or even attempt to redefine art itself. In the process, they often raise difficult or thought-provoking questions without providing easy answers.' In the early 2000s, Dubrovsky began fusing art with anthropology by creating interactive workbooks for her young son. This evolved into Anthropology for Kids, which also holds workshops where participants are encouraged to work with the project's books as a group. In 2024, MIT Press published Cities Made Differently, the first English-language Anthropology for Kids book. This is the first in a three-book series that also aims to explore new perspectives on museums and artists. An outgrowth of Anthropology for Kids called Visual Assembly emerged during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the U.S. in 2020. The website for the Museum of Care, which honors the legacy of Dubrovsky's late husband, describes Visual Assembly as 'a democratic form of creative collaboration used to reimagine new ways to run and organize our social systems.' While it uses artistic tools, it 'is not only an art project. Mainly it is about a public debate on how to rearrange' social institutions and services like education and health care. A Visual Assembly event in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in February 2025 typifies these experiences: A multigenerational, culturally diverse group of approximately 20 participants sat at a table covered with a map of an imaginary city. Attendees collectively imagined and designed the city they would like to inhabit. Visual Assembly events have been held in locales like Spain, Iceland, Germany, Cuba, New York, and London. 'It's interesting how people from very different backgrounds have similar reactions to the [same] questions,' Dubrovsky notes. 'For example, when people imagine dystopian spaces, [their descriptions] are always poetic, but [when Visual Assembly participants] imagine utopian spaces, they're very practical. They immediately start to think, 'How would we produce our food? Where would we deal with our trash?'' Dubrovsky feels that these commonalities among event participants indicate that people of different cultures and ideologies can build grassroots social spaces together. 'If we just started to provide people with the spaces to think together and share their ideas about how they can do that, maybe [we would discover] that many more people than we think agree with each other. All humans need the same things, like kindergartens, hospitals, and housing. It's interesting to see [similarities in] ideas of what an ideal society [would look like when] we refrain from using [left-versus-right] language and start talking to people just as people. That's what children's literature does, and that's what anthropology has always done because it's trying to figure out the differences between cultures and groups of people. But also it's the belief that everyone is a human being, so we're all fundamentally very similar to each other.'

Apple Strikes Deal With Indonesia, Secures Future Market Access F...	By Tria Dianti A new agreement between Apple Inc. and Indonesia will allow the tech giant to sell the iPhone16 in the country, a senior government official said, resolving a dispute over investment requirements that led Jakarta to ban the model. The deal commits Apple to hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments, said Indonesian Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita. Those include the establishment of a research and development center, integration of Indonesian suppliers into its global manufacturing network, and expansion of education and technology programs. The agreement allows Apple to regain compliance with Indonesia’s Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certification, a rule mandating that foreign tech companies invest in the country in exchange for market access. 'The talks were challenging until the very last 15 minutes,' Agus told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday. 'But the memorandum of understanding has now been signed electronically on a provisional basis.' For Apple, the agreement represents a win in Southeast Asia’s largest country, where smartphone penetration is rapidly increasing. The iPhone 16 is expected to hit Indonesian stores soon after Apple secures the necessary certification and distribution permits from the government. 'Sales could begin as early as next month,' Agus said, though he declined to provide a specific date. The 2017 regulation requires that 40% of smartphones sold in Indonesia use domestically sourced components. The policy is part of Indonesia’s push to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports. The dispute escalated in late 2024, when Apple failed to meet its previous investment commitments under the regulation, prompting Indonesian regulators to block sales of the iPhone 16. Unlike rivals such as Samsung and Oppo, which have built local assembly plants, Apple had chosen to fulfill its obligations through innovation investments, a strategy that fell short of government expectations. With iPhone sales halted, Apple entered negotiations with the Ministry of Industry, culminating in this agreement, which the government said was a fresh investment cycle rather than a continuation of past obligations. Under the new deal, Apple has pledged U.S. $160 million in hard cash investments and will deepen its supply-chain presence in Indonesia, the industry ministry said in a statement. The company will bring in Luxshare, a key supplier in its global supply network, to invest $150 million in a new manufacturing facility in Batam, an industrial hub near Singapore. The plant will produce AirTag accessories, with Indonesia set to become the supplier for 65% of the global AirTag market. An AirTag is a tracking device that when attached to a user’s belongings, such as keys, helps the user find the item. Apple has also agreed to source AirTag batteries from Indonesian manufacturers, further embedding local suppliers into its ecosystem, the industry ministry said. Additionally, Apple is expanding production in Bandung, where local company Long Harmony will manufacture mesh fabric for AirPods Max, making it an official part of the company’s global supply network. These investments represent a change in Apple’s approach to meeting Indonesia’s local content requirements, moving beyond software and education programs to deeper supply chain involvement. One of the most significant commitments in the agreement is Apple’s decision to establish a research and development center in Indonesia, focused on software innovation, the ministry said. It will be Apple’s first research and development center in Asia and only the second outside the United States, after Brazil. The facility will partner with 15 leading Indonesian universities, including Bandung Institute of Technology and University of Indonesia, and will also be part of the Indonesia Chip Design Collaborative Center (ICDEC), an initiative aimed at strengthening Indonesia’s presence in the semiconductor and chip design industry, it said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jg8wE549_9fD	2025-02-26T16:29:42-08:00	
Bosnia’s Defiant Serb Leader Dodik Sentenced To One Year In Priso...	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- Bosnia's Serb political leader Milorad Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office by a Bosnian court on Wednesday. In defiant remarks to supporters, Dodik responded by vowing to ignore the rulings of the judiciary in Sarajevo – and urging them to do the same. Rarely has Bosnia and Herzegovina’s unity appeared so fragile, nearly 30 years after the signing of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. Dodik, president of Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb entity in the deeply divided country, was ordered to serve one year in prison and banned from public office for six years by a Sarajevo court for defying the decisions of the High Representative, the international official responsible for overseeing the country’s post-war peace agreement. 'They say I am guilty. There is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. What matters is that you are here,' Dodik told his supporters, who had gathered outside the National Assembly building in Banja Luka, the largest city in Republika Srpska. He had refused to travel to Sarajevo for the verdict, having previously stated that he would reject the court’s ruling 'whatever it may be'. Dobik can lodge an appeal against the verdict, although it remains unclear if he will. Republika Srpska defiance In the summer of 2023, Republika Srpska's National Assembly passed laws refusing to recognise the High Representative’s decisions, barring their publication in the Official Gazette, and preventing their enforcement within the entity. In response, the High Representative introduced amendments to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s criminal code, making non-compliance with his rulings a criminal offence. Ahead of the verdict, thousands of people gathered in Banja Luka, waving banners in support of Republika Srpska and its president: 'Today Dodik, tomorrow all of us', 'Conviction of the president, attack on Republika Srpska', and 'Srpska is our pride, the president is our protector'. On Tuesday, Republika Srpska's National Assembly launched a two-day emergency session in which Serb representatives were instructed to block decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina state institutions. Lawmakers are also expected to vote today on resolutions rejecting the verdict and refusing to recognise the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the country’s highest judicial authority. Rising regional tensions A long-time ally of the Kremlin, Dodik has ruled Republika Srpska unchallenged since the mid-2000s and has regularly threatened to push for the Serb entity’s secession. His hardline stance has always been backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who recently denounced what he called 'political attacks' against the RS leader. 'We need stability in the Balkans. This is precisely what President Dodik has ensured over the years: a stable and prosperous Republika Srpska,' Orbán declared on X just over a week ago. According to Bosnian media reports, members of Hungary’s special police forces have arrived in the Serb entity in recent days. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has convened a National Security Council meeting in response to the verdict and is expected to travel to Banja Luka later today. Vučić, who is facing growing protests in Serbia, appears keen to seize the moment and use pan-Serb ethnic solidarity as a political lifeline to deflect from intense domestic pressure. A major anti-corruption demonstration is planned for Saturday in Niš, while a general strike has been called for next week.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoWUK23tz2V7	2025-02-26T16:26:04-08:00	
RFE/RL Obtains Copy Of US-Ukraine Minerals Deal	By Ray Furlong and RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed a deal to allow the United States access to its natural resources, a major agreement that comes amid rapid diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s three-year full-scale war against Kyiv. The deal, a copy of which was obtained by RFE/RL, does not address key questions and leaves most details to be provided by a future agreement. It does not contain specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand by Kyiv. The agreement also does not specify whether the United States would continue to supply military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine. Key Points No Security Guarantees: The deal supports Ukraine’s pursuit of security assurances but doesn’t provide them Resource Development: Ukraine and the U.S. will jointly develop Ukraine's natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas Reconstruction Fund: A joint fund will receive 50% of Ukraine’s state-owned resource revenues Reinvestment: Fund profits will be reinvested 'at least annually' for Ukraine’s economic recovery Pending Details: Governance and ownership specifics will be negotiated later The text of the deal begins by noting that Washington 'has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion.' But it makes no mention of Washington’s demand for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from accessing Ukraine’s mineral wealth that was seen in an earlier draft of the deal. This was a point that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was unacceptable. No Security Guarantees for Ukraine The agreement does not include firm U.S. security pledges. But it does say that the United States 'supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees.' It also says that Washington 'will maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.' Beyond these general statements, the main body of the agreement concerns the establishment of a jointly owned Reconstruction Investment Fund. Ukraine has agreed to put 50 percent of future revenues from its government-owned natural resources into the fund. It says this relates to mineral wealth, oil, and gas, as well as related revenues from liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and ports. It explicitly states that 'such future sources of revenues do not include the current sources of revenues which are already part of the general budget revenues of Ukraine.' Money from the fund will be reinvested in Ukraine 'at least annually.' Unanswered Questions There are many questions which have not been answered. The agreement states these will be addressed in a future agreement, which working groups will start negotiating 'without delay.' Among these key points is how the joint ownership of the fund will break down, suggesting it may not be a simple 50-50. Details of the fund’s 'governance and operation' are also still to be resolved. The deal states that neither party can 'sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of' any part of the fund without agreement from the other party. In other words, neither side can unilaterally withdraw. The agreement says it is subject to approval by Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, but does not mention Congressional sign off. Ukrainian lawmaker Bohdan Kytsak, from Zelenskyy’s ruling Servant of the People party, told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that the deal presented potential benefits for the economy. 'This requires a huge number of specialists, scientific research, and the emergence of new technologies,' he said, adding that U.S. investment could create a 'new economy.' A former economic adviser to Zelenskyy, Oleh Ustenko, told RFE/RL that 'symbolism plays a larger role here than financial and economic issues.' For U.S. President Donald Trump this may represent a political win. He has pushed hard for the deal and now he has got it. For Zelenskyy, a scrap awaits over the details. For now, the deal could ease a bitter and public rift that saw Trump brand him a 'dictator.' Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL. He has reported for RFE/RL from the Balkans, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and elsewhere since joining the company in 2014. He previously worked for 17 years for the BBC as a foreign correspondent in Prague and Berlin, and as a roving international reporter across Europe and the former Soviet Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoHs3l1_N3P3	2025-02-26T16:24:30-08:00	
US, Ukraine To Sign Minerals Deal, But Security Issues Unsettled	By Ken Bredemeier President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a deal giving the United States substantial rights to Kyiv’s lucrative rare earth minerals and to compensate Washington for weapons sent to Ukraine to fight Russia’s three-year war of aggression. Trump, at the first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term, said that Zelenskyy will be at the White House on Friday to sign the pact and for discussions about the state of the war. Trump said the deal 'brings us great wealth,' but said his first goal is to end the war, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians. 'My No. 2 thing is to get paid back,' Trump said of the more than $100 billion in munitions Washington has shipped to Kyiv to support its fighters. 'Without our equipment, that [war] would have been over very quickly,' with Russia overrunning Ukraine. As it is, Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has vowed to not give any of it back in a would-be peace settlement. Trump said he expects to eventually reach a deal with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting. Trump initiated talks with Putin about ending the conflict but the first discussions last week between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, excluded Ukrainian and European officials. 'Because I got elected, this war is going to come to an end,' Trump declared. He said Putin 'had no intention of settling this. We’re going to have a deal.' But he said Ukraine 'could forget about' joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a peace settlement. In Kyiv, Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework for the rare earth mineral deal was complete, but that U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital have yet to be settled. Trump has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Ukraine. Last year, he refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war. Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator, without blaming Putin for the invasion. The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid as a way to fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. Zelenskyy says the U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be repaid but now has agreed to the deal for the rare earth minerals needed for manufacturing technology products. Zelenskyy said he expects to have wide-ranging substantive discussions with Trump. 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader said he wants to know whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments and whether Washington plans to lift its economic sanctions on Russian entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin. Elements of the deal Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s public television channel that the agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine. Under terms of the deal, the plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil and gas to create a 'stable and economically prosperous Ukraine' if the war is ended, and half to a U.S.-controlled fund. The New York Times reported the economic agreement includes a line that says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,' but does not spell out details on what that might entail. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Wednesday in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled. European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an American 'backstop' of military assistance, such as American satellite surveillance, air defense or air force support. Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan but on Wednesday called the peacekeeping force 'a good thing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoQJaVzJofTn	2025-02-26T16:22:08-08:00	
Romania Indicts Right-Wing Presidential Hopeful Georgescu	By Marian Chiriac Romanian prosecutors on Wednesday indicted right-wing presidential candidate Calin Georgescu on six charges, including incitement to undermine the constitutional order, spreading false information, and founding an anti-Semitic organisation. Georgescu, a populist politician known for his NATO-sceptic and pro-Russian views, faces ten to 20 years in prison if convicted, and may be barred from May’s re-run presidential election. He was leading in the first round of the initial election last November before it was annulled by the Constitutional Court. Police initially took Georgescu for questioning after stopping him in traffic in Bucharest on Tuesday. 'Calin Georgescu was going to file his new candidacy for the presidency …. The system stopped him in traffic and he was pulled over for questioning at the Prosecutor General’s Office! Where is democracy, where are the partners who must defend democracy?' Georgescu’s communications team posted on Facebook. Dozens of people, including far-right politicians in parliament, protested in front of the General Prosecutor’s Office against what they described as his 'abusive detention' and 'abuse by the totalitarian state'. Earlier, police and prosecutors started searches in 47 sites in an investigation related to a group of 27 people for allegedly 'acting against Romania’s constitutional order', and the 'creation of an organisation which spreads fascist, racist and xenophobic messages'. Around noon on Wednesday, prosecutors announced the confiscation of some 1 million euros and various weapons from people who were searched. Although prosecutors did not name Georgescu or his aides in their statement, shortly after news of the searches broke, Georgescu claimed the raids were aimed at blocking his new presidential bid. Georgescu won the first round of the presidential elections in November, signalling that EU-member Romania was joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. His unexpected success led the Constitutional Court in December to order a re-run of the vote, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', likely referring to Russia. Georgescu, known for his advocacy of sovereignty and traditional values, has gained support among those disillusioned with the current political landscape. The latest polls say he leads in voting intentions. Romania is to re-run the election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. His cause has also received unexpected support from the Trump administration in the US. US Vice-President JD Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, accused EU leaders of engaging in 'rampant censorship' and 'cancelling elections, as recently occurred in Romania'. Elon Musk amplified these claims on his social media platform, X, where he criticised the annulment of the elections and called the head of Romania’s Constitutional Court a 'tyrant'. Musk also shared content from Georgescu supporters and far-right groups.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jv_opjWxq7zn	2025-02-26T16:14:34-08:00	
The Western Media’s Israel-Palestine Double Standard – OpEd	America and Israel’s manipulation of the violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, exaggerating crimes against Israelis or Jews and ignoring those that target Palestinians and Muslims, should anger the entire world, especially the people of the Middle East. Unfortunately, this disparity does not get much attention in either the US or Israel. But the gap between how the two are reported is immorally immense. Last Thursday, explosions destroyed three empty civilian buses in separate car parks in Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. Israeli police immediately called it a terrorist attack. Even though no one was hurt, the nonlethal attacks dominated media reports in America and Israel. Meanwhile, barely reported by any American mainstream media is the daily carnage in Gaza. Israel’s violence in the Strip takes place 24 hours a day, every day, meaning it does not fit the journalistic definition of 'news' — that of being 'new.' Under that cloud is another wave of ongoing violence being carried out by the Israeli security services and armed Jewish settlers against West Bank Palestinians. Little is being reported. It is almost like nothing is taking place. But it is happening. Daily. The day before the attacks on the three empty buses, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that Israeli forces had killed at least three Palestinians in an attack on a house in the Far’a refugee camp. The mainstream American media ignored this. Had the victims been Israeli, the reporting would likely have been hysterical. B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog staffed by Jews and Arabs, continues to persevere despite an ongoing campaign of harassment, beatings and bullying by Israeli security forces. It reports on violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Israel itself, but its findings are often ignored. This month, for example, B’Tselem published a report into the events of Dec. 19, 2024. At about 10 a.m. that day, two vehicles with Palestinian license plates drove into the market street, a central thoroughfare in Balata Refugee Camp in Nablus. Local security signaled for the unknown buses to stop and that is when Israeli soldiers emerged from the vehicles and began firing indiscriminately, wounding six people and killing two. Halimah Abu Leil, 80, who was shopping for vegetables in the market, was shot and killed. The Israeli attack lasted more than two hours. Soldiers blocked all attempts to take the injured Palestinians to hospital for treatment. The Israelis entered a nearby home, expelled the family that lived there and used it as a command center. They used one of the family’s daughters, Lara Sawalmeh, as a human shield, stationing her at the front door as they shot at residents from the home’s windows. A neighbor, Qusai Al-Saruji, peeked out of the door of his balcony to check if the raid was over so that he could go to work. He was shot dead, the B’Tselem investigators reported. Even with all that detail confirmed by a highly respected agency, nothing was reported by the Western news reporters who work out of Jerusalem under Israeli government supervision. In another incident last year, Israeli forces went on a campaign of destruction in Tulkarem refugee camp. B’Tselem reported that special forces personnel arrived at the camp at about 12.30 p.m. on Sept. 10 in civilian vehicles with Palestinian license plates. They were later joined by additional military, border police and Shin Bet forces, who brought bulldozers. The purpose? To dig up the streets, smash Palestinian-owned cars parked on the side of the road and block the entrances to homes. The destruction was so widespread it turned much of the area into rubble. As residents returned to their homes on hearing about the raid, the Israeli forces shot at them. Two young Palestinians were killed. They were Ahmad Majdubah, 25, who was trying to close the gate of his family’s car wash to go home, and Hibat Allah ‘Obeid, 21, who stepped out of her house with her mother to see what was happening. Also, in the summer of 2024, Israeli forces repeatedly entered Hebron and injured dozens of Palestinians. B’Tselem volunteers took testimony from 25 of the victims who were abused by Israeli soldiers between May and August last year. They describe acts of violence, humiliation and abuse by Israeli soldiers against men, women, teenagers and children. The victims gave harrowing accounts of physical and psychological abuse, including beatings, whippings, cigarettes being put out on their bodies, blows to their genitals, injections of an unidentified substance, prolonged binding and blindfolding, threats, insults and more. Soldiers appeared to select the victims arbitrarily as they went about their daily lives. In most cases, they were taken away to military facilities, where the worst of the abuse occurred. None of the victims were suspected of or prosecuted for any offense. They were mostly released immediately after being assaulted, with many requiring medical treatment. Only two victims were arrested and both were released without charge within days. Nearly every Palestinian city is being targeted by Israeli forces and Palestinians are being killed every week. But where are the media reports? These incidents are ignored. Why? Because terrorism against Palestinians is not considered news by the mainstream Western news media and many Western reporters are forced to work under the confines of Israeli government censorship. They lack the courage to speak out against the inhumanity occurring right before their eyes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JvZTyabhfd6j	2025-02-26T16:11:11-08:00	
Syria After Assad: Addressing Chemical Weapons And Accountability...	By Shravishtha Ajaykumar Despite a Sunni majority in Syria, the Assad regime has managed to maintain its dominance through a combination of autocratic and kleptocratic rule, using patronage to secure loyalty. On 8 December 2024, following a 10-day uprising, Bashar al-Assad, son of Hafez al-Assad, was brought down along with the entire Assad Regime. The Syrian Civil War has highlighted the human tragedy and the failure of many international conventions aimed at preventing the use of banned weapons, including chemical warfare. Despite global prohibitions and condemnation, several Syrian actors have been known to deploy these weapons against protestors and civilians on multiple occasions. With the formation of a new Syrian government, the issue of chemical weapons has assumed a renewed urgency in making Syria a state free of such weapons. Bashar al-Assad's regime and chemical warfare Chemical warfare has seen use across multiple incidents of warfare throughout history. During World War I, several countries employed chlorine and mustard gases, resulting in at least 1.3 million people being affected and the death of over 90,000 people. The tragedies of the War led to many negotiations around the use and disuse of chemical weapons, leading to the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1993, officiating an agreement aimed at the cessation of the use of chemical weapons, and the elimination of their resurfacing. Nevertheless, between 1993 and 2020, there have been over 300 cases of chemical weapons use. One such prominent case was the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam, allegedly ordered by his cousin and North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un, and the 2018 assassination of Sergei Skripal, allegedly by the Russian State. Key incidents of chemical weapon use The Syrian civil war also sought to disillusion the world on the mitigation of such atrocities. As the Syrian opposition started gaining ground, the Assad regime threatened and terrified of losing power, resorted to using chemical weapons to preserve its authority and control the dissidents. In particular, sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas were used indiscriminately against military and civilian infrastructures. There have been 13 isolated attacks in Syria attributed to different actors from 2013 to 2020. Table 1: Alleged Cases of Chemical Weapon Use in Syria 2013-2020 DateAlleged PerpetratorInjured/Affected3/23/2019Unknown2111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1011/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/11/2016Free Syrian Army2411/3/2016Ansar al-Din Front, Authenticity and Development Front, Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement2910/30/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusrah Front, Free Syrian Army358/16/2016Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)58/2/2016Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement204/7/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Free Syrian Army, Jaysh al-Islam (Syria)298/21/2015Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)244/11/2014Al-Nusrah Front1013/19/2013Unknown130Source: Global Terrorism Database Three cases of chemical weapons in civilian areas have left a global impact. The first major chemical weapons attack in the Syrian Civil War took place during the Ghouta attack in 2013. Rockets armed with sarin gas were shot from the early morning hours into rebel-controlled sectors of Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, resulting in the death of 1500 people. The Ghouta attack shocked the international community, as it represented a clear violation of the CWC and raised alarms about the regime’s willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Although Assad’s regime denied responsibility, alleging that insurgents were responsible for the attack, growing evidence from the United Nations (UN) investigators suggested that Assad’s forces perpetrated the crime. In 2017, sarin was also found in Khan Shaykhun, where another rebel stronghold was bombed, killing over 80 people, including children. Responding to that attack, the US conducted missile strikes, launching 59 tomahawk missiles on the assumed origin of the chemical attack, the Shayrat Airbase. Notwithstanding the US actions and the international community’s condemnation, the resolution was not adopted by the UN Security Council due to Russia’s use of Veto, where the Assad regime appeared unaffected, continuing its use of chemical weapons in later incidents. In 2018, a chlorine gas assault in the city of Douma, Eastern Ghouta district, killed 42 individuals in a civilian area in an attempt to target a rebel base. The Syrian regime had been trying to achieve a recapture of the region, and the chemical attack took place as a prelude to a concerted effort to annex the territory. The attack was deployed amid an evacuation agreement, impacting civilians who were attempting to leave an area under attack. The international community, including the United States (US), France, and the United Kingdom (UK), condemned the attack, accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) dispatched a fact-finding mission (FFM) to examine the incident. Following that rebuke, the US, UK, and France conducted airstrikes against facilities that they alleged were associated with the Syrian chemical weapons effort. Despite the retaliatory strikes, the Assad regime, while denying liability for the attack, instead attributed it to the rebels, and the airstrikes again failed to interrupt the regime's activities. The end of the Assad regime, accountability, and enforcement Despite such numerous reports, investigations, and condemnations, including those by the UN and OPCW, Assad's government faced little consequence for its actions. Efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable was met with significant challenges, including the consistent opposing positions from allied nations such as Russia, which repeatedly vetoed proposed actions in the United Nations Security Council. While the regime's fall may be considered a geopolitical win, it does not negate the need to hold defence forces accountable for war crimes that particularly used chemical weapons against civilians. The non-enforcement of the CWC and the resistance to international retaliation have revealed the flaws in the fundamentals of the CWC and other international conventions. The voluntary nature and lack of enforcement rules in such frameworks make them little more than symbolic gestures, failing to translate into meaningful action or real accountability. The Syrian case conveys that international legal frameworks should be established and actively enforced through attribution and accountability globally, and domestically. Despite the end of the Assad Regime, Syria still contains stockpiles of chemical weapons and now must clear them to ensure such weapon use is not seen in the future. The CWC must be strengthened, and its enforcement must be redefined to prevent future tragedies. First, increasing the attribution of chemical attacks is essential. Investigative bodies like the OPCW must be better equipped to gather irrefutable evidence and ensure that perpetrators are identified; sub-committees like the FFM and JIM (Joint investigative mechanisms) must perform regular check-ins, especially in the trade and access of materials that help formulate chemical weapons and ensure accountability in not just the case of use, but also in the supply chains routed to those using chemical weapons. In addition to the control and monitoring of chemicals, the removal and control of the infrastructure for manufacturing chemical weapons is equally important. Those suspected of resuming or resurrecting their production must be under the international community’s immediate radar while invoking sanctions. Countries that are behind procurers of iodine strokes, much like in the situation of Syria with Iran and Russia, should face diplomatic, financial, and judicial repercussions. Strengthening the CWC’s attribution, accountability, and international cooperation mechanisms are vital in holding perpetrators accountable and deterring future violations. As Syria recovers from the Assad regime, the international community must prioritise the destruction of its remaining chemical weapons stockpiles. Only through robust monitoring, stricter controls on chemical precursors, and a unified global response can we prevent further atrocities and guarantee that chemical weapons will never again be used as a tool of war.

Rare Earth Minerals Front And Center In The Push For Peace In Ukr...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- A few weeks ago, rare earth elements, critical minerals, and other natural resources seemed like just one more factor in efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine. Now they are front and center, a dominant focus of U.S. talks with Kyiv and a prominent vein of the intensifying diplomacy that also involves Moscow, the European Union, and others as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. There were strong indications on February 25 that an agreement on a framework deal had been reached and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be in Washington later this week to sign it. The deal would cover the joint development of Ukraine’s critical minerals and other natural resources, such as oil and gas, according to multiple news reports quoting unidentified sources in the Ukrainian government. The reports said the agreement was a framework for a broad economic deal that would include the exploitation of rare earth minerals. It was not immediately clear whether the agreement carries any specific U.S. security guarantees or if Washington has committed to sending additional military aid, Reuters reported. But one Ukrainian government official quoted by the Associated Press said that Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs. There was no formal confirmation from the U.S. side, but President Donald Trump said Zelenskyy wants to come to Washington to sign the deal. 'I hear that. I hear that he's coming on Friday,' Trump told reporters at the White House, adding that Zelenskyy 'would like to sign it together with me' and the deal on had been 'pretty much negotiated.' Bloomberg reported earlier that Ukraine’s cabinet is expected to recommend on February 26 that the deal be signed, and AFP quoted a senior Ukrainian official as saying the government was 'working on the details' and 'considering a visit to Washington for Friday to sign the agreement.' Reuters cited two sources it did not identify as saying Zelenskyy plans to travel to Washington on February 28 to meet with Trump. The Financial Times cited Ukrainian officials as saying Kyiv is now ready to sign the agreement after the United States 'dropped demands for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from exploiting the resources.' It said the draft deal did not include specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s assault, which had been one of Kyiv’s complaints about previous versions. The reports of agreement on the terms came less than a month after Trump said on February 3 that his administration was 'looking to a do a deal with Ukraine to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.' His remarks sketched the bare outlines of a trade-off: U.S. aid, including the tens of billions of dollars in mostly military support that Washington has already provided, in exchange for access to critical minerals. Since then, wrangling over a potential deal played into discussions at the February 14-16 Munich Security Conference and a starkly public exchange of criticism between Trump and Zelenskyy, who said he had rejected an initial U.S. proposal due in part to a lack of concrete security guarantees. Trump Expecting Zelenskyy To Sign Mineral Deal The White House redoubled its efforts to reach a deal with Kyiv in the wake of those developments, and on February 24 Trump said he expects Zelenskyy to come to Washington to sign an agreement sometime in the next two weeks. Earlier that day, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in a post on X that talks on the deal were in their 'final stages' and 'nearly all key details [have been] finalized.' Hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly added a new element to the transatlantic discussions about critical minerals in what looked like a bid to complicate the path toward a U.S.-Ukraine agreement. He chaired a high-level government meeting on rare earth metals and offered the United States a chance at joint exploration of Russia's own deposits, adding: 'We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasize, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.' Putin spoke after Trump hailed the possibilities for close U.S.-Russian economic cooperation in the event of a peace deal. He touched on a sensitive issue that is at the heart of his war against Ukraine and is likely to be a major bone of contention as efforts to end the war proceed, saying potential rare earth exploration deals could include deposits in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, in the resource-rich region known as the Donbas. On February 23, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko told a news conference that 'about $350 billion worth of these useful critical materials' are in Russian-occupied territory. At 3.8 million metric tons, Russia's rare earth reserves are the fifth-largest in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The main Russian rare earth mining and production companies have been nationalized since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and are now controlled by Rosatom, the state nuclear company, which has strong ties with close Putin associate Mikhail Kovalchuk, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit, Systema, reported on February 25. Rare earths are a class of more than about 17 minerals -- among them yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum -- that are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's surface. They're in increasing demand because of their use in products such as batteries, computers, smart phones, magnets, electric cars, and high-tech weaponry. What Are Ukraine's Mineral Resources? Ukraine says it has reserves of half the 50 minerals the United States deems 'critical to the U.S. economy and national security' -- a broader category that includes lithium and titanium, among others -- and of more common mineral resources such as coal, iron ore, oil, and gas. U.S. officials have said that the minerals deal would enhance Ukraine's security because the United States would want to protect its interests, but Zelenskyy has stressed that Kyiv needs strong and reliable security guarantees in the event of a cease-fire or peace deal. In addition to concerns about security guarantees, the amounts the United States has mentioned have also caused consternation in Kyiv. Trump said earlier this month that he wanted 'the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths,' and a new draft proposed by Washington after the rejection initially called for Ukraine to contribute to a U.S.-held fund until it reached that amount. Zelenskyy has pointed out that American wartime aid so far has been far below $500 billion and that much of the money has gone to U.S. weapons producers. As of September, Congress had appropriated $174.2 billion in emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine-related purposes, with 64 percent of that going to the Defense Department and defense-related accounts, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Financial Times said it had seen the 'final version' of the agreement, which it said was dated February 24 and did not include a demand for $500 billion. The deal would 'establish a fund into which Ukraine would contribute 50 percent of proceeds from the ‘future monetization’ of state-owned mineral resources, including oil and gas, and associated logistics,' the newspaper reported, and the fund would 'invest in projects in Ukraine.' According to the newspaper, the deal excludes mineral resources that already contribute to Ukrainian state coffers, 'meaning it would not cover the existing activities of Naftogaz or Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest gas and oil producers.' While the draft includes no specific security guarantees, AFP quoted a 'senior Ukrainian source' as saying 'there is a general clause that says America will invest in a stable and prosperous sovereign Ukraine, that it works for a lasting peace, and that America supports efforts to guarantee security.' Existing EU-Ukraine Memorandum Amid tension between the United States and the EU over Russia and the war in Ukraine, meanwhile, the news agency AFP reported that an EU official said the bloc had proposed a separate deal between the EU and Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen on February 24, the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale invasion.'Twenty-one of the 30 critical materials Europe needs can be provided by Ukraine in a win-win partnership,' AFP quoted the European commissioner for industrial strategy, Stephane Sejourne, as saying. 'The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that's not mutually beneficial.' However, European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said on February 25 that there was 'no proposal' from the EU, adding the bloc has had a partnership with Ukraine on critical minerals since a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2021.Von der Leyen 'reaffirmed [a] commitment to implement this memorandum of understanding and accelerate the work to strengthen our mutual benefit partnership,' he said. 'As you see, this is really here about cooperation with Ukraine and not about any sort of competition with the United States.'Speaking to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity, a senior EU official said he would be 'surprised' if Von der Leyen and the European Commission 'would want to challenge the U.S. on this.'

Exploring Ancient Understandings Of Meteorites In Archaic Societi...	Five times a day, approximately one-fourth of the world's population turns toward Mecca to bow their heads in prayer. The Kaaba at the center of this global genuflection has a cornerstone that some speculate is a meteor. Meteoritic artifacts appear as early as the dawn of Egypt's Early Dynastic Period, approximately 4,500 years ago. Archaeological teams in the 1920s reported that beads from the Gerzeh cemetery in northern Egypt had very high concentrations of nickel, typical of meteoritic iron. These are the earliest analyzed artifacts, and modern metal testing technologies mean that chemists can now identify and catalog the presence of meteoritic iron in archaeological collections across Eurasia. Since 2013, this has led to many discoveries reframing the prominence of extraterrestrial resources in the archaeological record, including identifying that King Tutankhamun's dagger was crafted from a meteor. Experts believe this opulent weapon was a gift to the boy king's grandfather Amenhotep III around 1300 BCE, from the king of the Mitanni region, based on the Amarna tablets. This high-status gift is one of the many ways meteoritic iron was revered by ancient civilizations. One of the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics for iron seems to be derived from a longer phrase translating to: 'iron from the sky.' This word has cosmological connotations associated with the Egyptian belief that the sky was an iron pot or tub filled with water, and bits of it fell to the Earth in the form of meteorites. 'We have evidence for the idea that the sky was a dome made of iron in a few different civilizations,' explains Victoria Almansa-Villatoro, the Egyptologist who analyzed the hieroglyphic for iron (and sky), during an interview. 'If all of these civilizations had this idea and they are so spread apart, it is possible that the idea goes way back in time, maybe before writing was invented.' Almansa-Villatoro emphasizes tracing any common meanings or beliefs linking such cultures is purely speculation. Contemporaneously to the Mitanni, it is believed the Hittites used meteoritic iron by 3,000 to 2,000 BCE as one iron dagger excavated in Alaca Höyük in modern-day Turkey was made from a meteor and dated to 2,500 BCE. Iron pendants from Umm el-Marra in Syria and an iron axe from Ugarit in Lebanon are other key examples of hammered meteoritic iron. The process of working with meteoritic iron is much simpler than having to reduce the impurities out of terrestrial iron ore (because meteoritic iron is already a metal). All that needs to be done is hammering the material. This key difference is why meteoritic iron appears well before terrestrial iron and even before the beginning of the Bronze Age, which varies by region but is approximately from 3,000 to 1,200 BCE. The Gerzeh beads and King Tutankhamun's dagger were hammered cold or hot, similar to early gold and copper processing. Smelting out impurities from terrestrial iron demarcates the start of the Iron Age because Bronze Age furnaces were not hot enough for such a complex process. The dawn of this development is between 1,200 and 600 BCE depending on the region. How early metallurgists started working with iron ore is still being actively explored by experts. Even though the melting of copper is much simpler than iron production, it may have played a role in the development of iron reduction. 'Copper slags have a lot of iron oxide, and if your furnace reduces too much you will get a small amount of iron in your slag,' explains geochemist and metallurgist Albert Jambon, Sorbonne University, during an interview. 'Maybe the first people were working with slags, but to go from slag to an ore, I just don't know.' Slag is the waste from metal processing, and it is a good and readily available source of data in the archaeological record. Jambon devised a chemical strategy for identifying meteoritic iron by studying the ratios of nickel to iron and copper in artifacts. It seems that all the iron artifacts from the Bronze Age came from outer space, but research published in 2025 identified that three of 26 iron artifacts were meteoritic. These artifacts were found in an early Iron Age cemetery of the Lusatian culture in modern-day Poland. Oddly, these artifacts were not found with any wealthy implements in what seemed like graves of 'commoners,' a stark contrast to how meteoritic iron was valued during earlier historic periods. Even though approximately 17,000 meteors weighing more than 50 grams hit Earth each year, most are made of stone. Only about 4 percent are composed of iron alloys with abnormal nickel content that people can use. These materials became a rare commodity for ancient people, who began valuing this easy-made iron above gold. Cuneiform tablets found at the Old Assyrian Colonial site of Kültepe-Kanesh in Turkey from approximately 4,000 years ago refer to a 'sky metal' that cost as much as 40 times the price of silver. Silver was the most valuable common precious metal in the region at the time. Assur, the capital of the Old Assyrian city-state, felt that the meteoritic iron needed to be taxed, which makes Jan Gerrit Dercksen of Leiden University think that it was common enough to be included in the system of trade tariffs. In Anatolia, not every merchant could afford to trade meteoritic iron, and it seems that groups of merchants combined their funds to buy this sky metal in bulk according to Dercksen. There was a smaller source of meteoritic iron coming from the East into Assur, but it is difficult to identify where the trade originated. Jambon has struggled to identify more meteoritic iron artifacts farther East, but it has been difficult to obtain and test artifacts from Turkey. As for Iran, there are very few iron artifacts and they don't appear well into the Iron Age. This as well as the context in which most Bronze Age meteoritic iron was found suggests that its rarity in part made it a highly valued commodity. This changed with the Iron Age, while meteoritic iron remained rare, terrestrial iron became more common and the early Iron Age cemetery site in Poland is the only identified site where meteoritic iron was found alongside terrestrial iron. It is unclear how much meteoritic iron was used as the number of iron artifacts exploded in the archaeological record. 'There are two possibilities: either there was so little meteoritic iron [artifacts] that it looks like there was no meteoritic iron or the second possibility [is], the price of iron sank so much cheaper than copper,' explains Jambon. 'People didn't care anymore about meteoritic iron because iron was so common it was no longer fashionable.' The Sky is Falling There is evidence globally that meteors have carried importance across millennia, including the Western Hemisphere. Archaeologists in Arizona found the Winona meteorite inset in what was assumed to be a ritual cyst in a pre-Columbian settlement. The Clackamas tribe in Oregon have a rich oral tradition and a range of ceremonies surrounding the Willamette meteor, the largest meteor found in North America. Just like the ancient Egyptians, the Hopewell tribe made beads out of meteoritic iron brought from more than 400 miles away as well as adzes and earspools. In the 1500s, Indigenous guides brought Spanish soldiers to a field of at least 26 impact craters 500 miles north of Buenos Aires that they called Piguem Nonraltá. The Spanish translated this to Campo del Cielo—'field of the sky.' The Spanish soldiers claimed they saw a huge slab of iron but couldn't believe the local stories that it had fallen from the sky. The meteor shower occurred approximately 4,500 years ago and was recorded by the local cultures as a great catastrophe. Spanish records indicate that the Indigenous tribes made weapons from the iron, but none have been preserved or identified. This field is home to some of the world's largest meteorite fragments including the 30-ton Gancedo fragment found in 2016. A meteorite currently in the Academy of Sciences of Munich struck Zanzibar in the middle of the 19th century only to be revered by the Wanika tribe until a Maasai cattle raid made them lose respect for it. They promptly sold it to German missionaries. Prehistoric stone tools also developed a type of lore as good luck charms in different periods and regions due to different cultic traditions largely associated with cosmological concepts. Tuvan reindeer herders in northern Mongolia continue to collect prehistoric stone tools for good luck and call them 'sky stones.' Obsidian and flint tools of the Neolithic and Paleolithic in both classical Greek and Roman periods were called 'lightning stones' because they looked like weapons and were associated with the lightning bolt weapons of Zeus. It was recorded as late as the 20th century in Italy that Neolithic flints were treated as amulets to protect against lightning and natural disasters. It is speculated that people didn't associate these tools or lightning stones as man-made from an earlier period. Scholar Christopher A. Faraone writes that there is 'no evidence that the Greeks or Romans realized that these axe-heads were manufactured by previous stone-age cultures and indeed the inclusion of them in [natural history and geology books] confirms... that they were believed to be 'natural' stones which, like amber, jet or coral, had special protective powers.' The historical depth and meaningful associations people have historically placed on meteoritic iron are more fully illustrated by the tale of a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue, made by the Bon culture in Tibet. A Nazi expedition looted the statue weighing just more than 10 kilograms between 1938 and 1939 not knowing that it was made out of meteoritic iron. Indiana Jones wasn't there to rescue the statue, and it disappeared for decades. The statue reappeared in the hands of a private collector, who collaborated with researchers and determined its extraterrestrial composition and landing spot on Earth. They determined it came from the Chinga meteor which landed 10,000 to 20,000 years ago in southern Siberia, likely traveling thousands of kilometers in its journey to Tibet. While the space-born Buddha is one of the most unique and intricate objects crafted from a meteor, the oldest meteoritic artifacts found east of the Levant are weapons from China's Shang Dynasty, dating to 1,400 BCE. A knife and a pole-mounted dagger-axecalled ge from 900-800 BCE were also made from meteoritic iron. Baetyls Meteors are part of many myths and stories around the globe, but one of the most interesting correlations between meteors and sacred sites is found in southwest Eurasia and the Mediterranean region. Baetyls are an ancient tradition of using sacred stones thought to be meteorites or based on meteorites. The etymological origin of the word translates to 'house of god.' Thought to originally refer to open-air sites of worship from the original Semitic term, depictions across cultures and civilizations, however, all show hewn stones at the center of god's house that some speculate are meteorites. The word baetyl itself is now used to refer to these revered stones. In Agia Eirini, Cyprus, more than 2,000 terracotta figurines were found surrounding and facing a cultic stone on an altar. This miniature terracotta army was surrounding a round-shaped small boulder that appears contextually to have been treated as a sacred baetyl. Baetyls were known to be in the Phoenician cities of Byblos and Tyre and were adopted by Greek tradition in Delphi at the Temple of Apollo and the Needle of Aphrodite in Paphos. The origin of the baetyl at Tyre may be related to accounts from the Phoenician writer, Sanchuniathon, that the goddess Astarte found a stone fallen from the sky, which she took to Tyre to worship in a shrine. It is even speculated that the cultic practices around meteors played a role in the founding of Rome. Rome had a sacred black stone and shrine like a baetyl called the Lapis Niger, which was believed to have been derived from preexisting cultic worship practices. According to the Roman Grammarian and teacher Marcus Verrius Flaccus, the Lapis Niger marks a spot of ill omen and was intended to be the mythical founder Romulus's burial spot but was, in fact, not used as such. Excavations under Giacomo Boni at the Roman Forum in 1899 uncovered what was dubbed the Lapis Niger and the tomb of Romulus. This was something of a misnomer because it is unclear whether he actually found this site or if the accounts were accurate in the first place. The archaeological journal volume about his excavations from 1903 suggested that the polished black stone on the Lapis Niger that Flaccus saw could have been a meteorite, but the excavations from 1899 only seemed to have uncovered copies influenced by the Lapis Niger. Etruscan grave markersfrom a major necropolis in Cerveteri have similar black stones to that of the Lapis Niger. There are several textual references to sacred stones from the sky in Greco-Roman sources that experts believe are meteor fragments. The religious historian Mircea Eliade even asserted that important holy sites, including the Palladion of Troy, the Artemis of Ephesus, and the Cone of Elagabalus in Emesa, were actually based on meteorites. There is no physical evidence supporting the origin stories of these shrines and the historical speculations surrounding them—no excavated or identified baetyl was a meteor. Other descriptions of baetyls are regularly just rock or even simply mounds of earth. The same stands true for the Egyptian Benben stone—a black pyramidal stone thought to either be on top of a pyramid or influence the pyramids in ancient Egypt. Benben has become a generic term for the top cornerstone of a pyramid or obelisk, but it is derived from a revered one mentioned repeatedly in Egyptian texts. The original was venerated at the 'Mansion of the Phoenix' within the Great Sun Temple of Heliopolis but likely predates the sun cult of Ra. It is linked to the creation story of Atum, one of the oldest Egyptian deities. The Benben is either the hill he rises out of the waters from or what he falls out of the sky on (remember the Egyptian sky being an iron tub of water). But Atum is credited with and linked to many cosmological symbols. Just like the Black Stone of the Kaaba in Mecca, it is still not scientifically conclusive whether or not any revered stones recorded in historical documents are meteors. It is speculated there are cultic, pre-Abrahamic items of worship inside the Kaaba Similarly, any potential meteor worship in the Greco-Roman pantheons could have been derived from earlier traditions, like how Atum's Benben predated the Sun God Ra. Although the Black Stone, or al-Hajar al-Aswad in Arabic, makes appearances during the lifetime of Abraham and Muhammad, it supposedly fell to Earth when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. It landed where they were to build the first temple, and it was placed into the Kaaba by the Prophet Muhammad in 605 CE. According to tradition, the Black Stone was originally white but turned black as it absorbed the sin of the hajis who touched it at Mecca. Islamic tradition is the only source of information on the origin of al-Hajar al-Aswad. In the oldest known epic poem from Mesopotamia, the titular protagonist Gilgamesh dreams of a meteor landing outside the ancient city of Uruk that he is unable to move. This dream has prophetic meaning for the rest of the epic, putting meteors front and center in one of the oldest pieces of literature. Philosophers of the Greco-Roman period were some of the first known to record rocks falling from the sky. Aristotle, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, to name a few, were the first to record a meteor fall in Turkey around either 467 or 466 BC. Meanwhile, the community of European scientists debated the existence of meteors until the early 19th century; a meteor shower in France in 1803 ended the debate. The uncertainty of textual references can hopefully be proved by the archaeological record. Jambon first started using his chemical analysis looking for meteoritic iron in 2010 after purchasing an XRF instrument. Despite the many obstacles in obtaining old artifacts from around Eurasia, he continues to shine a light on ancient metallurgical technologies.

How AI Can Help Both Tax Collectors And Taxpayers – Analysis	New technologies have the potential to improve the relationship between governments and citizens. Tax portals, customs IT systems and online services have simplified interactions with public authorities, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and increased transparency. Now, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as the next transformative force. Known for its ability to understand and produce human language, GenAI opens possibilities that go beyond simple automation. However, in an area as politically sensitive as taxation, it also raises important questions that could quickly undermine trust. Tax authorities are beginning to explore GenAI, though most efforts are still at an early, experimental stage. The most evident area so far has been on improving communication with taxpayers. In Singapore, a virtual assistant answers tax questions in multiple languages and has cut call-center inquiries by half. Korea has deployed an AI guide to help citizens file and pay taxes. In France, AI can analyze incoming emails and propose draft responses for civil servants to validate. While these applications are promising, a more profound question emerges: Can GenAI significantly alter the relationship between governments and citizens? Furthermore, how will it influence the way citizens experience and perceive taxation—a politically sensitive process that is governed by law yet deeply intertwined with social norms and practices? What’s new with GenAI? Most AI systems currently used by tax and customs authorities are predictive and built for a single function. They analyze large sets of structured data—like past tax declarations or transactions—to produce things like risk scores to indicate possible fraud. By contrast, GenAI is a generalist system that understands almost all forms of information and is designed to interact with humans in any language. It can handle a range of tasks, from drafting letters to providing interactive guidance about tax regulations and assisting officers in their investigations. By training a GenAI agent with legal texts, tax codes, operating procedures, and internal guidelines, administrations can adapt it to specific needs. The result is a dynamic system capable of understanding and producing content that both civil servants and taxpayers can interact with. Transforming the State-Society Relationship While AI tools already in use often enhance efficiency, they have not fundamentally changed the way revenue authorities work or engage with citizens. They mostly replaced manual tasks or systems for econometric or statistical modelling. With GenAI, there are more profound implications. Internally, it can help tax and customs officials to focus on analytical and judgment-based roles, allowing them to become oversight specialists and increasing their productivity. Externally, it can reduce the knowledge gap between administrations and taxpayers, aiding in the interpretation of complex provisions, navigating laws, identifying deductions, and even auto-filling forms. For low-income countries, GenAI offers the opportunity to drive organizational reforms and leapfrog into the most modern systems. For example, in Madagascar, the customs authority wants to use GenAI to improve risk management, combat fraud and increase revenue, using data accumulated over 10 years to train its system. The human-like interactions offered by AI chat tools can personalize the process, as shown in Singapore and Korea, where users can ask questions and receive plain language replies. Citizens’ organizations, academics, and political parties can also use GenAI to examine proposed reforms, compare scenarios, and engage in deeper policy debates. This two-way transformation could increase overall trust, making taxation feel less like a frustrating obligation and more like a shared responsibility of both taxpayers and governments. Preconditions for success Despite its potential, GenAI also comes with challenges. Issues related to data quality, ethics, privacy concerns and hallucinations (i.e., incorrect results) must be addressed to reinforce and not erode trust. For instance, Korea’s approach—directing particularly sensitive queries to human agents—reflects the need for careful oversight of confidential matters. Results must be explainable and perceived as fair in all cases. Effective knowledge management is another requirement. Revenue authorities have extensive laws, regulations, case records, and operational manuals. However, scattered archives and incomplete digitization can hamper efforts to train AI systems effectively. A human must determine which documents are accurate, relevant, and suitable for inclusion in the training material. As GenAI becomes integrated into various aspects of revenue administration, employees will need to be trained to interpret, correct, and complement its outputs. Policymakers must ensure that errors are reported and addressed promptly. By providing human-like capabilities to support taxpayers and tax authorities, GenAI can act as both taxman and taxpayer assistant, automating routine tasks, clarifying complex issues, and fostering a more transparent and collaborative relationship. This technology can lower administrative hurdles, demystify tax obligations, and invite broader participation in policy debates. However, shaping it properly requires strong leadership, ethical policy frameworks, and vigilant oversight of data quality, privacy, and accuracy.

The Possible Reality Of The ‘Century Of The Americas’ – Analysis	By Zhou Chao It is undeniable that as of this year, the basic process of de-globalization has been ongoing for roughly a decade. The further divergence of the global economic development pattern is, therefore, an indisputable fact. As for the countries and regions that are likely to take the leading positions in the future global economic landscape, many different views have emerged in the commentary. Some argue that, with its young population and increasingly stronger economic power, India's position in the global economy will be further strengthened. Others point out that, with similar advantages, Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam are expected to become key players in the future global economic pattern. There are even opinions that foresee a promising future for the five Central Asian countries. In this regard, however, the Americas seem to have been somewhat overlooked. That being said, a senior researcher at ANBOUND has long expressed the view that, in terms of the future global economic structure, the possibility of a 'Century of the Americas' should not be underestimated. Latin American countries, represented by Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as North American countries, including the United States and Canada, will occupy a more important position in the global economic structure, with greater influence. In several prior analyses, ANBOUND has highlighted that the past focus on the economic aspects of globalization has been one-sided and superficial. This approach has resulted in overly long and complex global supply chains, which have proven highly vulnerable in the face of sudden events such as natural disasters and regional conflicts. Moreover, the widening global wealth gap has fueled increasing dissatisfaction within countries over this narrow form of globalization. As a result, regionalization is expected to emerge as a long-term trend, with the United States gradually redirecting its attention and resources to the geographically closer Americas. Recently, in matters such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States has essentially adopted a unilateral approach and marginalized Europe. Conflicts between the U.S. and Europe in areas such as trade, investment, and defense spending are likely to continue intensifying for a period. Furthermore, with the rise of conservative forces in the U.S. and the deepening ideological divide between them and the European Union's establishment faction, tensions in U.S.-EU relations are continuously strengthening. Moreover, since the beginning of the century, due to its own structural bloating and complex legal regulations, the EU's economic vitality has gradually weakened, and it has fallen behind China and the U.S. in areas such as cutting-edge technological research and development. The intensification of U.S.-EU contradictions and the EU's decreasing economic vitality may undermine the importance of the EU as the primary destination for U.S. capital's long-term overseas investment. For the entire Americas, the U.S.'s primary task is to effectively manage and integrate the entire continent both ideologically and economically. In North America, the economic strength of the U.S. and Canada is undeniable. While Canada has developed clear opposition with the U.S. on specific issues such as trade disputes, the ideological divide between the two countries is minimal. Economically, Canada remains highly dependent on the U.S., and its eventual full integration into the U.S.'s regional strategic framework is merely a matter of time. Therefore, the U.S.'s most important task is the integration of the entire Latin American region. In terms of economic development and strategic integration, the Latin American region holds significant importance for the U.S. The Latin American region is rich in mineral resources, holding at least 65% of the world's lithium reserves (concentrated in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil); 49% of the silver reserves (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and Mexico); 44% of the copper reserves (primarily in Chile and Peru, with Mexico following); 33% of the tin reserves (found in Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia); 26% of the bauxite reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, and Jamaica); 23% of the nickel reserves (mainly in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic); and 22% of the iron reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico). In addition, the Latin American region is also rich in oil and gas resources. Effectively managing and developing these resources is of great strategic importance to the U.S., as it plays a crucial role in ensuring resource independence and reducing reliance on China. Furthermore, the Latin American region is itself a massive consumer market. With a population of approximately 665 million, it accounts for 8.3% of the global population. The population is notably concentrated in a few leading countries, with Brazil and Mexico ranking as the seventh and tenth most populous nations in the world. Additionally, the region has a relatively young demographic structure. Data shows that in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Chile, around 24% of the population is under 15 years old, while 65% is between the ages of 15 and 65, indicating a youthful population. The gender ratio in the region is also relatively balanced. In recent years, Latin America's economic growth has been characterized by fluctuations, with consumption potential being relatively promising. Brazil and Mexico are seen as markets with the greatest growth potential. All of these factors provide the U.S. with relatively ideal returns on potential capital investments in the region. It is also important to note that, although some countries in the Latin American region face internal political instability and other issues, the overall situation in the region remains relatively favorable on a global scale. Unlike certain Southeast Asian nations, Latin America does not suffer from severe internal military fragmentation or warlordism. The activities of criminal groups in the region, while a concern, do not possess the same level of destructive power as the Islamist extremist forces in Central Asia and the Middle East. The internal issues in Latin American countries are primarily due to inadequate governance capacity, and these challenges are far more remediable compared to those faced by some of the major countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. In terms of the U.S.' integration of the Latin American region, the major regional powers remain the primary targets. This means that the success or failure of future U.S. integration efforts largely depends on the attitudes of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. As for Mexico, although there are confrontational feelings and positions toward the U.S. on issues like tariffs, there is no serious ideological opposition. Furthermore, Mexico's heavy economic dependence on the U.S. makes it highly likely that Mexico will be successfully integrated into the U.S.'s regional strategic plans. Mexico's own economic strength and growth prospects are also highly regarded by global capital. As for Argentina, President Javier Milei's radical reforms have already yielded significant results. His series of reforms in the monetary and financial sectors have effectively deepened Argentina's integration into the United States' regional strategy. Regarding Brazil, the country is currently governed by left-wing forces, and this creates an ideological distance from the U.S. Economically, Brazil faces structural issues such as low investment efficiency and heavy reliance on final consumption and primary product exports. However, Brazil's overall economic performance remains relatively stable, and its inflation rate is not as alarming as Argentina's. It is also important to note that in the last election, the left-wing forces did not have an overwhelming advantage; right-wing forces still maintain significant influence at both the local and central levels. This suggests that Brazil's economic reforms could still move toward an American-style neoliberal model, potentially integrating into the U.S.'s regional strategy in the future. As for other countries, due to their relatively limited population and economic scale, their ability to resist U.S. influence is weaker, making the possibility of full integration into U.S. strategy quite high. In the case of Cuba, the country has long been affected by isolation and sanctions, with ongoing internal economic and social struggles. Additionally, its aging population is the highest in Latin America, and the country's social vitality is likely to continue to decline, making it difficult to effectively obstruct the U.S.'s future strategy for the Americas. For Venezuela, although Nicolás Maduro's rule remains relatively stable for now, due to its limited overall scale and national strength, it lacks the capacity to significantly hinder the U.S.'s integration and control over the entire Latin American region. Due to the various challenges that still exist in Latin American countries, the U.S.'s efforts to integrate the region face numerous challenges. The U.S. is the dominant power in the Americas, and its development needs were historically met through global markets. In the future, these needs may primarily be met by emerging countries on the American continent. Clearly, in order to achieve this, countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil must possess large, young populations, thriving manufacturing sectors, and stable social environments. Only then will these Latin American countries be able to effectively absorb and meet the development and investment requirements of U.S. capital, providing sustained growth and driving social and economic prosperity. Achieving these requirements will face a series of uncertainties, but it is not impossible. Once U.S. capital, technology, human resources, and ideas truly reshape the entire Latin American region—especially the key countries, the economic power and social development levels of these nations can experience significant leaps. Their international status and influence could also be greatly enhanced, thus creating a prosperous 'Century of the Americas'. A Latin American region like this would not only become an important base for the U.S. in the era of regionalization but also a key support point for strengthening U.S. global influence when the trend of globalization resurges. Final analysis conclusion: Since the launch of the Trump 2.0 era, actions such as demanding Canada join the U.S. and Denmark in ceding Greenland, and forcing Panama to quit the Belt and Road Initiative, have all indicated that the U.S. will gradually shift its focus and investments toward the entire American continent. Fully integrating the Americas, including Latin America, will become a key component of the U.S.'s future global strategy. While this strategic plan will face numerous challenges, it is not without possibility. If successful, both the U.S. and the major countries in the Americas will be able to further enhance their global standing, creating a 'Century of the Americas'. Throughout this process, China's existing interests in Latin America may face continuous and significant disruptions.

Vienna Process Offers A Genuine Alternative To The Taliban – Anal...	By Luke Coffey More than 100 Afghans from different ethnic and minority groups recently gathered in Vienna, Austria, for the fifth meeting of the Vienna Process for a Democratic Afghanistan. Over the past two years, the Vienna Process has emerged as the primary forum for anti-Taliban resistance movements to coordinate, strategize, and chart a common path forward. While the international community has struggled to formulate a coherent approach to Afghanistan, this growing coalition of opposition groups has steadily built a framework for an alternative future. The Vienna Process has grown in both scope and influence since its inception in September 2022, one year after the Taliban’s return to power. The first round brought together over 30 participants from various Afghan minority and ethnic groups, who issued a joint statement rejecting Taliban rule as unacceptable. Perhaps the most significant outcome was the emergence of Ahmad Massoud, the son of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, as the de facto leader of the resistance. By April 2023, the second round had expanded to include a broader range of activists, representing diverse ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds. While Massoud and the National Resistance Front remained central, the Ankara Coalition, Hazara, and Uzbek representatives played key roles. Notably, nearly half of the participants were women. This time, they took a bolder step, agreeing to support all forms of resistance against the Taliban, including armed struggle. The third round in December 2023 saw even greater participation, with over 50 representatives from anti-Taliban groups. For the first time, Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek commander and longtime Afghan powerbroker, sent a personal envoy. The presence of international observers from the US and Europe signaled a growing recognition of the resistance movement. By June 2024, the fourth round had grown to 70 participants, including influential figures such as former Afghan Vice President Yunus Qanuni; Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq; and Anarkali Honaryar, an Afghan Sikh. Women’s rights activist Parwana Ibrahimkhel, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in 2022, also joined. To develop a roadmap for Afghanistan’s future, participants broke into working groups focused on politics, foreign policy, human rights, and economics. This week’s fifth round was even larger and included almost 100 attendees. For the first time, there was a session giving international observers from the US and Europe an opportunity to speak and engage. In addition to Ahmad Massoud, other notable attendees included Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front; and Rangin Dadfar Spanta, the country’s former national security adviser. The biggest outcome of this meeting was the agreement to a roadmap that various working groups had been drafting since the last meeting in June. This program is the opposition’s attempt at showing that there is an alternative to the current Taliban rule. All aspects of Afghanistan’s future and society are covered to include future economic development, security, diplomatic relations, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women’s rights. A special commission of 19 members representing all walks of Afghan society was also formed. This commission will work together and coordinate a response to implement the roadmap. At the heart of the Vienna Process is Massoud. Since fleeing to his ancestral homeland in the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, Massoud has pursued a dual-track approach to countering the Taliban. Militarily, the NRF is active in many provinces across Afghanistan, primarily in the north, using guerrilla warfare tactics to target Taliban forces. Last year alone, the NRF launched dozens of attacks, making it a persistent security challenge for the Taliban. Diplomatically, Massoud has led an international effort to raise awareness of the resistance and build alliances. This is one of the main reasons the Vienna Process has gained momentum. The Vienna Process offers a rare good news story about Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, they have shown little ability to govern effectively. The country faces an acute humanitarian crisis that worsens each year, and the economic situation remains dire as questions arise over the sustainability of international aid. Meanwhile, human rights conditions continue to deteriorate, with ethnic minorities persecuted, girls banned from schools, and women forced out of many workplaces. Yet, the NRF and other Vienna Process participants demonstrate that an alternative future is possible. The situation today mirrors the 1990s when the Northern Alliance controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, yet refused to surrender to the Taliban. Likewise, the NRF and other resistance groups must continue their fight and ensure that the world does not forget them. The Taliban itself is deeply divided, with competing factions vying for power. These internal fractures could create opportunities for the anti-Taliban resistance to establish safe zones and reclaim territory. The international community would be wise to engage more seriously with the Vienna Process. While a few international observers attended this week’s meeting, no senior government officials participated. At the next Vienna Process gathering, representatives such as the US special envoy for Afghanistan and counterparts from other nations should attend — even if only as observers. It makes little sense that much of the international community engages with the Taliban as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan, while failing to establish meaningful dialogue with resistance movements such as the NRF and others in the Vienna Process. With each round, the Vienna Process has become more inclusive and strategic, positioning itself as the most significant platform for Afghanistan’s anti-Taliban resistance. Global policymakers should take note. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

What Is Danantara, Indonesia’s New State Investment Body? – Analy...	By Arie Firdaus Daya Anagata Nusantara (Danantara), a new state investment management body launched by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, aims to boost the nation’s economy. The announcement on Monday fulfilled a key campaign promise by Prabowo, who took office in October. But what exactly is Danantara, and how does it fit into Indonesia’s economic ambitions? Here’s what you need to know: What is Danantara? Danantara is designed to consolidate funds from Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and channel them into strategic projects, such as renewable energy, industrial development, and food production. Prabowo has described it as an 'economic catalyst' with the ambitious goal of accelerating Indonesia’s growth rate and ensuring long-term prosperity. The name Danantara is derived from three Indonesian words: Daya (energy or strength), Anagata (future), and Nusantara (Indonesia). They reflect the body’s mission to become a driving force for the nation’s economic future. With an estimated initial asset base of U.S. $900 billion, Danantara ranks among the world’s largest state investment bodies. It surpasses Malaysia’s Khazanah ($37 billion) and Singapore’s Temasek ($596 billion) and is the seventh-largest globally. What will Danantara do? Danantara’s primary role is to optimize the management of Indonesia’s state-owned assets and invest in high-impact projects. According to Prabowo, the body will focus on areas related to sustainable energy, food security and industrial downstreaming that involves processing raw materials into higher-value products. 'We no longer want to sell our natural resources cheaply or serve as raw material suppliers for other nations,' Prabowo said during the launch. 'High-impact projects will generate significant value for our nation, create quality jobs, and ensure long-term prosperity for the Indonesian people.' Why was Danantara created? The idea for Danantara emerged during Prabowo’s presidential campaign, where he pledged to create a superholding company to manage Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises more effectively. Inspired by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, the plan was initially slated for launch in November 2024 but was delayed. Danantara’s creation was formalized following the third revision of Indonesia’s SOE Law, passed by the House of Representatives on Feb. 4. While it was initially envisioned as a replacement for the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, the ministry now retains some oversight powers, including a 1% 'special share' that grants the government veto power over strategic decisions. Who is leading Danantara? Rosan Roeslani, Indonesia’s minister of Investment and head of the Investment Coordinating Board, has been appointed Danantara’s chief executive officer. Rosan, who led Prabowo’s 2024 presidential campaign team, is joined by Pandu Sjahrir, a businessman and nephew of National Economic Council Chairman Luhut Pandjaitan, as chief investment officer. Pandu was a member of Prabowo’s campaign team as well. The Dantantara team also includes Deputy Minister of SOEs Dony Oskario, who will serve as chief operating officer. The presidential office has indicated that a former president may be appointed to Danantara’s leadership, but no details have been provided. How is Danantara funded? Danantara’s initial capital comes from seven major state-owned enterprises, including Bank Mandiri, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Telkom Indonesia, and energy giant Pertamina. Together, these companies have contributed around $20 billion in initial funds from their revenues. Additional SOEs are expected to join Danantara in the future, which will further expand the body’s asset base. The first phase of investment will focus on nickel and bauxite processing, food production, and green energy projects. How does Danantara compare with Indonesia’s existing investment fund? Indonesia already has a sovereign wealth fund, the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA), established in 2021 under former President Joko Widodo. However, Danantara is broader in scope, combining investment management, asset development, and sovereign wealth fund functions such as managing and investing state assets. INA will eventually be absorbed into Danantara. What are the concerns? Despite its ambitious goals, Danantara has faced skepticism from analysts and transparency advocates. Some worry that its leadership, dominated by political appointees rather than independent professionals, could undermine its efficacy. 'Danantara looks more like a political institution for elites rather than a professionally managed fund,' said Budi Frensidy, a capital market analyst at the University of Indonesia. Others have raised concerns about oversight. Under its legal framework, Danantara’s audits will be conducted by a public accountant chosen by shareholders and approved by the SOE minister. Only if the House of Representatives requests it would there be an intervention by the Supreme Audit Agency, which is the government body responsible for accountability of state finances. The law does not explicitly grant oversight authority to Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) either. Danantara’s CEO Roslan has sought to address these concerns, stating that the body is not immune from the law. 'The KPK can certainly step in, especially if there are improper or criminal acts,' he told reporters on Monday. Prabowo has also stressed the importance of transparency, declaring that Danantara 'must be auditable at any time by anyone because this, once again, belongs to our children and grandchildren, [and] to the future generations of Indonesia.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdu5wjfluXLeSBMFh7WUnkK	2025-02-25T17:24:40-08:00	
Trump’s Russia Strategy: Breaking The Sino-Russian Alliance Or St...	By Dr. Hasim Turker The return of Donald Trump to the White House has marked a departure from the conventional trajectory of US foreign policy. His administration’s approach to Russia signals a recalibration of priorities, reflecting an underlying strategy aimed at reshaping global alignments in Washington’s favor. Rather than maintaining the confrontational stance of previous administrations, Trump appears to favor a more conciliatory approach toward Moscow, a shift largely dictated by the imperative of countering China’s rise. This shift, however, raises critical questions about its broader consequences, particularly for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. Russia and China: The New Strategic Equation For decades, US foreign policy has been characterized by a dual containment approach toward both Russia and China. However, Trump’s return to power suggests a shift in focus, prioritizing China as the primary geopolitical challenger while seeking to ease tensions with Russia. This change underscores a belief that continued antagonism toward Moscow only serves to push Russia further into China’s strategic orbit. The assumption behind this approach is that an entrenched Sino-Russian partnership presents the most formidable challenge to US hegemony. If the two powers deepen their military, economic, and diplomatic coordination, Washington faces a significantly more complex threat environment. By offering diplomatic and economic incentives to Russia, the Trump administration aims to weaken this partnership and prevent Beijing from leveraging Moscow’s resources in a future confrontation with the United States. The urgency of countering China stems from its growing economic and military power. China has surpassed the United States as the world’s largest trading nation and advanced significantly in AI, semiconductor manufacturing, and quantum computing. The modernization of the People’s Liberation Army and its growing naval power challenge US strategic superiority in the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, Beijing’s global outreach through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative has significantly expanded its influence across Africa, Latin America, and even Europe. Against this backdrop, Trump’s foreign policy team views Russia as a secondary concern. While Moscow remains a geopolitical competitor, its ambitions are seen as more regionally focused, making engagement with Russia a strategic move to free up resources for the broader confrontation with China. A Diplomatic Strategy to Divide Russia and China Trump’s approach recalls President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972, where Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet split to contain Moscow. However, this time, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of select sanctions, and potential de-escalation of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back into a more balanced relationship with the West. The assumption is that, with the right incentives, Moscow might be willing to moderate its ties with Beijing. Yet, this assumption is flawed. Unlike during the Cold War, when ideological rifts separated China and the Soviet Union, today’s Russia-China partnership is built on shared opposition to Western dominance. Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Given these realities, the likelihood of Russia abandoning its close ties with China in exchange for uncertain US concessions remains low. Implications for NATO and European Security While the logic behind Trump’s approach is clear, it carries significant strategic risks. By deprioritizing support for Ukraine and easing pressure on Moscow, Trump may embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. A perceived retreat by the United States could encourage Russia to expand its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe through hybrid warfare or direct military action. The administration’s skepticism toward NATO, combined with its reluctance to maintain military aid commitments to Ukraine, risks fracturing the transatlantic alliance. European nations, uncertain of Washington’s reliability, may seek alternative security arrangements, undermining the cohesion that has underpinned Western stability since World War II. Additionally, by engaging in direct negotiations with Moscow without meaningful European participation, Washington risks sidelining key allies such as Germany, France, and Poland. This could push European nations toward a more independent foreign policy stance, reducing Washington’s ability to coordinate a unified response to global security challenges. Concrete Policy Shifts and Their Consequences Trump’s realignment is already manifesting in concrete policy decisions. His administration has signaled a shift away from previous commitments to European security, urging NATO members to increase their defense spending while casting doubt on the United States’ commitment to Article 5. He has also moved to curtail military aid to Ukraine, undermining Kyiv’s ability to resist Russian advances. While these measures are intended to secure Moscow’s neutrality in a US-China confrontation, they carry long-term risks that could outweigh their short-term gains. If Russia interprets these moves as signs of Western weakness, it may choose to exploit them rather than reciprocate with genuine geopolitical realignment. A More Strategic Alternative: Balancing Engagement and Deterrence If the objective is to prevent an entrenched Sino-Russian alliance while maintaining US credibility, an alternative approach is needed. Rather than offering unconditional concessions to Moscow, Washington should pursue a strategy of selective engagement coupled with reinforced deterrence. Diplomatic engagement with Russia should be contingent on verifiable actions, such as de-escalation in Ukraine and a commitment to cease aggressive military posturing in Eastern Europe. European allies should be encouraged to increase their defense contributions, but US commitments to NATO must remain firm. Enhanced joint military exercises and forward deployments in Eastern Europe would deter Russian aggression while ensuring NATO’s resilience. Economic relief should only be granted in exchange for concrete behavioral changes from Moscow, using sanctions as a bargaining tool rather than a premature concession. Washington should explore areas of limited cooperation with Moscow, such as arms control and Arctic governance, without jeopardizing broader security commitments. Conclusion: Long-Term Strategic Considerations Trump’s foreign policy shift toward Russia represents an ambitious effort to reshape global alignments, but its long-term ramifications remain uncertain. While a Russia-China split could, in theory, provide the United States with strategic flexibility, the execution of this policy raises concerns about its sustainability and unintended consequences. Weakening NATO at a time of growing Russian assertiveness could compromise transatlantic security and embolden Moscow to test Western resolve. Moreover, Russia’s incentives to break from China remain limited, making it unclear whether Washington’s overtures will result in meaningful realignment or simply encourage further geopolitical adventurism. A more sustainable strategy would balance engagement with deterrence, ensuring that diplomatic initiatives with Russia do not come at the expense of broader US strategic interests. History has shown that unchecked concessions rarely produce lasting stability, and the challenge for US policymakers lies in navigating this complex realignment without sacrificing critical security commitments. The broader question remains: Can the United States successfully realign its global strategy while maintaining stability, or will this shift inadvertently accelerate the rise of revisionist powers?

Japan: Strong Reactions To A Weak Yen Shake Economy – Analysis	By Willem Thorbecke The Japanese real effective exchange rate is now at its lowest level in 54 years. Despite the pressures of a depreciating yen — from import prices to debt repayment — Japan’s global competitiveness and financial markets make it well-equipped to handle these challenges. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has tightened monetary policy cautiously. It abandoned negative rates on the uncollateralised overnight call rate in March 2024 and raised the target to 0.25 per cent in July 2024 and to 0.5 per cent in January 2025. The move in July sparked a 6 per cent appreciation of the yen and a 12 per cent drop in the stock market, while the move in January proved uneventful. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has been waiting for what he calls good inflation — inflation driven by wage increases that increase consumption and aggregate demand — to tighten policy. Despite years of easy monetary policy and wages increasing 5.1 per cent in the 2024 spring wage offensive, real disposable income has not increased. This has led to sluggish growth in real consumption. The BOJ may face pressure to tighten in order to resist a disorderly depreciation of the yen. This is especially true as the US Federal Reserve may slow monetary policy easing because of inflationary risks due to tariffs, large US budget deficits and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. The weak yen increases the prices of imported energy and food. This has raised average household costs in 2024 by 90,000 yen (US$590). To combat this, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba implemented stimulus measures to subsidise utility bills and provide cash for poorer households. But one problem with both the BOJ’s tightening and Ishiba’s stimulus package is that they increase budget deficits. By raising interest rates, the BOJ raises the cost of servicing Japan’s public debt. At 1.2 per cent, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are at their highest level in 14 years. Debt service costs in 2025 are already forecasted to be above 4 per cent of GDP. Ishiba’s package, along with increased spending on military and social security categories, will turn the forecasted primary budget — the budget excluding interest payments — from a surplus into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2025. With a public debt of 250 per cent of GDP, Japan needs to eschew additional borrowing. It should instead allow entrepreneurs to play a larger role in allocating resources. The weak yen also impacts Japan’s international transactions. It raises the costs of imports of food, fuels and other items. Yet the stimulus to exports is mitigated as many manufacturers relocated factories abroad during the strong yen period that lasted until 2012. Since the weak yen increases the cost of imports and has a tenuous impact on exports, it contributed to a trade deficit in 2024. But the weak yen raised the yen value of repatriated profitsand contributed to a 47 per cent increase in tourism. Primary income inflows and tourism revenues more than offset the trade deficit, pushing the overall Japanese current account to a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP. The Nikkei 225 stock market index also benefitted from the weak yen. It increased 19 per cent in 2024 and finished at its highest year-end level ever. Much of this occurred because the weak yen increased the yen profitability of companies such as Toyota and Komatsu, who obtain revenues from abroad. It has yet to be seen whether many Japanese firms who moved factories abroad during strong yen episodes — such as after the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — will return production to Japan as the yen remains weak. The government has pushed to return semiconductor manufacturing to Japan. The weak yen may help this plan succeed. As an oil importer, Japan faces challenges from high energy costs which are only raised with yen depreciation. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and to promote renewables and safe nuclear power. Somewhat paradoxically for an oil importer, oil price increases raise stock prices for Japanese industrial firms. This is because Japanese companies produce niche goods and services that are needed as energy prices increase. These high-quality niche products also improve the resilience of the Japanese economy. Japanese firms produce the lion’s share of photoresists and image sensors, used in the electronics industry and medical equipment. Japanese firms are also major suppliers of inputs to the semiconductor industry. With Japan consistently ranking as the most sophisticated economy, finding substitutes for many Japanese goods is hard. This provides Japanese companies with a stable source of demand for their products across Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Europe and the United States. This diversification reduces their exposure to difficulties in individual markets such as China. Japan will face challenges in 2025, including uncertainties from United States President Donald Trump, competition from South Korean and Chinese firms, dangers from wars and natural disasters, a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Japanese companies have navigated difficulties associated with the Russia–Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the weak yen. These past successes provide reason for optimism that Japan can weather the coming shocks.

Is Taiwan Fever Breaking In Lithuania? – Analysis	By Thomas J. Shattuck (FPRI) -- One of Taiwan’s most significant foreign policy achievements since the COVID-19 pandemic was the expansion of its unofficial diplomatic cooperation with Lithuania. Both countries opened unofficial representative offices in each other’s capitals—in 2021, Taiwan’s office opened in Vilnius, and in 2022, Lithuania’s office opened in Taipei. The announcement of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania' resulted in a coercive firestorm from Beijing. Since then, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has utilized various diplomatic and economic mechanisms to pressure and punish Lithuania. The two nations’ relations remain at the chargé d’affaires level, with both countries’ embassies remaining closed. After the fall 2024 elections in Lithuania, the new government in Vilnius has made the reestablishment and normalization of Lithuania-PRC relations a foreign policy priority. As these debates continue in Lithuania, it is essential to analyze the state of Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, the implications of backing down to Beijing, and the current state of the Lithuanian economy and trade vis-à-vis PRC economic coercion. Taiwan-Lithuania Trade and Investment After the PRC announced trade repercussions for the enhanced Taiwan-Lithuania relationship, it was incumbent upon Taipei to demonstrate that it could be a reliable trade partner and make it worth the aggravation for Vilnius. After all, the PRC removed Lithuania as a country of origin, preventing anything from Lithuania from entering the PRC. During the first few months, Taiwanese people went out of their way to purchase items from Lithuania that were banned from entering the PRC. To her credit, then-President Tsai Ing-wen announced several new initiatives to encourage Taiwanese investment in Lithuania and to spur joint projects. The Tsai administration set up a $200 million investment fund for high-tech industries and a $1 billion credit fund for joint projects. Some funds have been utilized, but not as many as those figures would presume. Most of the investments were related to fintech and laser technologies. According to an official familiar with Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, Lithuanian politicians are more confident about the bilateral relationship than Lithuanian businesses are since there is a general unfamiliarity with Taiwan and how it conducts business. There are not a lot of easy wins for either country due to the types and sizes of their economies. Nevertheless, trade between Taiwan and Lithuania increased by 50 percent in 2022 from 2021. Taiwan did its part to demonstrate that it supported Lithuania during the diplomatic crisis. However, that spirit was not extended through businesses utilizing these new opportunities, so while the funds are there, the follow-through has been lacking. But that does not mean Lithuania is now worse off because of its trade situation with the PRC. Is Lithuania Worse Off? One would assume that the PRC cutting off all trade with a country like Lithuania would be economically devastating. After several years, the opposite has turned out to be true. The reason for this is simple: Lithuanian exports to the PRC accounted for under one percent, while PRC imports to Lithuanians were only 4 percent. At the outset of the crisis, some Lithuanian industries were heavily affected because the sanctions essentially turned off their business with the PRC overnight. The industries hit hardest by the crisis were furniture, lasers, and high-tech manufacturing. Companies in these industries lost tens of millions of euros from the loss in business in the initial shock. However, this is not the whole story. These companies and industries found new opportunities elsewhere in the European Union, Indo-Pacific, and the United States (not to mention the PRC quietly reduced its economic sanctions on Lithuania). The industries needed time to diversify away from the PRC and shift to other markets. In fact, 'the total exports of Lithuanian origin goods to the ten Indo-Pacific countries increased by 60.4 percent [during January-June 2022], exceeding the volume of exports to China by four times (compared to January-June 2021).' Trade between Lithuania and the PRC has improved since 2022—a reason cited by the European Commission when asking the World Trade Organization to suspend the European Union’s case against the PRC. Lithuanian exports to the PRC are still not at the pre-crisis level, but they reached the floor in early 2022, with a slow but steady increase since then. At the macro level, Lithuania’s gross domestic product has fluctuated but remained positive since the PRC crisis. In 2021, it grew by 6.4 percent; in 2022, it grew by 2.5 percent; and in 2023, it grew by 0.3 percent, with projections for 2024 of over 2 percent. A Lithuania official noted that Lithuania and its economy were not affected by PRC actions because imports and exports recovered due to the ease of finding new markets for certain commodities. The Battle of the Narrative However, measuring the impact of the PRC’s actions on possible deals with other companies and countries worried about angering the PRC is difficult. During the height of the crisis, Beijing was pressuring companies and governments not to use Lithuanian components. There was a general fear of reprisal for anything Lithuanian and how Beijing could expand that punishment beyond Lithuania. While the economic figures speak for themselves, it appears that the PRC has won the battle of the narrative by emphasizing how much worse off Lithuanians are due to Vilnius’ decision to enhance cooperation with Taiwan. Part of this narrative warfare is the failure to make Lithuania the 'gateway' in Europe for Taiwan. In early 2024, a study by the Eastern Europe Studies Centre found that 47.6 percent of Lithuanians believed that 'China is a profitable market and that Lithuania should be pragmatic and refrain from criticizing it.' About 44 percent still thought Lithuania’s 'economy would struggle without investments from China,' even though GDP figures point to a different reality. Most tellingly, 37 percent believed that 'support for Taiwan does not bring any economic benefits to Lithuania and is less important than maintaining good economic relations with China.' However, 40 percent had no opinion, and 22 percent disagreed. These numbers are a shift from another survey conducted in 2022 by GLOBSEC. Slightly over 42 percent of Lithuanians agreed that the PRC 'presents a danger (significant threat)' to Lithuania, and 71 percent disagreed with the statement that 'the Chinese regime could be an inspiration' for Lithuania. This skepticism could be attributed to President Gitanas Nausėda’s consistent disagreement about allowing the Taiwan office to be named 'Taiwanese Representative Office' and not 'Taipei.' He emphasized this point regularly since the beginning of the crisis and continues to do so. Current Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas campaigned on getting the Lithuania-PRC relationship back on track, but has remained silent on what the future holds for the name of the Taiwan office in Vilnius. He noted that he would work towards restoring full ties 'without humiliating ourselves, falling to our knees, and begging for anything.' One of the architects of the expansion of Taiwan-Lithuania relations, Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was serving as foreign minister then, is no longer serving in parliament after his party only won twenty-eight seats in the 2024 parliamentary elections. He maintains that allowing Taiwan to open an office and use the word 'Taiwanese' was the correct decision. He traveled to Taiwan for the first time in January 2025 to receive an award from President Lai Ching-te. While in Taipei, he said changing the name of the office in Vilnius would be an 'enormous mistake' and that 'it is more than just a name. It is part of [Taiwan’s] identity.' Landsbergis reminded the world that the crisis occurred because the PRC created it through sanctions against Lithuania. It is not really up to the current government in Lithuania to fix a problem that it did not create. Looking Ahead The most crucial issue for Lithuania remains the closure of its embassy in the PRC, which makes it difficult for Vilnius to conduct diplomacy with Beijing. It is difficult for people to obtain visas to visit the country for business or pleasure. A Lithuanian official interviewed on these topics noted that the United States and most of the world maintain an embassy in Russia despite the war in Ukraine. Aggressors and competitors can conduct diplomacy, but this is not the case for Lithuania and China. The sticking point is allegedly the name of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office,' and according to one school of thought, the change in the name will fix all problems. If the current government in Vilnius backs down after years of being resolute, it would mark a significant blow to democratic nations standing up to PRC coercion. The PRC’s actual problem lies with the fact that Lithuania expanded its cooperation with Taiwan, not one specific word. The name is just a detail of a larger part of PRC coercion of third parties to limit Taiwan’s international space and ability to conduct its foreign policy. What happens if Vilnius requests that Taipei change the name of its office and Beijing does not fully restore the Lithuania-PRC political and economic relationship for a different reason—like the fact that it left the China-CEE in 2021? That would be a serious blow to the legitimacy of the government, especially in a country that has a history of standing up to authoritarian regimes. Lithuania needs an open and operating embassy in the PRC, but it is incumbent upon Beijing to change its coercive behavior, not Vilnius to back down. About the author: Thomas J.

Musk’s ‘Super Government’ And The ‘New Elites’ – Analysis	By Zhao Zhijiang Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are shaking revamping the U.S. federal government. This is done through applying corporate strategies like cost reduction and efficiency improvement to government agencies, with the goal of building a super-government that no other country can match. As its name suggests, the DOGE is truly efficient. Within less than a month of its establishment, it has pushed through a series of reforms across multiple fronts. These include eliminating agencies, making personnel changes, limiting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s foreign payments, and cutting the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments. Every day, the DOGE shakes up the power structures in Washington. The department's current goal is to cut USD 3 billion per day, and this pace may increase in the future. Recent reports show that Musk and his government efficiency team have already reached at least 19 American government departments and gained internal system access in some of them, further expanding their power. In response to external criticism and attacks, President Donald Trump defended Musk's team, claiming that the federal government is too bloated and that waste and fraud have caused excessive financial losses. Now, Musk continues pushing toward the creation of a 'super-government', focusing on those who profit from politics, particularly Democratic senators. Recently, a video circulating on social media showed Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who usually appears composed, rudely elbowing a reporter who kept challenging her. In the video, the reporter first asks why Warren is bothered by transparency and opposes Musk exposing fraudulent government spending. Then, he asks, 'How did you get a 12 million dollar net worth on a 200,000 dollar salary?' Throughout the exchange, Warren remains silent, smiling as she walks and greets others. Her staff tries to escort the reporter away. When Warren approached her vehicle, she visibly got angry and elbowed the reporter. The video sparked a flood of outraged comments online, with many criticizing Warren as hypocritical and demanding she release her financial and tax records. Some even suggested the reporter should sue Warren for the assault. There are other Democrats in a similar situation to Warren, with unclear income sources and net assets far exceeding what would be expected of a U.S. civil servants. Recent data quoted by Musk shows that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has an annual salary of USD 223,000 but a net worth of USD 202 million. Current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earns USD 210,000 annually, with a net worth of nearly USD 75 million. Some like certain left-wing critics question Musk's data and accuse it of being false information. However, when looking at open-source data and statistics published by authoritative research organizations like OpenSecrets, it becomes clear that these Democrats qualify as 'super-rich' under the standard definition, belonging to the wealthiest 1% of American society. For instance, OpenSecrets data shows that Pelosi's assets exceeded USD 100 million in 2018, reaching USD 115 million, while Warren had nearly USD 8 million in assets that same year. American people have known about these issues for a long time, and previous U.S. administrations were aware as well but chose to turn a blind eye and ignore them. Now, however, Musk's scrutiny has focused on this group of establishment Democrats, judges, and prosecutors, and this is causing quite a stir. The reason is that these individuals' income sources are problematic. During last year’s U.S. election, these establishment figures and people in the courts banded together to attack Trump. Recently, there have been reports showing that USAID provided large sums of money to an organization controlled by financial tycoon George Soros, which in turn funded a large number of prosecutors. Essentially, Soros’s organization was directing them to prosecute Trump during the election. It is said that the financial transactions of these institutions have already been exposed. Additionally, some argue that USAID, with its large amounts of unclear funding, is now the engine behind the U.S. left-wing culture, fueling many of the issues Musk and Trump are determined to change. The question is, what kind of result will Musk's current efforts lead to? A senior researcher from ANBOUND believes that these efforts by the non-establishment factions in the U.S. will actually create a new elite system. These new elites will no longer come from humble beginnings; they will already be wealthy, born into privileged families, and not rely on politics to make money. For them, holding political office is about contributing and serving. Take Musk himself as an example: a billionaire who works for zero salary, earning not a single penny, yet does his job tirelessly day and night, even sleeping in his office. A government made up of such people is what ANBOUND’s team has referred to as an 'elite government'. This is the government Musk aims to build. This, in essence, restores the old tradition of rule by nobles and elites. The only slight difference is people like JD Vance. From his autobiography Hillbilly Elegy, it is clear that Vance is an elite who grew up from humble beginnings. Through his own efforts, he escaped the poverty of the Rust Belt, attended Yale, worked in California, and gradually made his way into U.S. politics, eventually becoming vice president. However, one Vance alone might struggle to handle the vast governance system of a country like the U.S. Therefore Musk’s vision either needs more idealists to succeed, or it could end in failure and collapse. We can see that Musk’s recruitment for the DOGE is aimed at finding people like him. The department’s job posting on X outlines that applicants must have exceptionally high IQs and be willing to work over 80 hours a week, focusing on the tedious task of cost-cutting, with zero pay. This in effect reflects Musk’s own lifestyle and work philosophy. According to a report by Wired, the six young people in the department leading the charge for streamlining government are between 19 and 25 years old. Some are still in college, some started businesses during college, and others have interned at Musk’s companies or those of his friends. None of them have government experience, but they are experts in technology and algorithms. For example, Akash Bobba, of Indian-origin, has interned at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates, working in AI, data analysis, and financial modeling. Another example is Gavin Kliger, whose father graduated from Cornell University and works as a lawyer at the well-known credit reporting agency Experian. These prodigies come from privileged backgrounds, with strong starting points in life, good family circumstances, and little concern for wealth or salary. If a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it would undoubtedly be a significant development in the field of political science. Musk’s efforts to build a 'super government' could gain increasing social support and gradually become part of the mainstream mindset. The outcome, of course, remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Musk’s push to create a super government will have an impact just as profound as his mission to land on Mars, and it will undoubtedly have a massive influence on the world. Final analysis conclusion: When a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it will undoubtedly be a major event in political science. Musk's efforts to create a 'super government' may also gain increasing social support, gradually becoming part of the mainstream mindset.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0y1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-24T16:13:11-08:00	
President Joe Biden’s Decision To Posthumously Pardon Marcus Garv...	By Lipton Matthews President Joe Biden’s decision to posthumously pardon Marcus Garvey has been met with widespread acclaim in the United States and across the global black diaspora. Garvey is revered as an iconic black nationalist and Pan-Africanist thinker, celebrated for his vision of racial uplift and economic self-sufficiency. However, his legacy is far more complex than the hagiographic portrayals suggest. Rather than echoing the usual fawning sentiments, this article will provide an overview of Garvey’s conviction and ideological framework. Garvey’s 1923 conviction for mail fraud remains one of the most controversial episodes in American history. As the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), he was accused of defrauding investors in his ambitious Black Star Line (BSL) shipping venture. However, his trial occurred in an extremely hostile environment. Due to his vocal criticisms of the white political establishment, J. Edgar Hoover had been determined to indict Garvey for fomenting discord as early as 1919. When initial attempts proved abortive Hoover pursued other means to secure a conviction, ultimately arguing Garvey’s management of the Black Star Line could possibly constitute fraud. To build a case, Hoover deployed agents to infiltrate the UNIA. FBI surveillance of Garvey played a key role in justifying his presidential pardon, but the legal basis for such a pardon is more nuanced. The trial judge, Julian Mack, was a known ally and contributor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), an organization that frequently clashed with Garvey. Members of the NAACP supported efforts to prosecute him, and just one day before the trial, the organization’s secretary, James Weldon Johnson, wrote to Mack, raising concerns about impartiality. Citing the precedent set in Berger v. United States, which permits judicial recusal based on extrajudicial factors, Garvey submitted a petition for Mack’s recusal, but it was denied. Faced with a stacked deck, Garvey dismissed his attorney after being advised to accept a plea bargain. This decision only worsened his situation, as Mack failed to ensure Garvey fully understood the consequences of waiving his right to legal representation. Further compounding the miscarriage of justice was the perjury of Schuyler Cargill, a key witness for the prosecution. Cargill claimed to have prepared mailings and made deliveries for the BSL between 1919 and 1921, yet he was unable to identify his supervisor or coworkers. His testimony was crucial, as Garvey’s conviction rested on the allegation that a letter was sent to Benny Dance encouraging him to buy shares in the BSL. However, Cargill later admitted that prosecutors had instructed him to lie about his employment. Also of relevance is Cargill’s declaration that the prosecutor showed him a copy of a circular that the court intended to present to him, which inevitably biased the proceedings. Despite these improprieties, Mack failed to flag Cargill’s testimony as improper, and the prosecution’s case remained intact. The trial’s dubious handling extended to Benny Dance, another prosecution witness. While he received mail from the UNIA, he admitted that he did not always read the contents and could not confirm whether any letter from Garvey urged him to invest. Strangely, the envelope presented in court was empty. Nevertheless, in mail fraud cases, the mere existence of an envelope can be sufficient for conviction, even if its contents remain unknown. It is not impossible for the perpetrator to erroneously post an empty mail, so the existence of an envelope is stronger evidence. Despite these unfavorable circumstances, Garvey appealed his conviction. While the original case was marred by prosecutorial misconduct and judicial bias, the failure of Garvey’s appeal was due to the incompetence of his appellate attorneys. Legal scholar Justin Hansford argues that Garvey’s defense team pursued an ineffective strategy. Instead of emphasizing the lack of intent to defraud, they argued that there was no proof Garvey had used US mail to facilitate fraud. Hansford contends that this was a flawed approach, as they should have known that there was no need to identify the contents of the envelope to establish that Garvey proposed a scheme to defraud. Moreover, Garvey’s own trial testimony did not contradict the prosecution’s assertion that he had solicited investments via mail. By advancing weak arguments, Garvey’s attorneys effectively endorsed the prosecution’s case. Hansford even stated that it would have been nonsensical for the court to overturn his conviction based on the arguments they proposed. Undeniably, Garvey’s original case was imperfect, hence he applied for an appeal to rescind the conviction which was unsuccessful due to the incompetence of his attorneys. Furthermore, one of the judges presiding over the appeal was Justice Learned Hand, who criticized the activism of Justice Mack, so the charge of judicial misconduct is inapplicable in this case. Therefore, Biden’s pardon was unnecessary since Garvey appealed and failed in his second attempt to exonerate his name. Further, Garvey’s defenders often overlook his own awareness that the Black Star Line was poorly managed and undermined by corrupt staffers. While FBI infiltration and sabotage played a role, the BSL resembled a Ponzi scheme destined for collapse. Disgruntled employees even claimed that he purchased overpriced ships and later used the vessels for propagandistic purposes to the detriment of profit. Due to the precarious financial situation of Garvey’s enterprises, he resorted to diverting funds budgeted for financing the shipping line to sponsor the Negro World and other businesses. Strapped for cash, Garvey failed to pay employees on time and summarily dismissed accountants who exposed his financial practices. The opinion expressed by the appellate court echoes the sentiments of many who thought that Garvey preyed on naive people: The substance of the indictment is that, while there center around Garvey other associations or corporations for their object the uplift and enhancement of the negro race, the entire scheme of uplift was used to persuade Negroes for the most part to buy shares of stock in the Black Star Line at $5 per share, when the defendants well knew, notwithstanding florid representations...that said shares could never be worth $5 cash. Beyond his legal troubles, Garvey’s ideological framework warrants scrutiny. His philosophy emphasized black self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and the establishment of an independent African homeland. However, his views also contained troubling elements. As A. James Gregor notes in Black Nationalism and Neofascism, Garvey’s rhetoric and organizational methods bore striking similarities to European fascist movements. Garvey even described himself as a fascist and claimed that Mussolini borrowed ideas from him. Like European fascists, he viewed racial and tribal conflicts as inevitable and saw militarism as essential. He also believed that racial groups should always be prepared for battle and expecting to win such battles without industrializing was futile. Additionally, as a tribal thinker, Garvey opposed the multi-racial state. Garvey promoted the concept of racial homelands. Unlike liberals, he felt that Africa was for Africans, Europe was for Europeans, and America was built by white people for their descendants. Garvey’s vision for an independent black state was unapologetically nationalist and anti-integrationist which made him an opponent of the NAACP’s integrationist agenda. Another similarity between Garveyism and fascism is the primacy of the nation-state as an avenue for economic and social advancement. Both Garveyism and early fascism posited that individuals achieved personal fulfillment through the state. Likewise, these philosophies countered Marxism by envisioning a managed form of capitalism that served the interests of the nation-state. A deep preference for strong states ruled by elites who wield immense power is another area where these philosophies find common ground. Garvey’s ideal state is closer to Plato’s Republic or Singapore than to America. Additionally, to inculcate national pride, Garveyism and fascism rely on historical myths. Hence, it is unsurprising that Garvey often informed his followers that Africans were a creative race whose ideas were stolen by whites. Garvey’s eccentricity heightens when the parallels between Garveyism and Hitlerism are explored. Fascism is an identitarian, though not exclusively racist movement like Hitlerism. Hitler and Garvey implored their followers to espouse racial truths. Garvey preached that all issues should be assessed using a racial framework. He was so committed to race that he encouraged blacks to embellish facts for the benefit of the race, even lying was permitted. Paradoxically, Garvey admired the Jews but nevertheless argued that they were tribal people who could not be trusted. Despite antisemitic sentiments, Garvey criticized how they were treated by Hitler. Notwithstanding his distrust of Jews, Garvey theorized that anti-Jewish hatred was premised on envy. Indeed, he was a complicated character though it must be noted that Garvey never recanted his affinity for the generic ideas of Mussolini and Hitler, he only lambasted them when it seemed that their projects were antithetical to blacks. Garvey himself was an imperialist with plans to colonize the 'primitive tribes' of Africa, he only disliked the thought of Hitler and Mussolini colonizing blacks. Particularly controversial were Garvey’s interactions with the Ku Klux Klan. While ostensibly his dialogues with the Klan were pragmatic—rooted in a shared belief in racial separatism—they alienated many black leaders. Garvey and Klan members were natural allies because they preferred racial homelands. Klan members appreciated that Garvey was a racial separatist who wanted blacks to reside in their own state. Furthermore, contrary to popular narratives, Garvey was not a civil rights activist in the mold of Martin Luther King, Jr. or W.E.B. Du Bois. He did not advocate for racial integration or equality under a shared national identity. Quite appropriately, Garvey argued that blacks should create alternatives to white institutions, instead of depending on their benevolence. When Jim Crow laws irritated other blacks, Garvey remarked that Americans’ transportation infrastructure was built by whites for their consumption. Garvey was a conservative philosopher in the Western tradition with racist worldviews and thinking otherwise indicates delusion. Garvey’s legacy is also marred by violence within his movement. Thomas Lennon’s research indicates that UNIA members frequently resorted to attacking critics. In 1922, Cincinnati UNIA leader William Ware and three associates assaulted black educator Samuel Saxon for opposing Garvey. In 1923, Garvey’s African Legion member Charles Linous was imprisoned for making death threats during the trial. UNIA members were also accused of killing Garvey’s rivals, including Reverend James Eason, who had intended to testify against him and Laura Coffey. Garveyism is laced with negativities, however his work contains positive elements. Garvey’s emphasis on economic empowerment, professional development, and anti-corrupt leadership remains deeply relevant. While his racialist views appear problematic, his moral vision and entrepreneurial spirit inspire admiration. Despite being a black nationalist, Garvey was never afraid to tell blacks that other groups would continue to outperform them unless they improved themselves. Neither did he refrain from chastising them for expecting to get rich overnight, when entrepreneurial success requires years of hard work. While his flirtations with fascism and racial separatism merit scrutiny, his pioneering advocacy for black self-reliance and economic independence continues to resonate. Garvey’s legacy offers a roadmap for empowerment, leadership, and self-determination when stripped of its contentious elements.

The Party Is Over – OpEd	The Trump administration, pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency and deployed by the Office of Personnel Management, has sent another email to all federal employees with a normal request to present five tasks accomplished in the last week. It’s an easy task. It takes 5 minutes. In the service industry, this is entirely normal, even routine. Taking inventory of the workforce is standard for any new management in the private sector. Oddly, absolute mania broke out among the pundit class. Government unions are preparing lawsuits. The panic and frenzy is palpable. As it turns out, no new president has ever done anything like this before, no Democrat who believes in good government and no Republican who supposedly distrusts bureaucracy. Something dramatic has hit Washington. It’s about more than Trump. The party now in control of the US executive branch is a third party built out of the corpses of two existing parties. It goes by the name Republican but this is nearly a historical accident. The GOP was a vessel that was least protected against invasion and occupation. It has now been nearly taken over by outsiders who had little or no influence within the party a decade ago. Nearly all the top people now in power – including Trump of course but also Musk, Gabbard, Kennedy, Lutnick, and so many more, to say nothing of the voters themselves – are refugees from the Democratic Party. Coalitions have dramatically changed. Voting blocs have migrated. And policy debates and priorities are nothing like they have been in any period since the end of the Great War. The occupiers left a Democratic Party that was and is busy consuming itself with Rousseauian frenzies on issues about which most people do not care or are otherwise completely opposed. The legacy establishment of the Republican Party, however, never welcomed them in. They were hated and resisted at every step. The Kennedy Migration To understand the remarkable speed and trajectory of this creation of a third party within the structure of two, consider that it was not even two years ago when Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was first contemplating running for president as a Democrat. The conditions were unique. He had gained an enormous following for his courage during Covid, standing up against the lockdowns, speaking out against the censorship and rights violations, and then decrying the imposition of shots that achieved nothing for public health. In 2023, President Biden was unpopular and not even credible as the chief executive, much less as a candidate for a second term. The thinking in the Kennedy camp at the time was that a run by Kennedy for the Democratic nomination would force an open primary and he could lead the party back to its roots, away from woke totalitarianism toward the political values of his father and uncle. In theory, all of this seemed plausible. His first rallies were crowded events, and the money poured in. Volunteers were signing up to work for the campaign. The first ads that appeared were nostalgic of a lost time, an America before the shattering of civic culture that came with the assassination of his uncle in 1963. The framing and even music of his campaign reflected such themes. If anyone could fix the Democrats, it was surely Kennedy with a lifetime of activism and experience in litigation against corporate capture of agencies, plus a recent campaign for human rights and free speech. The presumption here was that the Democrats had some base of support that still supported such values. And maybe that was right but his intentions ran headlong into the machinery of party leadership. His intention was to challenge Trump for the presidency, and the basis of the challenge was rather obvious. It was, after all, under Trump’s watch that the lockdowns began and the legal apparatus that led to the dangerous shots was deployed. It was Trump who kicked off the economic crisis with wave after wave of stimulus payments plus monetary expansion. As an empirical matter, he had presided over the worst invasion of rights of any president in history. That’s where matters stood only two years ago. When it became obvious that there would be no open primary, Kennedy was tempted by the lure of an independent run. The most immediate problem of gaining ballot access hit hard. The system, after all, is set up for two parties only and they want no competition unless such an effort works as a spoiler. That was not obvious with Kennedy – he drew equally from both sides – so everyone with power wanted him excluded. The other problem traces to the undeniable logic of winner-take-all elections. Under Duverger’s law, such contests tend to default to two choices only. This logic applies not just to politics but to all systems of voting. If you offer guests at a party the chance to vote on dinner, but the majority will prevail over the minority, everyone will immediately shift from voting for what they like toward voting against the food they hate the most. For some reason, this pattern of strategic voting is hardly mentioned in polite company but it is a reality in US politics. Voters select against the candidate they fear the most and for the person they believe can win to forestall the worst possible outcome. In the Kennedy case, then, it meant that no matter how much people loved him, they would end up supporting either Biden or Trump regardless. It so happened that over the summer, this logic was pressing itself heavily on the Kennedy campaign even as Trump faced astonishing levels of deep-state lawfare plus an assassination attempt, which conjured up deep family trauma in Kennedy. This provoked some discussions between the two that resulted in a historic realignment in politics. During these discussions, Trump was frank about what happened during the Covid period. He had been lied to by his bureaucracy, the experts who had been assigned to him to say that this virus was a bioweapon with possible cure in the form of a new vaccine. With great reluctance and only for a limited time did he approve what everyone, including family members and conservative pundits, was telling him to do. As for Warp Speed, Trump had always considered it to be an aggressive push for a solution. International and domestic sources named Hydroxychloroquine as a workable therapeutic, and so he ordered it for mass distribution. It was essentially inconceivable in those days that the deeper bureaucracy would not only remove it and other repurposed drugs from distribution but even generate fake studies warning against them, all in an effort to push the new pharmaceutical product. Trump was surely astonished to see these events unfold in a manner that he could not control. In that connection, both Trump and RFK, Jr. agreed on the dangers to American health from a variety of sources, including that emanating from the overuse of pharmaceuticals. Trump learned from Kennedy’s expertise on this matter, and they experienced a meeting of minds. And not only on this but on the evils of captured agencies, censorship, and deep state manipulation of public culture in general. They would never agree on issues of oil and gas, of course, but on that topic too Kennedy had been moved by the Covid years to reconsider the supposed science behind climate change, especially that which recommended more human suffering as a means of solving a supposed existential threat. We may never know the fullness of what took place over those two days but the discussions changed history, bringing together two mighty forces in American culture that had long been separated by party label and tribal identity: bourgeois nationalism vs. the haut bourgeois crunchy liberalism of the Whole Foods set. As it turned out, they had a common enemy. Now Kennedy is the new head of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which is now undertaking the largest attempt at routing the DC establishment since Andrew Jackson. His goal is to turn around the whole ship of state, industry, and science, away from fakery and industrial corruption emanating from a single focus on infectious disease toward a new focus on chronic disease with science-based and natural solutions. That is a herculean task. The Musk Migration Elon Musk is the third force within this leadership triumvirate of the new party. Before 2020, he was a politically conventional investor and entrepreneur. Mostly he associated with the default party of the elites, the Democrats. Then lockdowns came. He was the only major corporate leader in the US and probably anywhere in the industrialized world who publicly stood up in protest. He said he would sooner sleep on the floor of his factory than close it. He refused vaccine mandates in all his companies. He pulled Tesla out of California and moved it to Texas. He moved all his corporate registrations out of Delaware. By 2023, he was a changed man, newly aware of the threat of Leviathan, and did a deep dive into anti-statist literature. He faced his own family battles over woke ideology, and this made his intellectual transformation complete. He entered the political season with a new consciousness. Whereas he once regarded the bureaucracy as annoyingly necessary, he increasingly viewed it as the source of unchecked tyranny. At one level, the meetup of Trump and Musk – like the meetup of Trump and Kennedy – was completely implausible. Musk regarded his greatest achievement as a businessman as having made the most mighty contribution to clean energy yet, having broken up the automotive monopoly and mass-produced the first commercially viable electric car. Trump, on the other hand, had sworn to smash electric car subsidies and called for deregulation of oil and gas. To link up with Trump meant having to put at risk even the tax break for consumers of EVs. But he was ready for that simply because, like Kennedy, he became convinced that Western civilization itself was at risk from a woke Leviathan that had shown its teeth in the most brutal way during the Covid years. His reason for purchasing Twitter for $44 billion was to bust up the censorship cartel that was constructed to enforce lockdowns and promote the vaccine. Once having taken over, he discovered the extent of government control, uprooted it, and unleashed free speech on the US. Here again, Musk shared this concern with Kennedy and Trump. All three linked up on the crucial issues: the desperate need to curb and crush the power and reach of the administrative state. This is an issue that crosses left and right, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, and all other traditional categories. The Gabbard Migration In this connection, there was also the national security angle in which decades of neoconservative 'forever wars' had bred resentment and failure abroad, thus bringing over the articulate Tulsi Gabbard from the Democrats to Trump’s side, together with other influencers like Pete Hegseth who saw traditional military concerns having given way to woke ideology that Musk despised and Kennedy found to be deeply corrupting of traditional liberal concerns. Their interests dovetailed with the revolt against globalism generally, which had taken the form of endless unwinnable wars, unchecked spigots of foreign aid, taxpayer pillaging in the form of subsidies to international syndicates of NGOs and agencies, plus the cruel deployment of immigration as a tool of electoral manipulation. It was the immigration point that triggered the populist push for the new nationalism that gathered in new refugees from the antiwar sectors of the left and right. Donald Trump himself has undergone his own migration. An industrial mercantilist from his earliest public statements, he gradually absorbed a de facto anti-statism once his ill-fated first term was subverted from within and then he faced unprecedented lawfare and even assassination attempts to stop his second term. When he told the Libertarian Party that this lawfare made him a libertarian in spirit, he was being truthful. Once it became personal, the new head of state effectively turned against the state and all its works. These are all circuitous paths but they reached the point of having huge influence over the public mind in the wake of the Covid years that discredited existing elites and prepared the way for a completely new way of going about government and public life. Given the meme culture of our time, this new party went by various names, first MAGA and then MAHA and then DOGE (in homage to the meme coin that started as a joke and then became real). MAGA/MAHA/DOGE is not exactly the catchiest name for the new ruling party but it is far more accurate than Republican, much less Democrat. It is a new party formed out of the discredited shells of the two existing parties that lost public trust over decades of misrule culminating in an ill-fated attempt to master the exigencies of the microbial kingdom. In a Kuhnian sense, the collapse of the orthodox paradigm (rule by administrative agencies informed by captured science) was complete by 2023, preparing the way for the pre-paradigmatic coalition of these fascinating characters, backed by popular movements that are mirrored in many lands, and generally sailing under the flag of populism. And here is the crucial fact: these leaders have their reach, influence, and power because the causes they represent have come of age with a population completely fed up with misrule by experts. These are new and highly promising times, as the old undergoes a merciful dismantling and something entirely new takes its place. We find the roots of the ideology of the administrative state in the works of Woodrow Wilson, and it takes only a few minutes of reading his deluded fantasies of how science and compulsion would forge a better world to see that it was only a matter of time before the whole experiment was in tatters. It took more than a century but that day is finally here. The paradigm has shifted. For all the messiness and frenzy – including the chaos, confusion, and betrayals – our times at least present opportunity to reassert a foundational principle of the Enlightenment; namely that the people themselves should have some fluid and influential role in shaping the workings of the regime under which they are forced to live.

Now Is The Time For L.A. To End Single-Family Zoning – OpEd	By David Youngberg Los Angeles needs more housing. Now, more than ever. The fires that roared through the city in January 2025 were nothing short of devastating, with over 16,000 structures destroyed and an estimated 150,000 people displaced. In the wake of the disaster, victims scoured the still-hot wreckage for scraps of their former lives. The immensity of their loss was only dwarfed by its suddenness. And then there’s the rent. The mass destruction of homes exacerbated L.A.’s already pricey housing market. Rents substantially shot up, sometimes more than doubling. As is often the case in the aftermath of disaster, the public demanded that the government freeze prices. Disasters create the political will necessary to enact sweeping reforms, but rent control is the wrong approach because it discourages construction and causes more harm than good. Fortunately the city has not (yet) gone down this route. The California Coastal Commission is also waiving permit requirements to rebuild lost homes. But that will only return L.A. to the terrible housing market before the fires. The city should instead end single-family zoning so a better, more affordable city can rise out of the ashes. Supply and Demand Determine the Price of Housing Most people don’t know how the housing market works. The same people who understand that more cars will cut car prices and more grain will cut grain prices will flatly deny that more housing will cut housing prices. As Michael Munger once wrote, 'The mind…boggles.' It’s not as if landlords suddenly discovered money is good at precisely the same time a bunch of homes were destroyed. As 'price gougers' can 'take advantage' of people because there are so few options, they would have trouble 'getting away' with 'jacking up prices' if there were more options. If mass destruction increases the price of housing, mass creation will reduce it. The question becomes: How can L.A. radically increase its housing stock? Zoning Laws Choke Off Availability Even before the fires, Los Angeles was not a cheap place to live, with an average home price of just shy of a million dollars. Most of the price tag came from the land the house was on. This is how homes less than a thousand square feet can go for over half a million dollars. Multiple households on the same lot assuage the land cost burden. A 20-unit building on land worth half a million means each unit’s price goes up by $25,000. That’s not a trivial amount of money, but it’s far less than the unit’s construction costs. Unfortunately, in most of the places people want to live, it’s illegal for multiple households to live on the same land. Single-family zoning—one house per lot—means one family has to pay the entire price tag for the land, and the housing price is thus also high. Single-family zoning forces people to waste precious land. Single-family zoning is dreadfully common. Like in many places in the United States, areas where it’s illegal to build affordable housing dominate—an astonishing 75% of L.A.’s residential land is zoned for single-family homes. Before burnt-out housing drove up rents, unbuilt housing was the culprit. Single-family zoning isn’t the only reason there are so few places to live—parking requirements, historic districts, permitting processes, minimum lot sizes, and other barriers make it all worse—but ending single-family zoning is a great place to start rethinking the housing market. Chicago Rebuilt Better Destruction is terrible, but if you have to rebuild, rebuild thoughtfully. This is exactly what Chicago did after the Great Fire of 1871. Much like the L.A. fires, extremely dry weather and strong winds transformed a small flame into a city-consuming inferno. Chicago’s fire raged for 30 hours, destroying over 17,000 buildings and leaving a third of the population homeless. As in L.A., it was fueled by a forest of wooden homes. Chicago was too well-located to abandon, and investment poured in. Under new regulations that we’d consider common sense, the Great Rebuilding remade the Windy City. It’s no coincidence Chicago soon became home to the world’s first skyscraper, with its unburnable metal frame and massive windows (more sunlight meant fewer candles). More followed. The city rose like a phoenix, far surpassing its previous population and earning fame for its cutting-edge architecture. Los Angeles Can, Too As Chicago recognized it had too few regulations, L.A. should recognize it has too many. Now is a perfect opportunity to unmoor its residents from a system that drives up housing prices. Greater density may be a hard pill for Angelenos to swallow, but even the widespread adoption of the humble duplex would drastically increase the number of units without any increase in fire danger. Greater affordability will help combat homelessness and the fires that come with it. Los Angeles doesn’t have to take a radical position to make major progress. As L.A. residents rebuild and recover, let us hope they don’t miss the lesson: as mass destruction brought rents up, mass construction will bring rents down.

Iran: Factional Infighting Grips Regime As Economic Crisis Deepen...	With the expansion of protests in Iran and the social repercussions of the dire increase in prices and unsolvable imbalances, the regime’s internal crisis has reached a new stage. Regime president Masoud Pezeshkian, describing the dispute between the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Oil, referred to the proverb of a hard ground and butting bulls, saying: 'These ministers of ours sometimes fall short in the oil, electricity, and gas sectors, so they blame each other. We are really facing problems in electricity and gas supply right now. Reserves have also decreased; one won’t give, and the other won’t send reserves. And there’s no way to send reserves at all. The ground is hard; we can’t plow it, so we butt heads with each other' (state-run TV, February 13, 2025). The first days of Esfand (the last month in the Iranian calendar, corresponds to February 20 – March 20) and Bahman 30 (February 18) saw two consecutive sessions of the regime’s parliament (Majlis), where regime officials expressed fear of a 'revolution of the hungry' and the sinking of the regime’s ship. MP Qasem Ravanbakhsh, while admitting to the smoldering embers of poverty in society, said, 'These days, the bones of the people, especially the poor, are being crushed under the wheels of the government’s economic adjustment. In previous administrations, when the exchange rate increased, the government and parliament would think of a solution, but now that the dollar has reached over 900,000 rials and gold coins are over 70 million rials, and medicine, rice, legumes, meat, and essential goods have skyrocketed, no action is seen from the government to control it.' Javad Nikbin, another member of the parliament, while expressing concern about the explosive state of society and 'the events that are happening,' addressed the regime’s president, saying: 'These events happening in the country are not the result of sanctions but the result of your wrong decisions in foreign policy, elections, appointments, and all these areas… Twelve hours of motor-pump shutdowns a day means the farmer is ruined. Twelve hours of shutdowns a day means millions of farmers across the country are unemployed… Friends know, government officials know, Minister of Oil, Minister of Energy, know that the price of oil, gas, and electricity has increased by more than 1,500 percent from Mehr (September/October) to today…' MP Ahad Beitoteh, while warning about the deadly effects of the livelihood crisis for the regime, said, 'People are tired of empty promises… Unfortunately, in recent months, we have witnessed an unreasonable and uncontrollable increase in the prices of essential goods, especially items that have the greatest impact on people’s livelihoods… Minister of Economy! Mr. [Abdolnaser] Hemmati! You said that we would raise the Nima dollar (a subsidized exchange rate for importers) to lower the free market dollar price, but you broke the record for the speed of the dollar’s increase. After three months, you have made gold and foreign currency more than 50 percent more expensive. Medicine and essential goods have become more expensive; in less than three months, you have reduced people’s purchasing power by 50 percent…' Amid the factional infighting, Kamran Ghazanfari, a member of the parliament’s Internal Affairs Committee, announced that members of parliament had filed complaints against Pezeshkian and Mohammad Javad Zarif, Pezeshkian’s Vice President for Strategic Affairs, in the Administrative Justice Court and the Supreme Court of the regime. A significant number of members of parliament also demanded the impeachment of Pezeshkian’s Minister of Economy, Hemmati. MP Hamid Rasaee went a step further, saying, 'Do not impeach Mr. Hemmati. Prosecute him. This is the only way if you want to be honorable before history, before the people, prosecute Mr. Hemmati.' Finally, on February 19, Ahmad Naderi, a member of the parliament’s presiding board, said, 'The impeachment of the Minister of Economy has been submitted to the presiding board by the Economic Commission after necessary reviews, and therefore, with 91 signatures, it has been declared received, and the chairman of the session (Hamidreza Haji Babaei) announced March 2 as the day of impeachment.' In the same session, MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghian set aside politeness and, while warning about the sinking of the entire regime in the swamp of crises, said, 'What is the council of the heads of the three branches doing for critical issues?… Mr. Pezeshkian, you are also clinging to branches and leaves; you will also stop at the same station where previous governments stopped. Dear ones! Let’s not be polite; this ship is sinking. We will realize it when it goes underwater!'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-6mFSNniVz8	2025-02-24T16:06:08-08:00	
Gaza’s Reconstruction Roadblock: The Unresolved Role Of Hamas – A...	By Kabir Taneja Gulf powers in the Middle East are locked in a sprint towards coming up with a viable plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and upkeep as President Donald Trump takes charge in Washington, and mobilises pressureby threatening a take-over of the strip by the US. Trump’s plan includes a 'relocation and resettlement of the population in Gaza to safer, neighbouring nations' such as Egypt and Jordan, and in return subsequently transforming the contentious piece of land into a 'riviera of the Middle East'. Trump’s quintessential take—viewing Gaza more as a real-estate problem than a deep-rooted geopolitical crisis, especially at the nucleus of many Middle Eastern fissures— has, if nothing else, forced Arab powers into an urgent huddle. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait recently met in Riyadh to try and reinvigorate an Arab-led blueprint for the Palestinian crisis as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza continues. How serious Trump is regarding his view of the displacement and reinstatement of a population is up for debate. But the relatively casual tone of narratives flowing in from the White House has certainly ruffled enough feathers to mobilise regional powers, ahead of the emergency Arab Summit in Cairo, Egypt on 4 March 2025, to further discuss Gaza’s reconstruction plan. However, the core issue in the Gaza context today is not simply reconstruction and rebuilding, but also the political future of the strip and the Palestinian cause. Questions about the political leadership of the Palestinians, beyond Hamas, remain critical. Currently, there is neither clarity, direction nor any movement to address this core conundrum. While Hamas has been dealt multiple blows over the past year and a half, including the planned assassination of its top leadership, it seems to be holding on to its influence despite Israel’s stated vision of eliminating the group. This is only coupled with the fact that any potential replacement of Hamas, at least in a public forum, has not been seriously discussed regionally. Replacing Hamas as both a political and military influence in Gaza will not be a simple endeavour even though the militant group itself is responsible for much of Gaza’s suffering. While Israel’s heavy-handedness in using disproportionate force since October 2023 has flattened Gaza into a nearly unrecognisable geography, Hamas is still quite functional. It recently clocked Public Relations (PR) wins on the sidelines of prisoner exchanges as part of the ceasefire agreement and a broader distinction of the idea of ‘resistance’ from ‘terror’ in many sections of public discourse. Its other sibling, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) during a recent visit to Iran added to the complexities as PIJ’s Chief Ziad al-Nakhala reaffirmed his commitment towards the 'path of resistance'. For the Arab powers, the path forward is undeniably fraught. The financial practicality behind Gaza’s reconstruction, in injecting both political and economic sponsorships, is not as difficult for several of these cash-rich states. However, to remould Palestinian politics to future-proof it against a military-first posture and simultaneously be cognizant of Israel’s security interests has multiple layers attached to it. The path forward would ideally demand both compromises and clarity from all parties involved, a task easier said than done. To begin with, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE may need to leverage their access with Iran in an institutional manner, aiming to ease Tehran’s support for Hamas, PIJ, and Hezbollah. Thereafter, Israel would have to be brought in, and at the very basic, its sovereignty-led security needs would have to be realistically addressed. Whether this translates into a two-state solution or not, remains the fundamental question. On paper, no other outcomes exist, and any other disruption in the status quo in all likeliness will not be a solution, but a bandaid at best. The underlying question now remains, whether a solution should be sought, or is the status-quo consolidating benefits to only a few, the preferred choice. The regional competition, which has benefited from the Palestinian flux, by working in a both short-term favourable capacity and often against regional players, including Arab states, will also have to deal with big power competition. This is an added spanner in the proverbial peace wheel. China has already thrown its support behind an Arab-led pro-Palestine two-state solution. Russia, however, is on the ropes. The overnight collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria not only dented Moscow’s political clout, but geographically, has also pushed it to the peripheries of the region whilst mediating with the new regime of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus to regain control of its lost military bases on the country’s Mediterranean coast. Simultaneously, a Donald Trump–Vladimir Putin détente is not only putting Europe on the edge but Iran as well. Such a speculation is driven by Iran’s well-defined fears that its long-standing ally in Moscow could give America concessions for long-term strategic gain in the European continent in exchange for leverage over Tehran, particularly at the United Nations Security Council. In all the aforementioned kerfuffle, the future of Palestinian politics rests in a grey zone. Any attempt to dismantle the grip of Hamas Gaza would have to be a long-winded process. Militarily, an outright elimination may not be possible. Politically, subsuming Hamas into a broader Palestinian process is perhaps an even graver challenge, with the group’s penchant to fight even within the Palestinian systems to ensure its hegemony remains undeterred. Finally, the Arab world finds itself in a spot of bother. It ideally wants Hamas gone, but equally expects to not be held responsible for any long-term or even permanent displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza. This is not only because of what may be the right thing to do from an Arab perspective, but also because any perception of their collusion over such an act could become a direct challenge to the leader’s authority, especially if the issue galvanises the street and public sentiment beyond a point. Envisioning the next four years, Trump is now imploring Europeans to think more deeply about their own security viz-a-viz Russia, and Arabs to take more responsibility for regional dynamics viz-a-viz Israel and Palestine. This disruption in particular, may not be entirely detrimental in the long run.

Centrist Coalition, More Debt: Merz Rushes To Lock In A Deal	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Fresh off his election win, Friedrich Merz wasted no time on Monday, pushing to form a government with the Social Democrats that could unlock new security spending even before a new coalition is officially sealed. Merz’s Christian Democrats won Sunday’s German election with a big lead, but must now find a coalition partner. As expected beforehand, the party’s lead candidate quickly turned to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of the incumbent Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as his preferred partner. 'We will now be holding talks [with the SPD] over the next few days,' Merz told journalists at the CDU headquarters in Berlin on Monday, naming foreign and security policy, managing migration, and boosting Germany's industry as priority topics. Merz was due to talk to Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s co-leader, the same day and added he would also speak to Scholz to coordinate during the transition. Klingbeil, who is by some accounts the party’s new figurehead as Scholz announced his imminent departure, played hard to get on Monday, saying it was not a given that the SPD would join a coalition. But he also added: 'We're ready to hold talks.' The election result leaves few other options for a stable, centrist government, as the centre was squeezed in Sunday’s ballot. The seat share of parties on the centre-left and centre-right dropped by a third compared to the last election in 2021. A coalition of the Greens and the CDU falls short of a majority, while the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) failed to re-enter parliament. The centre-right bloc would have a majority with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), but Merz again ruled out formal cooperation on Sunday. The centre's losses created an even more pressing headache for Merz regarding delivering on his Sunday night promise to bolster Germany’s defence and help make Europe independent of US protection and the erratic new president, Donald Trump. The necessary investment will be hard to fund within the boundaries of Germany’s strict constitutional debt rules. To reach NATO’s spending target of 2% alone, €95 billion annually would be needed as of 2028, according to Munich-based Ifo Institute – almost double the current defence budget. For a potential 3% target, €140 billion would be needed. But to change the constitution, a two-thirds majority is needed in the German parliament, which the centrist parties CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens narrowly failed to reach. Old rules are changing With the clock ticking, Berlin scrambled on Monday to avoid tying the hands of the new government before it takes office, which could usher in a rare and controversial move. The Greens suggested calling a snap Bundestag meeting within the next 30 days, while the parliament is officially still in session within the bounds of its previous composition, to allow for new debt and defence investment. Both Merz and Scholz signalled they were open to the approach. One option would be to agree to reform the ‘debt brake’, a constitutional deficit limit, that would increase fiscal leeway, including for defence. The debt brake, introduced in 2009, restricts structural public deficits to 0.35% of GDP, but has come under fire recently for stifling investment into infrastructure and Germany’s defence. Alternatively, the government could create an extra-budgetary special fund outside the limits of the debt brake, that can be adopted via a two-thirds majority. Such a special fund of €100 billion was created after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but will have dried up by 2027. Officially, the CDU aims to maintain the debt limit, but Merz signalled openness for reform during the campaign. The SPD, meanwhile, is in favour of reform, arguing previously that higher defence spending should not come at the expense of pensioners, the welfare state, or other public investment. Notably, Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), echoed those talking points on Monday, saying, 'It won't be possible to organise our defence by just cutting back everything' and causing 'social tension.' Merz could also opt for difficult negotiations with The Left in the new parliament. The far-left party has left the door open to jointly reform the debt brake but opposes higher defence spending. But given the perceived urgency of the situation and the squeeze of the centre, the old rules seem to be changing rapidly. Merz said his priority was to end the state of crisis in Germany and win back trust after a difficult three-year period. 'Some of you will share the view that this term could be one of the last chances to achieve this,' he told journalists.

The World Bank And IMF Await Elon Musk – OpEd	I think that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been misinformed. I don’t disagree with their shutting down USAID, but I think it’s rather small fry. There are much, much bigger fish to fry if you want to really save U.S. government money that is being wasted in programs that are mischievously justified as aid to the poor people of the world. Elon, hear me out: if you walk northwest from your headquarters at the Eisenhower Executive Building along Pennsylvania Avenue, you’ll come after one long block upon two ugly buildings squatting beside each other. One is the World Bank. The other is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You can actually just walk in and demand to look at their books since they are extensions of the U.S. government. And you would have a very good reason to do so, since these are two of the most questionable and controversial institutions directly or indirectly funded with U.S. taxpayers’ money. Let me start with the World Bank, which is located at 1818 H St NW. This institution has so-called development projects throughout the Global South, otherwise known as developing countries. This agency says that its mission is to end poverty in the developing world. To fulfill this goal, its lending has risen from nearly $55 billion in 2015 to $117.5 billion in 2024. Yet, despite this massive increase, the Bank admits that global poverty reduction 'has slowed to a near standstill, with 2020-2030 set to be a lost decade.' Some 3.5 billion people, or 44 percent of the globe, remain poor, after decades of massive World Bank lending. And a major part of the reason is that World Bank programs have created poverty instead of alleviating it. Living in Luxury While 'Fighting Poverty' To manage its operations, the Bank’s full-time staff rose from nearly 12,000 in 2015 to over 13,000 in 2023. These figures are just the tip of the iceberg. If one includes all employees—permanent, non-permanent, contractual, part-time—throughout the world, the Bank employs close to 41,000 people. The vast majority, 26,000, or 63 percent, work out of the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC, and only 3,200 are located in Africa, where most people in extreme poverty live. The Bank’s economists and top administrators are among the highest paid financial functionaries in the world, which explains the reason why the Bank is a major cause of the brain drain from developing countries: a great number of highly trained economists from developing countries prefer to work at the Bank instead of their home countries, with some going straight from Ivy League or British graduate schools to Washington, DC. Many within the Bank and the International Monetary Fund complain about the 'South Asian Mafia' that they claim controls employment opportunities for economists and higher-level staff in the two organizations. The World Bank has come under fire for the billions it has spent supporting fossil-fuel projects throughout the Third World that have contributed to global warming and to mega-dam projects that have displaced millions. The Bank, along with the Fund, has also gained notoriety for imposing 'structural adjustment' programs guided by the radical principles of the 'Washington Consensus' that are designed to promote globalization but have, instead, increased poverty and deepened inequality. The reason World Bank projects and programs don’t work or create exactly the opposite of their intended goals is because they are based on questionable propositions built on little or no empirical evidence. An assessment made a few years ago by an all-star team of renowned economists led by Princeton’s Angus Deaton, a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics, was damning: [The] panel had substantial criticisms of the way that the research was used to proselytize on behalf of Bank policy, often without taking a balanced view, and without expressing appropriate skepticism. Internal research that is favorable to Bank positions was given great prominence, and unfavorable research ignored. In these cases, we believe that there was a serious failure of checks and balances that should have separated advocacy and research. The panel endorses the right of the Bank to strongly defend and advocate its own policies. But when the Bank leadership selectively appeals to relatively new and untested research as hard evidence that thes preferred policies work, it lends unwarranted confidence to the Bank’s prescriptions. Placing fragile selected new research results on a pedestal invites later recrimination that undermines the credibility and usefulness of all Bank research. The Bank’s refusal to acknowledge real-world refutations of its pro-globalization advocacy and its unbalanced, one-sided research led to justifiable rejection of its advice by the people who were suffering from the policies it was implementing, confessed Paul Collier, head of the Bank’s Research Development Department of the Bank from 1998 to 2003: The profession has been unprofessional, fearful that any criticism would strengthen populism, so that little work has been done on the downsides of these different processes [of globalization]. Yet the downsides were apparent to ordinary citizens, and the effect of economists appearing to dismiss them has resulted in widespread refusal of people to listen to 'experts.' For my profession to re-establish credibility we must provide a more balanced analysis, in which the downsides are acknowledged and properly evaluated with a view to designing policy responses that address them. The profession may be better served by mea culpa than by further indignant defenses of globalization. Despite the high rate of failure of its lending programs acknowledged in internal World Bank assessments, the World Bank administrative budget that supports the high salaries of its economists and other high-level staff just keeps growing. The World Bank (IBRD/IDA) administrative budget was approved at $3.5 billion for FY25, a sizable rise from the $3.1 billion authorized for FY 2024, with no convincing reason at all. The IMF and the Art of Worsening Financial Crises The International Monetary Fund, whose address is 700 19th St NW, is the World Bank’s sister agency. It has a full-time staff of 3,100, supported by a budget of $1.5 billion. The IMF’s economists are paid even higher than those at the World Bank, and they evoke more fear, hatred, and contempt than the Bank. The IMF has an equally controversial history. It has a record of coming in to supposedly assist developing economies in crisis, only to make things worse. Its greatest debacle and scandal was its performance during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, when the so-called 'tiger economies 'of the East and Southeast Asia were destabilized by the massive inflows and outflows of foreign portfolio investment. The Fund was heavily criticized on three counts. First, it had encouraged the governments of the region to eliminate capital controls, thus provoking uncontrolled capital flows. Second, it assembled multi-billion dollar 'rescue packages' that went to rescue not the people suffering from the crisis but to compensate the foreign financial speculators that had lost millions in dubious speculative ventures, thus encouraging 'moral hazard,' or irresponsible investing. Third, its measures to stabilize the damaged economies intensified the crisis, since instead of encouraging government spending to counteract the collapse of private sector, it told the governments to radically cut spending, leading to a 'procyclical' negative synergy that ended in deep recession. In just a few weeks, one million people in Thailand and 22 million in Indonesia fell below the poverty line. The only country that contained the crisis was Malaysia, which refused to follow the Fund’s dictates and imposed capital and currency controls So disastrous were the IMF’s interventions that George Schultz, President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of the Treasury, called for its abolition for encouraging moral hazard, and prominent economists like Jagdish Bhagwati and Jeffrey Sachs accused it of provoking global macroeconomic instability. Indeed, a rare conservative-liberal alliance in the U.S. Congress came within a hair’s breath of denying the IMF a $14.5 billion replenishment. Eventually, the Fund was forced to admit that the 'thrust of fiscal policy…turned out to be substantially different…because the original assumptions for economic growth, capital flows, and exchange rates…were proved drastically wrong.' But things were never the same again. The IMF was so reviled for its performance that Asian governments developed IMF-phobia, swearing never again to ask the IMF for rescue even in the most dire circumstances. For instance, after paying off what Thailand owed the IMF, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared the country 'liberated' from the Fund in 2004. Instead of learning from its debacle during the Asian Financial Crisis, the IMF stumbled into another fiasco more than a decade later, during the Global Financial Crisis. It allowed itself to be hijacked by Germany, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank to provide billions of public money to rescue German financial institutions and investors that had engaged in an orgy of irresponsible lending to Greece to the tune of 25 billion euros. To get the so-called rescue funds, the Greek government, like the Asian governments previously, was forced to adopt severe austerity measures that drove unemployment up to 28 percent and condemned the Greek economy to permanent stagnation, only to turn the money it was ostensibly receiving over to the German banks. Not surprisingly, so long as the IMF is there, the big international banks will assume that they will be bailed out for making irresponsible loans. The U.S. and the Bretton Woods Twins: Fiction and Fact There is a fiction that the IMF and World Bank are multilateral institutions that are owned by their many member governments. The reality is that the United States controls both institutions, with a 17.4 percent share of total quotas at the Fund and 15.8 per cent share of voting power at the Bank. These shares give the U.S. government a veto power over any policy change. But the truth is that U.S. power is not limited to its being able to veto policy decisions it does not like. No country would dare oppose a move by the United States to radically cut the administrative budgets (by, say, 75 percent initially) and the number of personnel in the two organizations (to 600 personnel each, as in the case of USAID) if it wanted to do so. All it needs to do to get its way is to threaten to withhold its contributions to the two organizations. I can guarantee that immediately the interest rate at which the Bank borrows in international capital markets would leap upward, paralyzing its lending operations. The IMF and the World Bank are monuments to misguided economic thinking and policies that have brought much misery to the peoples of the Global South. They are institutions that no longer serve any purpose except to perpetuate and enlarge themselves. If Elon Musk and Donald Trump are really serious about radically downsizing bloated bureaucracies, they could not have better targets than the Bretton Woods twins.

Trump Says Putin Ready To Accept European Peacekeepers	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to accept European peacekeepers ahead of talks with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on ways to end the war in Ukraine. 'I have specifically asked him that question. He has no problem it,' Trump said, when asked by a reporter about Putin's position on the matter. Macron said European countries 'are ready and willing to provide' Ukraine with security guarantees 'which could perhaps include troops.' The French leader said any European forces sent to Ukraine would be there to 'maintain peace' and would not be placed along the front lines or become part of the conflict. Macron's visit to Washington comes on the third anniversary of the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion. He and Trump attended a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies to discuss the war in Ukraine prior to holding one-on-one talks. The trip to Washington comes on a day of high-stakes diplomacy, where Macron's visit, along with a summit in Kyiv and a showdown over diplomatic language at the United Nations over how to refer to the war have laid bare Western divisions over how to end the war in Ukraine. Ahead of his trip, Macron said he would present a European action plan to help achieve a durable peace deal with solid security guarantees for Ukraine. During a press conference streamed on social media before departing for Washington, he said he would also present the case to Trump that how he handles Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine will either dissuade or embolden China, the United States' largest geopolitical competitor. 'You can't be weak in the face of President Putin. It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest,' Macron said, outlining the argument he plans to make to the U.S. president. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you're weak in the face of Putin?' Addressing G7 leaders virtually, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hoped to finish the war 'this year' as he appealed to Trump for continued U.S. support and argued for allowing Ukraine to join NATO, which the Trump administration opposes. 'If Ukraine remains outside NATO, it will be a much more expensive and complicated path for everyone because NATO provides the simplest and most cost-effective security guarantees,' the Ukrainian president said. Zelenskyy added that Kyiv is working 'productively' on an economic deal with Washington amid ongoing tense talks over U.S. access to Ukrainian mineral resources in exchange for continued aid.Trump has roiled America's traditional allies in Europe with his readiness to restart diplomatic ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, raising concerns that Europe -- and even Kyiv itself -- will be sidelined in the process.Macron's trip comes after Zelenskyy met with at least 13 foreign officials in Kyiv on February 24 -- with another two dozen or more joining online -- to discuss support for Ukraine in the face of questions over U.S. assistance. Those concerns -- which have expanded since U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia last week -- were borne out in comments from European governments at a summit in Kyiv where leaders looked to reaffirm their support for Ukraine. 'It is Russia that started this war,' German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said via video link. 'Russia may have gained an open ear in the White House but they have not gained an inch of legitimacy.' During the summit in Kyiv, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to 'speed up the delivery of weapons and ammunition' to Ukraine and announced 3.5 billion euros in new aid. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also promised 1 billion euros in new military support and equipment, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would contribute new military support and donate frozen Russian funds to Kyiv.The European Union also announced a new sanctions package against Russia and von der Leyen said Ukraine could join the bloc before 2030 if the country continues its reforms at their current speed and quality. 'President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks, and it has created an opportunity,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told world leaders over video connection. 'If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table, and any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine backed up with strong security guarantees.' The prospect of a normalization of ties between Russia and the United States, Trump's stated desire to quickly end the war, and a public war of words between the U.S. president and Zelenskyy have worried European leaders and launched a wave of outreach to Washington. 'If you look at the messages that come from the U.S., then it's clear that the Russian narrative is there, very strongly represented,' Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told reporters in Brussels. She is scheduled to travel to Washington on February 25 and meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Kallas will follow Macron in visiting Washington, and Starmer is also set to meet with Trump on February 27 at the White House. Polish President Andrzej Duda also met with Trump over the weekend. During a trip to Turkey on the war's anniversary, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow remains open to negotiations but its military campaign will only stop if the outcome is satisfactory to Russia. Lavrov added he believes many countries have become more 'realistic' in their position around the war and that the recent meeting in Saudi Arabia raised hopes of having normal dialogue between Moscow and Washington. Alongside Lavrov, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Turkey -- a NATO member that has previously helped broker agreements between Moscow and Kyiv -- was ready to host future peace talks on ending the war in Ukraine.In addition to unfolding Western divisions at the G7, a diplomatic battle over Ukraine is also taking place at the United Nations in New York City, where the United States has proposed a draft resolution that uses less critical language of Russia's full-scale invasion than a draft resolution put forward by the EU and Ukraine. The United States abstained during a vote at 193-member UN General Assembly on February 24, allowing the body to reaffirm Ukraine's territorial integrity and adopt a strongly worded resolution condemning Russia's invasion. But Washington also joined Russia in voting against a UN resolution from Ukraine and European countries that refers to 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation' and demanded that Russia immediately withdraw its forces.The 15-member UN Security Council is also set to vote on the same U.S. text. In order to be adopted, a council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by its permanent mebers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, or France.In contrast, the General Assembly has no vetoes and despite being closely watched a way to gauge world opinion, its reoslutions are legally non-binding -- unlike those adopted by the Security Council.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQzxQzcghq1AP	2025-02-24T15:54:00-08:00	
US Threat To Cut Off Military Aid To Egypt And Jordan May Provoke...	President Donald Trump’s threat to cut off military aid to Egypt and Jordan—if they refuse to provide sanctuary to Palestinians removed from Gaza—is most likely to trigger protests from the US military-industrial complex, one of the most powerful lobbies in the US. Currently, Egypt and Jordan, along with Israel, are three of the major recipients of US military aid, including some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems, in the Middle East. This includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and Excess Defense Articles (EDA). The EDA offers second-hand military equipment at reduced or at no cost to US allies. According to the State Department, U.S. assistance to Egypt has played a central role in Egypt’s economic and military development and in furthering the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership and regional stability. Since 1978, the United States has provided Egypt with over $50 billion in military and $30 billion in economic assistance. Egypt is also a major security partner of the US and one of the largest recipients of US military aid in the region; it has the status of a 'Major Non-NATO Ally,' a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation, according to the State Department. Meanwhile, since 2015, the US has provided Jordan with $2.155 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which makes Jordan the third largest global recipient of FMF funds over that time period. In addition, the Department of Defense (DoD) has provided $327 million to the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) under its '333 Authority', since 2018, making Jordan one of the largest recipients of this funding. Further, the United States has supported the Jordan Border Security Program, an integrated border security surveillance, detection, and interdiction system along 350 miles of Jordan’s land borders since 2009, at a cost of over $234 million, according to the State Department. Dr. Natalie J. Goldring, who represents the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy in her work at the United Nations on conventional weapons and arms trade issues, told IDN one factor that has been given insufficient attention is the extent to which US defense contractors benefit from these military aid programs. For example, she pointed out, Egypt is required to use its military aid to buy weapons and services from US defense contractors. President Trump can threaten to cut off military aid to countries that don’t agree to accept large number of Palestinians who are removed from Gaza. 'It’s not clear that he can legally cut off military aid that has been appropriated by Congress. But even if he can, that would put him in direct conflict with US defense contractors, whose profits would be decreased as a result of these cuts,' Dr Goldring said. She said its’s difficult to know which of President Trump’s claims and threats are sincere. Is he sincere when he claims that the United States will take over Gaza and develop it? Is it mere rhetoric when he claims that Egypt and Jordan will take in the Palestinians whose homes were in the Gaza Strip? Or is this simply more of the bluster for which he is known? 'But in any case, his claims ignore the human rights of the Palestinian people – he consistently treats them as objects, rather than human beings with individual and collective rights. These proposals would also eliminate or at best severely undermine the prospects for a two-state solution for Palestinians and Israelis.' 'President Trump talks about Gaza as a real estate developer more than as a president. He emphasizes its desirable location, and describes its current condition as a ‘demolition site’. He never mentions that it’s the Israeli government that has reduced Gaza to rubble, and that US weapons have been and continue to be critically important in producing that devastation.' 'One enormous open question is what will happen with US foreign aid going forward. When Secretary of State Rubio described the US aid freeze (whose legality has not been established) he exempted military assistance to Israel and Egypt, but not Jordan,' said Dr Goldring. According to the State Department, total bilateral trade in goods between the United States and Egypt stood at $9.1 billion in 2021, the highest level ever. Egypt is the United States’ largest export market in Africa. U.S. exports to Egypt include wheat and corn, mineral fuel and oil, machinery, aircraft, and iron and steel products. U.S. imports from Egypt include apparel, natural gas and oil, fertilizers, textiles, and agricultural products. Under the Qualifying Industrial Zone agreement, the United States waives duties on imports from Egypt if the value includes 10.5% Israeli content; this program promotes stronger ties between the region’s peace partners. American firms are active in most sectors of the Egyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy technologies, financial services, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications and information technology, and the restaurant and hospitality industry. As for Jordan, the US has $4.47 billion in active government-to-government sales cases with Jordan under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, according to the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. FMS sales notified to Congress and recent and significant prior sales include: F-16 Air Combat Training Center; UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter and related equipment; 700 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems; F-16 weapons, munitions, ground vehicles, jet engines, and logistics support; High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), and other multiple rocket launch systems; 37 Meter Coastal Patrol Boats; as well as AMRAAM air-to-air and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Since 2016, the United States has also authorized the permanent export of over $697 million in defense articles to Jordan via the Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) process. The top categories of DCS to Jordan include: aircraft, fire control/night vision, and military electronics. Jordan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally in 1996, which provides Jordan with a number of benefits reserved to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and allied nations, including potential participation in cooperative research and development, priority delivery for Excess Defense Articles (EDA), and reciprocally-funded cooperative training. Since 2014, Jordan was authorized to receive three C-130H aircraft, MEI-23E Hawk missiles, cargo trucks, and one Intermediate Level Support Equipment Test Station via the EDA program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQy6vLuj96nsM	2025-02-24T15:51:13-08:00	
China Conducts Live Fire Drills In Tonkin Gulf As Vietnam Draws S...	The Chinese military has announced a live-fire exercise in an area in the Gulf of Tonkin from Monday to Thursday this week, warning ships not to enter the zone. The warning came as Vietnam issued a formal map defining the baseline to demarcate its territory in the gulf. Though neither side linked their action to that of the other, it was unlikely to be a coincidence, some observers said. China’s exercise comes amid the latest wrangle between the neighbors over Vietnam’s island building in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea. A baseline under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, is the line that runs along the coast of a country, from which the extent of the territorial sea and other maritime zones is measured. In March 2024 China released its baseline in the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin, deemed by analysts as 'excessive.' Radio Free Asia was the first media outlet to report in April 2024 that Vietnam was considering its own baseline amid concern that China may seek to expand its maritime zones. The Chinese baseline at some points encroaches about 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) into international waters, according to analysts. The U.S. military, which promotes freedom of navigation across the world, criticized China’s baseline, saying it may provide a pretext for China to 'unlawfully impede navigational rights and freedoms guaranteed to all nations, including transit passage through the Hainan Strait.' Chinese drills not ‘a pure coincidence’ 'The establishment of the baseline in the Gulf of Tonkin aims to uphold Vietnam’s rights and obligations,' the Vietnamese foreign ministry said in a statement, 'It provides a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.' China has yet to comment on its neighbor’s announcement but some Vietnam watchers said China’s live-fire drills appeared to be a response to Vietnam’s baseline. 'Although the exercise area off northwest Hainan island is relatively far from Vietnam’s waters, the timing seems too close to be a pure coincidence,' said Song Phan, a maritime researcher. The new baseline that runs along Vietnam’s coast 'conforms strictly to UNCLOS unlike the Chinese baseline,' he said. Hanoi and Beijing in 2000 signed a Delimitation Agreement to demarcate their shares of the gulf from the mainland of Vietnam and China in the North to the mouth of the gulf in the South. The two countries, however, have yet to renegotiate a joint fishery cooperation agreement in the Gulf of Tonkin after the old one expired in 2020.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ5udE0KpbDHJ	2025-02-24T15:49:01-08:00	
Japan, Philippines Strengthen Defense Ties Amid ‘Increasingly Sev...	By Jason Gutierrez and Jojo Riñoza The defense chiefs of Japan and the Philippines agreed to boost bilateral military ties over mutual concerns driven by an 'increasingly severe' security situation in their respective territorial disputes with China. The two officials met amid a flurry of visits to Manila in recent days by foreign allies and new partners in broadened military cooperation with the Philippines. These included a visit by Adm. Samuel Paparo, the top U.S. military officer in the Pacific, and a port-of-call by the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and its carrier group. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani arrived in Manila over the weekend, two months after the Philippine Senate ratified a new defense treaty with Tokyo, whose military forces had occupied the Philippines during World War II.'[Philippine Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr.] and I firmly concurred that the security environment surrounding us is becoming increasingly severe and that it is necessary for the two countries as strategic partners to further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific amid such a situation,' Nakatani said during a joint press conference with Teodoro in Manila on Monday. Both Manila and Tokyo should 'deepen bilateral cooperation' with a sense of expediency, Nakatani said. Teodoro said Nakatani’s two-day trip was meant to advance bilateral defense engagements after the Philippines ratified the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA). It allows for larger-scale joint military drills and paves the way for military personnel to take part in security operations, including coordinated security patrols. The pact, however, still has to be ratified by the Japanese parliament before both nations 'get to the ground running at full speed,' Teodoro said. 'This meeting was an exchange of views on regional security issues on the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and most importantly on our shared initiatives moving forward, not only on bilateral security enhancements, but also in promoting a sustainable, economically beneficial and defense-sustained defense industry partnership,' Teodoro said. Both Manila and Tokyo agreed to boost operational cooperation, start a strategic dialogue between 'high-level operational action officers' and deepen information sharing, Nakatani said. 'We also agreed to commence discussion between defense authorities on military information protection mechanisms,' he also said. Nakatani visited two key Philippine military sites in the north of Luzon, the main Philippine island, including Basa Air Base. Basa is one of the nine Philippine military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between Manila and its long-time defense ally, Washington. First signed in 2014, the EDCA allows the U.S. military to build and operate facilities inside Philippine bases for use by American and Filipino forces. While the United States is barred from establishing permanent bases here, analysts said the pact has allowed some flexibility in cooperation – including the hosting of the Typhon mid-range missile system – raising strong protests from China. The EDCA supplemented the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, which provides legal cover for large-scale joint military drills in the Philippines between the two long-time allies. Regional security concerns The Japanese minister’s trip to Manila came after the unprecedented visit of France’s lone nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and accompanying warships last week after the French navy ships took part in combat drills with Filipino forces in the South China Sea. The Charles De Gaulle, accompanied by three destroyers and an oil tanker, docked in Manila and in Subic Bay. In 2016, France and the Philippines signed a defense and security cooperation agreement, and have been building on it since. Adm. Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific command based in Hawaii, meanwhile met with Philippine officials in Manila last week. He was there to discuss regional security issues and underscore Washington’s commitment to the Philippine military 'to enhance maritime domain awareness and capacity building in order to counter illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities,' according to a statement from his office on Sunday. ‘Very timely juncture’ 'The visit by the Japanese defense minister is very important, coming at a very timely juncture, when the Philippines is engaged in outreach to like-minded partners,' said Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst and lecturer at De La Salle University in Manila. 'The timing in fact is very important, especially after a series of provocations by China within the West Philippine Sea,' he told BenarNews, using Manila’s name for South China Sea waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. 'This is not just symbolic, but an opportunity to deepen or broaden the already strengthening Philippine-Japan security partnership.' Japan’s strategy is to signal its emergence as a 'major power broker' in the region, security analyst Chester Cabalza told BenarNews. 'Tokyo has felt the intensity of Beijing’s impounding presence in its own coastlines, and one way of reducing the tension is to ally with nations experiencing similar strategic territorial dilemmas with China,' said Cabalza, who heads International Development and Security Cooperation, a think-tank in Manila. Japan, unlike the Philippines, does not have territorial claims that overlap with China’s expansive ones in the South China Sea. But Tokyo has a separate dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) in the East China Sea. 'Japan has to ink pacts with other middle powers in the region,' Cabalza said. 'By this way, China will be reprimanded to follow maritime rules-based order in the South China Sea.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ_hwhj6GpDnW	2025-02-24T15:47:15-08:00	
Ralph Nader: Stop Repeating The Vast Undercount Of Gazan Deaths; ...	Enough already of the media’s lazy indifference to the vast undercount of the Palestinian death toll from Netanyahu’s genocidal daily bombing and shelling of Gaza’s defenseless civilian population. I’m referring to all the media – the corporate media, the public media, and the independent media. They all stick with the Hamas Ministry of Health’s (MOH) count of named victims whose corpses have been identified by hospitals and mortuaries. For months there have been no operating hospitals and mortuaries to send their grisly data to the Health Ministry. The official Hamas count that all sides like to cite is now over 48,000 deaths. As American doctors back from Gaza before the Rafah closing last year said—just about everybody surviving in Gaza is sick, injured, or dying. They put the death estimate almost a year ago at a minimum of 95,000, not counting tens of thousands of families buried under the rubble when Israeli F-16s blew up entire apartment buildings. Why would all sides to this one-sided Israeli war of extermination rely on Hamas’ figures? Well, Hamas has an interest in low-balling the number of deaths to limit the rage of its inhabitants and allies abroad for not protecting the people of Gaza and not providing them with shelters. The Israeli super-hawks want to keep the undercount low to dampen down the international rage, boycotts, and demand for more sanctions and ICC prosecutions. The Biden administration and now the Trump regime also benefit from a low number. Here is the Washington Post’s esteemed foreign affairs editor Karen DeYoung’s reply on September 6, 2024 to my inquiry: 'We use the Gaza MOH [Ministry of Health] figures – as does the United Nations, World Health Organization and virtually every other humanitarian organization – while noting that independent media are not allowed to enter Gaza and the casualty counts are most certainly underreported… The Lancet [British Medical Journal] report notes that based on other ‘recent conflicts…it is not implausible to estimate’ that four times as many have died than those listed by the MOH…The time will come, I believe, when an independent accounting can be done.' But six months later the time still hasn’t come. The Biden State Department had a much higher estimate of deaths but refused to release their analysis, obstructing our Freedom of Information request filed last May 24, 2024. All kinds of estimates and projections by reputable universities, specialists, global health groups and UN agencies point to a much higher death and overall casualty toll. But the State Department won’t come forward with a reasonably estimated number that can replace Hamas’ statistical immolation. For example, in late 2023, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh—Professor Devi Sridhar—said that if the destruction continues, half a million Palestinians would die in 2024. The devastation has gotten worse—the bombings, the genocidal denial of 'food, water, medicine, electricity, fuel' in the omnicidal words of the high Israeli military officials, the spread of diseases, untreated injuries, babies born into the rubble, infants starved, lack of potable water, sick elderly without critical medicines, and more. This is the result of 110 thousand tons of bombs (Israeli admission) daily tank shelling and precise destructions. Yet neither she nor most other experts who have projected continuing mayhem have offered a number. Interestingly, the media has no trouble estimating the Syrian deaths at the hands of dictator Assad (500,000) nor the deaths in the wars in Sudan or Ukraine. Only the Palestinians, who are not allowed to live, don’t get the respect of having their deaths accurately estimated. One team of Gazan undertakers said they buried 17,000 bodies in mass graves by February 2024, including 800 in one day. Were the shoe on the other foot, Congress would not only have had intense public hearings: it would have declared war against Hamas. With total U.S. co-belligerency – from huge weapons supplies to the veto at the UN, Netanyahu gets away with blocking Israeli and all other reporters from going freely into Gaza, and shuts up those conscience-stricken Israeli soldiers who are sickened by what they were ordered to destroy. One of them said, 'I felt like, like, like a Nazi … it looked exactly like we were actually the Nazis and they were the Jews.' Some columnists in the U.S. like Charles Lane and Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and Netanyahu’s mouthpiece, Bret Stephens of the New York Times, do not believe the Israeli military consciously targets civilians and civilian infrastructure. Israelis scoff at such naivete; many want more annihilation of all Palestinians whom they regard as 'subhuman,' 'vermin,' 'snakes,' or 'animals' (racist words from high Israeli politicians over the decades). Some 45 years ago, former UN Ambassador and Foreign Minister Abba Eban —under then Prime Minister Menachem Begin—wrote that Israel 'is wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name.' In August 2024, based on available historical, empirical, and clinical records, we estimated about 300,000 Palestinians had been killed. (See the August/September 2024 issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen). By now it is over 400,000. Yet the media still uses the figure by Hamas and ignores the lives blown apart under the killing fields in Gaza. At 400,000 and growing, far more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza than the combined total of deaths from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Dresden in World War II. This week, Netanyahu dropped leaflets in Arabic signaling a forthcoming violent exclusion of Gaza’s trapped, unsheltered Palestinians from their homeland. More accurately estimated civilian casualties matters morally and for the intensity of the political, diplomatic, and civic resistance when the world learns the truer toll of death and injuries in this tiny enclave the geographical size of Philadelphia. To remind the world of the daily Israeli violations of settled international law inflicted on Gazans (also in the West Bank and Lebanon), international law practitioner Bruce Fein compiled this concise list: ISRAEL’S TEN VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IN GAZA Genocide Count I. Killing Palestinians in Gaza. Genocide Count II. Deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Genocide Count III. Destroying hospitals and maternal care necessities intended to prevent births by Palestinian women in Gaza. Crimes against humanity. Extermination and persecution of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza as part of a systematic attack directed at Palestinian civilians. Deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property for destruction. Failing to provide for the security and welfare of the inhabitants occupied by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. Impeding delivery of humanitarian assistance. Forcible relocation of civilian population. Use of military force causing civilian casualties vastly disproportionate to the importance of any legitimate military objective. War of aggression against Gaza Palestinians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-JoQqQNI1GC	2025-02-24T15:45:31-08:00	
Pakistan: Terror Thrives In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On February 23, 2025, Security Forces (SFs) killed seven Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in two separate operations carried out in Daraban and Maddi areas of Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 21, 2025, six TTP terrorists were killed after SFs carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Karak District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 17, 2025, SFs killed 30 terrorists during an IBO in Sararogha area of South Waziristan District, KP. A statement issued on February 18 from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. On February 17, 2025, four soldiers were killed and five sustained injuries when the convoy of the Commandant of the Kurram Militia, Frontier Corps, was ambushed by unidentified armed attackers in the Manduri area of Kurram District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists including 'commander' Kharji Shah Gul alias Rohani were killed during an IBO conducted by SFs in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire during IBOs in the Dosali and Tappi areas of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 12, 2025, at least five terrorists were killed in SF's projectile strike, quadcopter, in Draban area of Dera Ismail Khan District in KP. On February 10, 2025, SFs killed five TTP terrorists during a late-night operation in Mir Kakam Banda area of Banda Daud Shah town in Karak District of KP. On February 6, 2025, at least 12 terrorists and one Army soldier were killed in an IBO in the Hassan Khel area of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 4, 2025, at least five SF personnel were killed while another six sustained injuries in a militant attack on the Raghzai security post in the Shaktoi area of North Waziristan District, KP. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), 346 terrorism-related fatalities, including 22 civilians, 63 SF personnel and 261 terrorists, have been reported in the current year, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) in KP. During the corresponding period of 2024, the province recorded 142 fatalities (41 civilians, 53 SF personnel and 48 terrorists). KP recorded a total of 1,363 fatalities (288 civilians, 421 SF personnel and 654 terrorists) in 487 incidents of killing in 2024, as against 941 such fatalities (205 civilians, 329 SF personnel, and 407 terrorists) in 312 such incidents in 2023, registering an increase of 44.84 per cent in overall fatalities. On year-on-year basis, overall fatalities have been on a continuous rise since 2020, with an increase from 130 (30 civilians, 69 SF personnel, and 31 terrorists) in 2019 to 216 (61 civilians, 57 SF personnel, and 98 terrorists) in 2020, 301 (72 civilians, 108 SF personnel, and 121 terrorists) in 2021 and further, to 527 (119 civilians, 173 SF personnel, and 235 terrorists) in 2022. Significantly, overall fatalities declined between 2014 and 2019, barring 2018, when they increased to 167, from 129 in 2017. Fatalities had fallen from 946 in 2013 to 607 in 2014, 298 in 2015, and 215 in 2016. Overall fatalities in 2024, at 1,363, are the highest in a year since 2009, when 5,883 fatalities were recorded in the province. Other parameters of violence also underlined a worsening security situation in the province in 2024. Total terrorism-linked incidents jumped sharply from 472 in 2023 to 702 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 1,432 such incidents. The number of major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) increased from 84 in 2023 to 140 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 341 such incidents; the resultant fatalities in such attacks also increased from 586 in 2023 to 891 in 2024. Similarly, KP accounted for an increased number of explosions, from 110 in 2023 to 142 in 2024 (the highest since 2013, when there were 198 such incidents), however, the resulting fatalities decreased from 296 to 207. Similarly, the province recorded a decreased number of suicide attacks from 28 in 2023 to 15 in 2024, the resultant fatalities in such attacks also decreased from 254 in 2023 to 93 in 2024. In the worst attack, on November 19, 2024, 12 SF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive laden vehicle into the Mali Khel Check Post in the Bannu District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Six terrorists were also killed in the subsequent SF retaliation. Jabha Ansar al-Mahdi, a sub-group of Hafiz Gul Bahadur's faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Of 38 Districts in KP, 28 recorded terrorism-related violence in 2024, as against 22 Districts in 2023, according to the SATP database. Of 38 Districts, 16 Districts registered terrorism-related incidents in 2022; 21 Districts in 2021; and19 Districts in 2020. The most violent District in 2024 was North Waziristan, with 271 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (163 fatalities), Khyber (137 fatalities) and Kurram (126 fatalities). In 2023 as well, North Waziristan was the most violent District, with 151 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (122), Dera Ismail Khan (109) and South Waziristan (107). In 2022, again, North Waziristan District accounted for 177 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (87), Bannu (60) and Dera Ismail Khan (43). In 2021 again, Waziristan recorded the maximum of 106 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (51), Peshawar (25) and Bajaur (22). In 2020, North Waziristan recorded 110 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (27) and South Waziristan (21). Compounding the rising trend in terrorism, is the flare-up of sectarian violence in Kurram District. Though sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslim groups is not a new phenomenon in Kurram District, but the renewed skirmishing in the district, commencing November 21, 2024, has so far taken over a hundred lives and drastically affected the day-to-day life of the region. On November 21, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy, in the Kurram District killing at least 43 persons and injuring 11. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23, resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 persons injured. Among the deceased, 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community. By the time a ceasefire was imposed on December 1, a total 130 people had been killed and another 186 sustained injuries. The actual fatalities figure could be much higher, as media movement was strictly limited due to the imposition of a curfew by the Government. Despite the curfew and ceasefire, sporadic violence continues. The KP Government disclosed, on January 1, 2025, that both warring Shia and Sunni tribes in Kurram Districts finally signed a peace agreement after more than three weeks of efforts to broker a ceasefire. The seven-page peace agreement has 14 points to which both parties assented, along with the Grand Jirga members. The document stated that, keeping in view the post-merger realities, members of the Kurram Peace Committee and both sides would be bound to uphold the Muree Agreement of 2008 and all other agreements, for the benefit of locals and the establishment of peace. The Muree Agreement was brokered by the Government and signed by all the tribes on October 16, 2008, to stop the violent clashes during 2007-08. Under the agreement, the rival tribes deposited PKR 20 million with the local authorities as a guarantee that they would refrain from fighting. But the five-point Agreement, which covered all major issues, was never implemented. Tribesmen blamed a lack of interest on the part of the Government for this. Further, during the 2011 sectarian clash, an Aman Jirga (peace conclave) between Sunni and Shia tribes on February 3, 2011, signed an accord, known as 'Kurram accord' to end bloodshed between the two sects. The Kurram Accord is little more than a collection of recommendations and appeals to the Government of Pakistan, with no corresponding guarantees from the Government's side. The Accord appeals to the Government of Pakistan for support and necessary action for the repatriation of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and implementation of the Muree Agreement; and for approval of a special development package for Kurram to compensate for the losses the agency had suffered in violent clashes since 2007. It 'urged' both Shias and Sunnis to 'show restraint' and cooperate with the Government for peace, and called on the political administration and Security Forces to play their due roles to re-establish their writ in Kurram. However, despite the peace agreement, the warring groups never ceased their exchanges of fire. On January 16, 2025, 10 persons, including six drivers, two passengers and two soldiers, were killed in an attack on an aid convoy carrying essential goods to the sectarian violence-marred Kurram District, near the Bagan area of Kurram District. Six terrorists were killed in SF retaliation. At least 10 terrorists and four SF personnel also sustained injuries during the clash. On February 17, 2025, nine persons, including five SF personnel, a truck driver, a passer-by and two attackers, were killed, while another 15, including four drivers and one Police officer were injured, when an aid convoy, consisting of 64 vehicles, en-route to Parachinar, were attacked by unidentified terrorists in the Char Khail, Uchit Baghan and Mandori areas of Kurram District. The trucks were carrying food and other supplies under the supervision of SFs. Following the assault, more than 35 vehicles were trapped in the area, though nine vehicles reached Alizai safely, while 20 were sent back to Tull, with most of them stripped of their cargo. Though the Government and security agencies have been saying that the violence is between two warring sectarian groups over land disputes, there is a terrorist angel as well. Quoting the local people of Kurram, journalist Mushtaq Yousufzai noted, on December 30, 2024, that terrorists were targeting locals, not any religious group. 'They say militants are in the region,' he stated on the Aaj News programme News Insight with Amir Zia, 'When Peshawar-Parachinar Road was closed, upper Kurram peoples used the Afghanistan route or mountains tracks route. But now it seems they are besieged for more than 80 days.' When asked if the Government would be able to disarm people and shut down bunkers, the journalist added that the task was difficult, as the religious groups 'doubted' the government's intention. They believed that surrendering arms, which they insist were for their own defence, would make them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Local people's apprehensions of terrorist attacks in Kurram are not unfounded, as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) affiliated Al-Azaim Media's 35th 'Voice of Khorasan' (Pashto, 125 pages) editorial on December 14, 2024, called for Sunni youth to target Shias, criticizing the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Taliban for failing to defend Sunni Muslims in Kurram. It reiterated a call for lone wolf attacks, urging ISKP loyalists and others to act on its behalf in Kurram and beyond, while condemning the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), TTP, and the Taliban for 'abandoning' jihad, and for ties with the United Nations (UN). The surge in terrorism-related violence in the province can be attributed to three principal factors. First, the United States (US)-Western withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan. Second, the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 14, 2021. And finally, the collapse of 'official talks' between the Pakistan Government and the TTP on November 28, 2022. The spike in violence in KP in 2023 was foreseeable, when TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali, in the wake of the collapse of peace-talks, asked his fighters to resume attacks. When the US pulled its forces out from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind around USD 7 billion worth of military equipment and weapons, including firearms, communications gear, and even armoured vehicles. The Afghan Taliban seized these weapons during the chaotic US withdrawal. On January 29, 2025, the Pakistan Foreign Office asserted that these advanced weapons have been an issue of profound concern for the safety and security of Pakistan and its citizens. The Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan issued a statement declaring, 'These weapons, left behind in the aftermath of the withdrawal of its troops in August 2021, have been used by terrorist organisations, including the TTP [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan], to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan,' and further, that Pakistan has been 'repeatedly calling upon the de facto authorities in Kabul to take all necessary measures to ensure that these weapons do not fall into the wrong hands.' The FO statement came after US President Donald Trump's pledge to take back military equipment left behind in Afghanistan during troop withdrawal in 2021. However, the Taliban has reportedly refused to return any of the military equipment and urged the US to provide them with more advanced weapons to fight Daesh. On February 15, 2025, the 35th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted to the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) revealed that the Afghan Taliban's continued support to TTP, despite Islamabad's increasing pressure to end backing of the outfit, was fuelling the group's escalating attacks in Pakistan. The scale of TTP's attacks in Pakistan has increased significantly, according to the report by the UNSC-formed monitoring team. The report, covering the period from July 1 to Dec 13, 2024, stated that the 'status and strength of TTP in Afghanistan had not changed', while the group intensified its assaults on Pakistan, conducting over 600 attacks during the reporting period, many launched from Afghan territory. It underscored that the Taliban continued to provide the outlawed TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support, bolstering the group's capacity to sustain its activities. Earlier on December 16, 2024, the KP Chief Minister (CM) Ali Amin Gandapur claimed that between 22,000 and 24,000 TTP members, had found safe haven in Afghanistan. Gandapur also claimed that an additional 16,000 to 18,000 TTP fighters were operating inside Pakistan. He acknowledged that Pakistan lacked the capacity to maintain law and order along its extensive border with Afghanistan. While the Afghan Taliban denied harbouring TTP members in Afghanistan, insisting they do not support the group, Gandapur argued that international legal constraints prevented Pakistan from pursuing TTP fighters across the Afghan border. He called on the Federal Government to engage in negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, adding that initiating talks was beyond the jurisdiction of his provincial administration. 'I am obligated to express my concerns about the deteriorating law-and-order situation because the people of my province are being killed by terrorism,' Gandapur stated. While the terrorists operating in the province were equipped with modern sophisticated weapons, including sniper rifles and thermal sensors, the provincial Police forces who stand on the first line of defence, remain ill-equipped. On October 1, 2024, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a high-level meeting in Peshawar to discuss peace and security in the province, particularly in the merged Districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and southern KP. To enhance the capabilities of the Police, 122 bulletproof vehicles were allocated to former FATA Districts, PKR 7 billion was provided for the Police in the merged districts, and PKR 1 billion was released for the purchase of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs). Additionally, 1,300 Police positions were announced for the Tank and Lakki Marwat Districts in Southern KP. Further on December 1, Chief Minister Gandapur announced a slew of measures to strengthen the Police's Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) to fight off surging incidents of terrorism in the province. 'We are fighting an enemy that is better equipped and we have to level up at least to be able to overcome one of the biggest challenges of our lives,' Gandapur told a news conference soon after attending a detailed briefing at the CTD Headquarters at Police Lines in Peshawar. The package, totalling PKR one billion, included the purchase of high-tech drones, sniper rifles with thermal and night vision capabilities, high-tech kits and bombproof vehicles. Quoting the KP Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on December 31, 2024, The Express Tribune reported that the majority of terrorist attacks had been carried out in the southern Districts of the province, including Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Tank, Kohat, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Khyber, Bajaur and Peshawar. The Express Tribune's sources within the KP CTD revealed that the Police had nearly abandoned the practice of patrolling outside the Police Stations after sunset in the southern Districts, where terrorist activities against both civilians and armed personnel were on the rise. Commenting on the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the province and tribal areas, Dr. Khurram Iqbal, an expert in security affairs and a PhD in Counter-Terrorism and Security from Australia, while talking to The Express Tribune, stated, The tug of war between the Federal and Provincial Governments had destabilized the maintenance of peace in the southern Districts of KP. In order to deal with the problem of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's cross-border sanctuaries, both the Federal and Provincial Governments must take a united stand vis-a-vis Afghanistan for ensuring lasting peace'. Despite the Provincial Government's efforts, terrorism continues to thrive due to the lack of cooperation from both the Federal and Afghanistan Governments. Advocating dialogue to settle disputes on January 20, 2025, KP Chief Minister Gandapur declared that he would send a delegation to Afghanistan within two weeks to seek solutions to Pakistan-Afghan issues. 'The federal government talked about negotiations with Afghanistan over bilateral issues, but there's no success. Now, the dialogue with Kabul will be held at the provincial level. A delegation of our [KP] government will meet Afghan officials within two weeks.' However, Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam asserted, on February 1, 2025, that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government's jurisdiction. While TTP and its affiliated groups wreak havoc in the province from Afghanistan, the failure of the Governments at the Centre and province, confer a degree of impunity on the terrorists, and can only further worsen the situation in KP in the days to come.

India: Troubled Borders In Arunachal Pradesh – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On January 15, 2025, Police arrested one operative of United Tani Army (UTA) identified as Tana Hasi from Itanagar in Papum Pare District, for his suspected role in carrying out recruitment of operatives for the outfit. Inspector General of Police (IGP) (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa stated that Hasi, along with the self-styled 'chairman' of UTA, Anthony Doke, had been carrying out recruitment of youth for UTA using various platforms, including social media. On January 9, 2025, a gun battle erupted between Security Forces (SFs) and militants of the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA), at Longka village in the Changlang District. No casualties were reported from either side. On January 6, 2025, suspected NSCN-K-YA militants abducted two male workers from an illegal timber camp at the Longvi village of Changlang District, near the Indo-Myanmar border. The abduction of the two workers is believed to be related to ongoing extortion demands. These three insurgency-related incidents have been recorded in the State in 2025, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), a single fatality was recorded in 2024 (data till February 23, 2025), where a cadre of NSCN-K-YA, identified as 'major' Gangjun Gangsa, was killed in a clash with the Assam Rifles in Longding District, on October 25. The NSCN-K-YA initiated the attack by firing at Assam Rifles personnel while they were moving from Wakka towards the Indo-Myanmar Border. In 2023, five (three terrorists, one civilian and one SF trooper) were killed in four separate incidents. Among the insurgents killed, one each belonged to the United Liberation Front of Asom - Independent (ULFA-I), the Niki Sumi-led faction of NSCN-K (NSCN-K-NS) and NSCN-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data, a total of 245 fatalities (176 insurgents, 38 SFs and 31 civilians) have been recorded in the State. In 2025, one incident of arrest has been recorded, in which a UTA cadre (of January 15, above) was arrested in Papum Pare District. In 2024, a total of 23 insurgents were arrested in 11 separate incidents - NSCN-IM, 12; ULFA-I; eight and one each from NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-Unification (NSCN-U) and NSCN-K. In 2023, 39 insurgents were arrested in the State in 26 separate incidents -NSCN-K-YA, 20; ULFA-I, eight; NSCN-IM, six; NSCN-Reformation (NSCN-R) and NSCN-K, two each; NSCN-K-NS, one. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 749 insurgents have been arrested in the State. Four militants surrendered in 2024 in three separate incidents, including two from NSCN-U in Changlang District and one each from NSCN-K and ULFA-I in Tirap and Changlang Districts, respectively. In 2023, 24 insurgents surrendered in nine separate incidents: Eastern Naga National Government (ENNG), 15; NSCN-IM and ULFA-I, two each; and NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-R, NSCN-K, Eastern Naga National Organisation (ENNO) and NSCN-K-NS, one each. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 214 insurgents have surrendered in the State. As usual, the abduction and extortion campaign of militants, principally by NSCN-K-YA, in the state continued in 2024. Some of the incidents of such activities included: As reported on December 3, NSCN-K-YA issued a demand of INR 2 million from Oil India Limited (OIL), a prominent petroleum company operating in the Manabhum Reserve Forest in the Lohit District of Arunachal Pradesh. The extortion note was delivered to the company's office in the Manabhum Reserve Forest by a self-styled 'major' of NSCN-K-YA, identified as Tha Aung, and set a deadline of December 10, 2024, for the payment. OIL Spokesperson Prankush Malla Buzarbaruah accepted that the company had received the extortion note from the outfit. On November 24, two civilians, Vignesh Kumar Jha and Bishnu Chetry, were abducted by a 10-member heavily armed group of NSCN-K-YA from a bridge construction site located between the Pongchau and Konnu villages in Longding District. The group was led by NSCN-K-YA 'leader' Akham Konyak. On February 18, ten workers employed at the Finboro Coal Mine in Changlang District, were abducted because of the failure to comply to an extortion demand by suspected militants of NSCN-K-YA and ULFA-I. A group of seven armed militants held the workers at gunpoint and transported them in a dumper truck towards Old Longtoi, a remote location within Arunachal Pradesh. SFs later rescued seven out of 10 coal miners. ULFA-I, later, released the remaining three, identified as Gyan Thapa, Lekhan Bora and Chandan Narzari, on March 22, at Lalpul near Longvi in Nampong in Changlang District, which was disclosed by ULFA-I's 'spokesperson' Rumel Asom. The 'overflow' of insurgency in three districts, Tirap, Changlang, and Longding (TCL) located along the Indo-Myanmar border remains a concern. SAIRnoted, earlier, that the TCL region served as the 'axis' of conflict in the State. Activities of insurgent groups from other States, primarily Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, affect the TCL Districts of the State - all lying on the Indo-Myanmar border. Further, SAIR noted earlier, Arunachal Pradesh continues to be used as a transit route by various militant groups, whose camps are situated in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar. The TCL region recorded 189 fatalities (133 terrorists, 29 SF personnel and 27 civilians) out of the 245 fatalities in the State since March 2000. The nine districts which recorded fatalities since March 2000 are: Tirap (110 fatalities: 76 terrorists, 18 SF personnel and 16 civilians), Changlang (50 fatalities: 32 terrorists, 10 SF personnel, and eight civilians), Lohit (39 fatalities: 35 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), Longding (29 fatalities: 25 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), West Kameng (five SF personnel), Anjaw (one terrorist), Papum Pare (one civilian), Kurung Kumey (one SF trooper) and Namsai (one SF trooper). Meanwhile, Naga nationalism and the demand for a Naga sovereign State, Nagalim, which includes the Naga inhabited areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and some portions of Myanmar, play an important role in the Naga armed movement in Arunachal Pradesh. Significantly, on January 27, 2024, ENNG merged with NSCN-IM after a request by the 'president' of ENNG, Tosham Mossang, and its 'general secretary' Sompai Pongha, to NSCN-IM, on January 21, 2024. After the merger, on January 28, 2024, NSCN-IM's 'ministry of information and publicity' stated, In approaching the NSCN for merger, the ENNG 'president' and 'general secretary' stated that they sincerely support the Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015, signed on the basis of giving recognition to the sovereign right of Nagalim. With this merger they believe it will motivate the people of Tirap, Changlang and Longding (TCL) in Arunachal and allow them to get more involved and active towards the Naga national movement. Not surprisingly, on September 25, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) issued a notification under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) that the act has been extended for another six months in several regions of Arunachal Pradesh. The UMHA notification observed, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of Namsai, Mahadevpur and Chowkham police stations in Namsai district of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam, are declared as 'disturbed area' under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, for a period of six months with effect from 01.10.2024, unless withdrawn earlier. In reviewing the security situation in the TCL region on February 17, 2025, Lieutenant General (Retd.) K.T. Parnaik, Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, emphasized the Government's responsibility and commitment to maintain peace in the TCL region. He also warned that any anti-national elements in the region would face 'severe consequences', and reiterated that citizens of the State would be protected from 'outside influence and intimidation.' Further, he highlighted the strategic significance of border security and the initiation of necessary steps to protect the interests of the nation and welfare of citizens residing in the border areas. At the end of 2024, a new insurgent outfit, the United Tani Army (UTA), released several videos of its training camps, which was made available by its 'chairman' Anthony Doke (the 'chief' of the short-lived National Socialist Council of Taniland) on December 31. The videos demonstrated the presence of weapons and operatives in the camps, though the location of the camps remained unknown. In an interview, Doke alleged that the Government of India did not care about the areas inhabited by the Tani tribes and that he would later present a 'detailed plan' for his group. An unnamed official disclosed that Doke was based in Myanmar, and that 'the camps shown in the videos look likely to be that of the NSCN (K-YA). He is trying to revive the UTA with the help of Naga militants.' On January 17, 2025, after the arrest of UTA cadre and main recruiter Tana Hasi, on January 15, 2025, the Arunachal Police asked the UTA cadres to return to the mainstream. The Police stated, Return voluntarily to your families and communities. No legal action will be taken against you if you come forward on your own. We understand that many of you may have been misled or pressured into joining. If you step back now, we will provide you with support to reintegrate into society and pursue a better future. The immediate response of Government agencies has undermined the emergence of new insurgent group in the State. However, constant disturbances by banned organisations operating in India's Northeast remain a challenge in Arunachal State. Given the State's strategic location for insurgent groups operating in the region along the Indo-Myanmar border, militant groups continue to exploit the region's vulnerabilities in pursuit of their goals and agendas.

Hegseth Welcomes Saudi Defense Minister To Pentagon, Underscores ...	By Matthew Olay US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Monday highlighted the importance of the partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia while hosting that country's defense minister during a bilateral engagement at the Pentagon. After formally welcoming Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud and his delegation, both men delivered prepared remarks in the secretary's office. 'As you know, [President Donald J. Trump has] made clear in his administration [that] we're going to pursue peace through strength and put America first,' Hegseth said. 'But that does not mean ignoring partnerships; and, in fact, it requires greater attention to the ones that matter most,' he continued, adding that the U.S. partnership with Saudi Arabia 'matters a great deal.' Referencing the cooperation that took place between the countries during Trump's first administration, Hegseth pointed out that both nations worked together to pursue security and stability in the Middle East, as well as to combat terrorism in the region and increase mutual prosperity. He also highlighted the long-standing cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, noting that it dates back 80 years to when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Saudi King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Quincy. 'Since then, we've worked to take on terrorism and all its manifestations today, with groups like the Houthis,' Hegseth said. 'Today, our relationship is a critical center of gravity in a very turbulent world,' he added. Stating that ending the war in Ukraine is one of the president's top priorities, Hegseth said he wanted to thank the Saudi Kingdom for hosting conversations between top U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, Feb. 18, 2025. 'And I also want to continue deepening and strengthening our partnership to pursue security and prosperity for both Americans and Saudis. So, I'm very much looking forward to a great discussion,' Hegseth said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0US5weGHdGT	2025-02-24T15:38:30-08:00	
Gloominess And Magical Thinking: The Comical, Frightening Mike Bu...	Never allow intelligence chiefs to speak publicly. Their prerogative lies in lying, their reassurance, cool deception. While the attractions of transparency are powerful, the result of a garrulous spook is always going to be unreliable. In Australia, a comically looking individual by the name of Mike Burgess terrorises and terrifies the local populace as head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the domestic spy agency. It will surprise no one familiar with this approach that it resembles several that have come before. Keep them frightened, soften them for the next encroaching round, and await ever larger budgets for the already fattened calf known as the national security state. In his 2025 threat assessment, the chief tries to be bracingly calm and reassuring, even as he delivers the frightening blows. 'Fortunately, I was born with the glass-half-full gene.' He tells us the agency is 'always looking ahead', which is encouraging. Prior to making that point, he says that he had 'focused on past and present threats.' With pointless contradiction assured, the theme is set for clotting clichés, grammatical torments and trying formulations. 'This year’s Assessment is future focused. And I think it’s fair to say it’s the most significant, serious and sober address so far.' Those wishing to waste their unrecoverable time listening to the address then realise that the agency has become a victim of public relations capture and trend shopping. Sections have been created that would make your run of the mill moronic university manager sigh. There is, for instance, a 'Futures Team' (think 'Future Fellows' or 'Deans of the Future' – their reality is never the now but always deferred) that supposedly 'pours over classified intelligence, reviews open source information, consults experts and uses structured analytical techniques to develop in-depth assessments about future trajectories and vulnerabilities.' The only thing missing from this froth is the use of artificial intelligence (appropriate for ASIO), which is bound to do the job as competently as any in the 'Futures Team'. For all we know, this is already being done, the machine component triumphant, the human minds lazily tempted. The predictable banalities follow in the Burgess show. 'Australia has entered a period of strategic surprise and security fragility.' If so, Australia has been entering for a very lengthy period, given the number of addresses Burgess has given. Like an academic who rises to the top on the strength of one idea and one paper eternally rewritten, the director can be relied upon to bore with ideas that have come before, ribboned and stringed for effect. 'Over the next five years, a complex, challenging and changing security environment will become more dynamic, more diverse and more degraded.' The Australian public, it would seem, is not playing along with the authorities. How dare they question and debate the norms they have been told are so sacred to servile stability? 'Social cohesion' – a vacuous term – is apparently eroding. Institutions are no longer trusted, while intolerance grows. Truth is being assailed (Burgess is a true comic as spy chief), 'undermined by conspiracy, mis- and disinformation.' For an entity that specialises in all three, this is fabulously funny. The terrifying world, it would seem, is replete with 'multifaceted, merging, intersecting, concurrent and cascading threats.' He is concerned 'about young Australians being caught up in webs of hate, both religiously and ideologically motivated'. There is a sense that individuals are seeking 'hybrid beliefs', cherry-picked from a garden of tempting varieties. Environmentalists of the left commune with Hitler in their beliefs. Islamic State propaganda converses with neo-Nazi dogma. Students of history will hardly find these couplings odd, but looking ahead will do that to you. In terms of concrete threats, one is singled out as numinous. One can only cringe at the identification of what Burgess calls 'the A-team'. This mysterious 'Australia team' is supposedly dedicated to combing 'professional networking sites for Australians with access to privileged information, and then use false, anglicised personas to approach their targets.' Their targets are offered 'consulting opportunities' and generous sums for reporting on Australian trade, politics, economics, foreign policy, defence and security. This does really sound like money poorly spent by the 'A-team', but who are we to judge? Some people are evidently living it up. Magical thinking also figures in domestic spy land. We find that questioning the imbecilic foreign policy decision by Australian governments to purchase and construct fantasy nuclear-propelled submarines as servitors of the US empire is bound to be the product of 'foreign interference'. The agency 'has identified foreign services seeking to target AUKUS to position themselves to collect the capabilities, how Australia intends to use them, and to undermine the confidence of our allies.' In his 2024 address, Burgess quotes the words of Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley to the Australian Parliament after establishing ASIO: 'It is not usual to discuss the detailed activities of a security service. Much of the value of such a service lies in the fact that it works quietly. Members of the organisation should not be unduly prominent at cocktail parties, but should devote themselves to the tasks allotted to them.' Burgess, ever the funny man, then takes a stab at humour, claiming to be more permissive than the former Australian PM: 'given the work my people do, I would never begrudge them the odd cocktail party now and then'. If only his agents, and Burgess, spent more time at such events and less time babbling on the stage, we would all be better off.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ7CcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-02-24T15:35:45-08:00	
Kremlin’s Militarization Of Russia’s Youngest Has Far-Reaching Co...	Russian educational institutions, especially kindergartens and early childhood education, have been militarized since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The regular use of army songs, posters, and guns in the curriculum to promote military values and the employment of returning veterans as instructors now dominate the kindergartens and early grades of Russian schools (Govorit Nemoskva, February 17). Many Russian parents and outside observers dismiss this as a passing phase. They believe that children who are now being subject to pro-war propaganda in kindergartens and the early grades will not be affected for very long and will adopt different positions when they grow older. Aleksandra Arkhipova, an independent Russian anthropologist, however, argues that a landmark study of the impact of anti-Semitic propaganda in Nazi-era German schools suggests otherwise (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNASVol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015): 7931-7036). Arkhipova believes that what is happening in Russian early childhood educational institutions now is likely to cast a dark shadow on the future. The children now passing through these schools are disposed to support militarism and aggression long into the future, serving as an important base of support for those in the Kremlin now and decades hence who want to pursue such policies (Telegram/anthro_fun, reposted at Echo fm, February 7; Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7, reposted at Echo fm, February 8). The German study to which Arkhipova refers found through the use of surveys that Germans who were subjected to anti-Semitic messaging in schools during Nazi times were far more likely to remain anti-Semitic decades later than those born either earlier or later and not having had that experience (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNAS Vol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015):7931-7036). This finding strongly suggests, Arkhipova continues, that the same pattern will hold with Russian children who are now being subjected to pro-war propaganda and are likely to remain more pro-war than those older or younger and thus form an important reservoir of support for aggressive and pro-war Kremlin policymakers long into the future. Unsurprisingly, Arkhipova’s posts have attracted widespread attention among Russians in particular because they challenge the assumptions and hopes many in that country have about a post-Putin Russia. Additionally, unlike in the case of Germany, there is virtually no chance that Russia will suffer the overwhelming defeat and occupation that transformed German society after 1945. This transformation helped to reduce to a minimum the ideas promoted by the Nazis in kindergartens and schools. Some Russians fear, although may seldom feel free to say, that if there is no such imposed transformation in Russia, the militarist and aggressive policies Putin has implemented will continue. These policies will enjoy the support of the rising generation, in whom many placed their hopes to create a better Russia. One Russian observer who has given particular attention to Arkhipova’s argument and the evolving state of Russian national identity is Vladimir Pastukhov, a Russian scholar now based in London. In a telegram channel post picked up by Russian internet portals, Pastukhov says that Arkhipova’s argument has prompted him to think 'about the evolution that Russian society has undergone over the forty years of post-communism … from ‘new Russians’ to ‘other Russians’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8, reposted at Echo fm, February 9). Pastukhov’s argument extends the one posited by Arkhipova by expecting a very different Russia than the one others like him have lived through or hoped for since the end of the Soviet system. Since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Pastukhov says, many commentators have focused on the way in which the war has become an important part of the genesis of a new Ukrainian nation. Few, however, have focused on how it is playing an analogous function for the Russian nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). He continues that for the reasons Arkhipova proposes as well as broader ones, it seems almost certain that 'a completely different Russian society will emerge from the war than the one which entered it' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Russia’s war against Ukraine marks 'the end of the history of post-communism with its ‘new Russians’ and the beginning of a fundamentally different era … the main character of which will be ‘the other Russian’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). This represents, Pastukhov says, the latest round of nation-building in Russia, extending the argument of others that the tragedy of Russia is that the country became an empire before the people became a nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Therefore, it has little chance to become a nation-state and every chance to remain a people defined by the retention and pursuit of empire (Asia Russia Daily, January 12, 2015; Gorod 812, December 14, 2020; Svoboda, March 2, 2024). It is a contested issue, with the opposition hoping for one kind of Russian nation and the Kremlin hoping for a very different one. This struggle has not, however, attracted as much attention as it deserves, the London-based Russian analyst says. While many in Russia and the West are more than willing to suggest that Ukraine does not exist as a nation, very few are prepared to recognize that Russia is not a nation, in the modern sense. Russia’s attachment to the state and the idea of imperial expansion reflects that reality (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). According to Pastukhov, the Kremlin has a better understanding of this reality than its opponents (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). It is actively working to institutionalize itself by shaping the youngest members of society as Arkhipova suggests, anticipating to 'mold golems from ‘the inhabitants’ in the hope of sitting out ‘behind the battlements’ for the time required for the golems to begin to speak' (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7). In the meantime, this rising generation will be far more likely to speak positively of the Kremlin than promote the formation of a democratic Russian nation at peace with itself and its neighbors. The danger of that negative outcome, again as Arkhipova indicates, is likely to remain in place far longer than Putin himself (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7).

Twenty Five Years Of Vladimir Putin – Analysis	By Ajay Kamalakaran On the evening of December 31, 1999, few in Russia knew what its first president was going to say in a recorded televised speech. The country, which was still in the financial doldrums because of its debt default, watched as Boris Yeltsin resigned. 'We are creating a vital precedent of a civilized and voluntary transfer of presidential power to a newly elected president,' Yeltsin said[1]. And yet, I have taken a different decision: I am leaving before the end of my term.' He added, 'In accordance with the Constitution, I have signed a decree giving the powers of president of Russia to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He will be the head of state for three months, after which presidential elections will be held, also in accordance with the Constitution.' From the beginning of the new millennium, Putin has been Russia’s undisputed leader, serving as president for the entire period, except from 2008 to 2012, when he was prime minister to avoid violating the then two-term constitutional limit for the country’s highest office. In 1999, when Putin was handed over the reins of power, the country’s GDP was $1,331[2] per capita. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook estimates[3] that in 2025, this number will touch $16,077 or, and $48,957 on a PPP basis. For Russia watchers who have been living in and observing the country for the last two decades, it is hard not to notice the incredible changes that it has witnessed in this time period. At the beginning of Putin’s presidency, Russia looked like a former empire in decline – crumbling infrastructure, rampant alcoholism, street crime, often violent, extremist political movements and general disenchantment. In the Putin era, Russian cities have undergone a dramatic revival, turning into clean, restored, efficient and beautified urban spaces with expanded and safe multi-modal public transport. The development has spread far beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg. For instance, the East Asian city of Vladivostok was chosen as the host[4] of the APEC Summit. Two new suspension bridges were built to link the city to outlying areas, and its main university was expanded to accommodate a growing number of foreign students from countries such as India. Sochi, the Black Sea resort city, got a much-needed makeover in time for the 2014 Winter Olympics[5]. Foreign media was quick to point out flaws in Russia’s organisation of the sporting event, prompting Putin to take personal care to ensure that the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted across Russian cities, became the gold standard. It was during this event that football fans from across the world got a chance to see – and fall in love with – contemporary Russia. The urban revival has stretched to second and third tier, distant cities that for decades lacked Moscow’s attention. One such is Astrakhan[6], which is close to the Caspian Sea and an important part of the International North South Transport Corridor. The rural areas of Russia have not witnessed the kind of large-scale transformation as have its cities. Nearly a quarter of the population[7] of the country lives in rural areas. Over the last decade, the government has increasingly shifted its focus on the countryside, given the growing need for food security in a sanctioned world. In 2024, $144 million was allotted[8] by the government for preferential lending programs aimed at improving housing, transportation and living standards in rural Russia. However, inequality in Russia is relatively low: Russia’s Gini coefficient, a measure that represents income, wealth and consumption inequality in 2021 was 35.1[9], suggesting a moderate level of inequality. On foreign policy, the early years of Putin’s presidency were marked with attempts to build trust and ties with the West. His personal friendship with then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder paved the way for the construction of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The Russian President also enjoyed warm ties with George W. Bush, who was one of 50 heads of state at the World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. Bush was joined by French President Jacques Chirac, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and India’s Manmohan Singh. In the early 2000s, Russia and NATO were increasingly looking at boosting cooperation, forming the NATO-Russia Council[10] in 2002. This was termed 'a consultation, consensus-building, cooperation, joint decision making and joint action,' where individual NATO member states and Russia worked 'as equal partners on a wide spectrum of security issues of common interest.' Russia’s critical interests were attacked during the Barack Obama administration when American officials aggressively pursued a regime-change in Kiev. In 2013, the US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland openly admitted[11] at the US-Ukraine Foundation Conference that Washington was sponsoring the events at the Maidan in Kiev that would eventually lead to a coup and the installation of a US-friendly regime[12]. Washington’s increased interference in Ukraine after the 2014 coup, and persistent meddling in other former Soviet republics like Georgia killed any hopes of this Council achieving any of the goals it had set out. While reaching out to the West, Putin made it a cornerstone of his foreign policy to simultaneously revive sagging ties with India and to remove mistrust with China. It was under the leadership of Putin and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that India and Russia signed the Declaration[13] of Strategic Partnership, and began the exercise of holding annual summits. Top-level meetings are also held annually under the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission (IRIGC) mechanism. One of Putin’s greatest foreign policy successes was the final settlement of the Russia-China boundary dispute. In 2004, the countries signed the Complementary Agreement[14] on the Eastern Section of the Russia-China Boundary. As a part of the agreement, Russia handed over half of the Tarabarov (Yinlong) Island, as well as the Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island and a few islets on the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers. The countries, which share a 4,209-kilometre border, now have more than 160 functional border crossings. The relationships built by Putin with China and India were crucial for the balanced positions the countries took when Crimea became a part of Russia. The Asian giants also refused to join Western sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis. While the country’s isolation from the West has been irksome for some members of the political, bureaucratic and business elite, Moscow has offset this partially with its growing ties with Asia through setups like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and other emerging powers through BRICS and BRICS-plus. In an ideal world, Russia would enjoy the kind of relations with the West it did in May 2005, when Moscow hosted world leaders for the 60th anniversary of World War II Victory Day. But its critical security interests have been challenged by the West, making it difficult. The Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia to end the war in Ukraine, may help mend strained ties. Despite concerns over the Ukraine crisis prolonging and inflationary pressures at home, Putin’s approval rating[15] hovers over 80 per cent. As with most countries, it’s about the economy; life and living standards have improved drastically over the last 25 years. Most Russians would not trade this away for the instability and crises of the Yeltsin era. Opponents propped up the West are seen as those ready to take Russia back to the 1990s when food and housing were scarce. One of Russia’s greatest successes in the Putin era was the revival of agriculture. In 2005 the Russian government identified agriculture as a national priority area. From being an importer of food grains in the late 1990s, Russia went on to become a major global supplier, with exports of grain and processed grain products touching 83.5 million tonnes[16] in 2024, according to Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor. Another factor in Putin’s popularity at home has been his constant support for what is accepted as 'traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' An official presidential decree[17] to this extent was issued in 2022. 'Traditional values ​​include life, dignity, human rights and freedoms, patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate, high moral ideals, a strong family, creative work, the priority of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercy, justice, collectivism, mutual assistance and mutual respect, historical memory and continuity of generations, the unity of the peoples of Russia,' the decree said. The 2022 presidential decree stressed the importance of religion for the country: 'Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions, which are an integral part of the Russian historical and spiritual heritage, have had a significant impact on the formation of traditional values ​​common to believers and non-believers. Orthodoxy plays a special role in the formation and strengthening of traditional values.' In Putin’s era, Russian Orthodox monasteries and churches have been revived across the country and programs on state television have promoted a return to religion. State support has also been extended to mosques and Buddhist monasteries. For instance, the old Cathedral Mosque was demolished in 2011 to make way for a new modern structure that houses 10,000 worshippers. For the opening ceremony of the new building in 2015, Putin was joined by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This emphasis on traditional values has also extended to making it easier for those who want to migrate to Russia. A 2024 presidential decree[18] grants even those who are not proficient in the Russian language or history temporary resident permits. It specifically invites those foreigners who reject 'the policies implemented by countries that impose destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes that contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' This could be a simultaneous way of building goodwill with people of foreign countries, while addressing the demographic needs. A quarter of a century after Putin became Russia’s president, a large number of Russians see this as an era of revival and regeneration after a decline that began from the days of Perestroika.

Getting Ready For Tomorrow’s Myanmar – Analysis	By Nicholas Farrelly Myanmar’s top generals have had another bad year. Under relentless attack, their subordinates have surrendered regional military command headquarters, draconian conscription regulations were introduced to bolster the dwindling rank-and-file, and in the north, east and west, rebel armies are strangling access to valuable resources. Old certainties on the battlefields have been overturned by the proliferation of armed groups, including nimble guerrilla squads in central Myanmar and the widespread use, by all sides, of new combat technologies, including drones. The economy, under these conditions, is spluttering — with the national currency, the kyat, now worth only a quarter of its pre-COVID-19 value. Regime officials have imposed price controls on essentials like rice, cooking oil, eggs, fish and meat. Even middle-class families struggle to survive, and flows of desperate migrants are continuing to flee to Thailand and Malaysia. The junta is also clamping down in the digital sphere, limiting access to information and networks through the Internet. The top generals’ devastating misjudgement of the public mood in early 2021 means monitoring and coercing the population is a bigger job than ever. In response, Myanmar’s democrats, ethnic separatists and sundry revolutionaries are steadily undermining the coherence of the dictatorship. While the wars in Myanmar, and the resistance that exists in every town and city, receive only scant media or policy attention, the realities on the ground have shifted, quite profoundly, against the military regime. In terms of the economy, territorial fragmentation, combat capacity, international reputation and diplomatic energy, the regime is faltering. The generals in Naypyitaw could hobble on in this fashion, potentially for years. The history of mismanaged military dictatorship in Myanmar suggests that this is a highly plausible scenario. In 2025, or perhaps 2026, the generals also want to hold an election to try to rebuild their authority and create some greater legitimacy, including for diplomacy through ASEAN. Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, for a start, would certainly welcome such rehabilitation, but the fact is that any such regime-endorsed election would also be immediately dismissed as flawed and undemocratic. It is increasingly clear that Myanmar’s people, and interested outsiders, need to consider what other future the country might face as the present regime continues its downward slide. With Aung San Suu Kyi still locked up, there is no unifying figure for the resistance. The National Unity Government inevitably struggles to draw all of the different fighting forces together. Some local examples help to illustrate the precarious conditions for ’day-after’ scenario planning. The Arakan Army now controls almost everything of note in the western state of Rakhine. In northernmost Myanmar, the Kachin Independence Army is increasingly dominant. Yet, in both areas, there are other political actors, including armed groups, who feel they have claims to specific territory and resources. The Shan State remains highly contested and has been where the Myanmar army has suffered particular setbacks in the past year, including the loss of strategic military bases. Myanmar’s jumbled geographical mandates are nothing new; throughout its history, Myanmar has remained a patchwork of different territorial claims. At times, the central government has, through ceasefires and other agreements, managed to create a somewhat unified national condition. Ideologies of ‘national race’ inclusion that developed over generations, remain a key part of the regime’s response to these fraught political conditions. What has changed is the strongest ethnic minorities’ tolerance for a system that defines their inclusion on Bamar Buddhist terms. Might the mess eventually lead to formal fragmentation? If there are future negotiations about the shape of a federalised Myanmar state, the armies that have fought to secure their own territories will not simply turn over security and economic decision-making to a central government. They will want to control local resources, with extra influence over educational, linguistic, social and cultural outcomes. Balkanisation, however defined, is a part of today’s and tomorrow’s realities. Within ASEAN, chaired in 2025 by Malaysia, there is deepening concern that Myanmar’s internal problems are far too big to ignore. 2021’s Five-Point Consensus clearly failed to change regime behaviour, but the path to a new mechanism for engagement is also far from clear. China has much to lose if Myanmar descends further into the quagmire. But it is not apparent it would contribute to a grand negotiation if that implied contributions from regional competitors like India, Japan or Australia. Russia, limping through its invasion of Ukraine, still keeps Myanmar stocked with sophisticated military equipment. The fall of the half-century Assad regime in Syria, after the rapid withdrawal of Russian backing, naturally heartened Myanmar’s resistance. Closer to home, they also watched the implosion of Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh, with the former prime minister forced to seek sanctuary abroad. These examples have no doubt buoyed Myanmar’s resistance fighters and offer reminders that supposedly settled conditions do sometimes tip quickly. There is little sense, however, that Myanmar has caught US President Donald Trump’s attention. But an unpredicted intervention cannot be completely ruled out. There are Republican figureswith a long-term eye on Myanmar’s democratic prospects and its possible role in thwarting Chinese designs in the wider region. With more bloodshed and turbulence inevitable, questions about how regional and global powers might find common ground to help the Myanmar people shape their own destinies are not going away.

Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs Of Trade Destruction – Analysis	At the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, investor Warren Buffett warned of derivatives as weapons of financial mass destruction. President Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' could have a similar impact on world trade. Last week, President Trump tasked his economic team with devising plans for 'reciprocal tariffs' on every country taxing US imports. Designed in part as bargaining leverage with other countries, they are ramping up prospects for a global trade war with both American allies and adversaries. As Trump put it, 'I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less.' Since Trump did not impose new tariffs yet, Wall Street sighed in relief. Though the prime financiers of the Trump campaign, U.S. financial institutions are increasingly concerned that the administration’s new tariffs are broadening trade war, penalizing consumer and business confidence and risking accelerated inflation in America. The financial institutions should be concerned. The only reason that Trump did not impose fresh tariffs was that he initiated investigations that could ignite a far worse global trade war toward the late spring. Trump's tariff war with the world The US deficits first emerged in the early 1970s; decades before offshoring, the rise of China and other large emerging economies. Since the mid-2000s, China and the large emerging economies have driven global growth prospects. In the process, U.S. goods and services deficit has soared to $918 billion in 2024, up $134 billion from the previous year. Today, the world factory is not in the US, but in China. The US doesn’t benefit from trade surplus; it suffers from a huge deficit. Similarly, in the past eight decades, US dollar’s share of global payments has halved to less than 50% of the total. Thanks to the past Trump and Biden administrations, US trade deficit has more than doubled from $40 billion per month to about $90-$100 billion monthly. On February 1, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs and 10% duties on energy products on Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on China. The three countries are America’s greatest trade partners and the US has a trade deficit with each. Together with Germany and Japan, these five countries account for more than half of all US imports. They and all the rest will be next in the firing line. This week Trump suggested 25% tariffs on autos, pharma and semiconductors, which could 'go very substantially higher over a course of a year.' A (very) broad definition of reciprocal tariffs Starting with countries with the biggest trade surpluses and highest tariff rates first, the aim is to offset not just tariffs but also non-tariff measures, including vehicle safety rules. The same goes for value-added taxes (VAT), even though VATs are faced by both US and other international companies in different countries. VATs create no advantage for European firms and no disadvantage for US firms because they are neutral with respect to trade. Thanks to the new tariffs and non-tariff measures the Trump administration is also on a collision course with its major allies, the European Union and Japan. The idea is also to go after what the Trump administration deems as 'burdensome' regulations, harmful 'government subsidies' and flawed exchange rate policies. In the Trump world, all these measures erect unwarranted costs and barriers to US products in foreign markets. The Commerce Department and the US trade representative are expected to prepare their plans to achieve 'reciprocal trading status' by April 1 – perhaps appropriately on April Fools’ Day. Penalizing emerging and developing economies Should this trade war materialize, it could prove far costlier to the emerging and developing economies, and it might push several fragile economies over the edge. Ironically, export-led growth, the development doctrine that fueled the rise of many East and Southeast countries, could now hit the wall. In the postwar decades, the so-called Asian tigers – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea – were lucky enough to industrialize during increasing global integration. The more they still rely on export-led growth and a US trade surplus, the more they will find themselves in tricky waters with the Trump White House. The successors of these countries – particularly the large emerging economies and many of the BRICS, including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico - that rely on international trade and US trade surpluses would also have to reassess their growth models. Things are likely to get even more heated with those countries that trade oil and gas or other commodities in local currencies. Reiterating his longstanding threat, Trump said last week that US 'if [the BRICS] want to play games with the dollar' and 'if any trading gets through, it'll be 100% tariff, at least.' However, big trading economies like China, which have diversified economies and can divert their trade into the Global South, will be better insulated from US economic coercion. If the expansive BRICS can unite their forces, their collective leverage will prove formidable, even vis-à-vis the US and other G7 economies. By the early 2020s. China alone used its currency to settle half of its foreign trade and investment transactions. Overall, the emerging world will face elevated uncertainty surrounding US trade policy that can defer investment decisions and impact emerging economies linked to countries targeted by US tariffs. Undermining the WTO In a short order, Trump has tried to decimate the US aid agency (USAID), withdraw the US from the UN refugee relief agency in the Middle East (UNRWA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while sanctioning the International Criminal Court (ICC). If completed, reciprocal tariffs would increase duties on many trading partners, while violating decades of normative trade policies by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trump’s attacks against the WTO began in the first term, when he put the global trade body into sleep by blocking judges from its top dispute-settlement panel. Instead of correcting the wrong, the Biden administration continued it. Now the Trump administration is eager to destabilize the WTO’s principle of 'most favored nation' (MFN) status. The MFN requires member nations to ensure equal tariff and regulatory treatment to other members unless they have free-trade agreements in place. The idea of applying different tariff rates to different countries violates the WTO principle of non-discrimination among its members. As Trump’s elevated tariff rates exceed the maximum rate negotiated with other WTO members, trading rules are violated. Expressing the views of many WTO members, China condemned these 'tariff shocks' that could upend the global trading system. Ironically, Trump is purposely undermining the 'rules-based trading world' that US claims to have fostered since the 1950s. Effectively, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs would mean a fatal rupture from the WTO. It could effectively endanger the very role of the trading body, the US role in the organization and the world’s trading system itself – for the first time in 75 years. Positioning for talks with China With an eye on his legacy, Trump wants a 'deal of a century' in China. He knows it needs to be a deal that can benefit both the US and China. His neoconservative hawks – Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sinophobe trade counselor Peter Navarro – will oppose any Chinese investment in the US. Yet, it is advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; and tech billionaire Elon Musk who he will listen. In the Middle East and Ukraine, Trump has used his special convoy Steve Witkoff to get things done (and override neocon mutinies). With China, he could do the same. But this time around, Chinese policy authorities are more wary. Trump’s interest in a 'deal of a century' with China is an opportunity. But he is seen as a risk amplifier. The stakes are too high for policy mistakes.

Why The Bureaucracy Keeps Getting Bigger – OpEd	By Murray N. Rothbard Bureaucracy is necessarily hierarchical, first because of the Iron Law of Oligarchy, and secondly because bureaucracy grows by adding more subordinate layers. Since, lacking a market, there is no genuine test of 'merit' in government’s service to consumers, in a rule-bound bureaucracy seniority is often blithely adopted as a proxy for merit. Increasing seniority, then, leads to promotion to higher ranks, while expanding budgets take the form of multiplying the levels of ranks under you, and expanding your income and power. Bureaucratic growth occurs, then, by multiplying levels of bureaucracy. The theory of hierarchical government bureaucracy is that information is collected in the lowest ranks of the organization, and that at each successive higher rank, the manager culls the most important information from his subordinates, separates the wheat from the chaff, and passes the culled information higher up, so that, in the end, the President, for example, dealing with intelligence operations, receives a two-page memo distilling the most important information gathered and culled from hundreds of thousands of intelligence agents. The President, then, knows more than anyone else, say, about foreign affairs. One problem with this rosy model, as Professor Gordon Tullock points out in his illuminating book, The Politics of Bureaucracy,1 is that the model doesn’t ask whether or not each bureaucrat has the incentive to pass the best distillate of truth on to his superiors. The problem is that bureaucratic favor, especially at the higher levels, depends on pleasing one’s superiors, and pleasing them largely rests on telling the President and the higher bureaucrats what they want to hear. One of the great truths of human history is that one tends to shoot, or at least react badly, to the bearer of bad news. 'Sire, your policy is working badly in Croatia,' is not the sort of message that the President, say, wants to hear from his envoy, and, while the outcome in Croatia remains in doubt, the President and his aides want to continue to believe that their policy is doing well. Hence, the dissident is set down as a trouble-maker if not a subversive, and his career in the hierarchy is side-tracked, often permanently. In the meanwhile, the envoys or foreign service people who assure the President 'things are going very well in Croatia,' are hailed as perceptive fellows and their careers are advanced. And then, if years later, the dissident is proved correct, and the Croatian policy lies in shambles, is the president or any other ruler likely to turn in warm gratitude to the former dissident? Not hardly. Instead, he will still remember the dissident as a troublemaker, and he will not blame his aides, who, along with himself, have been proved wrong. For after all, didn’t the great mainstream of experts make the same error? How common is sincere soul-searching and repentance for past errors among Presidents or other rulers? Those bureaucrats who are shrewd analysts of human nature, then, and who understand the way rulers operate, will, if they see that the cherished policy of their President is in grave error, tend to keep their mouths shut, and let some other sucker be the messenger of bad news and get shot down. Every human activity and institution will tend to reward those who are most able to adapt to the best route to success in that activity. Successful market entrepreneurs will be those who can best anticipate, and satisfy, consumer demands. Success in the bureaucracy on the contrary, will go to those who are most apt at (a) employing propaganda to persuade their superiors, the legislators, or the public about their great merits; and therefore (b) at understanding that the way to rise is to tell the President and the top bureaucrats what they want to hear. Hence, the higher the ranks of the bureaucracy, the more yes-men and time-servers there will tend to be. The President will often know less about what is going on than those in the lower ranks. Hence, for example, the phenomenon of President Nixon, thinking he knew more than anyone else about the Vietnam War and yet actually knowing less than the astute reader of the New York Times. For the CIA and other intelligence warnings of what was going on, developed by many of the lower officers, were screened out by the higher-ups, for being contrary to the President’s preferred line, i.e., that all was going well.2 The standard explanation of why government grows is that, as time goes on, there is more work for government to do, and that therefore the public’s 'demand for government' rises. Far more accurate is the view that there is a case of an inverted Say’s Law, where supply — or rather the suppliers of government 'services,' the bureaucracy — themselves constitute the 'demand' for their own services, and that they engineer the consent of their superiors, or of the legislature, to provide the wherewithal in the form of increased taxation. Contrast the hilariously satirical, but all too perceptive account of 'Parkinson’s Law' of bureaucracy. Thus, Professor Parkinson asserted that, in a government bureaucracy, 'there need be little or no relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which it may be assigned.'3 The continuing rise in the total of government employees 'would be much the same whether the volume of the work were to increase, diminish, or even disappear.'4 Parkinson identifies two 'axiomatic' underlying forces responsible for this growth: (1) 'An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals'; and (2) 'Officials make work for each other.' Parkinson begins his 'model' with an official who feels himself overworked. The official could resign, but that is unthinkable; besides, he would lose his pension rights. To ask to divide his work in half with a new colleague on his own level is equally unthinkable; for his status would be cut, and he would bring in a dangerous rival for the job of his own boss when the latter retires. He could ask for one assistant under him; but that would be dangerous, because the new man might achieve something like equal status with himself. No, his preferred route is to ask for two assistants, who could then compete with each other for his favor; pretty soon, each of these new assistants will complain of overwork, and each one of these will get two assistants. The original bureaucrat now has the satisfaction of having six men under him, and he is now ready for a promotion and a substantial raise in pay. But how about the work to be done? Won’t the original quantity of work be divided into seven parts, and won’t each man now be absurdly and manifestly idle and underworked? No — and here is one of Parkinson’s scintillating insights into the theory of bureaucracy — for one aspect of Parkinson’s Law is that 'work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.' Or, as Parkinson also puts it: 'The thing to be done swells in importance and complexity in direct ratio with the time to be spent.'5 Here enters the second aspect of Parkinson’s Law of Growth: that 'officials make work for each other.' For, says Parkinson, 'these seven make so much work for each other that all are fully occupied,' and the original man 'is actually working harder than ever.' Documents have to be sent to each man in turn, each has to comment on the document and send the comments to everyone else, they all have to confer on the document and the various amendments proposed, and the original man is now also wrapped up in problems of inter-personal relations between himself and his staff, and of each of his staff amongst the others. Finally, after a lengthy process of interaction, writes Parkinson, the original official produces the same reply to the document that he would have written if all his subordinates 'had never been born.' 'Far more people,' Parkinson concludes, 'have taken far longer to produce the same result. No one has been idle. All have done their best.'6 Parkinson then illustrates his law with delightful examples from the British Royal Navy. From 1914 to 1928, the number of ships in the Navy fell by 68 percent; the number of officers and men fell by 32 percent. And yet, during the same period, the number of dockyard officials and clerks in the Navy increased by 40 percent, while, even more outrageously, the number of Admiralty officials increased by over 78 percent. The annual rate of increase in the number of Admiralty officials, with little variation, was 5.6 percent. Parkinson takes another example from the British Colonial Office, from 1935 to 1954. In that period, the area and population of colonial territories remained about the same from 1935 to 1939, fell during the war until 1943, rose again until 1947, and then steadily decreased as Britain shed its Empire. And yet, in each of these two decades, the Colonial Office bureaucracy rose steadily in number by about 5.9 percent per year, regardless of what was happening in the scope of the alleged work to be done. Considering then the rate of increase each year in the Admiralty, and averaging the rates of increase of Admiralty and colonial officials, which is not, after all, more outlandish than many other statistical procedures, Parkinson triumphantly concludes that the number of officials will increase by an average of 5.75 percent per year, 'irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done.'7 A similar analysis was set forth earlier, in 1950, in a grievously neglected book by Connecticut attorney and farmer Thomas H. Barber, based on years of inquiry into government and on his observations of Washington bureaucracy during World War II. Barber writes that 'there are two requisites for a bureaucrat’s promotion, the first, the ability to get and hold votes, the second, the number of subordinates he is able to keep busy.' Barber goes on: … in the Federal Government the pay of a bureaucrat executive is proportioned by Civil Service law to the number of his subordinates. This leads to the rivalry in Washington as each bureaucratic chief tries to increase his 'empire.' Generally, in order to keep his subordinates busy the boss assumes an air of great importance and affects to be very hurried and under great pressure. He is very punctual at the office and insists that everyone else be. He then deliberately begins to multiply paperwork, calling for reports on any subject connected with his job. He issues enormously complicated orders and memoranda for the organization of his office, requiring that all papers be so routed round that almost every scrap has to be read by everyone in the office and discussed by a number of interlocking committees before it is acted upon. He requires that no paper be thrown away, but all shall be cross-indexed and filed. He has anybody who can be tagged, interviewed, a stenographic report made of the interview and typed (often he has them mimeographed), and circulated to be read and initialed. By these methods it is quite easy to take an amount of work that could be done easily and efficiently by three men and two stenographers, and blow it up so that it can keep from fifty to two hundred people extremely busy, and yet fall far behind in its execution. Thus the uncompleted work gives him an apparently sound excuse for more clerks, who increase his prestige and his pay.8 Barber then goes on to relate a delightful example of bureaucracy in action that he had observed during World War II. He notes that there existed a department whose work, 'supposing it was worth doing, which is doubtful,' could have been done competently by about twenty people. It was run, as he puts it, 'by a man with a bureaucratic soul.' This man asked for written opinions from everyone on all sorts of subjects and had every one read and initial them: He was always intensely busy himself, even at night; and he kept constantly increasing his department till he got it up to two hundred men and women. This made him very important. All the two hundred were so busy carrying out his regulations that they were in a constant sweat and confusion, had no time to think, and the essential work in support of the war effort — supposing it was essential — suffered dreadfully. He was rewarded and translated to a more important job. His successor, Barber related, was a different kind of person; an old gentleman with little ambition and little regard for the taxpayer, but whose objective was to do the essential work, and keep himself and everyone else at the workplace contented. In contrast to the twelve hours a day spent in the office by his predecessor, this man spent only one-half an hour at work each morning. The rest of the day, he walked around the office, talking and joking with the employees, and played golf in the late afternoon. At the end of the first week, says Barber, 'he fired about fifty of the two hundred people, apparently at random.' As a result, 'the work lessened considerably for the remaining ones.' There was naturally a lot of discussion of this action, and 'it was generally decided that he had fired the fifty he was sure he did not like.' 'Not a very scientific way of eliminating surplus help,' adds Barber, 'but it did lighten the work.' The following week, the new boss fired fifty more people, this time apparently dismissing those 'he thought he did not like.' In consequence, 'the work for the remainder lightened enormously, though some of the essential work of those dismissed was apportioned around silently by those that remained.' A few days later, another fifty people were dismissed, these being the people 'he was not sure he did like.' Barber notes: 'With three-quarters of the force eliminated there was practically nothing left but the ‘essential work’, such as it was, to do.' This work was done effectively in about half of each day by the fifty people remaining, 'far more efficiently than it had been done by the original two hundred. The fifty did their stuff and devoted the time remaining — about half of it — to their own concerns.' Barber concludes that 'the old gentleman, being now surrounded only by those he knew he liked, felt he had done enough.' He was in the office about an hour a day, and then he evaporated. 'The ‘work’ was far better done than it had been, people had time to think and were not in each other’s way.' Barber adds that the work probably could have been done by half again of those remaining, but that then the half would 'have had to work about as hard as the original two hundred had worked and there would have been no benefit to anyone but the taxpayers.'9 In addition to this keen treatment of bureaucracy, Thomas Barber was perhaps the first person to arrive at the essence of what is now called 'public choice' analysis in the economics profession. Barber notes the 'constant tendency for all governments to grow both in size and in authority.' Why? Barber answers: because the advantage of a big, powerful government, from the point of view of the bureaucrats, is personal, clear and ever-present to their eyes; and because the cost of it, not only in money but in freedom, which is lost by giving authority to officials, is vague and nebulous in the minds of the citizens whose attention is not focused on the government at all…. Therefore, since the bureaucrats know exactly what they want and are working for their own immediate interest, and since the other citizens do not realize what they are giving up, and, in fact, have not their attention on the matter at all, it is obvious which group will prevail.10 What public choicer has put it better? About the author: This article is adapted from 'Bureaucracy and the Civil Service in the United States.' Murray Rothbard was born March 2, 1926, the son of David and Rae Rothbard. He was a brilliant student even as a young child; and his academic record at Columbia University, where he majored in mathematics and economics, was stellar. In the Columbia economics department, Rothbard did not receive any instruction in Austrian economics, and Mises was no more than a name to him. In a course on price theory given by George Stigler, however, he encountered arguments against such then popular measures as price and rent control. These arguments greatly appealed to him; and he wrote to the publisher of a pamphlet that Stigler and Milton Friedman had written on rent control.

Uneven Prosperity Mapping India’s Poverty Struggles – OpEd	A glaring and varied picture of economic inequality in India is presented by the data on poverty levels in the various Indian states. The problem of poverty has long plagued India, and some areas are still severely affected even after years of efforts. In addition to showing the extent of poverty, the percentages on the map also highlight regional disparities in wealth distribution. One of the most populous states in India, Uttar Pradesh, has terrible conditions, with 32.1% of its people living on US$ 3.20 (? 270 approx.) or less per day. Although Uttar Pradesh is an important agricultural and industrial centre for India, a sizable section of its people live in poverty. This can be ascribed to inadequate social services, bad governance, and a lack of infrastructure. A cycle of poverty has been sustained, particularly in rural areas, by slow agricultural growth and restricted access to healthcare and education. Likewise, 23.3% of people in Bihar, another state with a large population, live in poverty. Despite advancements in areas like agriculture and education, Bihar has long been one of the poorest states in India. However, the state's overall economic growth has not been sufficient to lift a sizable section of its population out of poverty. Bihar's low productivity in agriculture and lack of industrialisation are the main causes of the state's high poverty. Moreover, the state's yearly vulnerability to floods and other natural disasters makes matters worse and forces millions of people into ever-deeper poverty. At 27%, poverty is also a significant problem in Odisha. Despite having an abundance of natural resources and minerals, Odisha has had difficulty transforming its wealth into widespread prosperity. Much of Odisha's population, like that of Bihar, depends on the still-underdeveloped agricultural sector. The industrial and mining sectors have not been inclusive enough to help the economically vulnerable despite their contribution to the state's GDP. Tribal areas of the state, which have been neglected in terms of development for decades, also contribute to the high rates of poverty. Surprisingly, 34.9% of the people in Maharashtra, one of India's economic superpowers, live on ? 270 or less per day. This number is concerning because Maharashtra is home to some of India's most advanced cities, such as Mumbai, the nation's financial hub. Here, we see the sharp contrast between rural poverty and urban wealth. Although much wealth has been created in metropolitan areas like Mumbai, most is concentrated among a small percentage of the population. Maharashtra's rural areas, where agriculture is still the primary source of income, are still plagued by poverty, droughts, and a lack of infrastructure investment. West Bengal is another state with a high population density, where 35.2% of people live below the poverty line. Even though the state has improved healthcare and education, its economic development still lags behind other states. Poverty has persisted partly due to the slow rate of industrialisation and the demise of traditional industries like jute. There is now a division between the countryside and urban areas like Kolkata because rural areas, especially those in the state's north and west, have been left behind in the drive for development. Like many other agrarian states, 26.4% of Rajasthan's population lives below the poverty line. Even with recent improvements in infrastructure and tourism, Rajasthan is still heavily reliant on agriculture, which is regularly impacted by unpredictable monsoon rains. Droughts, poor soil quality, and water scarcity are persistent problems in the desert state that exacerbate its economic difficulties. The state's advancements in other areas, such as urbanisation and renewable energy, have not had enough impact to lift the poverty many rural residents face. However, states like Tamil Nadu (5.7%) and Kerala (16%) show how progressive social welfare, healthcare, and education policies can dramatically lower poverty. Kerala has a robust healthcare system and high literacy rates and has continuously done well on several human development indices. Its poverty rates are low compared to other states, emphasising how crucial a robust welfare state is to combating poverty. The success of Tamil Nadu, which has the lowest poverty rate at 5.8%, further emphasises how important good governance and industrialisation are in generating jobs and services that help people escape poverty. The development models presented by both states strongly emphasise using human capital to combat inequality and poverty. Gujarat is a mixed case with a 21.8% share. The state is well-known for its quick economic expansion and industrialisation and has done an excellent job promoting entrepreneurship and creating jobs. However, poverty still exists in some places, especially in rural areas and among marginalised communities, which suggests that growth's advantages have not been shared fairly. Gujarat's emphasis on business and industry has occasionally come at the expense of social development initiatives that could significantly lower poverty. Relatively lower poverty rates in Delhi and Haryana (14% and 15.7%, respectively) demonstrate the advantages of northern India's urbanisation and economic expansion. As the nation's capital, Delhi has witnessed tremendous advancements in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, all of which have contributed to a decline in poverty. However, there are still problems with income inequality, especially between the wealthy and the less fortunate groups, such as slum dwellers and migrant workers, who find it challenging to make ends meet. Haryana has also profited from economic growth because of its proximity to Delhi and robust agricultural base, but inequalities still exist, especially in rural areas. An intriguing example is the northeastern states, like Nagaland (12.6%). These states have historically had greater rates of poverty because of their remote locations, inadequate infrastructure, and constrained economic prospects. However, targeted development initiatives, especially through central government programs and heightened focus on regional sectors like tourism and handicrafts, have contributed to a decrease in poverty in recent years. Nagaland's comparatively lower poverty rate demonstrates that focused interventions can make a significant difference even in historically underprivileged areas. On the other hand, the union territory of Lakshadweep provides an example of how poverty can be virtually eradicated with small, homogeneous populations and well-distributed resources, as evidenced by its remarkably low poverty rate of 0.3%. Due to the territory's small population, steady government assistance, and investments in regional businesses like tourism and fishing, there is little poverty and a high standard of living. The disparity in poverty rates among these states highlights how difficult it is to combat poverty in a nation with India's diversity. Geographical features, natural resources, governance, and historical development are all important determinants of each state's economic success. Poverty has decreased more successfully in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Gujarat, which have prioritised infrastructure development, industrialisation, and human capital investment. While this is going on, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha have had difficulty pulling sizable segments of their populations out of poverty due to their inadequate infrastructure, restricted access to healthcare and education, and excessive reliance on agriculture. Therefore, India's strategies for reducing poverty must be customised to meet each state's unique requirements and difficulties. This could entail concentrating on raising agricultural productivity, funding rural infrastructure, and expanding access to healthcare and education for states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In more developed states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the emphasis may need to change to tackle income inequality and ensure that economic expansion's advantages are shared more fairly. Furthermore, the fact that many states continue to have high rates of rural poverty emphasises the necessity of giving rural development more attention. The majority of India's population still lives in the rural hinterlands, which are neglected, while urban centres continue to expand and draw investment. The deep-seated poverty in these areas must be addressed through policies that enhance rural infrastructure, increase agricultural productivity, and generate non-farm employment opportunities. Furthermore, the differences in poverty levels highlight the significance of governance. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala that have made significant investments in welfare programs have seen a notable decrease in poverty. This implies that although economic expansion is crucial, social policies that guarantee growth advantages are distributed fairly must also be implemented. Social security, healthcare, and education are essential for enabling people to escape poverty and should be prioritised by all national governments. Finally, India's poverty map illustrates the country's uneven development. While some states have achieved notable progress in lowering poverty, others are still caught in a vicious cycle of hardship. A comprehensive strategy that considers each state's particular difficulties is needed to combat poverty in India. The way forward is obvious, ranging from boosting social welfare programs and addressing income inequality to increasing agricultural productivity and rural infrastructure. Combining inclusive social policies and economic growth is essential to bringing millions of Indians out of poverty and guaranteeing a more equitable future for everybody.

Ending The Russia–Ukraine War On Trump’s Terms – OpEd	By Dave Patterson The hands of the Russia-Ukraine war clock have ticked past 1,000 days. President Donald Trump is determined to end the conflict and stop the carnage. The Biden administration and Ukraine’s European neighbors were helpless in bringing the Russian invaders and their victims in Ukraine to the negotiating table for meaningful discussions, and Trump has potentially done that with two phone calls. Following Trump’s Feb. 12 conversations, one with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the other with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the stage was set for substantive talks aimed at ending three years of misery that began with the Kremlin’s unprovoked invasion Feb. 24, 2022. Peace Talks Begin The peace talks began on Feb. 18 in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh at the Diriyah Palace. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff represented the United States. They were joined by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the perennial face of the Kremlin’s foreign policy team, and Aide to the President Yuri Ushakov. A US State Department readout explained that 'President Trump wants to stop the killing; the United States wants peace and is using its strength in the world to bring countries together.' The statement continued with the observation that Trump 'is the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree' to a peace pact. Regardless of who is at fault for the aggression, neither of the two belligerents trusts the other. Buildling trust between Washington and Moscow will be a steep hill to climb, so it makes sense to take on this challenge first. To that end, the talks resulted in four trust-building steps. The US negotiators announced that they had decided to: 'Establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions. 'Appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides. 'Lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine. '[P]ledge to remain engaged to make sure the process moves forward in a timely and productive manner.' The State Department was clear in setting appropriate expectations for any rapid, permanent end to the destruction and bloodshed in Ukraine. 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace. We must take action, and today, we took an important step forward.' Soon after the meeting concluded, the US contingent met with journalists from CNN News and the Associated Press. A question posed was about how the Ukrainians and Europeans 'feel' shut out of the peace process as it has unfolded. In response, Rubio offered a dose of reality absent from the previous administration’s relationship with the Kyiv government and European leaders: 'Well, the comment I would have on that is that for three and a half years while this conflict has raged … no one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can. So, no one is being sidelined here.' Ukraine and Europeans Worried About Being Left Out To assuage the fears of the Europeans and Ukraine that they are not represented, Waltz offered, 'Look, it’s common sense. If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.' However, for the first meeting to establish confidence, having diplomats by the score, all pushing their country’s particular agenda, would have been a waste of time. Furthermore, candid and transparent, 'Rubio said a negotiation process had not begun in earnest, and if talks advanced, the Ukrainians and other Europeans would be brought in the fold,' Reuters reported. A key player with the most skin in the game is not convinced. RealClearPolitics quotedZelensky in a Meet the Press interview about assurances that Ukraine’s position would be protected. He declared, 'So, I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. And our people, never.' His passion is understandable — the Ukrainians have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens to a brutal Russian war machine. Nonetheless, never say never. When it comes to bringing peace to Ukraine, if not the United States, who? If not now, when? The previous administration and European leaders presided over a protracted conflict with no end in sight. It’s time for something different. The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

China Advances To Second Place In Global Soft Power Ranking – OpE...	China has overtaken the UK to secure 2nd place globally, advancing one position from the previous year ... in the Global Soft Power Index 2025. The latest report of the Global Soft Power Index for 2025 by influential brand valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, highlights the remarkable progress of China in its index ranking the extent of power and influence in world politics and international relations wielded by countries of the world. It now sits at second place behind the US which, although ranking first, has seen its soft power standing undermined by global concerns of its political stability, reputation and governance. The Global Soft Power Index report is based primarily on key indicators in economics and business. It also measures attributes related to culture and heritage, media and communication, education and science and sustainability. These together are increasingly seen as the other more influential and effective side of the power coin as compared with the flip side of hard power associated with military power and intervention, coercive diplomacy and economic sanction. The report notes that China retains first place globally for ‘ease to do business in and with’ and ‘future growth potential’ attributes for the last four years consecutively. This is a picture quite different to the one of ‘China collapsing’ and ‘China in economic crisis’ regularly featured in western mainstream media and reproduced by supporting Asian media. What is also notable is that China has soared to 7th place in the ranking of ‘culture and heritage’ and ‘media and communication’ attributes. This trend is strengthening with the further opening up of the country to foreign visitors and the global impact of the movie, Ne Zhe2 (NZ2) and Deep Seek, the artificial intelligence app. The impact of NZ2 and Deep Seek in their respective fields has been such that western media leaders such as CNN, BBC and New York Times that regularly engage in anti-China reporting, as well as have ignored or marginalized Chinese achievements, have been reluctantly aroused to run stories on them, albeit with their mandatory negative comments. Meanwhile, missing from the mainstream media coverage is India’s decline from the 29th position in 2024 to its current 30th position in 2025. Ne Zha2 Global Movie Megahit Ne Zha2 (NZ2), the latest China produced animation film hit with its story line of family, friendship, loyalty and sacrifice encapsulated within a framework of Chinese mythology and techno wizardry has captivated movie audiences wherever it has been shown and is expected to generate more than US$2 billion in box office takings. This will make it the highest ranking box office animated film in the world. What's appealing to movie fans, especially American audiences viewing it in the small number of cinemas it is showing - 300 of 9595 movie theatres - are not just the universal themes of courage and resilience but also the absence of messages relating to wokeness, political correctness, and attitude. Unlike in the West, where cultural dominance has been tied to colonial conquest and expansion, religion and political dominance, this example of film making and cultural influence is different. In today's high-tech era, films like NZ2 demonstrate how technology, storytelling and cultural heritage can converge to create a new filmmaking and culture dissemination model rooted in non ideological equality and dialogue rather than the legacy western model with its message of white, Christian and ideological goodness, superiority and supremacy. Movie audiences are no strangers to mythology-based storytelling. However, Chinese and other non-western mythology and story lines have been underexplored in the global entertainment world despite their rich history and universal themes. This is not only due to cultural and historical differences. It is more importantly an outcome of American dominance in the development of the movie industry since the early 20th century. Hollywood - with US government support - has dominated the world box office for more than a century and helped to shape how audiences in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America view the US and the world. Whilst this continues today, the success of Ne Zha and its sequel should encourage small countries in their cultural confidence and ability to tell their own stories. This will impact their soft power influence and ranking among the countries of the world. Deep Seek: Sputnik Moment and Bombshell Impact NZ2 comes on the heels of Deep Seek with the latter emerging like a bombshell in app stores around the world. As the most downloaded AI app, replacing Chat GPT, the Chinese AI model has significantly impacted the global tech industry by its cost-effective low budget development. This has caused major tech stocks to plummet and raised questions about the shifting power dynamics in the AI market. Many now see China as a major player in AI development that can challenge western AI apps presently dominating the market and tech giants such as Microsoft and Google. What’s important to the estimated 5 billion smartphone users in the world - they account for over 60% of the world’s population - is not that it is a Chinese app but that it is free. For those using it, Deep Seek has pioneered and opened the door to an open source app that can be used and modified easily and without the need to pay a fee or royalty. Deep Seek and NZ2 are not the only examples of China's growing soft power in the world. They follow Huawei, BYD, TikTok, Red Note and other recent China innovations and products developed entirely or mainly with homegrown talent whose ripple effects are affecting and undermining US and western domination of the existing world order. How will Trump’s MAGA Impact Global Power Balance Perhaps the greatest asset to China’s influence in the world for now comes from an unlikely source - President Donald Trump. As the world’s greatest political influencer and news maker, Trump in his mission to make America great again has embarked on a foreign policy campaign that has made allies of the US realize that their client status makes it inevitable that their interests will be placed on the sacrificial table if they stand in the way of Trump’s redefinition of American hard and soft power, and the ensuing relations with Russia, China or any other adversary. This, combined with China’s burgeoning soft power achievements, and Belt and Road Initiative with its emphasis on economic development and regional connectivity to bring about shared prosperity, will result in the more rapid remaking of the current world order to a more equitable and inclusive multipolar one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iUZlNZE-2vR	2025-02-23T16:50:57-08:00	
Germany Swings Right As Merz’s Christian Democrats Projected To W...	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour and Owen Morgan and Victoria Becker (EurActiv) -- Germany’s centre-right recorded a clear victory in Sunday’s national elections, according to early projections, heralding a substantial political shift in Europe’s largest country and clearing the way for Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats, to become Germany’s next chancellor, replacing Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats. Early projections put Merz‘s centre-right bloc, which also includes the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), at 29%, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 21 % and the Social Democrats (SPD) at 17%. The Greens won about 12%, the Left 9%, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) 4.5%, and the leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance 4.9%, according to the projections. The preliminary result signaled a substantial shift to the right in Germany's electorate since 2021, with the centre-right bloc and AfD recording a collective 48.5%, a massive jump from 34.5%. Given that Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, however, the prospect of a coalition between the two is slim. It was unclear late on Sunday whether the BSW would make it past the electoral threshold of 5%, which is required to gain parliamentary representation. Barring a substantial shift in the results, the process of crafting a coalition promises to be fraught, with the early returns suggesting Merz may need two partners to build a majority in parliament, most likely with the SPD and the Greens. 'It's now about creating a government that is capable of acting as soon as possible with a solid parliamentary majority,' Merz said. 'The world out there isn't waiting for Germany, and it isn't waiting for long-winding coalition talks in negotiations.' 'Rambo zambo' If confirmed, the results would be worst in the SPD's more than 100-year history, while also marking the first time since the World War Two that the Christian Democrats and SPD did not take the first two places in a national election. The projected centre-right win marks dramatic personal victory for Merz, who had all but abandoned his aspirations of becoming chancellor more than 20 years ago after his then-rival, Angela Merkel, outmanoeuvered him for the party leadership. Much to Merkel's chagrin, Merz returned to the head of the party in 2022 after two unsuccessful bids for the party leadership in 2018 and 2021. 'Now is the time for rambo zambo at the Adenauer House,' a triumphant Merz told supporters at the Adenauer House, the Christian Democrats party headquarters in Berlin. 'Tonight we'll celebrate, and from tomorrow we'll get to work.' For Scholz, there was little to celebrate. The chancellor and former finance minister, whose ascent other the chancellorship in 2021 suprised many, led the party to its worst national election result since 1887. He proved incapable of reining his fractious three-party coalition, however, and was ultimately forced to trigger its collapse in November, a year before the end off its term. 'This is a bitter result for the Social Democratic party, it is also a defeat – it needs to be said loud and clear,' said Scholz, who signalled he would step away from the limelight. Supporters were dead silent in the party’s headquarters when the SPD result was announced. 'A win for Europe' Merz said during the election night Elefantenrunde roundtable talkshow of top candidates that he hoped to form a new government by Easter, and that he wants to talk 'properly' to the Social Democrats after a tough exchange of blows on the campaign trail. On multiple occasions, he ruled out entering into a coalition with the AfD. As majorities remained uncertain, officials feared that prolonged negotiations over a future government could spell trouble for Europe amid global upheaval. 'The world is not waiting for us. Europe is waiting for us, for Germany, to take on a stronger leadership role again,' Merz said. Merz, who is a keen transatlanticist, added that Europe should prioritise agreeing on a united position on the US's negotiations with Russia on Ukraine. 'For me, it will be an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,' he stressed, noting that 'the Americans, at least this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.' The CDU's leader in the European Parliament, Daniel Caspary, hailed the victory as a win for Europe. 'The largest European country, in the heart of Europe, is now back on track,' Caspary told Euractiv. Christian Lindner, the former finance minister whose departure from government hastened the collapse of Scholz's coalition government, announced his resignation after the FDP failed to reach the 5% minimum threshold for seats in parliament. Asked if his Greens would approach the CDU over a possible coalition, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck suggested it was Merz's prerogative to initiate those discussions. But he also made clear the Greens were willing to join a coalition. 'This is the only possibility,' Habeck told ZDF public television. 'One has to let it sink in what this result means: We are in a very difficult situation.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7jwEB3BCQvc6	2025-02-23T16:46:09-08:00	
Zelenskyy Willing To Step Down As President To Secure Ukraine Pea...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is ready to give up his position to bring peace, saying it could be in exchange for his country joining NATO. Zelenskyy was speaking on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, amid mounting pressure from Washington to engage in peace talks. 'If there is peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready.... I can exchange it for NATO,' Zelenskyy told a press conference in Kyiv, adding he would depart 'immediately' if necessary. Following a bruising week in which he had a public rift with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, Zelenskyy also said he wanted Trump to visit Ukraine and that he was 'grateful' for American support during the war. 'I want very much mutual understanding with Trump,' Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' However, Zelenskyy also questioned a figure of $500 billion in U.S. support quoted by Trump, saying the real figure was closer to $100 billion. He said he would not recognize previous U.S. grants as loans. Transatlantic Cracks His comments come amid concerns of cracks in the transatlantic alliance as Washington held high-level direct talks with Moscow. In the past week, U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Zelenskyy and suggested he was responsible for starting the conflict -- although he later walked back these comments in an interview on Fox News radio, stating Zelenskyy should not have allowed Russia to attack. Zelenskyy, for his part, had caused anger in Washington by stating that Trump lived in 'a disinformation bubble.' Trump has also suggested Zelenskyy might not be needed in peace talks and called for access to Ukrainian mineral wealth as compensation for U.S. aid provided so far. Trump aide Steve Witkoff told CNN on February 23 that he expected the deal to be signed this week. Zelenskyy said it needed to include security guarantees for Ukraine, and that a deployment of U.S. troops in his country would be logical. European Diplomacy European leaders have joined Zelenskyy in voicing fears over the dangers of Western disunity -- and of their countries being left out of talks on ending the war. While other Western leaders head to Kyiv on February 24, French President Emmanuel Macron will fly in the opposite direction for talks with Trump in Washington. He'll be followed later in the week by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Both men will seek to find common ground with Trump on next steps. 'Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue. Nobody, least of all the Ukrainians,' Starmer told a party conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 23. 'But after everything that they have suffered, after everything that they have fought for, there could be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term secure future.' Starmer repeated his pledge that Britain would be prepared to provide boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders have held hastily convened discussions on the subject in recent days in another reflection of their concern that Washington is cooling on further support. In a further sign of support for Kyiv, British Foreign Secretary Daniel Lammy said on February 23 that his country would announce its largest package of sanctions on Russia to coincide with the three-year anniversary. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in messianic terms to justify his invasion of Ukraine, on the eve of the third anniversary of his forces' full-scale assault. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so,' he said at an event in Moscow on February 23 with soldiers who fought in Ukraine. This is not the first time Putin has used such language to justify Russia's aggression against Ukraine. In 2014, he defended his country's illegal seizure of Crimea by saying the peninsula had a 'sacred meaning' for Russia, comparing it to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities reported their country had come under its largest-ever drone attack from Russia overnight on February 22-23. Reports of casualties were gradually coming in from across the nation. The attacks further underlined Ukraine's vulnerabilities as well as its reliance on U.S. military assistance. Speaking to Current Time in recent days, military analysts said air defense was a key area where Kyiv relied on Washington. 'All other [military supplies] can be found in Europe. In some way, European help can replace American help. But air defense -- this is the key area,' said Oleksiy Alshanskiy from Conflict Intelligence Team.

Hezbollah Can Rebuild And It Will Be Disastrous For Lebanon – Ana...	By Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib As expected, Israel refused to fully withdraw from Lebanon on Feb. 18, leaving its forces in five border areas. Maintaining the occupation in this way is exactly the breath of life Hezbollah needs to revive itself.On Feb. 23, Hezbollah held the funeral of its secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27 last year. The funeral was an occasion for the group to show it still commanded strong support among the Shiite community.Wafiq Safa, the official in charge of the group’s coordination and liaison unit, said a few weeks ago that Hezbollah would emerge stronger than it was before. He could be right. It was born out of the grievances caused by the Israeli invasion in 1982. Now, Israel has created enough hatred and pain to give the group exactly the boost it needs to rebuild itself.Prior to withdrawing from the areas they did leave, Israeli forces made sure to burn the houses they had not already destroyed. Towns close to the border, such as Kfar Kela, were razed to the ground.Southern Lebanon is an agrarian society; the people there make a living from the crops they farm. Israel bombed the south with phosphorus bombs to ensure those people would no longer be able to cultivate their land.Israeli authorities are attempting to create an undeclared 'no-man’s land,' a buffer zone along the border with Lebanon. They hope that because of all the destruction, people will be discouraged from returning home. Through this buffer zone and control of five strategic points along the border, Israel thinks it can guarantee the security of its settlements in Galilee.In addition, the Israelis think that their presence within Lebanese borders means they will be able to move freely there and target anyone they want. A few days ago, for example, Israeli forces carried out a drone attack in Saida in which they assassinated a Hamas operative. Their reconnaissance and surveillance drones and planes can breach and roam Lebanese airspace as they please. From time to time, they fly at low altitude and break the sound barrier, creating fear and anxiety among the Lebanese people.Why would they not? Israeli authorities see no restrictions on their actions. They can do whatever they want. They broke all international laws in Gaza and faced no repercussions, so why not in Lebanon?However, the Israelis underestimate the urge this is fueling among the Lebanese to fight back, especially among Shiites, whose homes and land have been devastated. This is something Hezbollah, weakened as it is, can use to its advantage.To fully understand the group’s fall, one should understand its rise. Hezbollah was created out of a need to fight an Israeli occupation. It evolved from small, random groups into a formidable, well-organized guerrilla force that could spread fear among the generals in Tel Aviv. Of course, its creation came three years after the Iranian revolution, and directly after the Israeli invasion of Beirut. The rise of Hezbollah was considered the first export of Iran’s revolution to the Arab world and it was successful mainly because of the indigenous need to fight the Israeli occupation. After Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah lost its raison d’etre as a resistance organization. Following the withdrawal of Syrian forces in 2005, the group entered politics. Its members felt they had to because they had lost their Syrian sponsor. Political power represented a tool with which to protect their arms; they did not want a government in place they could not control, which might ask them to disarm in compliance with 2004’s UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and the 1989 Taif Agreement that ended the civil war in Lebanon.In 2008, Hezbollah tightened its grip on the government through the Doha agreement, signed on May 21 that year, which was designed to end an 18-month political crisis during which the weapons the group had been pointing at the Israelis were turned on their fellow Lebanese.On May 7, 2008, Hezbollah had taken Beirut by force. It became part of the country’s corrupt political structure. The arms that had been protecting Lebanon from Israeli aggression were now the main protectors of the political elite and their corruption.The more the group’s legitimacy was eroded, the more brutal it became, domestically. It suppressed dissent, whether through assassinations or by crushing the public protests that erupted in 2019, demanding the dismantling of a corrupt political system.The group had morphed from a clean resistance organization comprising a tight-knit group of dedicated people to a more mafia-like structure. It became involved in drug production and trafficking along with the Assad family. It started to become a conglomerate inside Lebanon. It owned a bank and various businesses. Somehow it began to mimic the corrupt Lebanese political system, and became its main patron.As it expanded in the region, however, Hezbollah made too many enemies. While the group enjoyed some degree of Arab acquiescence while fighting Israel, it lost whatever legitimacy it had in the Arab world when it entered Syria and acted like a proxy of Iran as part of the latter’s quest for regional domination.The Israeli attack on Hezbollah last year using booby-trapped pagers and other communication devices, and the wider recent war on Lebanon, were a wake-up call for the group and its surviving leaders. They realized they had overstretched themselves by interfering in other countries in the region.The only way for Hezbollah to rebuild itself, then, is to return to its origins as an armed resistance to an Israeli occupation. The grievances in southern Lebanon are strong enough to fuel this project.Wafiq Safa was not entirely wrong, therefore, when he predicted that Hezbollah would eventually emerge stronger than it was before. However, this would be a very dangerous development as it would lead to another war. The authorities in Israel at present are unhinged, buttressed by a permissive administration in the US. This means that if any resistance does arise, the response from the Israelis will be extremely destructive to Lebanon.The US should be wise enough to realize that the continuing presence of Israeli forces in Lebanon, and their operations there with the aim of killing every member of Hezbollah, will only strengthen the group in the long run.For the sake of stability, Israel must withdraw and the Lebanese state must be strengthened. If this is done, Hezbollah will eventually be decommissioned as an armed movement. • Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in US-Arab relations with a focus on lobbying.

Washington, Kyiv Headed Toward Deal For Ukrainian ‘Critical Miner...	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal and said he wants better financial terms. 'I don’t want something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,' he said. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelenskyy said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7kx3cU0zDwjT	2025-02-23T16:29:43-08:00	
Freedom For Secular Thought Still Eludes Bangladesh, A Decade Aft...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury The climate for freedom of secular thought in Bangladesh remains bleak a decade after religious zealots murdered blogger Avijit Roy as he left a literary festival in Dhaka, family members, researchers and human rights advocates said. The killing of the Bangladeshi-born American citizen in February 2015 was the first in a spate of murders of secular writers and intellectuals at the hands of Muslim extremists that year and in 2016. 'The current atmosphere for secular thought in Bangladesh is absent. Ten years ago, the condition for secular thoughts was very bad,' Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq, a retired professor at Dhaka University, told BenarNews. 'Blogger Avijit Roy was killed for promoting secular thoughts, my son Dipan was killed for publishing his book. What fault did they have,' Kashem said, referring to his son, Faisal Arefin Dipan, who was fatally attacked in October 2015. Ten years on, the South Asian country is still unsafe for the secular community because the threat from violent extremism remains alive despite last year’s fall of the authoritarian government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, according to observers. It had cracked down hard on Islamic militants by launching a deadly counter-terrorism campaign in July 2016, in the wake of an overnight siege of the Holey Artisan café in Dhaka, where 24 people, many of them foreigners, were slaughtered by Muslim extremists. But the Hasina government executed a 'wrong' policy of countering militancy and terrorism that did not root out the problem, according to one researcher. 'During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, the law enforcement agencies conducted operations to kill militants and extremists to get applause, cash incentives and awards from the government,' Abul Kalam Azad told BenarNews. Since Bangladesh’s independence in the early 1970s, some leftist politicians and controversial intellectuals had attacked faith-based parties through anti-religion books and comments while propagating secularism, making the term 'secular' controversial, according to Kashem, Dipan’s father. 'Their anti-religion postures put the faith-based parties in existential threat. As a means of survival, those parties propagated secularism as anti-religion,' Kashem said. He noted that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father who was Bangladesh’s founding leader and had led the independence movement to break away from Pakistan, defined secularism as a system where the state would not be a party to any religion. 'But the idea was not popularized,' Kashem said. 'Now, pro-Islamic parties dominate the political landscape,' he said. ‘Situation has deteriorated further’ On the night of Feb. 26, 2015, extremists who were later sentenced to death, fatally hacked with machetes Roy as he was exiting the Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka. Roy had written books about freedom of secular thoughts and freedom of expression. His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, was seriously injured in the attack. On Oct. 31, 2015, extremists killed Dipan, owner of the publishing house Jagriti where Roy’s books were printed. 'Definitely, the previous atmosphere was not conducive to freedom of secular thought and freedom of expression. But the situation has deteriorated further and now it has reached a dangerous level,' Anujit Roy, Avijit’s brother, told BenarNews. Anujit Roy said he did not know if any organization would mark the 10th anniversary because of security concerns. 'If not, then we the family members will observe his death anniversary at our house,' he said, noting that fears of violence had intensified since Hasina lost power. No support for secularism Maulana Mohiuddin Rabbani, a vice president of Hefazat-e-Islam, a conservative Islamic group, told BenarNews that religion was needed in Bangladesh. 'Secularism was imported to Bangladesh from India. But we don’t support or promote secularism. We believe that as the majority of Bangladesh are Muslims, the state religion must be Islam,' he said. 'But people from all religions can practice their respective religions as guaranteed by Islam,' Rabbani said. In recent months since an interim government took office in Bangladesh, religious zealots have obstructed several traditional cultural activities across the country. In late January, Islamists vandalized the venue hosting a female football match in Tilakpur, a sub-district in northern Joypurhat. Islamists were blamed for vandalizing a book stall on Feb. 10, during the month-long Ekushey Book Fair, for displaying a book of exiled Bangladeshi secular writer Taslima Nasrin. The Islamists alleged the book promoted atheism. Three days later, Sohel Hasan Galib was arrested and sent to jail for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through his poetry. On Feb. 12, zealots forced organizers to postpone the death anniversary of mystic poet Lalon in Modhupur, in Tangail district. A group in Bhuapur, in the same district, vandalized shops selling flowers for a spring festival on Feb. 15, leading organizers to scrap a scheduled kite festival in adjacent Gopalpur subdistrict. How Hasina handled militants Kalam Azad, the researcher and co-author of the first book on female militants in Bangladesh, said that the government under Hasina had wrongly accused many people of militancy. 'In my research, I found at least 50% of the alleged male and one-third of female militants were innocent victims. They were falsely implicated in terrorism charges with ill motives,' he told BenarNews. 'After Hasina’s fall, some groups have been trying to propagate that all alleged militants and extremists were innocent. But this is also not true,' Azad said. The researcher noted that people were panicking. 'I think the atmosphere for freedom of expression, freedom of thought and secular thought is not conducive right now due to existing bad political conditions,' he said. A former police inspector-general noted that the strategy for countering terrorism and violent extremism was flawed during Hasina’s tenure. 'The alleged militants were killed or arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without following proper judicial procedure,' Nur Mohammad told BenarNews. 'After the fall of her government, alleged militants or extremists were released,' he said. 'Now the question is whether we are free from the threat of violent extremism. The answer is, if there is no patronization, the idea will meet a natural death.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said there was no room for violent extremism, adding that the government had anti-terrorism, counter terrorism, transnational crime units and other agencies working to counter violent extremism. 'We believe Bangladesh must have an atmosphere where both secular or non-secular people can express their opinion without any fear or persecution. At present, people can express their views without any fear. We want to establish a truly inclusive society free from fear and prejudice,' Shafiqul Alam told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7k3v2dZmQm4T	2025-02-23T16:26:19-08:00	
Pentagon Tells Gold Star Families: We’ll Find Loved Ones, Bring T...	By C. Todd Lopez In Sacramento, California, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency on Saturday held the largest-ever family member update in its history. More than 500 Gold Star families attended to learn how the agency is proceeding in efforts to repatriate the remains of service members who never returned home from the Vietnam War, the Korean War or World War II. Around the nation, the DPAA holds several family updates each year so the families of service members who went missing in action can meet with officials one-on-one to discuss the details of their cases. Since 1995, DPAA has conducted these family updates, reaching more than 31,000 family members through face-to-face meetings. Nearly 82,000 service members still remain unaccounted for from conflicts dating back to World War II. According to DPAA, 71,981 service members are missing from World War II, 7,444 are missing from the Korean War, 1,573 are missing from the Vietnam War, and 126 are missing from the Cold War. Finding those service members and bringing them home is the sacred duty of the DPAA, said Fern Sumpter Winbush, the principal deputy director of DPAA. 'Not only is this mission a sacred obligation, but it's a moral imperative,' she told families. 'The agency exists because there are unaccounted for ... there are men and women who gave their ultimate all. We serve the families because you are the ones that are still here. You are relying on us because we're the only ones that are doing this mission. We'll continue to put [the] mission first. We're not going to accept defeat. We'll never quit, and we're never going to leave a comrade behind.' Winbush told family members that the DPAA mission would take recovery operations to 33 territories and countries this year. The ability to do that requires building relationships with nations around the world to earn the trust needed to gain access. It's something she said the agency will continue to work on. Right now, she said, there are 10 ongoing missions in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. Winbush also stressed to families in attendance the importance of getting family member DNA on file. 'We can't make an identification unless we have something to compare it to,' she said. 'For many of the unaccounted-for, we don't have the proper family reference samples on file. This is one way we work to collect them.' Also, she noted the number of young people attending the family member update and stressed how important it is that families keep other family members aware that a family member who served overseas never returned home and that the DPAA is still looking for them. 'We need third, fourth, and even fifth-generation families to stay on top of their loved one's loss,' Winbush said. 'We don't forget ... we have all of the records. But it's critically important that you stay on top of it so that the story can continue to be told.' She said it's common for DPAA to call families with a notification that a loved one has been found, only to find that some families were unaware or don't believe what they are being told. 'They don't know this mission exists,' she said. 'They don't believe that we're still searching for their great, great uncle [or] father ... from World War II,' she said. 'We've got to keep all of the families involved.' As part of the family member update, the DPAA also unveiled its annual poster, which will be used later this year to commemorate National POW/MIA Recognition Day, Sept. 19, 2025. This year's poster was created by artist Jeannie Huffman, the daughter of Navy Cmdr. Edward James Jacobs Jr., a Vietnam War pilot who never came home. He went missing Aug. 25, 1967, while piloting an RA-3B Skywarrior aircraft over the Gulf of Tonkin in North Vietnam. When her father left for Vietnam, Huffman was only two weeks old. She was just five months old when her mother learned her father went missing. She said her father had been able to hold her as an infant before he deployed for the war, but there's no record of that for her to look at today. 'One thing that kind of bothers me ... I have no photos of that,' she said. 'I wish I had a picture of him and me, and I don't.' Back in 2018, Huffman attended her first DPAA family member update in Greensboro, North Carolina. There was not a lot of information then about recovery efforts for her father, and this was because her father had been put into a non-recoverable status. Huffman's husband, Dave, explained what had happened. 'In 1993, when previous iterations of what's now the DPAA [were] charged with the mission, there was an order that came out to try to touch as many sites as possible,' he said. 'They got in a boat and went out to the grid coordinates of the last known location of the airplane and said there's no visible wreckage.' That finding resulted in Jacobs and the crewmen he was with being deemed unrecoverable — which stood until January 2024. However, the two did their own research and were later able to convince DPAA to begin anew in an effort to find Jeannie Huffman's father. 'We had a meeting with the DPAA in Washington, D.C., and we presented our research and investigation to them in November of 2023, and they revisited his case, and now his case and the two crewmen that were with him have all been changed from non-recoverable to active pursuit,' Dave Huffman said. This year's DPAA annual poster is not Jeannie Huffman's first for the agency. However, it is the first time one of her works will be used as part of the agency's official National POW/MIA Recognition Day commemoration. On the poster are five service members — four men and one woman — representing each service and the conflicts from which there remain service members who have not come home. 'It was important to capture all the conflicts of the POW/MIAs,' she said. Another aspect of the poster is that each individual photographed, representing each service and each conflict, is wearing period uniforms and gear. 'I believe that each of our missing is still seeking their way home, and they expect that our nation's promise will be kept, which is to bring them home,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7oN6RhcI9w8F	2025-02-23T16:23:12-08:00	
Iranian Officials Meet Lebanon’s President In Beirut	The parliament speaker and the foreign minister of Iran had a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in Beirut on Sunday. Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi have traveled to Beirut to take part in the funeral of the late leaders of Hezbollah, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah and Seyed Hashem Safieddine. The two Iranian officials held a meeting with Lebanese President Aoun and Foreign Minister Youssef Rajji at Baabda Palace, the official residence of the president of Lebanon, on Sunday morning. Lebanon is holding the funeral of former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli air strike. The event is held at the Camille Chamoun sports stadium on the outskirts of Beirut. He will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby. Nasrallah was killed on September 27 in an Israeli air strike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The funeral also honors Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for one week after Nasrallah’s death before he was also killed in an Israeli attack. He will be buried separately in the south on Monday	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7v3axTY5jW56	2025-02-23T16:18:07-08:00	
Indonesia’s Secret Weapon For Korean Peace: Lessons From Cambodia...	Indonesia has long been recognized for its diplomatic finesse and commitment to non-alignment principles that have shaped its foreign policy since independence. With a 'Free Active' approach Indonesia has consistently advocated for peaceful conflict and resolution earning neutrality credibility on the international stage. The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most geopolitical persistent conflicts in modern history marked by divisions ideological military tensions and nuclear proliferation concerns. Although Indonesia is not primarily a mediator, its balanced diplomatic engagement in multilateral forums and its historical experience in peace facilitation position it as a promising facilitator of peace. This essay argues that Indonesia’s diplomatic engagement has informed Cambodians about a model of dialogue, which includes the China-South China Sea approach to building confidence measures. This model offers a viable path for fostering reconciliation and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Indonesia has maintained diplomatic relations with North Korea since 1964 and with South Korea since 1973. This dual engagement allows Indonesia to facilitate open channels of communication between both nations. Unlike major global powers that often take a more partisan stance, Indonesia's neutrality allows it to be perceived as an honest broker. This balanced approach aligns with the Cambodian conflict model of resolution where reconciliation was achieved through inclusive dialogue involving multiple factions. The Cambodian model emphasizes the integration of adversarial actors into a structured peace process that Indonesia could advocate for Koreans in negotiations. Indonesia has played an active role in multilateral diplomacy, particularly within ASEAN. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) serves as a platform for regional dialogue, with North Korea participating in its discussions. The 2023 ASEAN Summit highlighted security concerns, indirectly addressing the stability of the Korean Peninsula. ASEAN’s approach to dispute resolution, especially in the South China Sea, offers a useful model for Indonesia's role regarding Korea. The Sea China model is a confidence measures reduction risk and strategies engagement that could be applied to the Korean peninsula. The development of a security multilateral mechanism similar to ASEAN initiatives in the China-South Sea facilitates sustained engagement between North and South Korea. Indonesia also supports the United Nations resolutions for denuclearization, promoting peace, and encouraging solutions. Although Indonesia has not directly been involved in peacekeeping efforts on the Korean Peninsula its broader commitment to international security aligns with UN objectives leveraging these multilateral platforms Indonesia can promote dialogue and de-escalation efforts. Economic and cultural diplomacy are also critical components of Indonesia's approach. While Indonesia is a major economic partner of South Korea, its minimal trade with North Korea enables it to maintain a neutral stance. Rather than exerting economic pressure, Indonesia focuses on engagement policies. Track II diplomacy, including academic collaborations and cultural exchanges, fosters informal connections that contribute to long-term trust-building. Scholarships for North Korean students and academic exchanges foster connections among individuals, similar to the grassroots reconciliation efforts observed in the Cambodian model. Historically Indonesia has demonstrated its ability to host international dialogues such as the 1955 Conference Bandung and Jakarta Informal Meetings. These suggest precedents in Indonesia that served as neutral venues for Korean peace talks. In Cambodia, neutral venues played a significant role in ensuring inclusive participation among conflicting parties. Applying this strategy to Korea and Indonesia could create an environment in the North where South Korea can engage in direct discussions and influence the majority of global powers. Despite potential Indonesia significantly faces challenges facilitating peace on the Korean Peninsula as follows: 1. Geopolitical Complexities: The Korean Peninsula is heavily influenced by global superpowers particularly the United States and China. Both nations have strategic interests in the region and their involvement complicates independence diplomatic efforts. Indonesia must navigate geopolitical intricacies carefully to maintain neutrality encouraging constructive dialogue. 2 . North Korea’s Isolation: North Korea remains highly isolated economically and sanctions self-reliance. While Indonesia maintains diplomatic ties with Pyongyang the Korean North leadership's reluctance to engage externally in dialogue poses significant barriers. 3. Lack of Leverage: China, unlike the U.S., lacks direct economic or military leverage over the two Koreas. Its influence is primarily diplomatic, which may limit its ability to advocate for substantial policy changes. 4. Concerns about Security Trust and Deficit: Both Koreas have deep distrust rooted toward external mediators. While Indonesia's neutrality is an asset, engaging North and South Korea in Indonesia-led initiatives remains challenging. Additionally, regional security concerns, such as North Korea's nuclear program, complicate the situation further. To address these challenges, Indonesia must integrate strategies modeled after those of Cambodia and the South China Sea : 1. Establishing a Neutral Dialogue Platform: Drawing from the Cambodian model, Indonesia could advocate for an inclusive dialogue mechanism in which regional stakeholders and international players participate in structured negotiations. 2. Confidence Expanding-Building Measures: Inspired by the South Sea China model Indonesia could push for ASEAN-led initiatives such as joint crisis communication hotlines security systems and risk reduction exercises between North and South Korea. 3. Track Strengthening II Diplomacy: Expanding cultural exchanges, joint economic initiatives and educational programs gradually lay the groundwork for reconciliation. Trust Building through societal engagement will formally complement efforts diplomatic. 4. Utilizing Multilateral Leverage: Indonesia should continue leveraging the role of ASEAN and the UN to encourage sustained diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula. Supporting regional security frameworks advocating peace for talks in international forums will enhance Indonesia's credibility. Indonesia’s nuanced approach to diplomacy is rooted in its'Free and Active' policies, which establish it as a credible facilitator for peace on the Korean Peninsula. By drawing on the lessons of the Cambodian model—which emphasizes dialogue inclusive—and the China South Sea model—which focuses on confidence building—Indonesia can contribute to conflict resolution efforts. While geopolitical challenges and North Korea's isolation pose security concerns and obstacles to Indonesia's diplomatic engagement and multilateral influence, Indonesia's historical role as a neutral mediator provides a solid foundation for peace efforts. Though Indonesia is not a primary mediator, its strategic engagement with ASEAN and experience in dialogue facilitation with the UN make it a key player in promoting stability and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. By integrating proven diplomatic frameworks, Indonesia can help bridge trust, foster collaboration, and contribute to a long-term resolution of one of the world's enduring conflicts.

Friendship Or Foreign Meddling? Trump’s $21 Million Bombshell Exp...	It began as vintage Trump: red-meat rhetoric, swaggering boasts, the electric thrum of a comeback tour. But in a single incendiary swipe, the former president detonated a geopolitical grenade. Speaking at a rally last week, Trump alleged that USAID—the U.S. government’s global aid arm—had quietly funnelled $21 million to India’s election machinery under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his self-proclaimed 'friend.' The claim, precise and pointed, ripped the lid off a Pandora’s box long sealed by diplomatic decorum. For the first time, Trump tethered Modi’s name to America’s shadowy election-finance labyrinth, casting Washington not as a watchdog of democracy but as an alleged architect of its manipulation. As outrage erupted across continents, the revelation laid bare a chilling paradox: in an age where foreign interference is a political death sentence, the U.S. now stands accused of pulling the strings—and Trump, the disruptor-in-chief, is holding the knife that slit the secrets open. The Forensic Breakdown: Trump’s Words, Modi’s Silence Trump’s statement, delivered at the Governor’s Working Association meeting, was not a mere off-the-cuff remark. It was a calculated disclosure, one that thrust Modi’s government into an unwelcome spotlight. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) called the claims 'deeply troubling.' The opposition Congress Party demanded a white paper detailing all USAID funds received under Modi’s tenure. Yet, Modi himself—India’s master orator, a leader who thrives on control over his image—has chosen to remain silent. Instead, the BJP and its media ecosystem scrambled to spin the narrative. First, they claimed vindication—that Trump’s comments proved foreign powers had conspired to meddle in India’s 2024 general election, a frequent BJP talking point. But Trump’s follow-up remarks shredded that defense. The money, he clarified, went to Modi. That revelation turned the tables, forcing Modi’s government into damage-control mode. A Pattern of Political Convenience This moment is not happening in isolation. The Modi government has repeatedly painted itself as a bulwark against Western influence, framing any external criticism as a neo-colonial attack on India’s sovereignty. Yet, it has gladly courted U.S. and European support when it suits its agenda—whether in trade, defense, or, as Trump’s comments suggest, electoral strategy. The USAID funding, as per Trump’s disclosure, was part of a broader $486 million package meant for 'election strengthening' worldwide. India’s $21 million slice was ostensibly aimed at increasing voter turnout—an anodyne phrase that now demands forensic scrutiny. Which voters? In which regions? And crucially, under whose directives? The Opposition Strikes Back The Congress Party, long accused by the BJP of appeasing the West, has seized on this scandal as proof of the Modi government’s double standards. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera framed it with brutal clarity: 'This is a matter between two ‘friends.’ But one ‘friend’ has betrayed another. Modiji, you owe a response to the country. Did you or did you not take $21 million from the U.S. to influence the elections in India?' This is not just rhetorical posturing. The implications are seismic. If U.S. funding was leveraged to influence voter behavior in India, it raises ethical and legal questions of staggering proportions. It also punctures the BJP’s long-standing claim of being the sole custodian of India’s nationalistic pride. USAID: A Benevolent Front or a Political Tool? For decades, USAID has positioned itself as an instrument of democracy-building. But the realpolitik of foreign aid is rarely that simple. Governments receiving aid often direct those funds toward programs that solidify their own political standing. And donor governments—especially the United States—have long wielded aid as a tool of influence, ensuring that recipient regimes remain aligned with their strategic interests. In this case, the 'voter turnout' initiative may well have been crafted with the noblest democratic intentions. But democracy promotion becomes suspect when it is selectively beneficial to one ruling party over another. This is precisely the charge now haunting Modi’s government. The Deafening Silence in Washington and Delhi Trump’s comments have forced both governments into an uneasy quiet. The Trump administration has refrained from commenting, wary of stepping into a controversy that could affect U.S.-India relations. In India, the silence from the ruling party is even more telling. For a leader who rarely misses an opportunity to shape the public discourse, Modi’s refusal to address the allegations suggests a crisis his government is still struggling to contain. Meanwhile, investigative reports have begun surfacing, suggesting that the $21 million in question may have actually been allocated for election-related programs in Bangladesh, not India. This raises a separate, but equally troubling, question: Was Trump misinformed, or was he deliberately misleading his audience? If the latter, what was his motive? Was this an attempt to entangle Modi in controversy as an implicit bargaining chip for future negotiations? The Real Stakes: India’s Democratic Integrity At its core, this controversy is about far more than just one funding allocation. It’s about the integrity of India’s democracy. If the Modi government knowingly accepted external funds for election-related activities, it shatters the myth that India’s electoral process is invulnerable to foreign influence. If the funds were used to engineer favorable voter turnout, it amounts to nothing less than a manipulation of democratic will. The opposition’s demand for a white paper is not just political theatre—it’s a necessary step toward transparency. India’s voters deserve to know whether their democracy was subtly, insidiously, influenced by external forces. They also deserve to know why their prime minister has refused to confront this issue head-on. The Final Reckoning Trump’s remarks have ignited a fire that neither Washington nor New Delhi can easily extinguish. The Modi government, which has built its brand on self-reliance and nationalist pride, now faces a credibility crisis of its own making. The BJP’s silence will not hold forever. Sooner or later, Modi will have to answer: Did he or did he not benefit from $21 million in U.S. funding for voter turnout? For now, the silence is deafening. But in politics, silence is rarely a sign of strength. More often, it is the prelude to a reckoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iiSojihFiHN	2025-02-23T16:02:39-08:00	
Before The Storm: How Microgrids Can Future-Proof Our Power Suppl...	When you want to buy an apartment, you are very concerned about the quality of tiles on the floor, the quality of plumbing, the quality of fixtures in the bathrooms, the quality of the appliances in the kitchen. But how many people ask whether this building adheres to the latest seismic safety codes?,' notes Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). His point is clear: we often overlook critical resilience factors in infrastructure planning, yet as climate change drives more frequent and severe disasters, the consequences of such oversight are becoming increasingly dire. Recent findings from the UNDRR's Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction indicate a dramatic surge in the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters over the past two decades. Between 2000 and 2021, 83% of major power outages in the U.S. were due to extreme weather events, while globally, economic losses from disasters reached $2.97 trillion between 2010 and 2019. Moreover, extreme weather-related power disruptions increased by 78% between 2011 and 2021, underscoring the urgent need for resilient infrastructure. 'Extreme weather events that used to occur once in a century now happen every 20 years, and in a number of major disasters such as cyclones and earthquakes, we have seen that 40% of infrastructure damage is in the power sector, in the energy systems,' Kishore highlights. As the current power grid is not designed to withstand the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather 'we have to come up with plausible worst-case scenarios and develop preparedness planning according to those scenarios. This means that if you invest in infrastructure, you must also put aside money for its maintenance. If you don't do so, it comes back to haunt you'. In the event of extreme events such as cyclones or earthquakes, maintaining power supply is critical for emergency response and recovery efforts. According to Saeed Manshadi, Associate Professor at the College of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the San Diego State University, renewable energy sources and microgrids are already playing a crucial role in ensuring energy supply during natural disasters. 'Given that renewable energy sources are locally available, we can install local battery and solar as distributed energy resources to energize microgrids as building blocks for the future smart grid. Under national disaster scenarios, while most of the time distribution and transmission lines are down, microgrids enable self-sufficient and self-healing capabilities for the local grid.' Compared to traditional centralised grids, new generation microgrids are particularly effective in disaster-prone regions. 'Microgrids enable grids to locally supply mission-critical facilities under blackout conditions. If they are self-sustainable, meaning they have enough battery storage and renewable energy resources available, they can maintain essential services,' explains Manshadi. In areas vulnerable to hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, microgrids can prevent catastrophic power outages and allow communities to function autonomously until the main grid is restored. 'Think of a situation where you’re in a very hot zone, flooded with Wi-Fi disruptions, or hit by a hurricane, and the main grid fails. Microgrids provide localised control, allowing essential infrastructure — like hospitals and emergency shelters — to continue operating'. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of green microgrids as useful tools in disaster resilience, a number of technical obstacles must be overcome. The major is to deal with a century-old energy delivery system, based on AC (alternative current), while in order to maximise yield and not waste energy and money, renewable energy based microgrids must operate through DC (direct current). One of the most promising advances in resilient energy solutions is the development of hybrid microgrids, which integrate renewable energy sources with advanced power management technologies. Eduardo Garcia-Martinez, Technical Director of Tigon, a European project aimed at enhancing the reliability and resilience of decentralised renewables-based power systems, explains: 'If there is an issue with the external AC grid, our microgrid can operate autonomously by shutting down the AC connection. With integrated battery storage and renewable energy generation, it ensures continuity of supply even in case of a blackout'. A key breakthrough of this project is the implementation of a 3,000-volt DC voltage level. 'Most DC microgrids today operate from 700V to 1,500V. We are pushing the limits with 3,000V, which allows us to transfer more power with lower current, increasing efficiency while reducing material costs and the need for extensive copper wiring,' he highlights. Another solution developed within this EU-funded project is the integration of solid-state transformers (SST), which facilitate seamless energy conversion. 'The SSTs enable DC generation and DC loads to be integrated more efficiently, avoiding unnecessary AC-DC-AC conversions that waste energy,' García explains. This approach enhances grid efficiency and resilience by minimising energy loss and stabilizing decentralised networks— an essential step in mitigating disaster-induced power failures. 'We’ve already achieved the main milestone of generating 3,000V. Now we need to integrate photovoltaic generation, batteries, and interconnections with other DC microgrids to prove feasibility,' García notes. If successful, this could pave the way for widespread adoption of hybrid microgrids useful in climate disaster prevention. Kamal Kishore, who has been observing and addressing issues related with catastrophic events around the world for 30 years, adds: 'A microgrid is great in terms of its modularity, and hence, less interconnection. This modularity is a source of resilience, so investing in microgrids is essentially investing in local resilience'. Manshadi agrees: 'Microgrids can supply their own community within the boundaries and supply mission critical facilities under the blackout. Especially if they are self-sustainable'. But the benefits of microgrids extend beyond resilience. As Kishore points out, they also contribute to energy affordability: 'Green power generated by microgrids brings costs down. While technical challenges remain — such as storage capacity — over the lifecycle of energy infrastructure, the investment in renewables and decentralized grids makes eminent sense. A very attractive proposition, particularly in the context of renewables, where you produce energy locally, and you consume it locally'. Despite the promise of microgrids, major policy and financial hurdles remain. 'We need more policies supporting distributed energy resources,' Manshadi stresses. 'Utilities are already overwhelmed with disaster risk and decarbonisation mandates. Policymakers need to enable third-party entities to take part in the expansion of distributed energy solutions'. Kamal Kishore echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the need for long-term investment in resilience: 'We need greater public awareness, not just for efficient post-disaster responses, but to prevent risks from emerging in the first place'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7lHkdhQaoqJq	2025-02-23T15:59:53-08:00	
Democratic Republic Of Congo: Locals Call For Prayer As 70 Bodies...	By Sabrine Amboka Locals at a village in the embattled North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are appealing for prayers after approximately 70 bodies were found inside a church building in the village. Local sources contacted by Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International said the killings took place between Feb. 12 and Feb. 15 in Maiba, a village in the eastern region of the DRC. In a report that ACN published on Feb. 21, the sources said that on Feb. 12, rebels from an Islamist terrorist group, originally from Uganda, entered the village and took approximately 100 people hostage. The sources recounted that on Feb. 15, about 70 bodies were discovered inside a Protestant church. 'Many of them had been bound and some beheaded. Among the victims were women, children, and the elderly,' said the source, which ACN did not identify for fear of reprisals from the many armed groups that operate in the region. 'It is likely that these victims were unable to resist or endure the forced march, because when the rebels take hostages, they make them travel with them, either as reinforcements for their group or as forced labor for the war effort,' the source is quoted as telling ACN. According to the source, abductors force people to carry the loot after raiding villages. 'If you get tired on the way, you’re done,' the source told ACN. 'I believe that is what happened to these 70 people.' According to the same sources, the Maiba massacre was carried out by the armed Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which operates in Uganda and the DRC and has terrorized the local population for over a decade. 'The Islamic groups have stepped up their attacks and raids in remote villages, killing thousands of Congolese civilians. Before they used to be in other areas, but now it is Lubero which is being attacked,' the local source told ACN. The source shared that fear has gripped the village because the residents believe that the terrorists have local collaborators who facilitate their operations. This Maiba massacre comes at a very delicate time for the region, given the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, which have seen heavy terrorization by another armed group, the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels. Reportedly supported by neighboring Rwanda and the Congolese armed forces, the M23 has taken important cities and outposts in the region, including Goma and Bukavu, amid heavy fighting. ACN’s local sources have expressed fear that over the next few days, M23 will take Butembo, North Kivu’s second-largest city, as it did Goma and Bukavu. 'We are living through very, very difficult times. We are expecting the rebels to enter the city any moment now, as they are only 70 kilometers [about 44 miles] away from here. There is a lot of psychological suffering in Butembo, because the war is literally at our door. We have seen how other regions were overrun by chaos, and now it seems it is our turn,' the source is quoted as saying. The source concluded with a call for prayers, imploring: 'Let us pray. Prayer is what keeps our hope alive amidst this situation we are living through.' This story was first published by ACI Africa, CNA's news partner in Africa, and has been adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7qvOC380oLRX	2025-02-23T15:56:15-08:00	
Why GPT Can’t Think Like Us	Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models like GPT-4, has shown impressive performance on reasoning tasks. But does AI truly understand abstract concepts, or is it just mimicking patterns? A new study from the University of Amsterdam and the Santa Fe Institute reveals that while GPT models perform well on some analogy tasks, they fall short when the problems are altered, highlighting key weaknesses in AI’s reasoning capabilities. Analogical reasoning is the ability to draw a comparison between two different things based on their similarities in certain aspects. It is one of the most common methods by which human beings try to understand the world and make decisions. An example of analogical reasoning: cup is to coffee as soup is to ??? (the answer being: bowl) Large language models like GPT-4 perform well on various tests, including those requiring analogical reasoning. But can AI models truly engage in general, robust reasoning or do they over-rely on patterns from their training data? This study by language and AI experts Martha Lewis (Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam) and Melanie Mitchell (Santa Fe Institute) examined whether GPT models are as flexible and robust as humans in making analogies. ‘This is crucial, as AI is increasingly used for decision-making and problem-solving in the real world’, explains Lewis. Comparing AI models to human performance Lewis and Mitchell compared the performance of humans and GPT models on three different types of analogy problems: Letter sequences – Identifying patterns in letter sequences and completing them correctly. Digit matrices – Analyzing number patterns and determining the missing numbers. Story analogies – Understanding which of two stories best corresponds to a given example story. A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on variations In addition to testing whether GPT models could solve the original problems, the study examined how well they performed when the problems were subtly modified. ‘A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on these variations’, state the authors in their article. GPT models struggle with robustness Humans maintained high performance on most modified versions of the problems, but GPT models, while performing well on standard analogy problems, struggled with variations. ‘This suggests that AI models often reason less flexibly than humans and their reasoning is less about true abstract understanding and more about pattern matching’, explains Lewis. In digit matrices, GPT models showed a significant drop in performance when the position of the missing number changed. Humans had no difficulty with this. In story analogies, GPT-4 tended to select the first given answer as correct more often, whereas humans were not influenced by answer order. Additionally, GPT-4 struggled more than humans when key elements of a story were reworded, suggesting a reliance on surface-level similarities rather than deeper causal reasoning. On simpler analogy tasks, GPT models showed a decline in performance decline when tested on modified versions, while humans remained consistent. However, for more complex analogical reasoning tasks, both humans and AI struggled. Weaker than human cognition This research challenges the widespread assumption that AI models like GPT-4 can reason in the same way humans do. ‘While AI models demonstrate impressive capabilities, this does not mean they truly understand what they are doing’, conclude Lewis and Mitchell. ‘Their ability to generalize across variations is still significantly weaker than human cognition. GPT models often rely on superficial patterns rather than deep comprehension.’ This is a critical warning for the use of AI in important decision-making areas such as education, law, and healthcare. AI can be a powerful tool, but it is not yet a replacement for human thinking and reasoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7nLDoD_XO2aE	2025-02-23T15:52:43-08:00	
The Transformation Of Ukraine’s Arms Industry Amid War With Russi...	By Kateryna Kuzmuk and Lorenzo Scarazzato Three years on from Russia’s escalation of its war on Ukraine with the full-scale invasion, Ukraine faces mounting military challenges. At the same time, there is growing uncertainty about future military assistance from the United States under the Trump administration. This makes the question of Ukraine’s ability to supply its own military needs and its reliance on aid all the more pertinent. Since February 2022, Ukraine has relied heavily on foreign military aid for its defence against Russia. Its domestic arms industry has also been able to increase production and develop its capabilities significantly. In 2023 Ukraine’s largest arms producer, Joint-Stock Company Ukrainian Defense Industry (formerly UkrOboronProm), achieved a 69 per cent year-on-year increase in arms revenues to $2.2 billion—the fastest increase and highest revenues the company has ever recorded. As Ukraine seeks to rapidly strengthen and modernize its military capabilities amid the conflict, numerous smaller producers have appeared, along with emerging joint ventures with foreign companies, creating a more vibrant, diverse and innovative sector. This topical backgrounder examines how Ukraine’s arms industry has transformed during the Russia-Ukraine war. From the Soviet legacy to specialization Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited around 30 per cent of the Soviet arms industry, including both production capacity and research and development facilities. This legacy comprised around 700 enterprises with over 1 million employees, making it the most capable part of the newly independent Ukraine’s manufacturing sector. Ukraine’s inherited production base was particularly strong in manufacturing missiles, transport aircraft, tanks, surface ships, and both marine and aero engines. It also included facilities for the production of munitions, explosives, radar systems, communications equipment and military optical devices. Notable examples of arms producers included Pivdenmash, the producer of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, and Antonov, the company behind the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya, formerly the largest transport aircraft in the world. Despite this, Ukraine did not have anything approaching self-sufficiency in arms production. Before 1991, Ukraine’s arms industries had been integrated into a network spanning all Soviet republics, with the overwhelming majority of final arms production concentrated in Russia. Developing the missing capabilities within Ukraine would have required costly restructuring and investment, which the country, caught in a severe economic crisis, could not afford. At the same time, the shifting military-political environment made arms production less of a priority. Following the end of the cold war, many countries reduced their military expenditure and started converting parts of their military industrial capacity to civilian production, and Ukraine followed suit. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear missile capabilities and significantly reduce its arsenal of conventional weapons. Most of its military budget went to the basic upkeep of the armed forces, with only a small portion allocated to the maintenance and development of the arms industry. As a result, the number of arms-producing enterprises in Ukraine had already fallen by nearly two thirds to reach 267 by mid 1993, and continued to decline in the following years. With limited domestic investment and procurement budgets, Ukrainian arms producers turned to the export of modernized Soviet-era equipment, technology transfers and joint ventures. This approach helped the industry to maintain a degree of economic viability and to preserve some technological capabilities. Competitive pricing and the proven durability of its systems enabled Ukraine to secure new export markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. As a result, for nearly two decades after 1993, Ukraine nearly always ranked among the world’s top 15 arms exporters. The wake-up call of 2014 Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas region in 2014, there was an urgent need to strengthen Ukraine’s defensive capabilities. In response, the government began steadily increasing military spending. Where the military procurement budget in 2014 was $62 million, by 2021 it had increased 13 times over, reaching $836 million. While much of the procurement budget was spent on imports, a surge in domestic orders fueled an expansion of the Ukrainian arms industry. The industry was, however, still plagued by a culture of secrecy, clientelism and corruption—another legacy of Soviet times—which even after 2014 not only weakened Ukraine’s military capabilities and delayed the development of critical military systems but also deterred Western investors. These problems were especially prevalent within UkrOboronProm, the conglomerate that oversaw more than 100 state-owned companies and served as the primary supplier to Ukraine’s armed forces. It was not until 2020, under pressure from civil society and foreign governments and also driven by a growing willingness for political intervention, that Ukraine began reforming its arms industry to address widespread corruption and inefficiency. The reforms included the creation of a new Ministry of Strategic Industries, the introduction of more transparent arms procurement procedures, an overhaul of leadership in state institutions and state-owned arms companies, and the corporatization of enterpriseswithin UkrOboronProm. Despite some progress, particularly in leadership changes, many of the reforms stalled or remained unimplemented due to funding constraints and bureaucratic inertia. Problems in the state-owned industries also led to the rise of private arms companies, which often surpassed their state-owned competitors in production efficiency, innovation and adaptability to the military’s needs. In 2015, 25 per cent of state orders went to private companies. By 2020 this share had more than doubled to 54 per cent, whereas state enterprises received 36 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent were imports. The expansion of Ukraine’s arms industry after 2014, along with reform efforts and the rising role of the private sector, laid the groundwork for increased arms production and technological innovation in the years that followed. Adapting under fire Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 presented Ukraine’s evolving arms industry with a new set of challenges. Proximity to active combat zones and targeted attacks severely disrupted production at many factories. In the first two years of active hostilities, major arms producers suffered significant losses. According to a report by the Kyiv School of Economics assessing damage during the first two years of the war, engine manufacturer Motor Sich and aircraft producer Antonov alone reported damage amounting to a combined $601 million in industrial assets. As a result, companies were forced to adapt by relocating and restructuring production. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s arms industrial capacity recovered quickly as the country shifted to a wartime economy. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has allocated more than 50 per cent of government expenditures to the military, significantly increasing funding for its arms industry. By 2023, government spending on arms and dual-use goods surged to 20 times the 2021 level, reaching $30.8 billion. Although a substantial portion of the procurement budget went into purchasing weapons from abroad, Ukrainian arms companies were able to restore and even expand their production capabilities. By 2024, approximately 500 arms producers were reported to be operational in Ukraine, collectively employing nearly 300 000 people. In the past three years, Ukraine’s arms production capacity has grown not only in terms of volume but also of the range of military hardware that can be produced. This growth has been largely driven by the development of new technologies, as the scale and nature of the war have created a demand for military innovation. One of the most notable advancements has been in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), with Ukraine significantly increasing the number of domestically produced UAV models. Technological progress has been further accelerated by government initiatives, such as Brave1, a state-led platform that provides assistance to military technology developers and fosters collaboration between industry stakeholders. In just under two years since its launch, Brave1 has grown to support over 1500 military technology start-ups. Resilient but still reliant Thanks to coordinated efforts by Ukraine’s government, private sector and civil society, the Ukrainian arms industry has been able to rapidly modernize and grow in response to the war. Despite this, the industry is still hampered by outdated technology, financial constraints and inefficient spending. The Ukrainian war effort remains highly dependent on Western arms, whether provided as aid or imported on commercial terms. Since 2022 Ukraine has managed to start domestic production of certain types of weaponry that it has received hitherto from abroad, such as globally scarce artillery and tank ammunition. However, it is still a long way from being able to produce alternatives to all the imported systems it uses on the battlefield. A significant portion of procurement funds are thus spent on purchasing weapons from abroad, which does not facilitate the development of the domestic industry. To address this, Ukraine is striving to implement new production technologies through cooperation with partners. Arms producers from the United States and Europe have been increasing their presence in Ukraine, with companies such as Rheinmetall, KNDS and AeroVironment opening production facilities and forming joint ventures with Ukrainian producers. These collaborations not only help in the modernization of Ukraine’s arms industry but also accelerate the standardization of Ukrainian-made armaments to NATO requirements, advancing the country’s long-standing ambition of Euro-Atlantic integration. To further stimulate the development of its arms industry, Ukraine has managed to engage Western partners through special programmes aimed at financing its domestic arms production. While it is still short of its $10 billion objective, by 2024 Ukraine had raised over $1.5 billion for investment in its domestic arms industry from nine Western donor countries under a new programme called Zbroyari (armourers) Manufacturing Freedom. Partnerships with Western companies have also catalysed long-overdue reforms, with partners urging Ukraine to address corruption and inefficiency in its arms companies. A notable example is the ongoing corporatization of UkrOboronProm, including its transformation from a state conglomerate into a joint-stock company. The transformation includes a plan to introduce Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) corporate governance standards across the numerous state-run arms companies under its control, to enforce transparent management practices and make them increasingly attractive to foreign investments. The steps mentioned above are undoubtedly helping to develop and expand the Ukrainian arms industry, and thus to increase the country’s ability to supply its own military needs. However, at least in the short term, Ukraine will remain heavily reliant on military aid for its defence, making it vulnerable to the whims of its partners. In an unpredictable geopolitical landscape, Ukraine needs to reduce this reliance and build a resilient arms industry sector that can serve as much of the country’s military needs as possible. Recent developments seem to be heading in the right direction to achieve those ends: prioritizing innovation and technological advancement along with fostering a competitive, transparent market should help to create an environment that is more attractive to sustained foreign investment, ensuring that the industry is economically viable in the longer term.

How ASEAN Nations Shape South China Sea Policies Around China – A...	Tensions between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea have been making more headlines in 2025 after escalating alarmingly last year. Some other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), meanwhile, are trying to maintain good relations with their big neighbor to the north, whose economic and political influence is only growing in importance, while protecting their interests in the disputed waterway. Reporters from RFA and BenarNews look at how three countries in the South China Sea are approaching relations with China. INDONESIA: Growing openness toward China In November 2024, Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto stunned South China Sea watchers with a sentence in a joint statement issued in China on his first overseas trip since becoming president. The seemingly innocuous line explained that Jakarta and Beijing had reached an 'important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims' in the South China Sea. But analysts were quick to point out that by acknowledging overlapping maritime boundaries, Prabowo and his officials had effectively acknowledged the legitimacy of China’s claims, something Indonesia had never done before. Indonesia had always insisted that China’s so-called nine-dash line, which it uses on its maps to claim historic rights over most of the South China Sea, has no legal basis, as seen in a note verbale to the United Nations in May 2020. Indonesia realized the mistake and issued a correction two days later, saying mutual recognition of differences and disputes does not equal accepting the other side’s legitimacy and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea still lacked legal basis. Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta said that nevertheless, there has been 'a shift toward a closer relationship that could reduce Jakarta’s assertiveness in the South China Sea under President Prabowo Subianto.' China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and one of its biggest sources of foreign direct investment, and expanding economic ties have been a major factor in Jakarta’s decision-making. This year, Indonesia became the first Southeast Asia member of the BRICS bloc led by China. Raden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Al Azhar University Indonesia said that there was growing openness toward China, not just in trade and investment but also in security cooperation. Prabowo’s dominant role in foreign policy appears to have sidelined Indonesia’s ministry of foreign affairs, he said. 'I am concerned that under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesian diplomats may have less space to provide input and guidance on how the country’s foreign policy should be shaped,' Luthfi said. Waffaa noted a sense that 'Indonesia is increasingly practicing self-censorship when dealing with China.' 'One possible explanation is China’s proactive diplomatic approach, which includes strong responses, or even retaliatory measures, against criticism,' he said. 'This makes Indonesia more cautious, possibly fearing economic repercussions and as a result, it has become difficult to openly address concerns over sovereignty and international law.' Indonesia is one of the founding members of ASEAN and long served as its de facto leader, playing a crucial role in mediating regional crises. Analysts warned that its leadership in the group on the South China Sea issue would wane if it stopped championing international legal norms. Indonesia has repeatedly said it is not a party to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. But its law enforcement agencies have had to deal with encroachment and illegal fishing, including by Chinese vessels in the waters off the Natuna islands. A major question now is whether warming relations will keep encroachments at bay. MALAYSIA: Aligning with China’s preferences? Malaysia’s leaders have always seen China as an important neighbor and partner with which they have to navigate a complex relationship. The two countries established a comprehensive partnership in 2013 and China is Malaysia’s top economic partner, with trade worth more than U.S. $200 billion in 2022. In comparison, Malaysia-U.S. trade was $73 billion in the same year. Since coming to power in 2022, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has made it clear that fostering good ties with China is one of his priorities. Regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Malaysia’s long-standing policy has been to protect its sovereignty via international law. Malaysia has never recognized China’s nine-dash line and even ordered the removal of a scene from an animated movie that showed it. Yet some of the prime minister’s comments have stirred controversy. In March 2024, in a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra, Anwar said that countries needed to put themselves in China’s shoes and that trying to block its economic and technological advancement would only bring grievances. In November, after meeting President Xi Jinping in Beijing, Anwar said that Malaysia was 'ready to negotiate' on the South China Sea, suggesting bilateral negotiations over conflicting claims in the waters off the coast of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January, once again the Malaysian leader stated that China should not be singled out for the tensions in the South China Sea, striking a clear pro-Beijing tone. 'Malaysia’s desire to exclude other countries, such as Australia, Japan and the United States, from South China Sea disputes aligns with China’s preferences,' wrote Euan Graham, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 'It also helps China’s behind-the-scenes efforts to influence negotiations with ASEAN on a code of conduct for the South China Sea,' Graham added. China and ASEAN have been discussing the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea for years but have yet to reach a final agreement. In February, during a trip to Brunei, Anwar called for the code to be completed 'as soon as possible' to address escalating tensions in the waterway. Malaysia is the ASEAN chair this year. 'I believe Malaysia prefers to settle the issue among the stakeholders through dialogue and engagement without any intervention from outside,' said Lee Pei May, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the International Islamic University Malaysia. 'If there is intervention from outside powers, I believe the situation would be chaotic,' Lee said. 'The U.S., U.K. and other powers, they are not directly related to the dispute so they are considered outside powers.' The U.S. and its regional allies, for their part, argue that they are also Pacific nations, and have an interest in a free and open Indo-Pacific. Some analysts said that the Anwar administration, despite being criticized for its seemingly pro-Beijing stance, had not compromised Malaysia’s claims in the South China Sea. 'To be sure, Malaysia has adopted a very different approach to the South China Sea dispute than either Vietnam or the Philippines,' said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. Anwar’s policy still 'allows Malaysia to maintain close ties with China while asserting its territorial claims and protecting its sovereign rights,' he said. VIETNAM: A balancing act On Feb. 19, Beijing for the first time officially and publicly denounced Vietnam’s island-building activities in the South China Sea. Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said that China opposed construction on 'illegally occupied islands and reefs,' referring to the features that Vietnam began reclaiming in the 2020s. It is not a secret that Vietnam wants to strengthen defenses against China’s dominance in the Spratly islands and the island-building activities have received strong support from the Vietnamese public as the sign of a refusal to compromise on sovereignty. 'If you listen to leaders’ speeches on both sides, Vietnam-China relations appear to be warm and flourishing,' said Dinh Kim Phuc, a South China Sea researcher. 'But Hanoi’s developments in the South China Sea show that they don’t really trust each other very much.' With China’s first public protest against the island building, it seems that an 'informal understanding' with Vietnam is over, noted Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at the British think-tank Chatham House. This tacit compromise meant that for a few years, Vietnam did not look for oil and gas inside China’s nine-dash line and China said nothing about Vietnam’s island-building activities, Hayton said. There may be several explanations for China’s objection but analysts believe Vietnam’s expanding ties with the United States is a major factor. Looking at overseas trips by Vietnam’s leaders, including the new Communist Party chief To Lam, Vietnam also seems to 'emphasize the values of ASEAN and the West' in its strategic thinking, according to Phuc. Vietnam has been reported as wanting to elevate ties with fellow ASEAN members Indonesia and Singapore to comprehensive strategic partnerships, the highest level of bilateral relations, this year. But that doesn’t mean that a decoupling from China would happen any time soon, analysts say, as Vietnam’s economy depends greatly on Chinese trade and investment. On the same day that China criticized Vietnam’s 'illegal occupation' in the South China Sea, Vietnam’s parliament approved a multi-billion-dollar railway running from the Chinese border to the South China Sea. Part of the funding is expected to come from China, despite some public unease about the potential debt. Gestures by General Secretary To and other leaders that can be seen as 'pro-West' or 'anti-China' are deemed as 'merely populist' by Dang Dinh Manh, a Vietnamese dissident lawyer now living in the U.S. 'They need to appease the general domestic public, which is increasingly nationalistic,' Manh said, adding that in his opinion the Hanoi leadership needed to appease China, too, and how to strike a balance can be 'a serious task', especially when it comes to sovereignty in the South China Sea.

The Case For Carbon Taxes In Southeast Asia – Analysis	By Subhramit Das Southeast Asia’s climate crisis is hardly a new phenomenon, with extreme weather events disproportionately affecting its populations and economies. But as public support for carbon taxes grows, governments in the region have a rare opportunity to implement effective carbon pricing policies that curb emissions while addressing economic and social concerns. The Asian Development Bank’s 2024 climate change perception survey of 14 Asian economies found that there is widespread public support for introducing carbon taxes as a measure to limit emissions. Another 2024 survey by the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute indicated that over 70 per cent of the respondents from across Southeast Asia supported a national carbon tax, and 93 per cent of that segment were willing to bear the personal costs that might arise from a carbon tax. These survey results lend urgency to Asian governments to explore the effectiveness of carbon taxes. The ‘polluter pays’ principle in economics argues that those responsible for creating pollution are responsible for managing it. Greenhouse gas emissions are a by-product of economic activity that impact society as they contribute to climate change, reduce quality of life and can be lethal, causing an estimated 4.2 million associated deaths worldwide in 2019. By imposing a price on emissions through a carbon tax, polluters are forced to internalise this cost. The key benefit of a carbon tax is that it provides businesses with a predictable path for controlling emissions, which helps them plan their shift to low-carbon technologies. In 2025, Singapore’s carbon tax rate is S$25 (US$18.4) per tonne of emissions. This will increase to between S$50–80 (US$37–59) per tonne by 2030. Singapore’s polluters are paying a low price initially while they develop and implement low-carbon technologies. The primary objection to a carbon tax regime has been its regressive nature — it disproportionately impacts lower-income households. Some countries have tried to get around this by introducing tax breaks, credits and targeted public spending that make the carbon tax revenue neutral. Canada’s British Columbia province introduced a carbon tax in 2008 and has been distributing the revenues as tax benefits for low-income households, as well as introducing tax cuts for small businesses to ensure they are not disproportionately affected by the carbon tax. Norway’s carbon tax revenue goes toward its Government Pension Fund Global. As of 2024, 39 countries have implemented a carbon tax. Most of the Nordic countries have had carbon taxation in place since the early 1990s. Carbon tax has directly caused a reduction in emissions in these countries. In 2015, Sweden reported a 30 per cent drop in emissions as a direct result of the tax scheme. The United Kingdom introduced a carbon tax on the power sector in 2013, which reduced electricity-related emissions by 26 per cent in just three years. Asia is facing headwinds from the European Union with the imposition of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2026, which puts a price on carbon emitted during production of goods that enter the European Union. As the European Union is the ASEAN region’s third largest trading partner, it is imperative for the region’s governments to implement carbon pricing. But Asian policymakers must tread carefully as introducing any new tax is often a political minefield. The failure of carbon taxes in Australia is a cautionary tale, but there are ways to counterpublic dissatisfaction. Phasing in carbon taxes, as seen in Singapore, lets the public experience the costs and benefits of the taxation without being immediately onerous. Spending the tax revenues on initiatives that mitigate climate change seems to increase support for a carbon tax among voters. Japan — the first Asian country to implement a carbon tax — uses the revenues to support renewable energy projects and develop energy-saving technologies. Redistributing carbon tax revenue to support those disproportionately affected, especially as the taxes ramp up over time, will also help soften the blow. A 2022 study by the German Institute of Development and Sustainability estimated that a carbon tax of US$50 per tonne of emissions would increase poverty by 20 per cent in South Asia without revenue redistribution. But through revenue redistribution, carbon tax could alleviate poverty and reduce inequality worldwide. The key to winning support for carbon taxes is effective communication with stakeholders well ahead of implementation through public consultations. Governments should focus on the benefits of carbon taxes for society at large, such as improved atmospheric visibility and quality of life, neutralising the effects on low-income households and the overall economic impact of the green transition. While countries have the option of achieving carbon pricing through an emissions trading system, a carbon tax regime yields the greatest benefits for developing countries in Asia. To ensure enforcement, governments should impose the carbon tax upstream on fossil fuels. Developing nations typically have large informal sectors with limited enforcement capacity, so an upstream carbon tax is a necessary safeguard. With greater institutional knowledge and experience in carbon pricing, developing countries can move toward a hybrid approach with carbon taxes for some sectors and emissions trading systems for others. CBAM is a wake-up call for governments in the ASEAN region to urgently review incoming external carbon pricing mechanisms and counter their economic impacts. Developing nations are disproportionately impacted by extreme weather events, so their populations know well how important it is to rein in emissions. Given the region’s broad support for a carbon tax, this might be an opportune time to test its feasibility.

Nazism, Fascism, And Communism: Warring Sons To A Common Father –...	By Amirhossein Ojaqfaqihi What if two of history’s most infamous ideologies—Nazism and Fascism—shared more in common fundamentally with Communism than we often recognize? Recently, a chairwoman of a German political party controversially claimed that Hitler was a communist. While this assertion is incorrect, much of the criticism it drew focused only on the visible differences between Hitler and Communists, leaving their deeper ideological similarities unexamined. By revisiting the words of Hitler and Mussolini, it becomes clear that their rivalry with Communism was less about rejecting its principles and more about promoting competing visions of collectivism. It is now the duty of classical liberals, who fundamentally diverge from both communists and fascists, to seize the opportunity and reveal the shared collectivist roots of these ideologies. As a classical liberal, I have always been skeptical of my ideology being grouped on the same 'side' as the Nazis, given the stark philosophical differences. The disproportionate attention drawn to the rivalries between various forms of collectivism hinders thorough political discourse and leaves the core question of individualism versus collectivism inadequately explored. Mussolini: From Marxist to Nationalist Collectivist 'If the 19th century was the century of the individual, we are free to believe that this is the ‘collective’ century,' wrote Benito Mussolini. He began his career as an ardent Marxist, even editing a socialist magazine. However, World War I and his perceived failure of Communist internationalism to galvanize workers led him to reconsider. Rather than abandoning collectivism, he sought a unifying force stronger than class: nationalism. In The Doctrine of Fascism, he argued that 'the nation has not disappeared,' emphasizing that class distinctions obstruct true unity: 'Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests, but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and a race; it is a spiritual community.' Mussolini criticized socialism, not for its collectivist nature, but for its inability to unify all segments of society. He describedFascism as an ideology that subsumed the individual into the state: Liberalism denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts The rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual…. The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. For Mussolini, the individual had meaning only as part of the collective, bound by traditions, culture, and duty: Fascism sees in the world not only those superficial, material aspects in which man appears as an individual, standing by himself…but the nation and the country; individuals and generations bound together by a moral law…founded on duty. Hitler’s Vision: Sacrificing the Individual for the Race The Nazis developed a slogan that can be read in a May 1, 1934 New York Times article title: 'The Common Good Before the Good of the Individual.' This Nazi slogan encapsulates Hitler’s collectivist ethos. While he diverged from socialism in practice, he acknowledged the collectivist appeal of its goals. In Mein Kampf, he states: 'I had no feelings of antipathy towards the actual policy of the Social Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes…' However, Hitler’s break with socialism stemmed from its perceived failure to preserve national unity and identity. He viewed socialism’s internationalism as a threat to German identity: 'But the features that contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the conservation of Germanism in Austria…' What set Hitler apart was his emphasis on race. His core concept of racial superiority was fundamentally rooted in collectivism, seeing the Aryan race as embodying the ideal of self-sacrifice for the community: The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers, but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of the community…. for the Ayran willingly subordinates his own ego to the common weal and when necessity calls he will even sacrifice his own life for the community. Compare this to Marx’s assertion that 'all previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority.' Both philosophies promoted visions of collective good, differing only in the identity—class or race—that served as the unifying force. For Hitler, the individual existed to serve the collective, with the state as the enforcer of this vision: '...the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind.' While he opposed Marxism’s internationalism, he saw it more as a rival than a fundamentally different philosophy: Only when the international idea, politically organized by Marxism, is confronted by the folk idea, equally well organized in a systematic way and equally well led--only then will the fighting energy in the one camp be able to meet that of the other on an equal footing; and victory will be found on the side of eternal truth. Language Matters Although sophisticated exploration of these subjects in the literature is important, what benefit would it bring if these ideas don’t reach the masses? How can we serve our passion for liberty if we fail to assert it daily through its most powerful tool—language? Should we tolerate the perception that our ideology is just a matter of degrees from Nazism and Fascism? Meanwhile, the most impactful irony is that these ideologies are often categorized as being on the 'right!' Are we unaware of the implications of this neglect? Or, if we are aware, have we been passionate enough to address it? What we need is an abundance of daily discourse that blends factuality with simplicity—one that consistently reinforces its implications through language until it becomes widely accepted. Conclusion The debate over whether Hitler and Nazism belong to the left obscures a deeper truth: their collectivist roots align them more closely with Communism than with individualism, classical liberalism, or libertarianism. The qualities of Hitler and Mussolini differed significantly; their denial of individualism was philosophical, whereas their resentment of Communism was more of a passionate rivalry. By highlighting the shared foundations of these ideologies through promoting alternative political categorizations, we should incorporate these facts into everyday political discourse and reestablish their significance as the only truly distinctive ideology. Recognizing these less-explored, but fundamental, common features would help societies to have a broader perspective towards political relations and avoid falling for runaway collectivist movements simply because they offer a new leading identity—whether defined by class, nation, race, or gender. Classical liberalism has played a groundbreaking role in shaping the modern world—a world that, despite its flaws, is far removed from the hardships of earlier times. It should now become the mission of classical liberals to uncover the truth. About the author: Amirhossein Ojaqfaqihi is a master’s student in Electrical Engineering at TU Chemnitz with a deep interest in political philosophy, particularly the Enlightenment era. A classical liberal, he believes activism alone is not enough and advocates for a return to deeper intellectual discourse.

What Policymakers Should Prioritize On Ukraine – OpEd	Russia’s war against Ukraine will soon enter its fourth year. Since February 2022, violations of the laws of war have led to needless civilian death, suffering, and devastation with more than 12,456 Ukrainian civilians killed and 28,382 injured, at least 6.8 million having left the country, and millions more internally displaced. Thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed. As this dreadful anniversary nears, the Trump administration is rapidly moving towards negotiations with the Kremlin. Civilian protection and justice need to be central to any negotiations. One immediate issue is the need to release Ukrainian civilians from Russian custody. These include thousands unlawfully detained and held by Russia in occupied areas of Ukraine and those forcibly transferred to detention facilities in Russia. A United Nations body recently concluded that Russian authorities torture Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) 'as a crime against humanity.' While the Geneva Conventions require the prompt release and repatriation of POWs at the end of active hostilities, negotiations offer an opportunity to highlight the urgency of achieving this. Russia continues to be an occupier in parts of Ukraine where millions live and is bound by the law on occupation. Investigations should continue into Russia’s violations of its obligations as the occupying force for example, by coercing residents to serve in the Russian military, imposing Russian citizenship, forcibly transferring civilians to other areas, imposing the Russian state curriculum in schools and other educational institutions, and politically indoctrinating school children in order to deny them the right to know and express their Ukrainian identity. Justice cannot be negotiated away. The perpetrators of war crimes, including widespread, indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure, torture and ill-treatment in occupied areas and Russian prisons, and the torture and executions of POWs, must be held accountable. Investigations and prosecutions need to be supported and well-resourced. The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and five other high-ranking officials must be honored and ICC member countries should oppose the Trump administration’s sanctions on the court and forcefully support the court’s crucial role. Trump’s recent, incendiary and factually untrue statements and controversies around potential negotiations should not distract from urgent concerns for the rights of people in Ukraine’s occupied areas. The release of civilian detainees and repatriation of POWs should be a priority and victims of atrocities should receive justice and reparations for the harm they have suffered.

India’s Language Debate: Unity Or Identity? – OpEd	India’s linguistic scenery is as vibrant and complex as its cultural history. With over 120 major languages and thousands of dialects, the country’s diversity is both a source of pride and a battleground for political and cultural identity. At the heart of this struggle lies a decades-old debate: Should India prioritise a three-language policy—promoting Hindi, English, and regional languages—or embrace a two-language approach that sidelines Hindi in favour of regional tongues and English? This question has resurfaced with renewed intensity in recent years and months, fuelled by educational reforms, protests, and the ever-present tension between national unity and regional pride and identity. The roots of this conflict trace back to India’s post-independence era. In 1968, the Three-Language Formula was introduced to balance linguistic diversity with national cohesion. It encouraged states to teach the regional language, Hindi, and English. While Hindi-speaking northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar adopted this model, southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala resisted. For them, Hindi represented not unity but cultural domination by the North. Instead, they championed a two-language system, focusing on their native languages—Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada—and English, which they saw as a neutral bridge to the wider world. This historical friction reignited in 2020 with the Modi government’s National Education Policy (NEP), which urged non-Hindi states to teach Hindi 'wherever possible.' Though framed as a suggestion, critics argued it was a backdoor tactic to impose Hindi, linking federal funding to compliance. Tamil Nadu, with its long history of anti-Hindi sentiment dating back to violent protests in 1965, erupted in outrage. 'They call Hindi the ‘national language,’ but India has no national language. This is about erasing our identity,' said Ganesh, a student protester in Chennai. The NEP’s ambiguity felt like a betrayal to many, echoing fears of linguistic homogenisation. By 2023, the flames of dissent spread to Karnataka. When the state government proposed making Hindi compulsory in schools, Bengaluru saw massive protests. Activists and opposition parties accused the ruling BJP of undermining Kannada, the state’s native language. 'Hindi is not our culture; it is a political agenda,' declared Kannada writer Vasudha Krishnamurthy. In Tamil Nadu, activists took symbolic action, stripping Hindi signage from metro stations and shops—a defiant rejection of what they termed 'linguistic colonialism.' Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.K. Stalin framed the resistance as a fight for Dravidian heritage: 'We will not let Hindi bulldoze our history.' Proponents of Hindi, however, paint a different picture. Leaders like Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath argue that Hindi is essential for national integration: 'It unites us all. Those opposing it are dividing the nation.' Economically, Hindi’s prevalence, spoken by 43 percent of Indians, offers practical advantages, opening doors to jobs in northern markets. Yet, for non-Hindi speakers, this logic rings hollow. 'Language is not just communication—it is memory, history, and resistance,' asserts Tamil scholar Ram. The debate also exposes stark class and caste divides. Rural India, where 65 percent of the population resides, relies heavily on state-language education. Without fluency in English or Hindi, students here face limited opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Urban elites, meanwhile, flock to English-medium private schools, cementing a divide between those who can navigate global markets and those left behind. The caste dimension adds another layer: Historically, upper castes monopolised Sanskrit and English, while lower castes were marginalised. Today, promoting Hindi as the 'people’s language' risks sidelining non-Hindi communities, reinforcing what Dalit activist Anand Teltumbde calls 'upper-caste dominance.' Technology has emerged as a new frontier in this battle. Government apps like Aarogya Setu, which initially lacked Tamil and Kannada options, sparked accusations of digital exclusion. Social media campaigns like #StopHindiImposition trend regularly, reflecting grassroots resistance. Yet tech also offers hope. Apps like Duolingo and AI-driven tools can democratise language learning, empowering users to bridge gaps without top-down mandates. The path forward may lie in flexible federalism. States like Kerala offer a model: teaching Malayalam, English, and Hindi but allowing students to choose between Hindi and Sanskrit post-primary school. This balances practicality with cultural choice. Decentralising language policy, investing in teacher training, and promoting regional languages in tech and media could preserve diversity while fostering unity. India’s linguistic struggle is ultimately a referendum on its identity. Can a nation of such staggering diversity thrive without imposing uniformity? The answer, perhaps, lies in embracing coexistence over coercion. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen reminds us, 'India’s plurality is its identity. To destroy that is to destroy India itself.' The Tamil farmer’s pride in his language and the Hindi clerk’s aspirations need not clash. In respecting both, India’s many voices can harmonise into a chorus that celebrates difference without discord. In a democracy as vast and varied as India’s, linguistic justice is not merely policy—it is a promise. A promise that every language, like every citizen, has a place in the nation’s story. The challenge is not to choose between Hindi and English, North and South, but to weave a tapestry where every thread strengthens the whole. Only then can India truly speak as one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqzt6PV9P9Tx7	2025-02-21T17:14:08-08:00	
Executive Orders Are Not A Panacea For America – OpEd	Many conservatives are exuberant that Donald Trump has won another term in the White House. And from a conservative perspective, there are undoubtedly reasons to celebrate Trump’s return to power, especially when compared with the Kamala Harris alternative: the abrupt termination of the US government’s profoundly discriminatory 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' programmes; a commitment to end government-sponsored censorship of Americans’ speech; a promise to cut government spending; the much-needed shake-up of the US’s pharmaceutical, health, and food regulatory establishment; and withdrawal from a WHO compromised by glaring conflicts of interest such as support from Pharma investors like Bill Gates. You do not need to be a front-row MAGA fan to be happy about these sorts of changes or see that they are far more sensible than what Kamala Harris was offering to the American people. However, I have the sense that some people are so caught up in the excitement of the moment that they are losing sight of the bigger picture. The bigger picture is this: The United States is an increasingly polarised society, divided between people who identify as 'progressives' and/or Democrats, and people who identify as 'conservatives' or libertarians and/or Republicans. This polarisation has translated into a divisive and acrimonious competition for federal power, that reaches its climax when both sides vie for the presidential office every four years. Federal power, whether over public finance and spending, the monetary system, the healthcare system, education, banking, commerce, or public health and hygiene, has grown to such an extent that people’s everyday lives are at the mercy of the person who ends up in the White House or the makeup of the US Supreme Court. This puts people’s freedom and prosperity on a very precarious footing indeed. Yet this has come to be widely accepted as the norm. And implicitly, it has come to be embraced by those who treat the president as a sort of messianic figure, who will either protect the 'little American' against Big Money, or 'make America great again,' and fight an epic, batman-like battle against the allies of Big Pharma, Big Bureaucracy, and Big Taxes. Don’t get me wrong. If you live in a centralised political system, it is rational to want the best candidate, or the least damaging candidate, to get into the White House. And you might be right in wanting a big shakeup of a corrupt oligarchic system, even if it takes a bit of a 'Batman' figure to pull it off. If I was Argentinian, for example, I would be happy that a country crippled by debt and cronyism was being shaken up by a powerful figure like Milei. One might wistfully hope that the rise of a Trump or Milei to power would somehow spark far-reaching reforms that ultimately returned power to the people. But that does not seem at all likely, given that the path to political reform in both cases is not grassroots change, but sweeping uses of executive power. If anything, there is a strong possibility that both Milei and Trump will further strengthen the executive office and make the national government even more powerful than before by showing the world how it can be effectively leveraged by a powerful president. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the man currently occupying the White House is a sensible, wise man who can restore 'common sense' in the national government and introduce policies that favour freedom and economic growth, without allowing the national government to become too intrusive or domineering. Even assuming that this is the case, this individual will not occupy the White House forever. The chances are, especially in a politically and culturally polarised country like the United States, that a very different candidate will come along, in four, eight, or twelve years, and win enough votes to get into office and reverse his or her predecessor’s reforms. For example, if an executive order can undo DEI policies, stop government collusion with Big Tech censorship, or weaken the hold of Big Pharma over the healthcare complex, then a future executive order can reinstate DEI policies, restore government-sponsored censorship of 'misinformation,' and put Big Pharma and Big Food cronies in charge of the national food, drug, and healthcare regulatory apparatus. This means that political reform, however dramatic and exciting to behold, is inherently unstable in a centralised system with a strong executive office, particularly in a society that is deeply divided over the proper ends of the national government and over the values that represent the country at its best. So those who care about the long-term health and stability of the United States should favour more far-reaching structural reforms, that weaken both Congress and the presidential office, and return power to the State and local levels of government. This way, many highly divisive political disputes can be removed from the national stage and returned to the State and local levels, where different solutions can be developed that are tailored to local needs and local sensibilities. If people don’t like the results, they can 'vote with their feet,' and seek out a State more to their liking.

Congress Is (Unfortunately) Key To DOGE’s Success – OpEd	Most Americans have suspected that the federal government is riddled with wasteful spending. In the last few weeks, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has begun to pull back the curtain and expose the misuse of money. Examples include $32 million for a Civil Society Centre in Prague, $14 million for 'improving public procurement' in Serbia, and $373 million for DEI training grants. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the early poster child for government waste, fraud and abuse. Some of its wacky spending includes $70,000 for production of a 'DEI musical' in Ireland, $32,000 for a 'transgender comic book' in Peru, and $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala. Nearly all staff for the USAID were placed on administrative leave as the Trump administration ponders the future of the agency. Considering that the federal government spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in last year, the waste of funds strikes working Americans as verging on criminality. At a minimum, it is gross negligence by our elected leaders. President Donald Trump imposed a funding pause on all USAID money while his administration decided how to go forward. A federal judge, however, has ordered the president to temporarily lift the freeze on USAID spending. So just how far can Trump go in righting the wrongs of Congress and prior administrations? In constitutional parlance, Trump’s refusal to spend money appropriated by Congress is known as impoundment. Throughout American history, presidents have declined to spend appropriated funds. For example, in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson declined to spend $50,000 Congress had appropriated for gunboats in anticipation of a conflict with France. Jefferson’s negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase rendered military conflict unlikely, and Congress supported Jefferson’s impoundment decision. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt impounded millions in congressionally appropriated funds when addressing various economic dislocations tied to the Great Depression and the war. Significant controversy over impoundment occurred during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, who impounded 17-20% of congressional appropriations. Nixon used impoundment to curtail domestic programs with which he disagreed. Crippled by the Watergate scandal and just a month before resigning, Nixon signed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 into law. At base, the statute requires the president to report impoundments to Congress and to abide by a congressional decision on the matter. If Congress takes no action to review the impoundment, the president must spend the money. The Supreme Court has never addressed the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act. Advocates of executive power argue that the statute infringes upon the president’s inherent powers, while proponents of congressional power contend impoundment gives the executive an extra-constitutional veto on congressional actions. How about the termination of federal agencies such as USAID? While President John F. Kennedy established USAID through an executive order in 1961, Congress in 1998 designated USAID as an 'independent establishment' outside of the State Department. Because of the congressional legislation, it is doubtful that Trump can abolish the entity. Had Congress not acted in 1998 and USAID was still a creature of a JFK executive order, the situation would be different (but still subject to wrangling in the courts over whether the presidential decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act). Americans cheering DOGE and Trump should focus their energy on Congress. For better or worse, the Constitution’s Article I vests 'all legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States.' The president cannot submit legislation to abolish USAID, but Congress can. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has introduced a bill (H.R. 1123) to halt all taxpayer funding to USAID and to claw back funds not yet distributed. In light of the DOGE discoveries and the anger of Americans at USAID’s malfeasance, if H.R. 1123 can’t pass with significant majorities in the House and Senate, there is no hope to ever Make America Great Again. H.R. 1123 presents Congress with, to borrow a phrase from Elon Musk, a fork in the road: continue to bankrupt the country by funding Guatemalan sex changes and other foolishness or take a stand for fiscal sanity. Absent a concerted effort in Congress to act on DOGE findings, Trump’s impoundments and employee furloughs will be caught up in the federal courts for months or years. While law geeks drool over the thought of the Supreme Court hearing arguments on the Impoundment Control Act, in the meantime, waste, fraud and abuse will continue in a business-as-usual manner. It’s time for the people supportive of DOGE to burn up the Capitol Hill switchboard.

Can The US And Russia Impose A Peace Deal On Ukraine? – Analysis	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- A whirlwind week that has seen two emergency summits in Europe and worried comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy underlines the gnawing fear in capitals from Kyiv to London. Namely, that Washington and Moscow could try to make their own deal on the future of Ukraine without Kyiv and U.S. allies in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the angst with his post on Truth Social, accusing Zelenskyy of being a dictator and saying 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' U.S. officials have denied they wish to exclude anyone from the process. But U.S. suggestions that Europe would not be at the negotiating table has caused widespread alarm, and the positive vibes from U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh on February 18 also set nerves on edge. At this stage, there are two key questions: would Washington and Moscow even be able to agree on a mutually acceptable settlement to end the war in Ukraine, and if they did, what could anyone else do about it? The White House clearly wants peace. It’s not clear that Moscow does. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on February 19 just hours after overnight Russian strikes pounded Ukraine. Some 250,000 people were left without power in subzero temperatures in the port city of Odesa. In Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the State Duma that 'the crisis should not be resolved with a cease-fire.' If the Kremlin is ready for a deal, it looks ready to push for a hard bargain. The nightmare scenario for Ukraine and its European allies is that Washington will agree to one. U.S. officials have said that both sides in the conflict will need to make concessions but have not provided detail of what Russia’s might be. Asked about this at the Munich Security Conference on February 15, Kellogg said: 'There’s going to have to be territorial concessions,' and 'it could be the renouncement of the use of force.' Skeptics have warned that the United States is giving away too much, too early, in search of a quick and easy diplomatic win. But if there is a deal that Ukraine and Europe do not accept, what then? There has been a string of strong statements. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was asked at Munich what Kyiv’s 'non-acceptance' of a bad deal would look like? 'We know how to resist. We proved this, on the battlefield,' he said. But without ongoing U.S. support, Ukrainian defiance is going to be difficult. So far, Europe has provided more aid to Kyiv than the United States, according to figuresfrom the Kiel Institute of the World Economy. The figures cover military, financial, and humanitarian aid. But Washington is the largest provider of military support, underlining the scale of the challenge Ukraine would face without U.S. backing. To make up the shortfall, Europe would have to nearly double its overall support to Kyiv. European leaders have repeated a mantra that they will provide assistance to Ukraine for 'as long as it takes.' But this does not address the question of whether they would massively increase this assistance to fill the gap. Even talk of a European peace-keeping force, which would be deployed in Ukraine after a potential cease-fire or peace deal, has been with the caveat that it would require U.S. involvement and support. Given fiscal limitations and political divisions, it’s unclear whether Europe would step up. So far, every step of the way, it has needed America to hold its hand.

Why Donald Trump’s Obsession With Greenland Is All About China – ...	By Joshua Frank In early January, Donald Trump Jr.’s private plane landed on a snowy airfield in Greenland. There was little fanfare upon his arrival, but his 14 million social-media fans were certainly tagging along. 'Greenland coming in hot…well, actually really really cold!!!' President Trump’s eldest son captioned a video he posted on X. It was shot from the cockpit of the plane, where a 'Trumpinator' bobblehead (a figurine of his father as the Terminator) rattled on the aircraft’s dashboard as it descended over icy blue seas. It was a stunt of MAGA proportions. Don Jr. was arriving in Greenland on behalf of his father who, along with his new buddy Elon Musk, had announced a desire to seize that vast Arctic landmass from Denmark through strong will or even, potentially, by force. There’s been plenty of speculation as to why Trump wants to make Greenland, the largest island on this planet, a new territory of the United States. And yes, his inflated ego is undoubtedly part of the reason, but an urge for geopolitical dominance also drives Trump’s ambitions. His fascination with Greenland can be traced back to his first administration when, in late 2019, he signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act establishing the US Space Force. 'There are grave threats to our national security,' he said shortly after signing the bill. 'American superiority in space is absolutely vital. The Space Force will help us deter aggression and control the ultimate high ground.' The following year, the US government renamed Greenland’s Thule Air Base, the Department of Defense’s northernmost outpost since 1951, Pituffik Space Base. According to the official United States Space Force Website, the 'Top of the World vantage point enables Space Superiority … Pituffik SB supports Missile Warning, Missile Defense, and Space Surveillance missions.' As such, it’s a key military asset for NATO and the United States. Denmark, a founding member of NATO and the country that has long controlled Greenland, had no problem with Trump’s Space Force operation taking root on that island’s soil. Some have argued that Trump’s obsession is related to the Pituffik Space Base and Greenland’s strategic importance for US power, given its proximity both to Europe and to the melting Arctic. Yet, given that the US Space Force already operates there with NATO’s and Denmark’s blessing, it’s hard to understand why this would be the case. So, what gives? Do you wonder whether Trump has his sights set on exploiting Greenland’s natural resources? A few small problems there: it has no accessible oil. Tapping its sizable natural gas reserves — mostly parked beneath massive sheets of glacial ice — would be challenging, if not impossible, and certainly not profitable. Even pipelines and other infrastructure would be difficult to build and maintain in its icy climate. Besides, the US already has the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves. Let’s assume that Trump’s fascination with Greenland is unrelated to fossil fuels or military installations. If so, that leaves one other obvious possibility: Greenland’s expansive reservoir of minerals, deposits crucial to making the gadgets we use and producing the green technologies that Trump appears to oppose. Trump’s green energy paradox As soon as President Trump took office, his administration began issuing executive orders in hopes of dismantling and disrupting environmental initiatives put in place by the Biden administration. One of its first actions included canceling Biden’s electric vehicle mandate, which requested that 50% of all autos sold in the US be electric by 2030 (though it wasn’t binding). 'We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,' Trump boasted during his inaugural address. 'In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.' Of course, from their batteries to their engines, Biden’s push for electric vehicles would require a plethora of critical minerals, ranging from copper to graphite, cobalt to lithium. So, too, would other clean energy projects the Biden administration supported, from home energy storage systems to the deployment of solar panels. Given Donald Trump’s battle over electric vehicles, you might assume he would prefer to keep such minerals in the ground. Yet, like much of Trump’s bombast, his ploy to reverse Biden’s mandate had ulterior motives. Like Biden’s executive order, Trump’s doesn’t automatically change existing regulations. All emissions policies remain in place, and no rules have been altered that would require congressional approval. In many instances, such executive orders are essentially aspirational. Tax credits for electric vehicles remain active, but the federal government, as under Biden, doesn’t require automakers to sell a certain number of electric cars. This isn’t to say that Trump doesn’t want to alter such standards. However, doing so would require outfits like the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to propose changes and then provide time for public feedback. Bureaucracy can run slow, so during Trump’s first term, such changes took over two years to implement. Moreover, despite his war on electric vehicles, Trump has shown no sign of any eagerness to slow the mining of critical minerals on federal lands. In fact, his advisers want to do away with nettlesome environmental reviews that have gotten in the way of such mining. He is going all in, looking to ramp up not just oil, coal and natural gas production but also uranium and critical minerals. After taking office, one of his first actions was to sign an executive order declaring a 'National Energy Emergency,' which specifically called for expanding critical mineral development. 'The energy and critical minerals … identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs,' reads the order. 'We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.' Energy experts disagree. The US is not experiencing an energy emergency and hasn’t for decades. Gas prices are at a three-year low, and the country remains the world’s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter. In reality, Joe Biden’s oil and gas approvals outpacedthose in Trump’s first term, even if he also halted some further oil and gas exploration on public lands. After initial excitement from oil and gas companies, insiders admit that Trump’s emergency declaration isn’t going to cause a production ramp-up anytime soon. Those companies are, of course, in it to make money, and overproduction would lead to significant price drops, resulting in lower profits for shareholders and company executives. If that’s the situation for fossil fuels, when it comes to critical and rare earth minerals, Trump wants to hamper renewables’ growth while increasing the domestic production of those minerals. If that seems incongruous, that’s because it is. He wants to boost US mining of critical minerals because he knows that China, his archnemesis, is leading the global charge for their acquisition. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that it’s hard to stimulate investment in critical minerals if the future appetite for the technologies they support remains uncertain. As a result of his battle against electric vehicles, manufacturing expectations are already being slashed. While he may not comprehend how contradictory that is or even care, he certainly understands that the US depends on China for many of the critical minerals it consumes. Around 60% of the metals required for renewable technologies come directly from China or Chinese companies. Trump’s tariffs on China have even worried his buddy (and electric car producer) Elon Musk, who’s been workingbehind the scenes to block additional tariffs on graphite imports. Chinese graphite, an essential component of the lithium-ion batteries in his Teslas, may face new tariffs of as high as — and no, this is not a misprint — 920%. Such pandemonium around imports of critical minerals from China may be the true factor driving Trump’s impetus to steal Greenland from the clutches of Denmark. Trump and Musk also know critical minerals are big business. In 2022 alone, the top 40 producers brought in $711 billion. Total revenue grew 6.1% between 2022 and 2023, exceeding $2.15 trillion. That number is set to jump to $2.78 trillion by 2027. Eco-colonialism Greenland’s Indigenous Inuit people, the Kalaallit, account for 88% of that island’s population of 56,000. They have endured vicious forms of colonization for centuries. In the 12th century, Norwegians first landed in Greenland and built early colonies that lasted 200 years before they retreated to Iceland. By the 1700s, they returned to take ownership of that vast island, a territory that would be transferred to Denmark in 1814. In 1953, the Kalaallit were granted Danish citizenship, which involved a process of forced assimilation in which they were removed from their homes and sent to Demark for reeducation. Recently uncovered documents show that, in the 1960s, Danish authorities forcibly inserted intrauterine devices (IUDs) in Kalaallit women, including children, which post-colonial scholars describe as a 'silenced genocide.' In other words, the colonization of Greenland, like that of the United States, was rooted in violence and still thrives today through ongoing systemic oppression. The Kalaallit want out. In 2016, 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark, and today, 85% oppose Trump’s neocolonial efforts to steal the territory. 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,' said the island’s prime minister, Múte Egede, who leads the democratic socialist Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which won 80% of the votes in the last general election. Even though Greenlanders are Danish citizens, the territory is self-governing. This brings us back to what this imperialist struggle is all about. The island is loaded with critical minerals, including rare earth minerals, lithium, graphite, copper, nickel, zinc and other materials used in green technologies. Some estimates suggest that Greenland has six million tons of graphite, 106 kilotons of copper, and 235 kilotons of lithium. It holds 25 of the 34 minerals in the European Union’s official list of critical raw materials, all of which exist along its rocky coastline, generally accessible for mining operations. Unsurprisingly, such enormous mineral wealth has made Greenland of interest to China, Russia and — yep — President Trump, too. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Right now, in this geopolitical chess game, graphite might be the most valuable of all the precious minerals Greenland has to offer. The Amitsoq graphite project in the Nanortalik region of southern Greenland could be the most significant prize of all. Considered to be pure, the 'spherical' graphite deposit at the mine there may prove to be the most profitable one in the world. Right now, GreenRoc Mining, based in London, is trying to fast-track work there, hoping to undercut China’s interest in Greenland’s resources to feed Europe’s green energy boom. The profits from that mine could exceed $2 billion. Currently, spherical graphite is only mined in China and is the graphite of choice for the anodes (a polarized electrical device) crucial to lithium-ion battery production. 'This is not a joke.' Despite President Trump’s attempt to put the brakes on EV growth in the US, sales are soaring across the planet. In 2024, EV sales rose 40%in China and 25% globally. Such growth comes with obstacles for manufacturers, which will need a steady stream of minerals like graphite to keep the assembly lines moving. It’s estimated that 100 new graphite mines alone will need to come online by 2035 to meet current demand. Such a reality is, no doubt, well understood by Elon Musk, the co-founder and CEO of Tesla. Musk benefits from his very close relationship with Donald Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (which isn’t an actual department but an office inside the White House) and would certainly benefit if the US came to control Greenland. 'If the people of Greenland want to be part of America, which I hope they do, they would be most welcome!' Musk recently wrote on his platform X. Musk is not the only one with potential interests in Greenland. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has a financial stake in the territory, though he’s promised to divest. Lutnick’s investment firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, backs Critical Metals Corporation, which is set to start mining in Greenland for rare earth minerals as soon as 2026. Like Musk, Lutnick will significantly influence Trump’s approach to the island, even if he officially divests. Trump has also dispatched Ken Howery, a billionaire tech investor, co-founder of PayPal, and buddy of Musk, to be the next US ambassador to Denmark. Howery has told friends he’s excited about his post and the possibility of brokering a deal for the US to acquire Greenland. Marco Rubio, the new secretary of state, insists that Trump isn’t bullshitting when it comes to Greenland. 'This is not a joke,' he said. 'This is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land. This is in our national interest and it needs to be solved.' Greenland and its resources are merely the latest potential casualty of Trump’s quest for global domination and his fear of China’s economic power. His interest in the green energy sector does not signify a change of heart regarding the dangers of climate chaos or the value of renewables but rather a drive for global financial supremacy. Like the billionaires around him, he desires it all — the oil, the gas and the critical minerals essential for the global energy transition, while China is pushed aside. Regarding the Kalaallits and their aspirations, he could care less. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Four Scenarios For Securing Peace In Ukraine – Analysis	By Tatiana Vorozhko U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year full-scale war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq38nZZPlAOx6	2025-02-21T16:52:28-08:00	
Musk’s Buddy Javier Milei Tangos With Crypto Scam – OpEd	Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who has won high praise from Elon Musk, was caught in the middle of crypto scam in the country, that may have cost investors close to $5 million. The story is that Milei used his huge following on social media to promote a new crypto coin called the $LIBRA. Milei told his followers that the $LIBRA would stimulate the economy and help small businesses grow. This post sent the value of the $LIBRA soaring. However, as people began to investigate the coin, they became suspicious that it was a scam. The price began to crumble, and Milei took down his post. The coin quickly lost more than 90 percent of its value. Milei then said that he didn’t know anything about the coin and took no responsibility for his actions. Meanwhile, a number of people bought the coin near its peak, allowing the originators of the scam to cash out with big gains and leaving them with big loses. In the scheme of things, a $5 million dollar scam is not a big deal even in Argentina. But it does say a great deal about the way things work in the Trump-Milei world. Like Trump, Milei has taken big pride in disrupting Argentina’s government and economy. He also fired large numbers of civil servants and cut back government spending in many areas. In fairness, Milei did have more to complain about. The country was suffering from double-digit inflation, and the economy was in a recession. Nonetheless, it is not clear that Milei’s wrecking ball approach is likely to be a step forward. The poverty rate soared to over 50 percent as the recession became far steeper and the unemployment rate jumped. Part of Milei’s agenda, like Trump’s, is promoting cryptocurrency. As with Trump, Milei has never suggested a serious use for crypto. In Argentina, as in the U.S., the only known use for crypto is facilitating illegal transactions like drug dealing and ransom payments. Nonetheless, both presidents express a strong fondness for it. Donald Trump and Melanie Trump even have put out their own crypto currency, likely pocketing close to $100 million from it. It is a bit ironic seeing the Milei venture, and possibly the Trump coins, referred to as 'crypto scams.' That is a bit like fake counterfeit currency. But apart from the philosophical issue, there is the point about the extraordinary ability of a president to use the power of the government for their own personal gain. While past presidents may not have been squeaky clean, we have never seen a president so willing to openly use their power to line their pocket as Donald Trump. At this point it is not even news because Trump is so open about it. In that sense the Milei clown show is interesting in that, at least in Argentina, this sort of sleaze is still a scandal. Argentina generally has not ranked very high on most people’s lists for good governance, but for now, it stands well above the United States.

Europe Braces For A ‘New’ Germany	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- The most attentive spectators at Germany’s many pre-election party conferences were easy to miss. While leaders courted the cameras on stage, European diplomats discreetly mingled with the crowds that gathered in the Berlin area on successive weekends to rubber-stamp lead candidates and manifestos. One week, observers might have spotted the British ambassador to Berlin at the City Cube conference centre talking to the lead MP on foreign policy of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The next, they may have stumbled across a representative of the Portuguese embassy queuing for coffee at the Green Party conference at the same venue. Europe has been nervously watching the election campaign of the continent’s biggest economy, whose importance at a time of global upheaval can hardly be overstated. 'The world doesn’t stop spinning with everything that is going on in America, the first 100 days of Trump, and even the European budget,' one European diplomat told Euractiv. 'Europe needs to have someone to engage with in Germany.' For Germany’s neighbours, it may be reassuring that the country’s officials seem to be aware of their responsibility to Europe, with the four leading parties all campaigning on distinct visions for Germany’s future role in the European Union. The most likely outcome of Sunday’s ballot would see Berlin play a more muscular role on the European stage – if at the risk of stepping on some toes. It would certainly be a contrast to the last three years. German observers have watched in horror as the country went from purportedly ‘leading the free world’ under Angela Merkel to becoming an also-ran under Scholz. If the chancellor ever made a splash in Brussels, it was because of a botched relationshipwith Emmanuel Macron – the other half of the EU’s Franco-German ‘engine’ – and unilateral measures in moments of crisis. At other times, his unruly three-party coalition has been so hopelessly divided that it derailed the EU's legislative process, or failed to agree on any position at all in Brussels – the infamous ‘German vote'. Ending Germany’s ‘speechlessness' Frustration over this is rife among Scholz's rivals, especially his coalition partners, the Greens, who have often been blamed by extension for what they see as the chancellor's failures. At the start of the campaign, when journalists at a background briefing pressed Robert Habeck, the lead candidate of the Greens, on the central narrative of his campaign, his answer was clear: a strong focus on Europe. Scholz’s mixed record on Europe was also a preferred campaign target of election frontrunner Friedrich Merz, a former MEP, who has vowed to introduce a proactive leadership style that prioritises coordination and ends Germany's 'European speechlessness'. While the campaign was hardly more Europe-focused than usual, Merz and Habeck notably tried to set themselves apart from Scholz on Germany's leadership in the EU, noted Johannes Lindner, director of the Jacques Delors Centre. European topics gained slightly more traction with Donald Trump’s moves on Ukraine and tariffs, and a swelling debate over irregular migration and national border controls, he said.This has yielded four distinct scenarios for Germany’s future role in Europe. On one side of the spectrum, Habeck has advocated for federalist leadership that would make Germany’s vast resources available to Europe, including openness to new common debt and funding. On the other side, Alice Weidel, the leading candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the second-most popular party, has promised to take Germany out of the EU and the Euro. Between the two, Merz promises a new, pan-European leadership style, but explicitly defends national policy interests. Meanwhile, Scholz stands for a status quo, in which the EU is hardly front and centre. 'He didn’t even mention the EU once,' said one European diplomat after the chancellor’s keynote speech at the SPD’s election conference in January. In voters’ hands But the choice – and Europe’s fate – ultimately lie in the hands of German voters. As usual, the EU was low on the list of the most pressing issues for the electorate, with only 1% seeing it as a priority matter, according to a recent YouGov poll. Yet they are mostly aligned with the vision of the likely winner, Merz. According to a survey commissioned by the European Movement Germany (EBD), most voters back Germany's EU membership and want the bloc to do more, rather than less, to boost Europe’s defence, border security, and competitiveness. Unlike Habeck, however, they do not want Germany to lend more of its spending power to the bloc and are divided about further enlargement. Merz's Christian Democrats are cautious about both. Merz’s promise is that his government will bring new European momentum to areas like security and competitiveness, through stronger European cooperation and a strengthened single market, said Lindner. 'Merz has underlined his appetite for leadership,' he noted. Whether he will succeed will depend on his ability to form a stable, two-party coalition at home and to coordinate closely with EU allies, Lindner added. The flip side That is not a given: Merz's appetite can translate into a lack of consideration. On migration, Merz has championed a 'Germany first' policy that involves permanent border controls and the rejection of all asylum-seekers that enter from neighbouring countries, which would all but undermine Europe's cooperation on borders and migration. His opponents have compared this unilateral approach to 'Clint Eastwood' (Habeck) and 'Viktor Orbán' (Scholz), with the chancellor accusing Merz of 'burying Europe'. Not to mention that some EU allies dreaded the prolonged period of German dominance under Angela Merkel during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s. But for now, Germany's neighbours seem satisfied that Merz has namechecked their priorities. 'There are signs that the key players in Germany are prioritising the right issues, such as security and competitiveness,' said Sweden’s ambassador to Berlin, Veronika Wand-Danielson. Above all, she cares that Germany will regain its footing soon. 'We hope that a new government will be formed as quickly as possible,' she told Euractiv. 'We have so many common interests and so many common challenges and no time to wait.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq78ond_4ajfq	2025-02-21T16:39:43-08:00	
India’s Growing US Ties And Its Impact On China Relations – OpEd	India's growing closeness with the United States has significant implications for its relationship with China, shaping the geopolitical landscape of Asia and beyond. As New Delhi strengthens its ties with Washington, concerns arise regarding the potential for increased tensions with Beijing. This dynamic is influenced by various factors, including military cooperation, economic strategies, and regional security considerations. Military Cooperation and Strategic Alignments The deepening military cooperation between India and the U.S. is a central element of their burgeoning partnership. This includes joint military exercises, defense technology transfers, and intelligence sharing, which enhance India's capabilities to counter Chinese assertiveness in the region. The U.S. has positioned itself as a reliable partner for India, especially in times of crisis, as demonstrated during recent border tensions with China. This support has bolstered India's confidence in confronting Chinese aggression, leading to a more assertive stance along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). However, this military alignment also provokes a strong reaction from China. Beijing perceives the U.S.-India partnership as a direct threat to its regional influence and security interests. Chinese analysts have expressed concerns that India's increasing military capabilities, supported by the U.S., could lead to a strategic encirclement of China. Consequently, China may respond by enhancing its military presence along its borders with India and increasing its support for Pakistan, further complicating the security dynamics in South Asia. Economic Implications Economically, India's alignment with the U.S. presents both opportunities and challenges in its relationship with China. The U.S. seeks to diversify supply chains away from China, and India is positioned as a potential alternative manufacturing hub. This shift could benefit India's economy by attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. However, it also risks exacerbating tensions with China, which may view these developments as an attempt to undermine its economic standing. China has historically leveraged its economic influence in South Asia through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has strengthened its ties with neighboring countries. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., it may find itself at odds with these Chinese-led initiatives, leading to further economic competition between the two nations. Technology and Supply Chain Dynamics The U.S.-India partnership emphasizes technology cooperation, particularly in sectors like defense and cybersecurity. As India seeks to attract American investment in technology sectors such as semiconductors, it faces the challenge of competing against China's established supply chains. The potential for U.S.-India collaboration in critical technologies could bolster India's position but may also lead to increased competition with China in global markets. Beijing is likely to respond by enhancing its own technological capabilities and seeking alternative partnerships. The Role of Global Actors The evolving dynamic between India, the U.S., and China is not isolated; it affects other global actors as well. For instance, Russia has historically maintained strong ties with both India and China. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., Moscow may seek to leverage its relationships to maintain influence in South Asia while also benefiting from China's economic growth. This triadic relationship complicates India's strategic calculations as it navigates its partnerships while being mindful of Russia's interests. Regional Security Dynamics The strategic rivalry between India and China is further complicated by regional security dynamics. China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean poses a direct challenge to India's traditional dominance in the region. The U.S.-India partnership aims to counterbalance China's maritime ambitions through initiatives like the Quad—a strategic alliance involving Japan and Australia focused on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. This increased collaboration among Quad members signals a collective effort to address shared concerns about China's assertiveness. However, it may also provoke Beijing to intensify its own maritime activities, leading to heightened tensions in contested waters. The potential for miscalculations or confrontations in these areas underscores the fragility of peace in the region. Diplomatic Maneuvering Despite these tensions, both India and China have expressed interest in managing their bilateral relations amid their respective alignments with the U.S. However, this balancing act is precarious; any significant warming of relations between India and the U.S. could prompt China to adopt a more aggressive posture towards India. Moreover, India's historical ties with Russia complicate this dynamic further. As India navigates its relationship with the U.S., it must also consider its longstanding partnership with Moscow, which remains critical for defense procurement and energy supplies. The interplay between these relationships will shape India's foreign policy choices moving forward. In conclusion, India's growing closeness with the United States significantly impacts its relationship with China across military, economic, and diplomatic dimensions. While this partnership enhances India's capabilities and positions it as a key player in countering Chinese influence in Asia, it also invites greater scrutiny and potential retaliation from Beijing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq71DST6wfYfo	2025-02-21T16:35:30-08:00	
More Reports Of Russian Mercenary And FAMA Attacks On Civilians	Members of the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa) and Russian mercenaries now known as Africa Corps are accused of killing nine people, including women and children, in an attack on a vehicle in Mali’s Segou region in January. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, spokesperson for the coalition of Tuareg groups in northern Mali, told Reuters that the victims were headed to a refugee camp in Mauritania when they were attacked. It was the latest in a series of atrocities committed by FAMa and Russian mercenaries since the United Nations peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, left the country more than a year ago. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara also have been active since MINUSMA left. The terror groups killed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands between June and December 2024, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). JNIM burned more than 1,000 homes, looted thousands of livestock, and increased attacks on civilians and security forces. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) reported that attacks on Malian civilians have increased 38% since MINUSMA left, with the battles and attacks spreading to new areas in northern Mali. ACLED said the Malian Army and Russian mercenaries commit 'torture, summary executions, beheadings, ejection of prisoners from aircrafts and the booby-trapping of corpses.' According to ACLED, Malian military and allied forces carried out 255 operations, killing 1,063 civilians between January 1 and the end of October 2024. During the same period in 2023, these forces conducted 216 operations that killed 912 civilians. A recent HRW report included interviews with witnesses to some of the atrocities. In search of ethnic Fulani men accused of supporting JNIM, Malian forces and Russian mercenaries on May 8 killed two men and a boy in Barikoro, a village controlled by the terror group. They arrived on motorcycles and about 10 military vehicles, including armored cars. A mechanic said that he advised a Fulani man to leave his garage when he heard the forces were coming. After the man left, the mechanic heard several gunshots. 'I found my cousin’s body on the west side of the village with eight gunshots: in the forehead, the head, the back, and the legs,' a survivor told HRW. 'Meters away we found the bodies of two Fulani men also riddled by bullets, so we dug three holes and covered them with sand.' Malian and Russian forces on August 16 raided the village of Dounkala, where JNIM regularly attacks security forces. Witnesses said the forces went door to door and rounded up all men and interrogated them outside a mosque, where they killed a 19-year-old. 'His mother told me that when Wagner [fighters] ordered him to go to the mosque, he refused and called them ‘kuffar’ [nonbelievers],' a witness told HRW. 'So, a Wagner [fighter] shot him. I saw the body with a bullet wound in the chest.' Forces conducted similar operations on August 15 in the village of Toulé, killing seven men and torching dozens of homes. A farmer said he hid in an irrigation canal in his rice field. He heard people shouting and saw flames coming from the village. 'The following day, I returned to Toulé and found the bodies of seven villagers, their hands tied up behind their backs, blindfolded, and with their throats slit,' he said. A 52-year-old man said three of his sons were among the 21 civilians reportedly killed in Tinzawaten, where 47 FAMa soldiers and 84 Russian mercenaries were killed in July during a fierce three-day battle with JNIM. Two of the man’s sons were younger than 18. 'I heard the two strikes, and the fear of a third one prevented me from rushing to the scene,' the man told HRW. 'So, the bodies of my children remained there until the early evening when I finally saw them, all hit by shrapnel. … We buried them in a single hole without taking off their clothes, just 900 meters from the place of the strike.' Dozens of Malian soldiers and about 10 Russian fighters attacked the village of Ndorgollé on October 8. Witnesses said uniformed soldiers arrived at 8 a.m. in more than 20 military vehicles, including two armored cars. They surrounded the village, killed two men and arrested three others. 'They asked an older man where his son was,' a herder said. 'He replied he didn’t know. So, one soldier shot him in the chest point-blank. After that, his son came out and was shot in the head.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq4W4WFYz0z9d	2025-02-21T16:31:56-08:00	
New HHS Secretary Curtails US Government Role As Drug Promoter – ...	It has been commonplace for so long that most Americans cannot remember a time before the United States government was out running public relations campaigns urging Americans to take this or that vaccine or other pharmaceutical industry product. Now, an early action by new US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. suggests this practice may be coming to an end. Helen Branswell reported Thursday at STAT News that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 'was ordered to shelve promotions it developed for a variety of vaccines, including a ‘Wild to Mild’ advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against flu' and that the CDC was informed that Kennedy 'wanted advertisements that promote the idea of ‘informed consent’ in vaccine decision-making instead.' What a major change — a transition from being a pharmaceutical company product promoter to being a promoter of, as Branswell describes informed consent in her article, 'the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed.' This is a good early step by Kennedy. It clarifies a new orientation placing focus on advancing information and choice instead of pushing product. If Kennedy continues on this course, he can accomplish major advancement for health and freedom in America as his appointment suggested would be possible.

Sudanese Refugees Imprisoned And Impoverished By Ethiopian Visa P...	By Augustine Passilly Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopian cities are being driven deeper into poverty because of government-imposed visa fees that are beyond their means, and some have even been arrested for failing to pay the monthly charges and arrears. Ethiopia requires Sudanese who want refugee status to live in designated camps—where they don’t have to pay visa fees – but had previously offered visa exemptions to those who decided to live in urban areas where there is less insecurity. However, these exemptions were halted last October, forcing thousands of refugees living outside the camps to start paying $100 every month to renew their visas, and an additional $10 per day in fines if they miss the payment. 'The police regularly arrest Sudanese people and throw them in jail because they haven’t paid the monthly fees,' one refugee*, who hasn’t been able to pay the charge since entering Ethiopia last July, told The New Humanitarian. A high school teacher in Sudan, the refugee said she relies on her son in France to pay for the modest hotel room she shares with her daughter. Since hearing about the monthly fees, she said she avoids going outside. Sudan’s war—which pits the paramilitary-turned-rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) against the regular army—erupted in April 2023, and has produced the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. According to the UN, more than 12.3 million people have been uprooted by the violence, of whom 3.5 million have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, mainly Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan. Since the beginning of the war, some 163,000 people from Sudan—including 85,000 Sudanese nationals—have arrived in Ethiopia, which is home to the second-largest refugee population in Africa, hosting over a million people. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities, and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' Ethiopia has been widely commended for allowing so many refugees into the country, yet it has several policies that are harmful to the refugee population, and it is also embroiled itself in a number of destructive and deadly internal conflicts. Sudanese refugees in camps have faced dire humanitarian and security conditions, especially in the Amhara region, where local militias have subjected them to attacks, abductions, and rapes. Some refugee settlements have closed as a result. Meanwhile, many of the urban Sudanese refugees, who are thought to number around 15,000, lack protections that would have been afforded to them if they had refugee status. 'Sudanese nationals who don’t register as refugees may lack legal protection and face deportation or detention,' said Tarik Argaz, a communications officer for UNHCR in Ethiopia. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern' Sudanese wanting to apply for asylum are supposed to register on arrival in the Ethiopian border towns of Metemma and Assosa. Once registered, they are then required to settle in UN-run camps allocated by local authorities. Those wishing to live outside the camps can request a permit from the government’s Refugees and Returnees Service, yet these can be hard to obtain because applicants must have a local sponsor or prove their ability to support themselves. Many of the urban Sudanese refugees therefore don’t have refugee status nor the hard-to-obtain residence permits. That means they are required to constantly renew their visas, even though few can actually afford it. A 25-year-old homeless Sudanese refugee who has been living in Addis Ababa since last April said he can only focus on his daily survival out on the streets and is terrified of encountering the Ethiopian security services. When he arrived in Ethiopia, he was working for a design company that wanted to fly him to its offices in Mauritania. But he said he was robbed last year of his phone and laptop, which stopped him from working and resulted in his contract being terminated. A single mother who crossed the Ethiopian border with her four children in June 2023 said she is also unable to pay the visa fees because she is focused on more essential things. 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern,' she told The New Humanitarian. 'I haven’t paid my rent in two months, but the landlord knows I’ll repay him when I have the money,' she added. A makeup artist in Sudan, the woman said she does small informal jobs to feed her children, from henna hand art to serving tea and snacks in the courtyard of a restaurant run by a Sudanese-Ethiopian couple. A Sudanese mathematics professor who has sought refuge in Addis Ababa said he owes so much money to the Ethiopian government that he cannot afford to travel to another country, which is trapping him in a vicious cycle. The professor said many Sudanese refugees in the capital are facing a tough time, with some youth even turning to crime to make ends meet. 'They are willing to do anything in exchange for a meal or a small sum of money,' he said. Detained refugees Arrests of Sudanese who have not renewed their visas are common, according to Hassan Tawakol, a Sudanese academic who is raising funds in Addis Ababa to pay for the bail of detainees. Tawakol sent The New Humanitarian a list of 12 Sudanese refugees he said have been detained since the beginning of February, all of them incarcerated in the capital. A diplomatic source in Addis Ababa, who asked not to be named to speak freely, said Sudanese embassy officials had requested an extension to the original visa fee exemption and that the Ethiopian authorities had promised to grant one. The official said they were unsure if the government had fulfilled its pledge because of 'a lack of will' or for political reasons, which could be linked to Ethiopia’s fractious recent relations with Sudanese authorities. A Sudanese journalist in Addis Ababa said he was stopped last year by security services in civilian clothing and was imprisoned for two months because he hadn’t reviewed his visa for more than half a year. The journalist said he shared a cell with around 40 detainees, including seven Sudanese refugees who all owed money to the Ethiopian government’s Immigration and Citizenship Services agency. He said he was released but has arrears amounting to $1,200 and fears being arrested again. 'There is no logic in asking us to pay such amounts when we fled a war,' he said. 'The Ethiopian government is simply looking for money.' A second Sudanese refugee journalist said the visa fees are supposed to be paid in dollars, which complicates matters further for those who already cannot afford to pay. 'To obtain dollars, I must go through the black market, which is by definition illegal,' the journalist said. 'The police can arrest me if they find dollars or any other hard currency in my pocket.' Fears of returning Despite the difficult situation they are facing – and recent advances by the Sudanese army against the RSF – the refugees who spoke to The New Humanitarian said they are not considering returning to Sudan anytime soon. 'I abandoned my home in Khartoum,' said the single mother living in Addis Ababa with her daughter. 'I have nowhere else to live. Moreover, rents have become exorbitant in cities controlled by the army.' The young man living on the streets said his family members in Sudan are internally displaced and facing dire conditions he would not want to experience. 'My father lost his teaching job because schools are closed,' he said. 'There is no work, no services, no network, no electricity there. And as a young man, it would be very dangerous for me to return to Sudan. I could be forced to take up arms.' *The names of all refugees are being withheld given the risks they face. The writer is a freelance journalist based in Ethiopia, and previously in Sudan. This article is part of The New Humanitarian’s wider body of reporting on abuses against Sudanese refugees in Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan.

Who Flew A Reconnaissance Drone Into Kazakhstan?	(Eurasianet) -- Kazakhstan is finding itself caught up in the Russia-Ukraine war after an unidentified drone crashed in the Bokeyorda District of the West Kazakhstan region, not far from the Russian city of Volgograd. Russian officials are trying to pin the incident on Ukraine, while Ukrainian experts have offered evidence that the drone was a Russian vehicle. Kazakh sensitivities have been heightened by a February 17 drone attack carried out against a vital pumping station in Russia operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), part of a pipeline that connects Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The CPC pipeline is the main route used for Kazakh oil exports; the destruction caused during the attack will allegedly reduce the pipeline’s export capacity by roughly one-third for several months, according to Russian officials. Ukrainian officials acknowledged the attack on the CPC facility in Krasnodar Krai and say attacks on Russian energy infrastructure will continue. 'They not only support Russia’s military by supplying fuel to enemy forces but also play a crucial role in financing the war through oil profits,' the Kyiv Post quoted a Ukrainian Security Services source as saying. The Kremlin reportedly wants members of the CPC consortium to shoulder the repair and upgrade costs for the damaged pumping station, including advanced firefighting equipment. The American oil giant Chevron and the Kazakh government-controlled energy entity KazMunayGaz are among the largest CPC shareholders. The drone discovery in West Kazakhstan occurred the day after the CPC attack, according to Kazakh media reports. The crash site is situated in the vicinity of a Russian military training ground, Kapustin Yar. Soon after Kazakh reports of a downed drone began circulating, Russian Telegram channels and web information portals began spreading unsubstantiated claims that the drone in question was a reconnaissance vehicle on a mission to coordinate a Ukrainian 'kamikaze' drone attack on CPC infrastructure in Kazakh territory. Russian media described the drone as a French-made UAV used by the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian Military Center, a Kyiv-based public organization with strong ties to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, accused Russia of trying to stoke 'an international provocation,' adding that the photo of the downed drone published by Kazakh media bears no resemblance to the design of the French-made drone that Russian sources say it is. The Ukrainian Military Center also posted visual evidence that indicates the vehicle is Russian-made, saying 'the characteristic shape of the hull, fuselage elements and the drone’s camera unequivocally confirm that it was the Orlan-10 drone that went down in Kazakhstan.' According to Kazakh media reports, the drone is now being analyzed by Kazakh military experts at a facility in the regional capital Uralsk. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry announced it will seek discussions with Ukrainian officials about drone attacks. 'This is a very important issue for the economy of Kazakhstan, and we will certainly discuss this situation with our Ukrainian partners through diplomatic channels,' the official Kazinform news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. Kazakh officials at the same time are downplaying the impact of the February 17 attack on the CPC pumping station, saying it 'will not pose risks to the transportation of Kazakh oil,' according to the Kazinform report. Export data raises questions about the reliability of Russian damage estimates to the CPC pumping station. The Reuters news agency reported that Kazakhstan pumped a record high volume of oil on February 19, two days after the Ukrainian drone attack on the pumping station. 'It was not immediately clear how Kazakhstan had been able to pump record volumes given output increases need to correspond with export pipeline capacity,' the Reuters report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqz8NOjERTJH6	2025-02-21T16:18:50-08:00	
British Court Confirms Vatican Was Defrauded In London Real Estat...	By Victoria Cardiel A ruling by the High Court of England and Wales published Feb. 21 has confirmed that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived by Italian financier Raffaele Mincione in the irregular purchase of a London building. For this transaction that ended in fraud Mincione was sentenced in December 2023 by a Vatican lower court to five years and six months in prison for financial crimes related to the case. In addition, he was ordered to forfeit 200.5 million euros (about $210 million), one of the largest financial penalties ever imposed in the Vatican courts. In that trial, Cardinal Angelo Becciu was also sentenced to five and a half years in prison for embezzlement of public funds. According to the ruling, Becciu arranged the acquisition of property located on Sloane Avenue when he was deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2018. To do so, he used a third of the reserved funds of the Secretariat of State: that is, $200 million that was paid between 2013 and 2014 at the request of Becciu. This amount was used to buy shares through a fund managed by the Italian intermediary Mincione, who was also convicted along with Becciu by the Vatican lower court for money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. Following the sentence, Mincione filed a lawsuit against the Vatican Secretariat of State in British court in June 2020, and the court published its ruling Feb. 21. The Italian financier’s aim was to obtain a series of legal declarations in his favor regarding his handling of the buying and selling of the Sloane Avenue building. Mincione argued that his conduct in the transaction had been transparent and in accordance with the standards of good faith. However, the British court rejected his allegations, confirming that the Vatican had reasons to consider itself the victim of a damaging financial scheme. According to Judge Robin Knowles’ 50-page ruling, Mincione and his companies withheld key information and misrepresented the value of the London property, causing significant harm to the Vatican. The court found that Mincione made 'unrealistic' statements, inflating the price of the property and taking advantage of the Vatican’s lack of experience in such investments. Much of the lengthy summary of the verdict focuses on the reconstruction of the irregular transaction.The British court made it clear that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived, which coincides with the primary thesis of the Vatican court, which had previously convicted Mincione of money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. As a lower court ruling, Mincione has the possibility of appealing the decision. For the Vatican, the ruling 'has important implications not only for Mincione but also for future cases involving the financial operations of the Holy See,' according to a Vatican News editorial on the subject. According to Vatican journalist Andrea Tornielli, the ruling 'establishes an important precedent by recognizing that the Vatican was the victim of financial fraud in one of its most important real estate investments.' He also confirmed that according to the Vatican 'the lack of transparency and ethics with which Mincione and his entourage operated could influence other ongoing judicial proceedings.' The sentence reinforces, Tornielli said, 'the conclusions of the Vatican tribunal, which had already convicted Mincione for crimes related to fraudulent investments of funds of the Holy See.' Tornielli also referenced a statement by the Vatican promoter of justice, Alessandro Diddi, expressing his satisfaction with the British court’s ruling against Mincione. 'The British judges have shared the view of the Vatican tribunal and have confirmed that Raffaele Mincione did not act in good faith as required in this type of transaction. With this ruling, it is clear that the Vatican court acted correctly in its assessment of the case,' Diddi said. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

What We Can Learn From Burckhardt’s Writings – Analysis	By Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was a prominent Swiss traveler, historian and orientalist who visited the Arabian Peninsula in the early 19th century. He is known for his accurate and fair observations. Burckhardt studied Islamic religion and the Arabic language in Britain before embarking on a journey with a pilgrimage caravan to Makkah during the era of the First Saudi State. His writings are considered a significant contemporary source of historical information. He relied on his personal observations and social analysis of the society at that time, in addition to oral narratives and a limited number of written sources, and he produced remarkable works about the period following the founding of the First Saudi State. How can the concept of the state accommodate the population of the Arabian Peninsula, the majority of whom are composed of nomadic tribes? How can the concept of exploitation and plunder through influence and power, which involves seizing the spoils from the weaker, be eradicated so that the populace can develop the vision of a state founded on integrity, Islamic principles, security, and peace? Burckhardt addressed these inquiries, conveying a detailed historical account through the pages of his books. Judicial reform Burkhardt presented an orientalist vision from outside the Arabian Peninsula, which articulated the existence of state values that the inhabitants had not previously recognized. This perspective imposed upon them, as individuals accountable to the state, the concepts of stability and peace, which had been absent for centuries in the region. It also addressed the management of tribal relations and governance, the importance of respecting the judiciary for the first time in centuries, and the prohibition of the use of force and weaponry. This wisdom represented a novel vision and direction for the residents of the Arabian Peninsula, emphasizing that the state bears responsibility for their welfare. The judiciary was the authority to which all tribes turned for arbitration, and it represented one of the most significant outcomes of the state’s legal framework, originating from Diriyah, the capital, and extending beyond it through individuals known for their integrity. The state directly allocated funds as a new legal system, replacing the traditional customs that had been prevalent among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula in previous centuries, where expenses were incurred by the disputing parties to discuss and resolve their cases. In the judicial system, the right to appeal a decision was also guaranteed under the First Saudi State across all its regions, specifically through the review process in Diriyah, to consider the appeal of the decision, representing a new development in a judicial system that differs from previous practices in the region’s history. Security for all Burckhardt also discussed how the early Saudis approached the concepts of security and peace for all inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. The state entrusted the complete responsibility for investigating thefts occurring within their territories to tribal leaders and local rulers. They were penalized with fines equivalent to the value of the livestock or property that had been stolen. The leaders of the regions and the chiefs of the tribes were thus tasked with protecting their neighbors and travelers just as they would safeguard their own properties. Consequently, there was a cessation of thefts and acts of plunder that had previously occurred. This level of order following the establishment of the state had not been experienced by the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula since the time of the Prophet and the era of the rightly guided caliphs. Burckhardt noted that a merchant could traverse the Arabian Peninsula alone with complete safety, and that the Bedouins slept without fear of nighttime thieves targeting their livestock and possessions. Burckhardt wrote about the personal guards of the imam, known as the Munqiya, who were recognized as some of the bravest knights of the Arabian Peninsula and formidable warriors. They were permanently stationed in Diriyah and served as a regular force for the state. To join this elite group, one needed to be a distinguished knight with a notable reputation among his people before gaining recognition from others. Each member was provided with a suitable horse or camel from the royal stables, received a salary, and was equipped to the highest standards. The horses or camels were outfitted with gear made from wool covered with felt, which offered significant protection against swords and spears. State protocols In Burckhardt’s writings, there is a notable emphasis on the social details pertaining to the state, particularly highlighting the era of Imam Saud bin Abdulaziz. This historical account is rarely found among local historians, who express admiration for the imam’s elegance and his keen attention to his appearance and pleasant demeanor. Additionally, it is noted that he took great care in grooming his mustache and beard, distinguishing himself from others primarily through the opulence and cleanliness of his attire, as well as the fragrances emanating from his headscarf. Burkhardt elaborated on intricate details of royal etiquette. He discussed the protocol of the Salwa Palace, located in the At-Turaif District, which was home to Imam Saud, and the manner in which princes from various countries and tribal leaders were received. Additionally, he described the palace’s engagement in hosting guests, including the provision of lunch and dinner, as well as the care for horses and camels of the visiting dignitaries. The majlis’s reception times were designated for three specific periods: early morning after dawn; after the afternoon prayer until sunset; and again after the evening prayer late into the night. This latter time was often reserved for the family of the imam and his descendants who happened to be present in Diriyah. Anyone wishing to meet the imam could simply approach the majlis. The common titles used by the public to address the imam included Saud, Abu Abdullah, and Abu al-Shawarib. The majlis was always enriched with the recitation of the Qur’an, discussions of Hadith, interpretations, and cultural insights from the scholars of the court. Imam Saud would conclude the session by addressing the book intended for explanation, followed by a serious discussion among the scholars regarding its contents and a thoughtful exchange of perspectives. According to Burkhardt’s testimony, Imam Saud excelled over others in his profound cultural knowledge, dialogue, and persuasive abilities. This was evident in his high-level writings that demonstrated his skill in persuasion. His eloquence and melodious voice particularly sparked curiosity and admiration, enabling his words to resonate deeply with the hearts of the Arabs around him. The generosity of the imam and his hospitality toward his guests astonished this orientalist, particularly in his description of the stable housing 2,000 Arabian horses. Additionally, he noted the presence of 500 family members and attendants, all of whom were provided with ample food, including rice, bulgur, dates, and lamb, sufficient to accommodate both them and the palace guests. The imam as a father Burkhardt illustrates the imam’s dedication to the upbringing of his children, particularly his son Abdullah, who would later become an imam himself. At the age of five, he was taught to ride horses, allowing him to experience the thrill of galloping. Additionally, the imam is said to have closely observed his children’s behavior and imparted wisdom and sound advice to them. His fondness for fatherhood is evident to anyone who visits the At-Turaif District, where the proximity of the imam’s palace to his sons’ residences is apparent. Imam Saud exemplified wisdom and the ability to address issues swiftly. He was highly educated, possessing a profound understanding of politics. He garnered significant popularity among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. His military engagements began at the age of 12. One of the most emotionally significant family moments for Imam Saud occurred during his pilgrimage when he stood before the Kaaba as the people of Saudi Arabia were adorning it with a new covering from Al-Ahsa. While he was preoccupied with observing the pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba, his son Fahd’s wife approached him, cradling her child in her arms. She had come to fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam and was eager for Imam Saud to meet his grandson, whom he had never seen before. In a tender moment witnessed by all the pilgrims, the imam took the child into his arms, embracing and kissing him affectionately for an extended period. I appreciated Burkhardt’s awareness of social details and the sincerity of his expression; this is what distinguishes a writer from any nation when viewed from an external perspective with a different Western lens. He captures intricate details that may have seemed insignificant to people at the time, which later became a vital source for studying the history of the era. Thank you, Burkhardt, for that account which transported us to the First Saudi State with remarkable detail and precision. Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen is the special projects executive director at the Diriyah Gate Development Authority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq19R-LfGYFIe	2025-02-21T16:08:16-08:00
