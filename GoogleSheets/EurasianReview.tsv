The Trump Factor And Iran’s Choices – Analysis	By Gaddam Dharmendra In recent weeks, the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been compelled to cope with mounting challenges on multiple fronts, and typically, the Iranians have responded with their penchant and affinity to indulge in playing multi-dimensional chess. Good on paper but difficult to pull off. In a series of visits and outreach, senior Iranian officials have been lobbying capitals across the region. In parallel, there has been carefully choreographed posts on social media platforms, including X (formerly known as Twitter). Both tracks are moving in tandem and are characteristically a mix of bravado and obfuscation. But this heightened Iranian diplomatic activity masks growing concerns within top leadership levels, of Iran’s deep seated but well concealed structural vulnerabilities which now stand exposed like never before. Tehran’s anxieties First and foremost, the most obvious cause for Iran’s anxiety is Donald Trump’s re-election. The main actors tasked to drive President-elect Trump’s foreign policy have been announced, giving an insight into the policy priorities and preferred direction of Trump’s second term. All pointers are of continuity of the avowedly pro-Israel stance witnessed in the first term. A resumption of the muscular approach towards Iran is certainly in the offing. This is bound to be compounded by allegations of Iran’s involvement in an alleged plot to assassinate Trump. Not surprisingly, statements emanating from Iran soon after Trump’s election signal a carefully calibrated yet nuanced dialing down of their hitherto confrontationist approach. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took to X, rejecting the FBI’s assassination charges and advising that for the US the 'The path forward is (also) a choice. It begins with respect.' In the same post, Araghchi categorically assures that 'Iran is NOT after nuclear weapons, period.' Given also the tumultuous precedence of Trump’s cabinet during his first term, the regular parade of dismissals and resignations, Trump’s appointments would need to be viewed with a degree of caution as regards the longevity of each appointee and consequently of policy consistency. But then Trump thrives on pulling off the unpredictable. Second are widespread assessments that Trump’s foreign policy priorities will include ending the war in Ukraine and restoring the maximum pressure on Iran witnessed in his first term. Any outcome on the former is likely to impinge on the latter, given the transactional relationship which Russia and Iran have established in recent years. Cessation of hostilities in Ukraine could free up the US to re-engage Russia and potentially enlist Russian support in the UNSC/IAEA on the Iran file. Third, the recent months have seen Iran suffer a series of devastating if self-inflicted setbacks. Israel has reestablished its military dominance by inflicting irreparable damage to Iran’s Axis of Resistance across Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. The targeted decimation of top commanders and cadres of Hamas and Hezbollah, along with their weapons and missile stores, and disruption to Iran’s ability to use the Syrian land-route for supplies has severely crippled the Axis. Consequently, Iran’s pursuit of a forward defense strategy, of encircling and cornering Israel through these proxy militia groups as part of its 'ring of fire' strategy, has been eroded, perhaps irreversibly. Related to this, and yet another cause of concern for Iran, has been Israeli intelligence’s deep penetration and compromise of the Axis. Israel’s HUMINT assets were important inputs leading to the assassination of high value targets such as Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas’ Ismail Haniyeh in a safehouse in Tehran guarded by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The rate of attrition has been such that the IRGC even decided to pull back several of its field commanders due to these losses including the death of its commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Israel’s bombing of the Annex housing the Iranian consular section in Damascus. That an Iranian fingerprint is present across every trouble spot in the Levant is further evidenced by the fact that Iran has enabled the rise of a new Axis benefactor in the form of the Houthis in Yemen. Houthi missiles have repeatedly struck deep inside Israel and disrupted shipping in the vital sea lanes along the Red Sea and Suez Canal routes. The latter has had a global impact, effecting supply chains and raising the cost of shipping and insurance. Fourth is the dangerous emergence into the open of the long running hostility between Israel and Iran. Both have shed their decades long shadow war and have, till date, exchanged two rounds of direct attacks on each other’s territory, the latest being the October 26 Israeli strikes on Iran. While reports from within Iran are typically difficult to discern as to their factual accuracy, Israel has claimed that it has decapacitated much of Iran’s air defenses giving it freedom to operate at will within Iran. Last but not the least are the rapid strides in Iran’s nuclear programme. Its stockpiles of enriched uranium are well beyond the limits set by the now defunct JCPOA, including 164 kg of uranium U-235 enriched to 60% (data is as per IAEA’s quarterly report for August 2024). These levels are within touching distance of the vital threshold of 90% enriched U-235 needed for a nuclear weapon. These capabilties make Iran the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to levels well beyond that needed for peaceful purposes. The changed West Asia landscape In dealing with Iran, the in-coming Trump Administration will have to contend with the reality of the unprecedented changes that have taken place in the preceding four years in the stubbornly challenging West Asia landscape. Trump will have to contend with and shape his policies around several new factors which have emerged and are now driving regional dynamics. The most important of these, representing a fundamental shift, is the mutual courtship between Iran and its neighbors. Iran’s late President Ebrahim Raesi, a surprise ascendent to the presidency in August 2021, put in place the twin foreign policy pillars of stabilizing Iran’s neighborhood and pursuing a pronounced anti-west policy in the guise of a look east policy. Thus, Iran’s pursuit of its version of neighborhood first, received initially with caution by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), gave way to the current sustained and wider engagement led mainly by the Saudis and the Emiratis. Here, two inter-related dynamics are at play. From Iran’s perspective, normalizing relations with the GCC enables it to address the latent threat posed to its regional ambitions by the Abraham Accords. And, from the GCC’s perspective, setting aside deep-seated historic and sectarian divisions by engaging Iran frees them up from the threat of potentially damaging strikes Iran had previously demonstrated viz. in 2019 Iran was widely held responsible for sabotaging shipping in the Hormuz Strait, the audacious shooting down of a US RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV and the impressively precise drone strikes on Saudi’s Aramco oil facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais). The GCC’s overarching calculus is to avoid a confrontation with a near neighbor, one that would have incalculable economic costs and set back the ambitious reform agendas being pursued by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and the Emirates’ Mohammad bin Zayed. As political scientist Avron Oshtavar posits: 'Iran’s improved regional standing and strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in particular, will make it difficult for the Trump administration to replicate its previous strategy toward Iran. Although Washington might try, Iran can no longer be as easily marginalised, and America’s Arab partners are unlikely to want to assist in the reinforcement of existing sanctions on Iran.' On Iran’s nuclear programme, Trump will have to contend with the consequences of his disastrous May 2018 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal or JCPOA. This time around, he can take advantage of several fortuitous developments. First, Iran’s weapons program appears to have been dealt a severe blow by recent Israeli strikes. Reports have claimed that in its strikes carried out in late October, Israel had successfully struck a top-secret Iranian nuclear weapon’s research facility at Parchin (near Tehran). These reports perhaps help explain Araghchi’s post conveying a categorical assurance that Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons. Parsing beyond the standard Iranian trait of bluster and combative rhetoric, this is a reasonable opening for all sides to address Iran’s nuclear issue. This is evident from Iran’s hasty green lighting of the long-delayed visit to Tehran by DG-IAEA Rafael Grossi. It is no coincidence that the Grossi’s visit took place within weeks of Trump’s reelection and Israeli claims of striking the Parchin nuclear research facilities. In fact, during his visit to Tehran, Grossi said: 'I made a request for Iran to stop increasing the stockpile of 60% and this was accepted. This is what we agreed and I hope this will hold. We will see.' The JCPOA legally expires in October next year. Foreign Minister Araghchi and others in Iran have signalled a willingness to negotiate a new deal based on the JCPOA but taking into consideration the changed realities. Trump the archetypical dealmaker, with his uniquely unconventional approach to international relations, can tease out the ‘bazaari’ in the Iranians and cajole them to settle for a deal. We have before us some interesting scenarios. The fact is, Iran is in a much weaker position than ever since the 1979 revolution. While its brutal internal repression has secured it against domestic challengers, its external overreach through its Axis proxies has proved costly. Iran is clearly hurting from the series of setbacks dealt by Israel in recent months. This is therefore an opportune time to be seized by all sides.

No Easy Cure For The Philippines’ HIV Crisis – Analysis	By Marph Daryl O Porras Since the first confirmed case of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the Philippines in 1984, cases have skyrocketed, with an average of 55 individuals diagnosed daily in 2024. This surge has highlighted the urgent need to address the rapidly evolving HIV epidemic in the country. Despite efforts from government agencies and non-governmental organisations, regulating the growing number of cases remains a significant challenge. The amendment of the Republic Act (RA) 8504 to RA 11166 in December 2018 represented a significant step forward in the Philippines’ response to the HIV epidemic. The expanded provisions on HIV screening and the inclusion of a community-based approach are crucial for addressing the growing number of cases and improving access to healthcare for people living with HIV. But the implementation of RA 11166 faces several challenges. Limited resources for HIV prevention, screening, treatment and care, coupled with pervasive stigmatisation and discrimination of HIV patients, can reduce individuals’ motivation to get tested and seek treatment. Ensuring accessibility to HIV services for all, regardless of sexual orientation and socioeconomic status, is crucial but challenging. Articles IV and VI of RA 11166 legally protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals with HIV/AIDS and prohibit compulsory HIV testing unless medically necessary. Despite these challenges, RA 11166 represents a significant opportunity for the Philippines to improve its response to the HIV epidemic. By effectively implementing its provisions and addressing the underlying challenges, the Philippines can make progress in reducing HIV transmission, improving the lives of people living with HIV and promoting sexual health for all. How HIV is perceived and experienced within communities plays a significant role in exacerbating the epidemic. Vulnerable groups in HIV transmission — including men who have sex with men — represented 89 per cent of new HIV infections in 2023. The mobility of such vulnerable groups makes it more challenging and complicated to analyse the spatial distribution of HIV. Individuals may undergo HIV testing in a different location from where they live but continue their high-risk behaviours in their local communities, complicating the HIV response. Addressing the HIV epidemic in the Philippines requires a collaborative, multi-sectoral approach, sustained political commitment and active community involvement. While non-governmental organisations have made significant strides in implementing transformative programs, government leadership is crucial for sustainable impact. The Philippines can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for people living with HIV by prioritising government efforts to combat stigma, partnering with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to strengthen interventions, focusing on prevention and treatment and advocating for policy changes. Specifically, the government can use its existing partnerships with NGOs to further strengthen community-based organisations, which are well placed to aid prevention and treatment since they already work directly in the community. The government should also consider establishing community-based organisations in areas where HIV cases are rising. In terms of policy change, local ordinances — especially those related to confidentiality and HIV testing — must be aligned with the amended Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act. It is also essential to address the challenges of limited healthcare access in various regions. Investing in upgrading HIV care facilities — especially in areas with a high prevalence of HIV — and providing specialised training for healthcare providers can help ensure quality care and improve outcomes. By addressing both societal stigma and healthcare access, the Philippines can make significant progress in combating the HIV epidemic and improving the lives of people living with HIV. While many HIV care facilities and treatment hubs have been established across the Philippines, the implementation of their programs has varying success. Challenges include the unstable supply of diagnostics and the use and monitoring of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications used to prevent HIV transmission through sexual contact or injection drug use. These challenges undermine the effectiveness of the HIV response in addressing the growing number of HIV cases, particularly in regions with high prevalence. In urban areas of the Philippines, where HIV cases are substantial, healthcare facilities offer essential frontline services such as HIV screening, confirmatory testing and antiretroviral therapy. But the quality of these services often falls short of meeting the needs of the increasing number of HIV patients. This is particularly challenging at the local level due to the absence of local AIDS ordinancesthat adhere to their mandate. To improve healthcare access for HIV patients, it is crucial that facilities are adequately equipped to handle the high volume of cases in their regions. This may involve investing in additional resources, upgrading facilities and specialised training for healthcare providers. To address stigma and discrimination, the Philippines should strengthen education and information dissemination as stipulated in Article II of RA 11166. The sense of urgency in taking meaningful action is evident as cases continue to rise where patients as young as 15 years old are being diagnosed with HIV. Action is needed to mainstream HIV/AIDS policies and conduct further study on risk behaviours, stigma and discrimination in the Philippines.

Digging Up The Roots Of Human Culture – Analysis	What led humans on the unique path of cultural development? And can we do anything useful with newly reconstructed histories of this process? Culture is central to defining humanity. Throughout history, many definitions have been proposed to describe what we mean when we talk about culture, leading to considerable confusion. The word 'culture' was once reserved to designate the customs and behaviors of particular groups of people in specific regions and timeframes. In recent years, however, definitions concerning what is and what is not culture have widened considerably, to the point where 'culture' is now used to describe the behaviors of numerous life forms. For example, it has become common to refer to culture when describing the social structures of sperm whales and other animals, including insects. But while animal culture denotes behaviors that are learned and socially transmitted, human cultural practices go further, transforming these behaviors into coded systems that are reproduced within specific group settings. This explains the emergence of tradition—a key element of culture that seems exclusive to humans. Traditions provide abstract mechanisms through which humans symbolically assimilate the concept of identity over time. This deeply symbolic derivation is only observed in humans. Human societies imbue culture with a network of meanings that can be shared and understood symbolically by individuals belonging to a particular social structure (family, tribe, community, and nation). The further we go back in time, the more difficult it becomes to reestablish the abstract (contingent) connections that once linked these symbols to their meanings. Over time, human culture has not only included the concrete manifestations of extrasomatic survival strategies but also encompassed abstract notions that are barely perceptible in archeological records. The emergence of stone tools more than 3 million years ago marks the birth of culture in the human lineage. When the first Homo habilis remains were discovered at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in the early 1960s, its name, which means handyman, was based on the idea that this hominin was the first toolmaker. This justified its placement at the root of the human family tree: the first species of the genus Homo. However, this anthropocentric denomination proved to be short-lived. As early as the 1970s, the probability that other genuses, like Australopithecines and Paranthropus, were also making tools, came to light in some archeological records. This likelihood continues to be supported by new data, including discoveries of sites yielding stone tools that predate the emergence of H. habilis. Because they were systematically made using techniques that had to be learned and shared communally, these activities meet the standard definition of culture used by cultural anthropologists. Furthermore, the repetitive technologies employed to make stone tools are defined as traditions, adding further weight toward culture. From this stage forward, for a period spanning almost the entire evolutionary trajectory of our genus (some 2.8 million years), stone toolkits provide virtually the only material evidence that catalogs successive phases of human cultural evolution leading to the present. Ancient stone tools are essential for tracking cultures and their interactions. In studying them, we can see how culture evolves on uneven pathways on a cumulative trajectory. As human societies grew and sharpened their technological capacity, their cultural repertoire expanded, a process characterized not only by the empirical remains of their material culture but also by increasingly elaborate symbolic behaviors that—we logically infer—mirror the emergence of human consciousness. The complex interplay of inter- and intra-human population exchanges and the capacity for learning, along with curiosity and inventiveness, have combined through time to create our species' current state. Despite the fragmentary nature of archeological records, studying ancient stone toolkits brings to light precious information allowing us to recognize culture in the deep past. Lithic specialists, for example, identify and describe the specific stylistic traits and chains of production in the toolkits, permitting scientific inferences that contribute to the knowledge about our cognitive evolution. Archeologists combine 'cultural' data with fossil genomics to track and compare hominin lineages and reconstruct the 2.8 million-year-old story of our genus. They are seeing a braided account of populations distinguished by their cultural manifestations and divided into groups with divergent species across continents. Today, however, with only one species of Homo remaining on the planet (H. sapiens), the supposed intra-human differences no longer have any biological foundation and have been laid bare for what they are: purely symbolic cultural constructions. Parallels are drawn to compare human expressions of culture and analogous behaviors in other life forms. This is demonstrated in primate studies and has often been recognized in the pioneering work of Jane Goodall in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, during the 1960s, when she observed wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) modifying branches and using them as tools to probe for termites in termite mounds. Some believe these observations could serve as a template for early hominin toolmaking behavior, a hypothesis supported by the close genetic proximity of chimpanzees to humans and their apparent physical similarities. Primate toolmaking capacity continues to be explored in the wild and in captivity, yielding probing results. Interestingly, other animals, such as crows, practice surprisingly similar behaviors, also modifying leaves to probe into crevices to retrieve insects, and even inventing compound tools. These 'crow tools' are uncannily similar to those made by chimpanzees; the manufacturing processes, aims, and outcomes are also comparable. Undoubtedly, there is a considerable gap separating the degree to which humans have developed material and immaterial cultures and the behaviors we observe in other animals. Through time, only humans have developed toolmaking into a fundamental adaptive strategy resulting in the techno-dependent species we have become. More importantly, only humans imbue their manufactured objects and behaviors with symbolically relevant identitarian meaning. Language is a central pillar in any discussion about human culture and its origins; its emergence has been linked to the evolution of stone tool technologies. As early Homo reaped the benefits of their toolmaking capacity, they also increased their ability to compete with other animals for resources and these advantages gave them more free time to develop innovative ways to expand their benefits. Through time, successive hominin ancestors invented new and increasingly complex toolkits, requiring individuals to spend more time learning to make them. This process eventually came to depend on vocal communication strategies. Paleoanthropologists have demonstrated that the cerebral and anatomical configurations necessary for spoken language could have resulted from changes in craniofacial features occurring over millions of years, as early hominins adapted to upright stature and bipedal locomotion. As hominins came to rely on specific kinds of stone tools, the conditions that made language physically possible also led to its selection and development as an advantageous adaptive culture-sharing strategy. When we think about what is unique about human culture, we often consider technology as central to characterizing civilizations. Technologies have evolved over time to synchronize culture in a way that assimilates individuals into discrete (but potentially huge) collaborative social units; in doing so, it plays a vital role in the mental construction of both personal and shared identities. Sharing culture and technological know-how creates a common sense of time. Museums, historical sites, and fictional history present the past through symbols of progress or failure and thus serve to chart a shared timeline. Although archeological records correspond to a series of sequential stages—advancing our species through a process of 'progress'—there is no inherent hierarchy to these developments, either at the biological or the cultural levels. For those educated within a cultural framework that explains prehistory as a linear and codependent set of chronological milestones—whose successive stages are understood by conjured logical systems of cause and effect—this outlook is going to take time to be accepted. It takes an intellectual leap to reject such hierarchical constructions of prehistory and to perceive the past as a system of nonsynchronous events closely tied to the shifting ecological and biological phenomena. This endeavor, however, allows people to recognize and use the lessons offered by the past. Notably, the fact that complexity of modern human culture results from baseline learning processes bolstered through time by biosocial adaptations. The long-term processes involved in human techno-selection have been compared to Darwinian natural selection: like biological evolution, technosocial innovations can emerge and persist, or remain latent in the human repertory. When specific conditions arise, they can be selected and, if successful, be developed into defining aspects of the human condition. At each stage of evolution, latent technological capacities exist within the structure of cultural variability; in different regions or time frames, they are selected, used, and refined, leading human groups to choose divergent evolutionary pathways. Refining these skills can even trigger technological revolutions; when the changes lead to positive results, they can set off wider cultural transformations in the populations that use them. Culture evolves along diachronic trends. Distinct evolutionary stages occur (or not) in different areas of the world, sometimes in very divergent chronological frameworks. Humans have learned to adapt to rapid cumulative technological change by developing complex social behaviors as an adaptive response that favors the survival of our species. This process may have started gradually, but with the accumulation of breakthroughs, it continues in leaps and bounds into the present day. Triggering a social response that could evolve in parallel to technological progress resulted in the emergence and sharpening of cultural traditions and identities, springboarding our genus toward exponential increases in social complexity. The archeological records and our own intuitive cerebral processes preserve the memory of our acquired anatomical and cultural developments. They are two sides of the same coin that evolved throughout human prehistory and beyond. Like other primates, humans are social animals, and as individuals, we need to learn, imitate, and emulate 'acceptable' behaviors within specific contexts. Culture represents the set of norms transmitted from generation to generation and dictates how individuals must behave to maintain social balance. Humanity shares and exchanges culture, but over time, we have also learned to exploit the constructed sets of cultural norms that define the social unit we belong to and justify the exclusion of people living in less favorable situations. Humanity uses culture to invent differences between people with identical biological makeup, needs, and desires. We have an increasingly useful 7-million-year-old global data set to better understand ourselves and how to survive and improve our well-being. With time, it will be increasingly recognized that using this information as a reference and planning tool is advantageous for practically every endeavor.

Trade And Tariffs To Dominate US-China Ties Under Trump – Analysi...	By Alex Willemyns Donald Trump has made no secret of his plans to hit China with massive tariffs. The only question is how much exactly. Calling tariffs 'the most beautiful word in the dictionary,' the president-elect threatened during the 2024 election campaign to hit Chinese imports with tariffs of 'more than' 60%, effectively slamming the brakes on trade between the world’s two biggest economies. On Monday, he said that whatever rate was ultimately levied, there would be an extra 10% tariff on top of that to punish Beijing for continued outflows of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which U.S. authorities say is killing around 75,000 Americans a year. All that suggests that the U.S.-China relationship looks set under the second Trump presidency to become increasingly dominated by a grand rebalancing of trade ties, experts told Radio Free Asia. In many ways, they said, things will pick right up from where Trump left them in January 2021, having hit China with some $50 billion worth of tariffs, which the Biden administration has since declined to roll back. Yet things may be a lot different this time. Trump tariffs 2.0 Beijing now has nearly a decade of experience in dealing with trade pressure from the United States, said Shanghai-based Han Lin, the China country director for the Asia Group business consultancy. While the world’s second-biggest economy was looking to increased exports as its ticket out of slumping growth, he said, Chinese economic officials also now have experience with retaliatory measures and knowledge of how best to hit back at aggressive U.S. policies. 'China is better prepared now than during Trump 1.0,' Lin told RFA. 'It has a wider range of carrot-and-stick trade responses, but the ever-present need for foreign investment may calibrate their behavior to send a message of strength without unnecessary escalation.' A likely response from Beijing, he explained, would be to let the Chinese yuan 'drift weaker,' so the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar makes Chinese goods more competitive for American buyers without directly needing to confront Trump or spark a tit-for-tat trade war. 'This will help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on China exporters,' he said, noting they would 'inevitably' get requests to lower their prices from American importers looking to avoid their own revenue losses. But it’s not even clear yet how much damage control will be needed. Zhiwu Chen, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, said China’s leadership likely saw Trump’s campaign threats of 60% tariffs as more of a 'negotiating tactic' than a solid policy promise. From Beijing’s view, he said, the final tariff rate was likely to be lower – especially if China agrees to buy more American exports like agricultural goods or oil, thereby mitigating the U.S. current account deficit. 'What the leadership in Beijing learned from Trump 1.0 is that he is for real and transactional, kind of like an open book, so they may prefer his style, though they don’t like his bare-knuckle style,' Chen said, adding he believed trade ties could even 'warm up somewhat in 2025.' Trump ally Elon Musk would be a key dissenting voice in the White House, he explained, and would advocate against a total decoupling with the Chinese market, given his extensive business ties there. 'Elon Musk can be counted on to temper that push as Tesla depends so much on the China market,' Chen told Radio Free Asia. The art of the deal Others are less convinced that the author of the 'The Art of the Deal' is necessarily so focussed this time on striking a deal with Beijing. Tao Wang, the Hong Kong-based chief China economist at the UBS Investment Bank, noted that China’s government would not blush at the idea of negotiating with Trump to find a new status quo. 'I think the Chinese government would be very open to having a deal,' Wang at a Nov. 20 event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'It’s just not really clear to me what Trump would want.' 'Last time, he said he’s the great salesperson – he wants to sell more soybeans, and LNG, and all these American products,' she said. 'Now he seems to want something different: He wants fiscal revenue from tariffs, and he wants to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.' On the campaign trail and in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10, Trump touted the fiscal revenue a 60% tariff on Chinese imports would generate, arguing that the funds paid by Chinese importers could even offset tax cuts for Americans. Still, even if Trump is serious about the 60% Chinese tariff rate, the practicalities of governing could temper his plans once in office. At the same Nov. 20 event, Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the campaign pledges of tariffs on China would be the easy part for Trump. When so many basic goods used by American consumers and businesses come from inexpensive Chinese sources, she argued, implementing the tariffs without fanning inflation would be the hard part. Economists warn that the tariffs on China will accelerate inflation just as the U.S. economy is recovering from an extended bout of surging prices. 'I don’t think anyone really knows how realistic his team has been about alternative sources,' Lovely said, explaining that the current White House had been struggling to diversify U.S. supply chains. 'We saw that in the Biden administration, where there was effort to create alternatives. They really didn’t make a whole lot of progress,' she said. 'This is a really difficult problem. I’m afraid we don’t know if the new team has really faced up to how difficult it is going to be.' Dear leader One thing seems clear though, and that’s that the U.S.-China relationship will increasingly be defined by the personal relationship between Xi and Trump, who in his first term variously expressed both admiration and disdain for China’s authoritarian leader. 'President Trump will probably want to engage directly with President Xi, and the leader-to-leader level interaction will color and inform the agenda and the tone of the relationship going forward,' said Ryan Hass, the director of the Brookings Institution’s John L. Thornton China Center, at an event hosted by the think tank on Friday. The Biden administration struggled to ignite talks between lower-level U.S. and Chinese officials. Bilateral tensions saw many Chinese officials – even the defense minister – ignore overtures from their U.S. counterparts, fearing the consequences of appearing too friendly. After Biden and Xi’s high-profile summit in San Francisco last November, though, cooperation at the lower levels was resumed. Still, Hass cautioned that Trump would not have absolute power in his dealmaking with Xi. Pressure would remain on him to maintain close alliances with allies like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, he said. 'President Trump is not Kim Jong Un: He does not decide by fiat what the United States is, or where the United States is going,' Hass said, noting Trump was now 'elderly' and 'in his final term' as president. He pointed to Rep. Matt Gaetz’s decision last week – apparently forced by Trump – to step aside as the nominee for attorney-general amid private opposition even from Trump-allied Senate Republicans. 'I mention that because President Trump’s views on alliances are also out-of-sync with the views of many members of Congress related to alliances,' Hass said, listing Senators Bill Hagerty, Jim Risch, Dan Sullivan and Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state. 'These are all Republicans who feel very strongly about the importance of alliances,' he said, 'so I encourage us to keep that front of mind.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazIjwOP08pqdw	2024-11-27T16:38:18-08:00	
Moldova’s Close Election Stands As Warning To Country’s Pro-Europ...	By David Smith (EurActiv) -- After suspected Russian interference in Moldova’s presidential election and EU referendum, Chisinau is calling for external support to consolidate its European path, while politicians have turned towards shoring up domestic political weaknesses ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections. On 20 October, Moldovan voters narrowly approved a referendum amending the constitution to include the national goal of EU integration by a vote of 50.4%. On 3 November, Moldova's President Maia Sandu won re-election in a runoff with Socialist candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo by 55% to 44%, thanks to high turnout among diaspora voters. Sandu narrowly lost the vote within Romania itself. Moldova’s former Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu recently wrote an opinion piecein Euractiv arguing that although the recent elections were closely contested, Moldovan voters sent a clear pro-European signal when factors such as global anti-incumbency sentiment and Russian interference were considered. While pro-European politicians in Moldova seek to portray an electoral victory, and opposition Socialist Party leaders declare that they do not recognize the results of the elections, all factions are attempting to impose their own narrative on a pair of close elections. The one narrative that is clear is the unprecedented nature of suspected Russian interference. Police have alleged that at least 130,000 citizens (around 7% of voter turnout in the runoff) received bribes via Russian banking apps in order to influence their votes. Following the election, police have levelled millions of Moldovan Lei in fines against voters who took bribes and continue investigations into Ilan Shor’s networks of voter bribery in Moldova. The scale of these efforts shocked Moldova and overwhelmed the systems meant to ensure a fair election. Prosecutors have alleged that the Russian security services coordinated the interference efforts and that one of their goals was to overwhelm Moldova’s justice system. In the first round of the presidential elections, Sandu’s campaign spent around $558,000, and the PAS party spent an additional $200,000 promoting the EU referendum. In the same period, police were able to track the $39 million spent by Ilan Shor’s network. This money represents voter bribery schemes in Moldova and not the extensive spending by Russian-linked oligarchs on platforms such as Facebook and Googlein the same time period. Additionally, there is emerging evidence of increasing anti-Moldovan influence campaigns pushed by Kremlin actors in Brussels and Washington and online in English. The sheer scale of resources at play is completely out of proportion with anything the Moldovan state has previously contended with. At the recent European Political Community Summit in Budapest, Sandu made her call clear, saying that Moldova needs more 'support to strengthen our institutions, to better protect democracy in the country.' Domestically, this election was a wake-up call that exposed serious political and institutional weaknesses that were leveraged by Russian interference. Moldova’s efforts at reforming the justice system and fighting corruption have been slow, and voters blame the government for the lack of tangible results. This was exemplified in the election itself, where courts showed themselves unable or unwilling to conduct speedy trials in cases of illicit financing. Thus far, no high-level Shor party officials have seen their cases completed in court, and all are free and continuing their political work as the trials stall on technicalities. Last week, Sandu levelled direct criticism at the country's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office for a 'complete failure in the fight against large-scale corruption, especially political corruption.' She has also convened the Supreme Security Council to make urgent recommendations for a new direction in justice reform. Any such new direction will need to progress quickly in order for changes to take effect before the 2025 parliamentary elections, which are expected in June. If tangible progress is made, it could help secure the vote and allow PAS to run on the tangible accomplishments that their voters demand. However, it is unlikely that all the underlying political issues that this election also exposed will be solved. While Moldovan political parties have always scrambled traditional right vs leftpolitical definitions, income and class divisions can be clearly seen in voter behaviour. Sandu and her PAS Party draw the majority of their support from the diaspora and more urban and middle-class voters. These voters understand the geopolitical questions around EU membership, the free movement of people and capital and the benefits that they have personally felt from closer EU ties. Pro-Russian parties gather most of their voters from villages and towns where incomes are low, and infrastructure lags behind the increasingly European cities. These voters do not frequently travel to Europe or to the capital and are less likely to vote on clearly geopolitical issues. Moldova does not currently have any pro-EU political parties on the left end of the ideological spectrum making a credible pitch to these voters. Looking ahead to the 2025 parliamentary elections, this is the area likely to be targeted by the so-called 'pseudo-European' politicians and parties that resemble the politics of the Georgian Dream. These parties profess to support EU integration while stressing social wedge issues such as gay rights and language politics and calling for a 'balanced' foreign policy between Russia and Europe. The results of the recent elections indicate fertile ground for these positions going into next year’s parliamentary elections. Combined with suspected Russian interference efforts, massive spending, and the continued weakness of Moldova’s justice system, Sandu and the PAS Party are likely to face serious challenges in the year ahead.

Mass Deportations: Unfeasible, Expensive And Would Undermine Othe...	President-elect Donald Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants in American history. His appointment of Thomas Homan, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as border czar signals his commitment to that promise. There are 11.7 million people residing in the United States illegally. 'Bottom line,' says Homan, 'if you’re in the country illegally, you’re not off the table.' Realistically, however, it is hard to imagine carrying out a mass deportation anywhere close to that number. The huge costs involved—including the not-inconsequential hidden costs—are almost certain to limit its scale. While discussing executive orders being written for the president to sign immediately after his inauguration, Trump transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, 'On Day One he’s going to open the largest deportation of illegal immigrants in American history.' As Homan has stated, 'Of course, there has to be historic deportation.' What would constitute a 'historic deportation'? During Trump’s first term, his administration deported 1.5 million undocumented immigrants. President Biden is on pace to deport the same number by the time he leaves office. Approximately 3 million people were deported during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office. So, for the last 16 years, 'normal' deportations have averaged 375,000 a year. The bulk of those deported were people apprehended after recently crossing the border. Deportations from the U.S. interior have averaged 100,000 annually for the past decade. What would it take to double or triple those numbers? First, there are not enough detention facilities to house millions of immigrants, nor are there enough immigration courts to process their cases for any immediate mass deportation. The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration advocacy organization, recently estimated that if sufficient detention facilities were constructed and nearly 1,000 immigration courts established, it would take a decade and cost almost $1 trillion to remove the undocumented immigrant population from the United States. Trump says, 'It’s not a question of a price tag. It’s not—really, we have no choice' other than mass deportation. However, the costs of removal are only the tip of the iceberg. There are other costs. For example, Trump has stated that he wants to make housing more affordable and decrease grocery prices. That won’t happen if homebuilders and food producers have to replace the nearly 1.6 million undocumented construction workers (25 percent of the total nationwide) and the tens of thousands of undocumented farm workers (more than 40 percent of the total) they now employ. Any mass deportation would drastically shrink the labor supply in these industries and increase consumer costs. Mass deportations also would undermine Trump’s promise to reinvigorate the economy. The American Immigration Council study estimates that a mass deportation would shrink the U.S. economy—that is, lower the overall gross domestic product—by 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent. A smaller and more targeted deportation seems likely, given the massive costs that counter Trump’s other goals. Homan has stated, 'You’ve got to prioritize where you go first' when choosing who to deport and that 'we’re going to concentrate on the worst of the worst.' According to a recent House Judiciary Committee report, ICE currently has a list of 617,607 non-detained undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime or have pending criminal charges. Presumably, they would constitute the 'worst of the worst.' Trump should concentrate his deportation agenda on this group: immigrants who are here illegally and who have committed serious crimes. Such a program would be logistically feasible, entail lower economic costs, wouldn’t undermine his other policy goals, and could still allow Trump to claim that he’s delivered a 'historic deportation.' Any mass deportation of non-criminal immigrants from the American interior will entail significant economic costs, tear hard-working families apart, and likely create serious public backlash. Trump would be more successful if he focused on deporting only criminals, while securing the border and opening greater paths for legal immigration to help fuel our economy.

Creeping Annexation? Moscow Expands Use Of Border Regions To Incr...	Vladimir Putin has taken another page from Stalin’s playbook and is using the western border regions of the Russian Federation to expand Moscow’s influence in neighboring Belarusian ones, weakening Minsk and raising questions about the Kremlin’s intentions not only with regard to annexing Belarus but using it to attack Ukraine. According to two new reports (rubaltic.ru/article/ekonomika-i-biznes/20241123-regiony-belarusi-i-rossii-uglublyayut-ekonomicheskoe-vzaimodeystvie/ and eurasia.expert/regiony-belarusi-i-rossii-ukreplyayut-gorizontalnye-svyazi/), Moscow has quietly expanded this effort over the last several months. Using border regions to promote larger policy goals has been a long-standing Russian and before that Soviet strategy (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2020/09/russian-governors-playing-increasing.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2019/12/cross-border-trade-means-for-russia-to.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2019/06/moscow-expanding-its-influence-in.html). But the situation with regard to such regional cooperation in the Russian-Belarusian case now inevitably raises questions about Moscow’s intentions -- especially in the wake of Putin’s war in Ukraine, one that the Kremlin invoked as a casus belli earlier transfers of what it claims as Russian territories, including Crimea and the Donbass, to Ukraine. That is all the more so because as one Moscow writer has pointed out, 'the most significant land gift from the RSRSR under Stalin' to another republic did not involve transfer of control of territory from Russia to Ukraine but land from Russia to Belarus (russian7.ru/post/kakie-territorii-stalin-prisoedinil/). Between 1924 and 1926, the Soviet government transferred from the RSFSR to Belarus, almost all of Vitebsk, Mogilyev and Gomel oblasts, moves far larger than the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine and that increased the size of the Belarusian SSR by three times (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2018/07/stalin-frequently-modified-russias.html).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazCCbvh2Vx6BW	2024-11-27T16:33:17-08:00	
The Jerusalem Temple And Its Older Brother: The Ka’ba – OpEd	Narrated Abu Dhar: I said, 'O Allah's Messenger, which (Holy Site) mosque was first built on the surface of the earth?' He said, 'Al- Masjid-ul-, Haram (in Mecca).' I said, 'Which was built next?' He replied 'The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) .' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3366 In-book reference : Book 60, Hadith 45 USC-MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 585) The Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) and the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca are the two most well-known sites for monotheistic pilgrimage in the world. The Islamic Hajj to the Ka'ba in Makka, and the Jewish Hajj to the Temple in Jerusalem, have been alternate swings of a single sacred pendulum connecting earthly humans to one monotheistic Divine source in the heavens. The Ka'ba was the original site of the Islamic Hajj. Destroyed in the days of Noah, it was later rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. After several centuries it was desecrated by later generations of idol worshipers. During the centuries while the Ka'ba was desecrated, Prophet Solomon built a Temple in Jerusalem for Jewish Haj on the site where Abraham bound his son Isaac as an offering to God.Four centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed in 587 BCE by the Babylonians. Then the Temple was rebuilt with the support of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and lasted for almost six centuries. As Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE) states; Jewish pilgrims came to Jerusalem from the ends of the earth, and from all the compass points. But with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, the pilgrimage Hajj aspect of the week-long harvest festival of Hag Sukkot, began a gradual decline in the spiritual consciousness of the Jewish People. The first time Hag/Hajj is mentioned in the Torah is in that famous scene when Prophets: 'Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go into the wilderness, that they may hold a feast (Hag) for me.'' [Exodus 5:1] or better: 'And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a Hajj/pilgrimage feast for me in the wilderness.'' But that one-time Hajj never occurred because Pharaoh refused to free the Jewish People thus incurring Divine wrath. The normative annual two Jewish Hajj week-long pilgrimages were the liberation celebration of Haj Passover; and especially the gratitude celebration of the harvest festival of Haj Sukkot. The Torah declares: 'Celebrate Hajj Sukkot for seven days after you have harvested the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns...Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Hajj of Matzah (Passover), the Hajj of Weeks, and the Hajj of Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 16:13-16) Hajj Sukkot was so important during the centuries when Solomon's Temple stood that the holy week of Sukkot was often called simply 'the Hajj' because of the very large numbers of Jews who came up to the Temple in Jerusalem. Hajj Passover is also celebrated as a weeklong pilgrimage. The third Hajj of Weeks is similar to Islamic Umrah, the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year. Although they share common rites, Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours; while Hajj is more time-consuming and involves many more rituals. The third Jewish Hajj of Weeks, like Umrah, is much simpler than Hajj Passover and can be performed in less than a few hours; on any one day during the seven weeks following Hajj Passover. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world and it surrounds one of Islam's holiest places, the Ka-ba. Unlike other mosques which are gender segregated, men and women can worship at the Al-Masjid Al-Haram together. The Holy Temple (Beit ha-Mikdash) of Jerusalem had two successive Temples on the Temple Mount where there now stands the Dome of the Rock. The Jerusalem Temple complex was separated into different areas where male priests, men, women and non-Jews could all come to worship the one God. Why is the Ka'ba the older brother of the Jerusalem Temple? Prophet Abraham is connected to both sacred sites. Prophets Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the destroyed Ka'ba; and later, Prophets Abraham and Isaac were tested on the hill where the Jerusalem Temple would someday be built by Prophet Solomon. Since Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions it is the most universal of them. Since Judaism is the first, and for over twelve centuries the only ongoing monotheistic religion, it is the least universal and the most pluralistic and tribal of the three Abrahamic religions. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for a dozen centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Prophet Abraham, the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) was the first, and only prophet, to successfully establish, through the descendants of his own two sons, three ongoing monotheistic religions, that have lasted into the 21st century: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; witch now make up about half of the world's population. Judaism discourages people who are interested in converting to Judaism because Judaism is the only true religion. Indeed, most non-Jews who become Jewish do it to unify a marriage or because they have a Jewish ancestor even if they do not yet know it. Judaism is not a missionary faith and so doesn't actively try to convert non-Jewish people (in many countries anti-Jewish laws prohibited converting to Judaism for centuries). However, the modern Jewish community increasingly welcomes would-be converts. A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism. As Prophet Micah (4:5) states: 'For all the (other) peoples walk each in the name of its god; and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.' Five hundred years before the birth of Prophet Muhammad Rabbi Yishmael, one of Judaism's most important rabbis was recorded as saying: 'In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel ... They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple, and construct a building (the Dome of the Rock) on the site of the (ruined by the Romans) sanctuary'. Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) There is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. Just as the Ka'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). When all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Prophet Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Prophet Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazB6KlferGs33	2024-11-27T16:29:08-08:00	
DOGE Could Become A Global Model For Fiscal Reform – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, in a sweeping effort to confront inefficiency and waste in federal operations. This bold initiative aims to identify and eliminate fraudulent practices and mismanagement within federal agencies, ensuring taxpayer dollars are used responsibly and effectively. Leading this ambitious endeavor are two innovation trailblazers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.The decision to entrust Musk and Ramaswamy with this critical task underscores Trump’s commitment to leveraging visionary leadership to solve entrenched governmental issues. Known for their transformative impact on technology and business, they symbolize a fresh, forward-thinking approach to governance. Under their leadership, DOGE will work to root out inefficiencies systematically, set higher standards for operational performance and establish a culture of fiscal discipline within the federal government.Trump’s announcement comes at a time when the need for reform is more urgent than ever. A March report from the Government Accountability Office revealed that $236 billion was wasted on improper payments last year alone — money that went to ineligible recipients or was misallocated due to systemic failures. This glaring inefficiency is compounded by a ballooning national debt of nearly $36 trillion and the $950 billion spent on interest payments in 2023. These staggering figures illuminate the critical need for decisive action.DOGE fulfills a key promise of Trump’s presidential campaign: to disrupt the bloated federal bureaucracy and deliver savings to American taxpayers. His vision is clear: streamline government operations, ensure accountability and restore trust in federal institutions. By reducing waste, the initiative seeks to redirect resources toward vital programs and investments that directly benefit citizens.The stakes are high. With interest on the national debt projected to grow further, unchecked wasteful spending poses a grave threat to America’s financial health. The new department aims to address these challenges head-on by introducing an era of fiscal responsibility and operational transparency. The initiative also promises to create opportunities for private sector collaboration, drawing on innovative practices to modernize government functions.Musk and Ramaswamy bring unique expertise to this endeavor. Musk’s groundbreaking advancements in technology and sustainability, combined with Ramaswamy’s entrepreneurial insight and efficiency-focused strategies, create a powerful synergy to confront inefficiency on an unprecedented scale. Together, they embody Trump’s vision of a government that mirrors the best practices of the private sector — innovative, efficient and results-driven.In a post on X on Saturday, Ramaswamy highlighted the glaring inefficiencies in government resource management, urging a creative and transformative approach to addressing the issue. He claimed that the federal government spends a staggering $15 billion annually on powering and maintaining office buildings, even though many employees no longer work on-site. He also noted that billions are spent on office furnishings and highlighted the existence of nearly 8,000 vacant government-owned buildings, calling the situation 'nuts' and stating that it might benefit from innovative solutions, potentially inspired by decentralized systems like DOGE.Musk and Ramaswamy have introduced an ambitious plan to reshape and streamline the US federal bureaucracy, emphasizing the need for greater efficiency, accountability and fiscal responsibility. Central to their vision is a strategy to reduce the size and scope of federal operations by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and redirecting resources toward more effective governance.One key aspect is a commitment to end unauthorized federal spending, which they estimate to exceed $500 billion annually. By aligning expenditures with congressional authorizations, they aim to restore fiscal discipline and reduce the burden on taxpayers. This will be complemented by large-scale audits of outdated government contracts to identify and address inefficiencies in procurement processes, yielding substantial savings.In addition to regulatory reform, they propose a significant reduction in the federal workforce. Rather than targeting individual employees, they plan to utilize existing 'reduction in force' authorities, bypassing traditional civil service protections to achieve structural adjustments within federal agencies. This approach is designed to streamline operations while minimizing the complexities of workforce management.Their reform agenda also extends to the Department of Defense, which has failed its audit for the seventh consecutive year despite its annual budget of more than $800 billion. The two businessmen intend to tackle waste and inefficiencies within the department, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are used effectively to support national security.Importantly, these changes are designed to be implemented through existing presidential powers, avoiding the delays and challenges of securing new legislative approvals from Congress. With a target date of July 4, 2026, they aim to complete this overhaul and present a more efficient, transparent and accountable federal government to the American people.As he prepares to take office, the president-elect has positioned the Department of Government Efficiency as a cornerstone of his administration’s agenda for 2025. This initiative reflects a commitment to fiscal discipline and a broader aspiration to reshape the federal government into a model of transparency and accountability. DOGE has the potential to inspire nations worldwide as a transformative model for reducing government spending, curbing dependency on public sector employment and fostering the growth of vibrant private enterprises. By introducing a system that prioritizes efficiency, accountability and innovation, the new department offers a roadmap for countries seeking to address financial instability and unlock their economic potential.At its core, DOGE’s mission to identify and eliminate wasteful government expenditure demonstrates that fiscal responsibility is not only achievable but essential for sustainable governance. For nations struggling under the weight of inefficiency and mounting debts, adopting similar strategies could help restore financial stability, freeing up resources to invest in areas that directly benefit citizens.Excessive reliance on government jobs often leads to bloated bureaucracies, inefficiency and limited opportunities for individual growth. Countries can foster innovation, entrepreneurship and job creation by shifting their focus toward private sector empowerment. This transition reduces the strain on public finances and establishes a foundation for a more dynamic and self-reliant economy.

Jamaica And The Failure Of The Entrepreneurial State – OpEd	By Lipton Matthews The concept of the entrepreneurial state proposes that governments—like private enterprises—can take risks, innovate, and drive economic growth. Through direct intervention, governments can strategically invest in sectors that hold promise for the future, aiming to spark productivity and economic expansion. However, in countries like Jamaica, the limitations of the entrepreneurial state are evident, as interventions often face economic realities and public sentiment that clash with the expectations of the private sector. Jamaica’s challenges with state-owned enterprises, regulatory bodies, and education policy reveal that government-led initiatives can only rearrange and stifle, rather than stimulate, economic potential. One example of how Jamaica and regional governments grapple with their role as an 'entrepreneurial' state is the continued support for subjects within the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) curriculum, which has seen low student enrollment. Subjects like Agricultural Science and Green Engineering are crucial in addressing Jamaica’s long-term developmental needs, including sustainable agriculture and environmental resilience. Nevertheless, these courses remain unpopular, with a small proportion of students opting to study them, which raises questions about the efficient allocation of resources. While an entrepreneurial company would likely cut these programs due to low demand, the CXC opted to retain them after facing public backlash, reflecting the influence of societal expectations on government decisions. In this case, the government is caught between responding to educational trends and fulfilling a broader societal mission to promote learning areas that might benefit the national economy over the long term. Yet, from an entrepreneurial perspective, continuing to fund these subjects indicates a misallocation of resources. Maintaining courses that lack student demand is arguably not a cost-effective investment and diverges from the private sector’s focus on high-demand offerings that drive profitability. Additionally, students have the option of studying these courses at the university so discontinuing them at the high school level won’t necessarily affect economic plans. The failure to offer subjects at the secondary level has never prevented students from pursuing them at university. Similarly, Jamaica’s public transportation sector offers another view into the challenges of state-led enterprise. The JamaicaUrban Transit Corporation (JUTC) has been financially unviable for years, heavily reliant on government subsidies to operate. A private company facing such persistent losses would likely have ceased operations or restructured to prioritize profitability. But rather than divesting the company, the government has decided to compound problems by expanding its services into rural areas. Rural regions often have poor infrastructure, which increases operational costs. In addition, rural demand may not be high enough to offset these expenses, particularly under the current fare structure, where prices are kept low to remain accessible to all. In this scenario, government funding would likely be stretched thinner, requiring substantial subsidies to cover the additional operational costs associated with maintaining rural routes. While the government’s continued support of the JUTC serves a social purpose, it raises questions about the sustainability of using taxpayer money to support a loss-making enterprise indefinitely. Moreover, the Jamaican government’s plan to revitalize the railway system, despite its troubled financial history, underscores the limitations of state-led entrepreneurship. Rail infrastructure is undeniably valuable for economic and environmental reasons, potentially reducing road congestion and emissions. However, without a viable business model, the revitalization could merely extend a legacy of losses. In this sense, the state’s involvement is a gamble that could further drain public resources, highlighting the delicate balance between serving public needs and securing a return on investment. The role of regulatory bodies in the agricultural sector further illustrate the restrictive influence that state intervention can have on Jamaica’s economy. The Jamaica Agricultural Commodities Regulatory Association (JACRA) was established to oversee the production and export of key crops, but its influence has stifled innovation and competition in the agricultural sector. By setting prices below the market rate for certain products, JACRA inadvertently limits farmers’ potential earnings, discouraging expansion, and reducing incentives for quality improvement. A private company, in contrast, would operate with a primary focus on optimizing profitability and encouraging growth. For example, a private agricultural association might explore more lucrative export opportunities, market Jamaican crops internationally, or invest in research and development for sustainable farming practices. Invariably, JACRA’s approach reflects a cautious regulatory stance that prioritizes market stability, arguably at the cost of stifling the sector’s dynamism and growth potential. These examples reflect the inherent tensions in the concept of a so-called entrepreneurial state. While Jamaica’s government has intervened across various sectors to promote social welfare, economic stability, and infrastructure, these actions clash with the principles of entrepreneurialism, such as risk-taking, flexibility, and resource optimization. Any entrepreneurial entity must be willing to operate with economic efficiency and responsiveness to economic signals. However, when it comes to the 'entrepreneurial state,' however, public opinion, historical legacies, and social missions often weigh heavily on government decision-making, leading to compromises that an entrepreneurial organization would avoid. Ultimately, the Jamaican government’s continued support for financially unsustainable initiatives like the JUTC, or the decision to retain low-enrollment educational programs, reveal the complex motivations behind state intervention. While the entrepreneurial state theory holds that governments can lead innovation and economic development, in practice, Jamaica’s experience highlights the limits of this model in a context where economic realities and public expectations often diverge from private sector principles.

Fear Is Still The Motivation For Black Voters – OpEd	Kamala Harris is now a historical footnote who is heading for the dustbin of history. Yet this harsh truth is avoided by many Black people, who cast aspersions and scorn when they should see the election result as an opportunity to forge a new political reality, instead of clinging to a party that has lost legitimacy with many of its voters. 'More directly, the Black electoral imperative to seek protection from the Republican/White Man’s Party reduces African Americans to an appendage of the Democratic Party apparatus, and thus of the capitalists that fund and control the Party. It subverts the essentially progressive nature of the Black polity, objectively enfeebling Black America, even as rich white Democrats pander to Black voters as the 'soul' of the party.'Glen Ford The always prescient Glen Ford wrote those words in February 2016 as he correctly hypothesized that Black voters would continue their tradition of supporting the candidate they believed was most likely to defeat a republican in that presidential election year. Eight years later his words still ring true. Donald Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris has engendered anger, fear, and retrograde politics, but surprisingly little criticism of the Democratic Party which failed its most loyal voters so spectacularly. The Kamala Harris/Tim Walz campaign raised more than $1.5 billion , more than the Donald Trump/J.D. Vance campaign was able to raise. Harris had the support of Democratic Party donors, corporate media, and the entire liberal class establishment yet received 7 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did in his 2020 race against Trump. Trump received 2.5 million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The reaction of many Black voters was epitomized by MSNBC commentator Eddie Glaude , who insists that Trump only gets votes from people who feel their 'whiteness' is under threat and dismisses the idea that there is any other explanation for Trump’s victory. One can never underestimate the power of racist and supremacist feelings among white people in this country, but that sentiment is not only simplistic in political terms but ignores the flaws in the Harris campaign and in Harris herself. But any such analysis seems to be off limits to millions of Black people, who are capable of navigating many other contradictions in their lives but who demur whenever there is a need to honestly address the party which would never win presidential elections without them. The notion of choice, even the choice of how to think or express oneself has been declared off limits. There is not nearly h dismay and anger that the party with resources to do anything it wanted still could not make enough of a case to win. There is precious little curiosity about the wisdom of making a top down choice after the donors’ coup against Biden’s re-election campaign. There is a suspension of disbelief from otherwise intelligent people who claim not to notice the famous Harris 'word salads' and odd pronouncements about coconut trees. There is an unwillingness to understand that people who depended on the covid era stimulus payments, child tax credits, and expansions of SNAP and medicaid benefits would not bother to vote for the democratic candidate who served with the president claiming to be the 'most progressive president since FDR' but who stood down when these programs ended.The trancelike state of much of Black America is a result of a deep fear of republican control of government, particularly if Trump is the republican in question. The fog is so heavy that it blocks out logic, empathy and even the need for self-preservation. It should be clear to anyone that a candidate who can raise more than $1 billion is automatically compromised. Having buy-in from the wealthy means that any message that might motivate voters will be off the table. The obedience to the oligarchic class that doomed the Build Back Better legislation is now permanent for the party and unfortunately for its voters as well. The spending spree didn’t even help Black democrats much. The Harris campaign paid $350,000 to Nu Vision Media, which is run by hack propagandist Roland Martin, before Martin’s softball interview with her. The money was not well spent, as Martin is only capable of reaching the choir Harris already preached to. Similarly, Al Sharpton’s National Action Network was also the recipient of useless largesse to the broader community when it received two payments of $250,000 each before the good reverend also held a very friendly interview with Harris. When the payments were revealed, Martin’s only comment was that 'It should have been a hell of a lot more. More should have been spent on Black-owned media.' While Black people clung to the hope of a Harris victory, the grifters saw the campaign as just another opportunity for a chump change payday. Well connected party consultants got rich, some of them making millions of dollars as they do every four years. Despite the resounding defeat, this columnist noticed a stubborn unwillingness to even question Harris’ campaign strategy. Her website was devoid of policy statements for 50 days, she chose to pursue non-existent 'never Trump' republicans, and she was unable to explain how she would differ from Biden or Trump even when speaking to friendly interviewers. Loyal Black democrats have rendered these and other critiques as being off limits for discussion or even of thought. The people who were once so organized that their actions changed U.S. politics and whose activism created programs like medicare and medicaid, now see themselves as powerless supplicants who can only support whomever the system spits out for consideration. Having decided to narrow their analysis only to how racist and misogynistic white voters are, there is no room to confront their predicament of Democratic Party loyalty. Lamentation about Trump 2.0 supersedes critical thought or discussion of options or how to change the Black relationship to the Democratic Party which has now been brought to such a low point. Money and the Black misleadership class are the main culprits in the continuation of this perverse relationship. The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and the civil rights organizations are bought off. Like Martin and Sharpton they are brought out every four years to prevent any hard questions from breaking out and to be paid off for their meager efforts. The hapless and hollow Harris has now been raised to a strange demi-goddess status. Her spectacular failure goes unexamined and so does any discussion of a new politics for Black people to seek. Even rudimentary questions about making demands or even asking questions are dismissed in favor of anger directed at Trump voters. There are certainly reasons for anger but they should not be directed at Trump supporters and non-voters. All blame should be placed squarely on the shoulders of the democrats. Black people need a new political vision, one that does not depend solely on electoral politics at four year intervals. Black people have achieved many great things but that won’t happen again if there is no willingness for introspection and for denunciation of the people who have driven them over a political cliff yet again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazAI0gf0kh05K	2024-11-27T16:12:35-08:00	
Provoking Nuclear War Over Something Americans Do Not See As A Ma...	New polling conducted this month by the Pew Research Center indicates that only 30 percent of Americans believe that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a 'major threat to U.S. interests.' That perception was at its highest of 50 percent of Americans shortly after the invasion. It has in successive polling consistently come in much lower, until reaching this new low. Nevertheless, the United States government over the past nearly three years has kept ramping up its support for Ukraine’s ongoing war with Russia — including via money, intelligence, and weapons. So involved in the war has the US become that it is seems a stretch to claim that the US is not at war directly with Russia. Thus we reach the point where nuclear war between the US and Russia has become a possible outgrowth of the ongoing conflict. When Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022, US President Joe Biden rushed to present a speech to stir up public support for the US government helping Ukraine and punishing Russia. He presented the US as acting to advance democracy in these endeavors. However, even at the height of stirred up war fever, an American majority did not see Russia’s action as a major threat to US interests. Now, that view is held by less than a third of Americans. Yet, the US government remains relentless in its war effort. In reality, it is all about power to the politicians, not power to the people. Biden’s appeal to democracy was intended to stir up an overwhelming support among Americans for the US going all in on aiding Ukraine and harming Russia. He largely failed in the effort. Democracy in America has said 'no' to war. Nonetheless, Biden, along with many other politicians, have continued pursuing war anyway. And now it seems they may keep doing so to the point of nuclear annihilation.

Silent Apartheid: The Rising Plight Of Lower Castes In Modi’s Ind...	Caste, an ancient social construct often dismissed as a relic of India’s past, remains a harsh reality for millions in the country. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, caste-based oppression has not only persisted but appears to be intensifying, exposing the dark underbelly of a society that prides itself on progress and modernity. As India embraces an increasingly radicalized nationalism, the plight of its lower castes, particularly Dalits, has worsened, revealing a systematic erosion of justice, equality, and human dignity. The rhetoric of development and empowerment that dominates India’s political discourse masks the grim realities faced by its marginalized communities. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) increased by over 9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, with heinous acts of rape, murder, and physical violence disproportionately targeting Dalits. The deeply entrenched caste hierarchy, embedded in every aspect of Indian society, continues to thrive under the veneer of modernity, aided by the state’s reluctance to challenge the status quo. The erosion of India’s secular foundation has been a gradual but deliberate process. Since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assumed power in 2014, the nation has seen a pronounced shift towards 'saffronization', a political project that prioritizes Hindu identity and culture, often at the expense of marginalized groups. While Hindu nationalism seeks to unite the majority population under a singular identity, this unification inherently sidelines communities that challenge the dominant narrative, including Dalits, Muslims, and other minorities. This saffronized vision of India does not merely marginalize lower castes, it actively dehumanizes them. Textbooks in BJP-governed states, for instance, have been revised to glorify upper-caste heroes while erasing the contributions and struggles of Dalit leaders like B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of India’s Constitution. Similarly, caste atrocities are frequently dismissed or downplayed, with political leaders and officials often defending upper-caste perpetrators. Such actions signal to society that lower castes are expendable and that violence against them can occur with near-total impunity. The international community has taken notice of the deteriorating conditions for India’s lower castes. The 2020 Hathras case, where a young Dalit woman was gang-raped and murdered in Uttar Pradesh, sparked global outrage, with human rights organizations condemning the state’s mishandling of the case. Similarly, the public lynching of a Dalit man in Rajasthan in 2021, allegedly for entering a temple, was widely criticized as emblematic of India’s caste apartheid. International institutions have not remained silent either. The United Nations has repeatedly urged India to address caste-based violence, linking it to broader systemic inequalities. In 2021, the UN’s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Indian government to implement stringent measures against caste discrimination. However, despite this global scrutiny, domestic action remains tepid at best, as caste hierarchies are too deeply entrenched to be uprooted without systemic reform. To comprehend the persistence of caste oppression, Antonio Gramsci’s theory of cultural hegemony provides a useful lens. Gramsci argued that societal dominance is not merely enforced through coercion but also through the normalization of certain values and beliefs by the ruling class. In India, upper-caste norms have long been institutionalized as the cultural default, allowing caste-based discrimination to thrive unchecked. The BJP’s cultural hegemony builds on this foundation by amplifying Hindu upper-caste ideals as synonymous with Indian identity. In doing so, it marginalizes Dalit narratives and perpetuates a system where lower castes remain 'invisible' or are reduced to stereotypes. This hegemony extends to policy-making, media representation, and even the digital economy, creating a society where caste discrimination is normalized rather than challenged. Caste discrimination is not confined to acts of physical violence; it is also deeply ingrained in India’s economic structure. Despite affirmative action policies like reservations in education and government jobs, Dalits remain disproportionately excluded from economic opportunities. A 2023 report by the Centre for Social Justice found that nearly 45% of Dalits live below the poverty line, compared to a national average of 22%. The rise of the gig economy and digital platforms has only widened this gap. Studies indicate that Dalits face systemic discrimination in hiring practices and are overrepresented in low-paying, menial jobs. In rural areas, where caste hierarchies are more rigid, Dalits are frequently denied access to land, credit, and other resources, perpetuating cycles of poverty and dependence. India’s caste crisis is a moral failure that demands urgent redress. For the nation to uphold its democratic principles, it must dismantle the structural inequalities that bind millions of its citizens to perpetual subjugation. This requires not only legal reform but also a cultural shift that challenges the normalization of caste-based oppression. However, such transformation seems unlikely under the current regime, which appears more invested in consolidating majoritarian power than in addressing systemic injustices. As India inches further toward authoritarianism, the voices of its marginalized communities risk being silenced altogether. The plight of India’s lower castes is not just an internal issue; it is a global concern. As the world’s largest democracy, India has a responsibility to lead by example, ensuring justice and equality for all its citizens. Anything less is a betrayal of its founding ideals and a stark reminder that progress without equity is no progress at all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWlYmfIdvZLUHVzdL_0VhC	2024-11-27T16:07:49-08:00	
Biden Officials Edging Toward Nuclear Reckoning Over Ukraine – Op...	By Dave Patterson Inside the Biden White House, after more than 1,000 days of brutal conflict in Ukraine, officials at some level are considering a new strategy. It appears the 'as-long-it-takes' approach is taking too long, and President-elect Donald Trump’s national security team is readying to take over. It seems Joe Biden’s coterie of official geopolitical thinkers is floating the notion of providing nuclear weapons to Ukraine. Biden Officials Offer Unthinkable Solution These conversations were a reaction to what current members of NATO and Biden’s national security team anticipate is Trump’s intention to secure a negotiated peace in Ukraine. The question on the table is if peace in Ukraine is predicated on an agreed-to ceasefire, how is the ceasefire guaranteed? One answer was posited in an Off the Press post that referred to a New York Times article, 'Trump’s Vow to End the War Could Leave Ukraine With Few Options': 'So, US and European officials are discussing deterrence as a possible security guarantee for Ukraine, such as stockpiling a conventional arsenal sufficient to strike a punishing blow if Russia violates a ceasefire. Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.' These are the kinds of conversations that go on when there are no adults in the room. The concept of returning nuclear weapons suggests that, as a member of the former Warsaw Bloc countries, Ukraine had autonomy in the employment of atomic warheads. In fact, these were Soviet Union-era weapons that belonged to and were under the command and control of the Kremlin, or so it was thought. New evidence, however, suggests Ukraine had more control over the use of the weapons than originally believed. 'These records cut sharply against the rationale for this historical resignation: that Ukraine was incapable of the technical means of operating nuclear weapons and that such weapons wouldn’t do much for its security even if it could,' The National Interest reported. Ukraine was sacrificing its security in the interest of international guarantees. Nonetheless, those weapons were removed from Ukraine in 1994 in compliance with the Security Assurances in Connection With Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Countries that signed the treaty, also called the Budapest Memorandum, were the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, the United States, and Northern Ireland. The memorandum effectively declared that if Kyiv gave up the nuclear weapons stored in Ukraine, the signatories of the non-proliferation agreement would 'refrain from threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.' Well, obviously, the Russian Federation violated the treaty. Moscow has a long history of engaging in such violations. What Will Putin Do? The lunacy of threatening to introduce modern nuclear weapons, which is what they would be, presumably since bringing back the original weapons is not possible, is mind-boggling. Who would have command and control over these weapons? With a ceasefire violation by Russia, wouldn’t Ukraine be more likely to resort to using the nuclear weapons if it could? And if operational control of the weapons remained with the United States or some other nuclear NATO nation, by whose authority would they be used? The lack of will displayed by the United States and NATO so far indicates the weapons would not be employed. So where is the deterrence value? Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use the Kremlin’s tactical nuclear arsenal based on a reduced threshold, and now NATO and US national security officials believe he will back down and be deterred if Ukraine once again is a nuclear nation. This comes from Biden officials whose constant mantra has been, 'Don’t do anything that would escalate the conflict.' When the United States provided longer range capability for Kyiv to strike targets deeper inside Russia, Putin reacted strongly. 'Putin has warned, even before releasing the revised nuclear doctrine, that the use of long-range missiles supplied by the West to attack Russia would constitute war,' Liberty Nation Newsreported. Imagine Moscow’s reaction even if the return of nuclear weapons to Ukraine were under the guise of ensuring a ceasefire. Did anyone actually think through musing about the deterrent effect of returning nuclear warheads to Ukraine? The United States and select NATO countries have nuclear-capable weapons in Europe. Installing some in Ukraine would be unnecessary atomic belt and suspenders. Trump is going to have enough on his plate negotiating an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine without unnamed US officials sitting around spit-balling about deploying nukes to Ukraine. Such thinking is dangerous and the act of desperation by an administration in the death throes of a failed foreign policy. Worse yet, Putin might consider such notions to be authentic US and NATO planning and use such ravings as a pretext for reacting in a dangerous manner. Did anyone on the Biden team even consider this catastrophic possibility? The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate.

The Evil That America Does Lives After It – OpEd	By Jonathan Power American foreign policy makers often wonder aloud why it is that much of the world has such an anti-American reflex. Why the 'Ugly American'? Graham Greene would never have written a novel entitled the 'Ugly Russian' or even the 'Ugly German'. It is not just Iran that considers the US as the 'Great Satan'. Remember that day at the UN General Assembly when the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, accused President George W. Bush of belching sulphureous fumes, and most of the chamber chuckled. When the Russian government denies that they switched their publicly announced mission of deploying planes to Syria to fight ISIS and have instead concentrated on bombing the redoubts of groups engaged in the civil war against the government of President Bashar al-Assad a majority of the world’s governments seemingly accepts the denial, despite the contrary evidence. When the US bombs a hospital in Afghanistan killing many staff members of 'Doctors Without Borders' this confirms the opinion of those who are always convinced that America does things like this on purpose after careful planning and will do it again as soon as the opportunity offers itself. There are two reasons, I think, for the image of the Ugly American. The first is America’s standing as the world’s number one economic and military power. The second is the CIA, the notorious Central Intelligence Agency. The British have their MI6 and its special agent, the glamorous James Bond. But the CIA only has its reputation as the master of the black arts of corruption, torture and assassination. The US’s largest covert operation in the CIA’s history Tragically for America its bad reputation is largely deserved. There are some notorious examples of its malfeasance that every politically educated non-American knows about. The most recent were the waterboarding and other torture methods carried out by the CIA during the administration of President George W. Bush. The Congo and its goings on immediately after its independence from Belgium is rightly the stuff of legend, novels, history and film. On 30 June 1960 its young leftist firebrand, Patrice Lumumba, was sworn in as prime minister. Within days the army mutinied against their all-white officer corps. Belgium responded by sending troops to reoccupy the country. Its richest province, the mineral rich Katatanga, was encouraged to secede. Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union which immediately flew in transport planes. That’s when the Eisenhower administration sent in the CIA. It ranked as the US’s largest covert operation in the CIA’s history. Its station chief, Lawrence Devlin, became so powerful that he controlled many of the key political players in the country. The CIA plotted to have Lumumba deposed, even murdered if necessary. The CIA encouraged President Joseph Kasavubu to turn against Lumumba. He fired the prime minister. Devlin was quick to find a substitute—Mobutu Sese Sese, the 29-year-old army chief of staff. Devlin told his CIA bosses, according to an official US government study, that 'this was the beginning of the plan for Mobutu to take over the government'. Ten weeks after independence Mobutu announced he was suspending parliament and the constitution. Mobutu became the CIA-funded de-facto dictator, with Devlin as his chief counsellor. The two of them agreed that Lumumba must be arrested, and they sent him to Katanga, the Belgium-supported secessionist province, whose government had repeatedly called for his scalp. Within days of his arrival he was shot dead, as the CIA wanted. The CIA then masterminded Cyril Adoula to be a nominal prime minister under Mobutu’s thumb. The CIA bribed parliamentarians, labour unions and the organization of tribal chiefs to back Adoula. The seesawing in Congolese politics continued for another five years before Mobutu, with CIA help, became the paramount leader with no need for a façade of parliamentary rule. For 32 years Mobutu, always considered a close friend by the US, milked the economy for his own financial benefit. The country ended up as the basket case of Africa, more riddled by continuous warfare, corruption and poverty than any other African country. Finally in 1997 rebels headed by a former Lumumbist and backed by military forces from Uganda, Rwanda and Angola deposed Mobutu, leading to a regional war that would kill more than three and half million people over the next decade. Only in the last handful of years has Congo, with massive UN help, begun to right itself. Another case of the perfidy of the CIA I have told at length in my book, 'Like Water On Stone', (Penguin, 2001). It’s the story of the overthrow of the legitimately elected leftist government of Chile in 1973. Other countries do similar bad things as the Americans—the British in Kenya, the Russians in Ethiopia but the world forgets and even forgives. But not with America. To take a liberty with Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, 'The evil that America does lives after it. The good is oft interred with its bones'.

The ‘Let It Rip’ Canard: Reflections On Jay Bhattacharya – OpEd	Early in the Covid period, the skeptics of government closures and universal quarantines were denounced as favoring a policy of 'let it rip.' The phrase has been in use since the 19th century. It is apparently drawn from experience with steamships. When you released power to its maximum extent, it made a ripping sound. The implication is that when you let it rip, you let go of all controls and just wait to see what happens. Think about the application to infectious disease, at least in the context of the debate over lockdowns. The theory is that if you don’t force people to stay home, force businesses to close, and force schools and churches to shut down, people will mindlessly move about here and there and cause infection to spread wildly. No one will have a clue about what to do about it. The implication is that people are unbearably stupid, lack all personal incentive to protect themselves, and somehow cannot but be as reckless as possible. There will be no strategies, no methods of mitigation, no therapeutics, no limits on the spread of incurable sickness. We need geniuses like Anthony Fauci to give us police-enforced guidance in order to stay safe from the consequences of our own choices. We don’t have brains. We don’t have habits born of experience. We don’t have any social mechanisms embedded in our traditions. We don’t have anything. We are worse than an anthill, which at least has a rules-based order born of instinct. In this view, human behavior is purely randomized and rote, moving about here and there, fully unable to process information about guidance, lacking completely in any capacity to be careful, wise, or otherwise govern ourselves. This is the essence of the push for lockdowns. Anything less than totalitarian control of the human population amounts to utter chaos in which the virus rules us all whereas the geniuses at the controls of government power know all things. This is the essential worldview of all those who said that lockdown opponents merely want to let the virus rip. This was of course the core criticism of the Great Barrington Declaration of which NIH Director-nominee Jay Bhattacharya was the main author. It advocated no such thing as 'let it rip.' Instead, it called for public health to recognize the existence of human intelligence and consider the costs of overriding it with police-state edicts that ruin businesses and lives. It came out six months after lockdowns began and already revealed themselves to be devastating. There should not have been anything even slightly controversial about the statement. And yet truly there was something about those times that tempted intellectuals toward grave extremes of utopian thinking. Remember the 'Zero Covid' movement? Talk about insane. I just read an outrageous paper in Frontiers of Health (date March 2021!) that claimed to have the magical solution to Covid. The plan would defeat the disease in 'one day' by ordering simultaneous universal testing, forcing all positive tests to isolate, and monitoring all public spaces with concentration camp guards. The authors proposed this seriously, forgetting that a respiratory virus with a zoonotic reservoir cares nothing for such antics. To have signed one’s name to such a suggestion should confine one to a lifetime of ill repute as an intellectual. There is also the slight problem of human rights and freedom. But, hey, anyone who yammered on about those topics was then accused of being an advocate of 'let it rip.' The truth is that we do have intelligence and brains. Older people have always known to avoid large crowds in flu season. Pick up any geriatric magazine and you can discover that this is true. Even our habits of the season reflect that. Intergenerational family units tend to stay indoors as we enter winter months and get out and about in the spring when threats of infectious disease die down. 'Focused protection' is embedded in the habits of the calendar year. We are also capable of reading data on risk demographics. We knew from February 2020 that Covid posed a medically significant risk mainly to the aged and infirm. There was never a serious risk associated with beach parties or schooling. We knew this at least intuitively, and vast numbers of people also knew to disregard the crazy fear-mongering from the top that was designed to prepare the population for the shot. Society knew better than its managers. It is this way in every sector of life in a world in which society is trusted as the primary manager of itself. It’s true in economics. Now that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are pushing for radical deregulation of all things, the same critique is being offered. They merely advocate that enterprise 'let it rip.' It’s the new name for laissez-faire, another smear term from the 19th century. But in the same sense that people have the intelligence to judge disease risk, society generates systems and institutions that put limits and guardrails up for enterprise too. The existence of rivalrous competition with easy entry and exit keeps prices, profits, and costs toward an equilibrium. Producer accountability is instilled with user ratings, reputation, and strict liability (unless you are a vaccine maker enjoying full indemnification). People forget that the best institutions assuring quality and safety are not government agencies but private services like Underwriters Laboratory, which has been around since the 19th century, long before the federal government had a single agency regulating even food quality. Remove the regulations, abolish the agencies, and competent and well-run private institutions would appear in every area, the same as professional credentialing now. Trusting people to manage infectious disease based on realistic risk assessments is no different from trusting property owners, workers, prices, and markets to work out the best possible solutions to the problem of scarcity in the material world. It doesn’t mean full throttle come what may any more than not locking down means zero control over our health. In other words, this whole phrase has been deployed against the idea of freedom itself. In fact, the proponents of lockdowns were not opposed to smearing that word too, spelling it as freedumb. Early on in the pandemic response, I was interviewed in Germany and the person asked what the best rhetorical strategy would be to push for a reopening. I suggested they campaign for freedom. The response: that is not possible because the word itself has been discredited. My response: if freedom is discredited, we have no cause of hope at all. The legacy of Jay Bhattarcharya’s actions during Covid – joining what felt like a half-dozen of us immediate critics of these awful policies – is not only his attention to science and facts; it is also a reverence for the idea of freedom itself, which really means to trust that society can manage itself with the best-possible outcomes apart from the dictates of pretentious and powerful people at the top. In a beautiful irony, Jay now inherits the position of the man who called him a 'fringe epidemiologist' and called for the censors to do a 'quick and devastating takedown' of his work. It’s been a very long journey lasting nearly five years, but here we are, the man who led the opposition to the worst-imaginable public health policies now in a position to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. Savor this moment: it’s a rare one when justice prevails. As for accountability and the truth about what happened in those dark days, there is a good phrase for what should happen to the information flows that should now happen: let it rip.

A New Arms Race In Europe: Euromissiles 2.0 – Analysis	By Aaron Stein (FPRI) -- Last week, Russia simulated a nuclear strike in Europe with a purpose-built missile designed to carry multiple nuclear or conventional warheads. The missile, which Russia has dubbed ‘Oreshnik’, is the latest Russian missile designed to strike targets in Europe. The missile is a purported variant of the RS-26, which was built using the first stage booster from the RS-24, a road-mobile missile designed to strike targets in the United States. The RS-26 was never deployed when first tested in 2011. However, the missile’s use in combat is clearly now intended to signal to Europe that Russia has a credible delivery system for intermediate-range nuclear strikes. This is part of an effort to make Russia’s nuclear threats more credible and forebodes continued tensions in Europe. The backdrop to these developments is the collapse of Russo-Western relations. This downturn stems from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has destabilized Europe and forced European countries to prepare once again for the prospect of regional conflict. These tensions have had a clear impact on missile proliferation in the region. The roots of missile proliferation date back to the turn of the 21st century, the gradual demise of the arms control agreements, and the upending of European security following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The use of the Oreshnik/RS-26 is, I believe, intended to influence decision-making in European capitals about the future of European-Russian relations. This is a classic Russian strategy and broadly reminiscent of Moscow’s thinking about the deployment and development of the SS-20 missile. I believe that this approach to intra-European relations will fail and, along with the United States, Europe is destined for the vast expansion of conventionally armed, medium-range missiles, designed to strike with extreme accuracy. This development forebodes continued instability in Europe, a future where arms control will be far more difficult than ever before to use to lessen tensions and suggests that the arms build-up that is now taking place will continue well into the future. A SS-20 Clone: Renewed Capabilities and Faulty Assumptions The RS-26 has its roots in the Cold War. It is the successor to the SS-20, the ballistic missile the Soviet Union developed to get around limits it agreed to in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). The missile was tested using three stages, but then packed full of warheads, and then cut down to hold airbases in Europe at risk. The development and deployment of the SS-20 presented Washington and the NATO alliance with a strategic and political problem: the missile could carry multiple nuclear warheads and fire at Europe from well within the territorial boundaries of the Soviet Union. This meant that Soviet Union no longer had to deploy missiles in the Warsaw Pact countries, where they were far closer to NATO forces, and therefore more vulnerable to attack. The United States and NATO had no corresponding system, which led to the second major issue: the Soviet Union could strike NATO territory with nuclear weapons with a purpose-built delivery system, while simultaneously threatening to hit U.S. targets with longer range missiles. This created a dilemma for NATO: Russia could strike targets in Europe without using weapons slated for striking the United States. This meant that in the event of a limited nuclear war in Europe a U.S. leader would be forced to risk a Soviet nuclear counter-strike to respond to an attack in an allied third country. The goal was to undermine confidence in U.S. security guarantees to undercut NATO – and it was done with one country in mind: West Germany. Russia’s goal was to make the defense of Germany untenable, thereby incentivizing West German leaders to be neutral by emphasizing their economic and security incentive to cooperate more closely with East Germany. This approach was broadly in synch with the intra-West German tensions about how to manage relations with their communist neighbors; whether to combat East German communists or cooperate with them. In the end, the deployment of the SS-20 did not break NATO or force German neutrality. Instead, West Germany (and all of NATO) agreed to host two comparable systems: the Gryphon (a ground launched version of the ubiquitous Tomahawk cruise missile) and the Pershing-II (a very accurate, multiple nuclear warhead carrying ballistic missile). These U.S. made systems, along with the SS-20, were what the two sides agreed to give up when Premier Gorbachev and President Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987. Euromissiles 2.0 The demise of the INF is multifaceted and largely Russia’s fault. However, the United States did undercut an absolutely critical component of all arms control with Russia. In 2002, the Bush administration withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which placed strict limits on the deployment of missile defense systems. The basic principle that underpinned this treaty was that neither side should seek to build its way out of vulnerability from strategic missile attack. The basic idea that neither side could 'win' a nuclear war allowed for mutual arms reduction. This is also the most basic component of deterrence theory; deterrence works because the mutual threat of catastrophic destruction prevents the use of nuclear weapons, thereby creating a positive incentive to refrain from launching a first strike. A capable anti-missile system could, in theory, undercut the feeling of vulnerability, which would naturally then require building more missiles to overwhelm defenses to offset any defensive advantages. This build-up would then require more weapons, which would be impossible under various treaty constraints that the two sides had agreed to during the Cold War. The demise of the ABM Treaty is one of many reasons for Russia’s decision to use legal language to circumvent the INF Treaty. The RS-26 was one such example. Moscow did what it did with the SS-20, it tested the RS-26 out to intercontinental range, removed a small third stage, and then packed the cut down missile with warheads. The excess weight decreased the missile’s range, thereby giving Russia an intermediate-range, nuclear capable delivery vehicle to strike targets in Europe. Moscow’s development of this system is often defined as a circumvention of the INF’s limits because it technically tested the missile to a range allowed under a different treaty agreement: New Start. The reasons for this require an entirely different piece, but needless to say, the development of the RS-26 was – and remains – a Russian effort to use known loopholes in two agreements – the INF and New Start – to build an intermediate-range missile capability. Russia also chose to violate the INF outright – and it was this violation that led the United States to withdraw from INF in 2019. This more concrete violation came when Russia developed of a land-based Kalibr cruise missile, known as the 9M729 'screwdriver', which has a range in excess of the INF’s limits. The deadlock over this missile ultimately led President Trump to withdraw from the INF, which has since spurned U.S. developments of intermediate-range missiles for deployments in both Asia and Europe. The first of these American-made systems is the Typhon. The Typhon missile launch system is designed to launch two-intermediate-range missiles: the SM-6 ballistic missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile. The Typhon has been deployed in the Philippines and was sent to Denmark for a training exercise. The system is conventionally armed and is slated for deployment on a rotational basis in Germany starting in 2026. The announcement of this deployment agreement in 2024 is one of the myriad of reasons cite by Putin for following through on the Oreshnik/RS-26’s development, deployment, and now use in combat in Ukraine. The dynamics in Europe are very suggestive. The continent is at the start of a medium-range missile build up, led first by the Russian decisions about the INF, followed by the U.S. response to Russia’s missile development, and now by the tensions over Ukraine. These dynamics are very reminiscent of the late 1970s, following the Soviet development of the SS-20 and NATO’s decision to deploy U.S. systems in Germany. The difference this time around is twofold. First, the U.S. and European systems now under development are strictly conventionally armed. However, a second Trump administration may revisit warhead options for the Tomahawk missile, which could open the door for a nuclear armed cruise missile variant. The RS-26, in contrast, appears to have been designed for a nuclear role. However, the variant used to strike Ukraine was obviously carrying a conventional payload, which suggests that Russia may deploy a certain number of Oreshnik/RS-26 missiles with a conventional only payload. Second, the situation in Europe has changed considerably since 1987. The United States and Russia no longer have a near monopoly on missile development and manufacturing. European and Asian missile makers now have the capabilities to build comparable systems to the missiles now spreading throughout Europe. The European missile maker, MBDA, for example, is developing a 'deep strike' cruise and anti-ship missile that will replicate Tomahawk and 9M729 capabilities for probable deployment in Western Europe first, with the option to sell to Eastern European countries. South Korea makes a series of ballistic missiles and is working with Poland on long range artillery rockets, similar in design to the American ATACMS now being used by the Ukrainians. France and the United Kingdom make the very capable Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile, which could very easily be modified for carrying on trucks. The proliferation of these systems, this time around, means that the leverage of both the United States and Russia will be far more limited in constraining missile deployments in the near future. Put simply: it is no longer realistic to suspect that a bilateral agreement, where both sides demand concessions from each other, along with their allies, could be easily reached and enforced. Putin has, at times, dangled a moratorium on intermediate-range deployments following the INF’s demise. The United States and Russia may, at some point in the future, decide it is in their mutual interest to sit down again and discuss limits on certain missile deployments. However, as Europe now grapples with the continued prospect of war in Ukraine, along with a fierce U.S. effort for NATO countries to enhance their defenses, it’s almost certain that Europe will soon be awash in various intermediate-range missile systems. This makes the prospect of bilateral arms control moot and will exacerbate intra-European fissures about how best to deal with a revanchist Russia once the war in Ukraine ends or stalls out. The future of Europe remains fraught. The trends suggest an environment with more missiles, made by more countries, and deployed very close to Russia’s border. This is a less-than-ideal outcome for Putin, one that will certainly incentivize him to return the favor and deploy countervailing systems. This is called an arms race. Europe is, once again, at the start of one. About the author: Aaron Stein is the President of the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI).

Ukraine Defense Minister Discusses Boosting Security With South K...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Defense Minister Rustem Umerov's talks in South Korea on November 27 focused on cooperation on the security of both Ukraine and South Korea in light of the deployment of North Korean forces in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Zelenskiy said Umerov went to Seoul at his instruction to discuss all aspects of North Korea’s involvement in the war 'and the things we can do together to defend our nations and to secure our regions together.' Umerov said earlier that he had discussed joint steps to strengthen security and stability with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol while in Seoul. Umerov also met with South Korea’s defense minister and national-security adviser. 'We believe that our arguments about the need to increase cooperation between Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will lead to a tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions,' Umerov said on Telegram. Umerov said he raised the presence of the North Korean troops and the North Korean military's 'active' support for energy infrastructure attacks on Ukraine. For South Korea, the deployment of the North Korean troops poses a serious threat because they are gaining combat experience, which could create additional security challenges, he said. A statement issued by Yoon’s office does not say whether the parties discussed the possibility of Seoul supplying weapons to Ukraine. Ukraine has previously asked Seoul for weapons, and South Korea has said it could consider such aid, depending on what Russia and North Korea do. Zelenskiy also said in his nightly address that decisions made in July at the NATO summit in Washington on air defense and other supplies to the front line 'have not yet been fully implemented…and this, of course, has had a significant impact on our people’s motivation and morale.' The recent authorization of long-range strikes on military targets in Russia 'has been helpful, but the pressure on Russia must be maintained and increased at various levels to make Russia feel what war really is,' Zelenskiy said. Russian forces have been making steady gains along the front line as Kyiv's troops battle a larger and better equipped enemy. Zelenskiy did not mention a news report that President Joe Biden's administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was quoted earlier on November 27 by the Associated Press as saying that the outgoing administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from 25 to help expand the pool of fighting-age men. The official said 'the pure math' of Ukraine's situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight, according to the AP. The official said the Ukrainians believe they need about 160,000 additional troops, but the U.S. administration believes they probably will need more than that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP2RndEdcRWdYhHtUTRrHG	2024-11-27T15:54:39-08:00	
Trump To Name Retired Army Lieutenant General As Special Envoy Fo...	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg to serve as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg was chief of staff on Trump’s National Security Council during his first administration and was the national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. 'Together, we will secure peace through strength, and make America, and the world, safe again,' Trump said in a statement naming Kellogg as envoy. Kellogg spoke exclusively with VOA’s Ukrainian service in July about his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, published as part of the book, 'An America First Approach to U.S. National Security.' At the time he said he had not presented the plan to Trump nor was he a formal adviser but said the plan would be one option to consider. He recommended then that the U.S. begin a formal policy 'to seek a ceasefire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict.' The U.S. would continue to arm Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking during or after a deal is reached, under the condition that Kyiv agrees to enter into peace talks with Russia. To persuade Russia to participate in the negotiations, Kellogg wrote that the U.S. and other NATO partners would delay Ukraine's membership in the alliance for an extended period in exchange for a 'comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees.' Under the imagined deal, Ukraine would not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all of the territories. The strategy proposes partial lifting of sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace and establish levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine's reconstruction.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP2RndEdcRWS2qH8mln-IZ	2024-11-27T15:51:18-08:00	
Will Ceasefire Deal To End Israel-Hezbollah War Achieve Lasting P...	By Najia Houssari and Anan Tello The world has largely welcomed a ceasefire deal which ends 13 months of fighting betrween Israel and Hezbollah that has claimed the lives of at least 3,700 Lebanese and more than 130 Israelis. The deal between the governments of Israel and Lebanon, brokered by the US and France, came into effect on Wednesday at 4 a.m. local time. From the Israeli army’s perspective, the war in Lebanon was coming to a point of diminishing returns. It has succeeded in weakening Hezbollah’s military standing and eliminating its top leadership but has been unable to wipe it out entirely. For its part, Hezbollah has been seriously debilitated in Lebanon; the war has eroded its military capabilities and left it rudderless. Looking at it optimistically, the diplomatic breakthrough — which unfolded on Tuesday night as Israel unleashed a barrage of bombs on central Beirut — could be the beginning of the end of the long-standing 'Israel-Iran shadow war,' as a new administration prepares to assume power in Washington. Hezbollah and the Israeli military began to exchange cross-border fire on Oct. 8, 2023, one day after Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a deadly Hamas-led attack. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 this year, when Israel began heavily bombing several parts of Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s stronghold in the south. The airstrikes killed thousands of Lebanese, displaced some 1.2 million others, flattened residential buildings, and devastated 37 villages. While the ceasefire deal calls for a 60-day halt in hostilities, President Joe Biden said that it 'was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' Negotiators have described it as laying the groundwork for a lasting truce. Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah will remove its fighters and arms from the region between the Blue Line and the Litani River, while Israeli troops will withdraw from Lebanese territory during the specified period. Thousands of Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers will deploy to the region south of the Litani River. A US-led international panel will oversee compliance from all sides. However, uncertainty persists, as both Hezbollah and Israel have warned that they will resume fire if the other party breaches the agreement. Hezbollah stated it would give the ceasefire pact a chance, but Mahmoud Qamati, the deputy chair of the group’s political council, stressed that Hezbollah’s support for the deal depends on clear assurances that Israel will not resume its attacks. Likewise, Israel said it would attack if Hezbollah violated the agreement. The army’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, also urged residents of southern Lebanese villages — who had fled in recent months — to delay returning home until further notice from the Israeli military. David Wood, a senior Lebanon analyst with the International Crisis Group, believes that while the ceasefire is desperately needed, it 'will almost certainly not bring Lebanon’s troubles to an end. 'Many of the country’s displaced may not be able to return home for months, as Israel has razed entire villages near the Blue Line border,' he said. 'Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s domestic foes claim they will no longer accept the group’s dominance over Lebanese politics — a pledge that promises still more instability.' Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, also cannot see this ceasefire bringing an end to Lebanon’s problems as the war has already triggered shifts in internal alliances. Describing the deal as a 'capitulation,' he said during an interview with the BBC that 'the majority of the Lebanese people, including Hezbollah's own support base, did not want to see Lebanon dragged into this war.' 'After all this devastation, after Hezbollah having now to capitulate and withdraw away from that border north of the Litani River, having to accept an American-led mechanism led by a general who is part of CENTCOM in the region, this is going to be highly embarrassing,' he said. 'And there's going to be a day of reckoning for Hezbollah in Lebanon once the ceasefire actually goes into effect.' He added that politically, this means that 'the various Lebanese parties and the various also alliances that had been in place before this war are no longer going to be there.' 'We saw, for example, Hezbollah’s crucial Christian ally distance itself from the group now, very much moving towards the center or even in opposition to Hezbollah.' Gebran Bassil, leader of the Maronite Free Patriotic Movement and a close ally of Hezbollah since 2006, said earlier this month that his party is 'not in an alliance with Hezbollah.' In an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, he added that Hezbollah 'has weakened itself and exposed its military strength, leaving Lebanon as a whole vulnerable to Israeli attacks.' Also acknowledging the toll on Hezbollah is Lebanese political analyst Ali Al-Amin. He expressed concern that, while the ceasefire deal is a positive development, its terms signal a significant shift for Hezbollah. 'People were happy at first glance about the ceasefire agreement, as it is a basic demand after a fierce, destructive war,' he told Arab News. 'However, there are many (unanswered) questions, starting with the nature of the agreement and its content. 'In a first reading, I believe that Hezbollah’s function has ended. The prohibition of military operations and weapons, the necessity of destroying and dismantling weapons facilities, and the ban on the supply of weapons are all preludes to ending the party’s function.' Hezbollah’s main ally, Tehran, expressed support for the ceasefire. Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, welcomed the end of Israel’s 'aggression against Lebanon.' He also reaffirmed his country’s 'firm support for the Lebanese government, nation and resistance.' Before the Israeli cabinet approved the deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ceasefire would allow his country to 'intensify' pressure on the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and focus on the 'Iranian threat.' Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israeli analyst with the ICG, believes that 'for Israel, the ceasefire is not necessarily an end to the war, but a pause' in fighting. She said: 'It will free up forces and resources to Israel’s other fronts in Gaza, the West Bank, and Iran, and is a chance to test out Israel’s ability to take military action to enforce the ceasefire, which is being sold as the main difference between the resolution that ended the 2006 war and this time around.' Al-Amin believes Iran, Israel’s biggest adversary, has accepted this shift affecting its ally Hezbollah. However, he stressed that while the deal remains 'subject to implementation,' it raises questions about the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and Washington’s role in overseeing its execution. Echoing Al-Amin’s concern, Heiko Wimmen, ICG project director for Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, said: 'The ceasefire is based on the commitment of both Lebanon and Israel to finally implement Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. 'The challenges are the same as 18 years ago, namely, how to make sure that both parties comply in the long term and what to do with Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which constitute a threat to the security of Israel, and potentially other Lebanese, whether they are present on the border or a few kilometers away.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who welcomed the ceasefire deal, reiterated on Wednesday his government’s commitment to implementing Resolution 1701. UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted to resolve the 2006 Lebanon war, called for a permanent ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, the establishment of a buffer zone free of armed personnel other than UN and Lebanese forces, Hezbollah’s disarmament and withdrawal from south of the Litani River, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. However, Maksad of the Middle East Institute, emphasizes that implementing a ceasefire in Lebanon — US-led and otherwise — will demand more than just adhering to the deal’s terms, especially on the domestic front. 'There is a crucial need to rearrange the deck in Lebanon,' he said in an interview with the BBC. 'You need to elect a president in Lebanon, one that is a sovereign-minded president that would work with the Lebanese army and provide it with the political cover it needs to help and implement this resolution together with the UN troops that are there and also the international community.' He added: 'You also cannot begin the task — the mammoth task — of rebuilding, the reconstruction, the tune of billions of dollars if you don’t have a reform-minded government.' And while the ceasefire brings a faint hope for Lebanon’s displaced population, many of those affected perceive its terms through the prism of personal loss, questioning what, if anything, had been gained from the war. Nora Farhat, whose family home in Anqoun in Beirut’s southern suburbs was reduced to rubble, lamented that the agreement 'will not restore our destroyed homes or bring back those who were killed — loved ones we have yet to bury.' The scale of destruction in southern villages means return is not an option for many, who are left wondering about Hezbollah’s future and its ability to maintain its influence in the region. Analyst Al-Amin believes that Hezbollah’s immediate focus will likely shift to managing the domestic narrative. 'Hezbollah’s priority now will be how to reverse the defeat into victory at home, and how to prevent the Lebanese from questioning what happened and why it happened,' he said. Some of those displaced from Shiite-majority villages in the south expressed frustration at being caught in the crossfire of Hezbollah’s conflicts with Israel. For Ahmad Ismail, who was displaced from his home in south Lebanon, the war and its aftermath seemed 'futile.' He told Arab News: 'There was no need to open a southern front under the slogan of supporting Gaza, as those who sought this war sought to humiliate us. 'If only we had implemented the May 17 agreement in the 1980s with Israel, we would have been spared wars, killing and destruction, and the Shiite sect would not have reached the point of displacement, death, and frustration it has reached today.' Ismail, who was previously imprisoned in Israel, believes the ceasefire is the only positive aspect of the US-brokered truce deal. 'It is a good initiative toward making this the last of the wars and a step toward disarming illegal weapons,' he said. 'It also paves the way for restoring the state to its role, which Hezbollah undermined by monopolizing decisions of war and peace without consulting anyone.' Despite the Israeli military’s warning, Lebanese people displaced from their homes in the south began flocking to their villages. Ismail believes 'people are currently in shock. Some still cannot believe that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has been killed, and many have not yet seen what happened to their homes and villages. 'When they wake up from the trauma, we will see the repercussions.' Ismail added: 'A disaster has befallen the Lebanese people, and Hezbollah must be held accountable. Hezbollah is no longer able to mobilize the people through the power of weapons, excess force, and money.' As Lebanon begins to pick up the pieces, many still wonder if this ceasefire will offer more than just a temporary reprieve — or if it will be the beginning of an uncertain future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeicgYiRV2dZlL45X0am235	2024-11-27T15:49:33-08:00	
Outgoing President Biden Must Use US Laws To Rein In Israel – OpE...	When an elected American official has to worry about getting reelected, they often restrain themselves and avoid pursuing controversial policies. But when the reelection option is no longer available and they are in what is termed a lame duck period of office, the elected official can do whatever they want within their powers without worrying about voter consequences or their critics. That is the situation Joe Biden is currently in as he prepares to relinquish the powerful office of president of the United States. He is effectively more powerful today than he was on the first day of his presidency. As president, Biden can take actions that do not require approval from Congress, including major foreign policy moves. These include negotiating agreements and recognizing foreign governments. As the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he can also take many military actions, such as ordering military operations or unit deployments, though long-term actions would require eventual congressional approval under the US War Powers Act. We have already seen Biden exercise these powers with respect to the Ukraine-Russia war. Biden this month removed restrictions that had been placed on Ukraine’s use of US-supplied long-range missiles, allowing them to be fired into Russia and not simply used against troops that had entered Ukrainian territory. This decision changes the war’s dynamics, giving Ukraine’s armed forces the ability to launch offensive assaults to counter Russia’s bombings of its cities and other targets. Ukraine’s other major weapons suppliers in NATO, including the UK and France, now appear to have followed suit and removed restrictions on the arms they supply or are at least considering doing so. Why can Biden not do the same thing with Israel and stop the flow of US weaponry and funding that is fueling Tel Aviv’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza? During the past year, the majority of people injured or killed in Gaza have been civilians. Although it is estimated that more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed, there is no way of knowing the precise number because Israel prohibits foreign journalists from entering the Strip. There is more than enough justification for Biden to do now what his administration failed to do when Israel began its war on Gaza last October. All he has to do is apply the American laws that prohibit the supplying of weapons to foreign nations that engage in the killing of civilians and genocide. There are five laws that restrict how foreign countries can use US money and weapons. However, until now, the outgoing administration has refused to enforce them. The Leahy Law prohibits the US government from using any funds to assist foreign security force units when credible information exists that implicates that unit in the commission of gross human rights violations. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits the allocation of financial assistance to any foreign government that 'engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.' The Arms Export Control Act states that foreign nations that receive US military aid can only use the weapons for legitimate self-defense and internal security. The War Crimes Act forbids breaches of the Geneva Conventions, which define the rules of warfare and prohibit the mistreatment of noncombatants and civilians, such as willful killings, torture or inhuman treatment, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and unlawful deportation or transfer. These are all methods routinely used by Israel to enforce its illegal occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. And the Genocide Convention Implementation Act was enacted in 1987 and establishes genocide as a specific crime. It provides for criminal penalties for individuals who commit or incite others to commit genocide. Each of these five laws give Biden the power to take action against Israel and end the ferocity of its military assault against Gaza and Lebanon. What does Biden have to lose? The election is over. His party lost. The outgoing administration has eight weeks to make up for its grievous failure of the last 13 months and try to stop the killing of civilians. Even if this action does not end the war or if Israel continues the carnage, at least it could help to restore a moral foundation to the administration’s legacy. Does it really want to be known as the administration that stood by as Israel killed more than 44,000 Palestinian civilians and thousands more Lebanese civilians? But the White House is hostage to Netanyahu, who needs the genocide to continue in order to derail the three corruption cases against him. It was these charges that pushed Netanyahu to form a coalition with the most extremist elements in Israeli society and extend his time in power. As a consequence, Netanyahu has no compelling reason to end the genocide and he will most likely continue the violence. He may even expand it to include Iran and any other regional nation that refuses to surrender to Israel’s hegemony. When the details of Israel’s atrocities become public — and one day they will — the US will be harshly judged for not acting. Unless it acts now. It is the right thing to do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeicgYiRV2dZmogoS9DTmbc	2024-11-27T15:47:16-08:00	
RFK Jr., Physicians’ Pay Schedules, And The Elites’ Big Lie – OpE...	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is known first and foremost for his anti-vaccine crusades. However, he has also been saying some things that make sense. When Donald Trump first announced him as his pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), he announced his plans to go after the corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. This has the potential to shake up an industry that costs the country more than $650 billion a year, or $5,000 per family. More recently he indicated his intention to go after the pay schedules for physicians in Medicare. This is also a really big deal. The Medicare pay schedules for physicians are largely designed by the physicians themselves, with the specialists deciding how much Medicare should pay them. The result is a system that tends to hugely overpay specialists, partly at the expense of primary care physicians and partly at the expense of the rest of us who must foot Medicare’s bill. The impact of Medicare’s physician payment structure is amplified by the fact that many private insurers follow Medicare in setting their own compensation levels for physicians’ services. This is a big part of the story of why we pay our doctors so much more than doctors in other wealthy countries. The average doctor in the US gets paid over $365,000 a year. This is more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. If we paid our physicians as much as doctors in Germany or Canada, it would save us close to $200 billion a year. The high pay for our specialists is a big part of this story. While our primary care physicians also get paid more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries, the gap is much larger for specialists. Also, a much larger share of our physicians are specialists than in other countries. In most countries primary care physicians do many of the tasks for which we rely on highly paid specialists. The story of doctors’ pay is big money, more than is at stake in things like the expanded child tax credit or other issues that we often have major political battles over. However, it is almost never raised as a topic for political debate. Or at least had not been before RFK Jr. brought it up. A major part of the story is that it runs at odds with the Big Lie has dominated the debate over economic policy for the last half-century. The Big Lie is that the debate has been over whether we should have 'neoliberal' free market policies or whether we should have social welfare policies that protect ordinary people from the market. The physician pay schedule story undermines the Big Lie because it is a way in which the government is very directly intervening in the market to shift income upward, giving money to roughly 1 million physicians at the expense of everyone else. It is not the whole story of government intervention boosting doctors’ pay. The government also severely restricts the ability of foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States, even as our 'free trade' policies have sought to put manufacturing workers in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. And we have all sorts of restrictions on the activities of physicians’ assistants and nurse practitioners that require doctors to do many tasks for which lower-paid health care professionals are fully qualified. These rules are great examples of how the government has structured the market to benefit a narrow groups of very highly-paid workers while imposing higher health care costs on everyone else. The government-granted patent monopolies, which make drugs expensive, is another very important example. These shift close to $500 billion a year in income to the drug companies. This is the story I tell in Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer(it’s free). The basic point is that there is no 'neoliberal' free-market. The market is infinitely malleable and can be structured in ways that produce hugely different outcomes. Those with political power have used it to structure the market in ways that give themselves more money. It is understandable that those who like the resulting distribution of income would be anxious to blame it on the workings of a free market, but for some reason those who claim to want more equality also accept this Big Lie. RFK Jr.’s plans to overhaul the Medicare physicians’ payment system, as well as efforts to end corruption in the pharmaceutical industry, both could lead to less inequality and undermine the Big Lie theory of inequality. As much as I would like to see progress in both areas, I still can’t stomach RFK Jr. His anti-vaccine rants threaten the enormous progress we have made in improving public health with vaccines over the centuries. His fantasies and lies also threaten the lives of people who have spent their careers trying to develop and promote vaccines in the interest of saving lives. They also have been blatantly racist and antisemitic. I’m afraid that I can’t see a scenario where I want to see someone like RFK Jr. hold a position of major responsibility in the government. However, I would like people to take at least some of the things he says seriously.

Feud With Marcos Beyond ‘Point Of No Return,’ Philippine VP Sara ...	By Camille Elemia Philippine Vice-President Sara Duterte said her feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had reached a 'point of no return' after police filed an assault complaint against her and some of her staff. The Philippine National Police (PNP) lodged the complaint on Wednesday amid an uproar over remarks where Duterte publicly threatened Marcos by saying he would be assassinated should she be targeted and killed in a plot. Her comments prompted the president to say that he would 'fight back.' The police accused Duterte and her staff of alleged 'direct assault, disobedience and grave coercion' during the transfer of the vice-president’s chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, to a government-run hospital from the House of Representatives detention center last weekend. The PNP said it had filed a case against Duterte, her chief security aide Col. Raymond Dante Lachica, and two others before the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office in Metro Manila. In response, the vice-president said that the allegations levelled against her 'don’t hold any water.' 'I believe we reached the point of no return and it is clear [that] they are really going after me,' Duterte said Wednesday at a press conference in southern Zamboanga City, where she holds a satellite office, when asked about the possibility of her and Marcos patching things up. 'They really want to remove me from my post.' Lt. Col. Van Jason Villamor, chief of the Quezon City police district’s medical and dental unit, and four other police officers filed the complaint. Villamor was directed to accompany Lopez during the transfer. Lopez was ordered detained at the House last week for contempt after a congressional committee accused her of trying to hamper an inquiry into the alleged budget misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.13 million) of Duterte’s office in Duterte’s role as vice president and the former education secretary. Lopez was later ordered transferred to a hospital after an unspecified health concern. She was supposed to be moved to jail, but Duterte initially prevented it. In a press conference held earlier on Wednesday, police spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo showed a video supposedly showing Duterte and Lachica pushing Villamor, preventing him from fulfilling the order to accompany Lopez during her transfer to the hospital. 'We cannot let this pass,' Fajardo said during the briefing. National police chief Gen. Rommel Marbil said the national force trusted that the courts would conduct 'a fair and impartial investigation into these serious allegations.' 'The Philippine National Police remains steadfast in its commitment to uphold justice and ensure that all individuals are held accountable under the law, regardless of their position,' Marbil said in a statement Wednesday. 'We respect the legal process and trust that the courts will conduct a fair and impartial investigation into these serious allegations.' Also on Wednesday, Marcos adviser and ally Larry Gadon filed a disbarment complaint against Duterte before the Supreme Court over her statement last weekend that she had arranged the assassination of the president, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, and House Speaker Martin Romualdez in case she herself were killed. The National Bureau of Investigation has subpoenaed the vice president over the verbal threat. But Duterte denied making it and said her statement was maliciously taken out of context. Marcos and Duterte – both children of former presidents and scions of influential political Philippine families – had formed a political alliance to win the general election two years ago, but the partnership ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the controversial drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor and Sara’s father, Rodrigo Duterte. The ongoing political feud between Marcos and Duterte could impact foreign policy and the midterm elections in May 2025, observers say. But one political analyst said she would not be surprised if an impeachment complaint were filed against Sara Duterte. 'If [an impeachment complaint against Duterte] happens, it’s something that’s par for the course because of what had transpired,' said Jean Encinas-Franco of the University of the Philippines on Wednesday. 'Her statements actually earned the Marcos administration the legitimacy to go after her,' Encinas-Franco told ABS-CBN’s news program 'Top Story.' 'The threat to kill is very different and something probably unthinkable for most people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWH3_MFbWInQO	2024-11-27T15:35:58-08:00	
Brazil: Federal Police Say Bolsonaro Left Country In 2022 To Avoi...	By Andre Richter The Federal Police concluded that former President Jair Bolsonaro left Brazil in late 2022 to avoid potential arrest and to monitor the outcome of the January 8, 2023, coup attempts from abroad. In the final days of his mandate in December 2022, Bolsonaro traveled to the United States, returning only in March 2023. The details are outlined in a Federal Police report indicting Bolsonaro and 36 others on charges of attempting a coup d'état and the violent abolition of democratic rule of law. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the rapporteur for the coup investigation, lifted the document's secrecy on Tuesday (Nov. 26). Investigators revealed in the report that an escape plan, devised in 2021, outlined steps for the former president to leave Brazil 'if his attack on the judiciary and the democratic regime faced setbacks that could jeopardize his freedom.' During the investigation, police discovered a PowerPoint presentation on the computer of Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide and one of the whistleblowers. The document outlined strategies for establishing an escape and evasion support network, to be employed if Bolsonaro chose to defy Supreme Court decisions. The plan also included the use of weapons to facilitate the escape. According to the investigations, the 2021 escape plan was adapted after the group failed to implement a coup d'état in 2022. 'The escape plan was adapted and used at the end of 2022, when the criminal organization was unsuccessful in carrying out the coup d'état,' the report points out. The police concluded, 'After failing to secure the Armed Forces' support for an institutional rupture, Jair Bolsonaro left the country to evade potential arrest and await the outcome of the January 8, 2023 coup attempts.' The defense Agência Brasil is attempting to contact Bolsonaro's defense and is open to including its statement in the article. At a press conference on Monday (25), the former president declared that he 'never discussed a coup with anyone,' adding that all actions taken during his administration were within 'the four corners of the Constitution.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWG02XAMeMq0t	2024-11-27T15:33:33-08:00	
Iran Says It Will Run Thousands Of Centrifuges In Response To EU3	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said following a resolution initiated by the European troika that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors passed against Iran, Tehran will put thousands of advanced homegrown centrifuges into operation in retaliation. Araqchi and his Spanish counterpart J​ose Manuel Albares Bueno held a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Forum in Portugal’s Cascais on Tuesday. The two diplomats discussed issues of mutual interest, including bilateral relations as well as regional and international developments. Araqchi underscored Iran's principled approach of fostering interaction and cooperation to promote peace and understanding among nations and cultures, the Foreign Ministry’s website reported. He also highlighted the importance of adhering to the rule of law in international relations and respecting international norms and principles. Addressing the precarious situation in West Asia, Araqchi attributed the ongoing genocide and aggression of the Zionist regime against Lebanon and other regional states to the regime’s impunity. The Iranian minister described the comprehensive military and political support provided by the United States and certain European countries as complicity in war crimes and genocide. He also called for decisive global action to halt Israel’s atrocities and warmongering, emphasizing the need to prosecute and hold the leaders of the Zionist regime accountable. Reviewing the recent developments in Iran-Europe relations, Araqchi criticized the confrontational and interfering policies of certain European states as unjustifiable and counterproductive. He warned that in response to the European resolution against Iran in the IAEA Board of Governors, Iran will be activating thousands of advanced centrifuges. Araqchi also reiterated the necessity of addressing international and regional issues with a realistic and law-based approach, emphasizing the need for constructive engagement to resolve the common challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWHDB9JqPtCtc	2024-11-27T15:29:08-08:00	
ACN Report: North Koreans In Contact With Christians Are Sent To ...	By Eduardo Berdejo North Koreans who are repatriated from China and who have had contact with Christians are sent to North Korean political prisoner camps, according to the latest report on religious freedom by the pontifical foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN). 'Persecuted and Forgotten? A Report on Christians oppressed for their Faith 2022-24' was published this month during Red Week and is an initiative by ACN to draw attention to religious persecution around the world. The 2024 edition addresses the situation in 18 key countries, including North Korea. North Korea is a communist nation ruled since 1948 by the Kim dynasty, and although 'gauging the true number of Christians or the extent of their faith in North Korea is exceedingly difficult,' says ACN, 'they are estimated to comprise around 0.38 percent of the population, which equates to just over 98,000 people.' However, despite the small number of believers, Christianity is considered a threat to the state, which is why Christians are forced to go underground. According to the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), the entire population is forced to follow Juche, 'an ideology of Marxist ‘self-reliance’ created by the country’s founder, Kim Il-Sung.' To escape the country, North Koreans often use the extensive 880 mile border with China. If they manage to get past the tightly controlled border, the fugitives must reach a third border undetected, mostly Thailand, and seek asylum in the South Korean embassy, ​​which will send them to South Korea. However, those who are apprehended by the Chinese authorities are repatriated to North Korea. According to Human Rights Watch, in April the Beijing government deported some 60 North Koreans. In its report, ACN refers to the defectors who were repatriated in October 2023 and said there is cause for concern for those 'who had interacted with Christians while they were outside the country. They were all sent to political prisoner camps, known for the harsh treatment of inmates there.' The report notes that while many served reduced sentences, 'those who came into contact with Christianity' were interned 'in political prisoner camps, which is in fact a life sentence without parole.' Citing a source In North Korea who spoke anonymously for security reasons to Daily NK, the ACN report said that 'North Korean state security departments base their interrogations of repatriated defectors on files provided by the Chinese police.' 'If anything related to religion is mentioned in the files, the defectors will be inexorably interned in camps' no matter what they say concerning what happened, the report notes. Believers are considered 'a hostile class' The pontifical foundation states that in North Korea, 'considered the worst country in the world to be a Christian,' people are classified according to their loyalty to the state and 'believers are automatically considered a ‘hostile class’ and subjected to relentless persecution.' 'Although there are widespread violations of human rights throughout the country and religious oppression affecting all areas of life and all religious groups, according to the U.S. State Department, Christians and followers of Mugyo (a shamanic religion) are the most persecuted,' the report explains. Illyong Ju, a North Korean defector who is now a Christian, told ACN that repatriated defectors are being forced to confess anything they may know about the 1,000 people who have not yet been repatriated to North Korea before they actually arrive in the country. However, Illyong Ju emphasized that among the defectors 'there will be people who believe in Jesus and who will spread the Gospel wherever they go. Like Sister Kim, who works with me and who evangelized eight people while she was in a North Korean prison due to her forced repatriation.' 'Therefore, we have faith that those forcibly returned to North Korea will become amazing members of God’s People who will rise up against the oppression of the North Korean regime,' he said.

Global Food Yields Have Grown Steadily During Last Six Decades	Contrary to widespread concerns that global crop yields have stagnated in recent decades, a comprehensive study of worldwide food production finds yields have continued to grow at roughly the same rate since the 1960s. John Baffes of the World Bank and Xiaoli Etienne of the University of Idaho, U.S., report these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE. Almost 10 billion people are expected to inhabit Earth by 2050, so agricultural production will become increasingly critical to feeding the growing population. Over the past six decades, much of the growth in food production has stemmed from technological advances, including the widespread development and use of better crop varieties. But some studies have suggested that the growth in production has leveled off, raising concerns about future food availability, especially in the low- and middle-income countries with the highest population growth. In the new study, the researchers developed standardized measures for production and yield for 144 crops, covering 98 percent of global agricultural land. These measures allow scientists and policymakers to compare agricultural productivity across different countries and regions. The researchers found that there has been no discernable slowdown in the global growth of crop yields during the last six decades – any observed slowdown in specific crops, regions or countries has been offset by gains in others. Their findings show that yields grew annually at a rate equivalent to about 33 kg of wheat per hectare. While the study’s findings are reassuring from a global food supply perspective, the researchers caution that sustainable food production and the affordability of food will continue to be challenges to global food security. They emphasize that these concerns are particularly relevant in the face of intensifying climate change and increased demand for food due to population and income growth. The authors add: 'Utilizing a comprehensive caloric-based index of production and yield for 144 crops, covering 98% of global agricultural land and food output, this paper reveals that, on an aggregate level, global yield growth—a vital indicator of agricultural productivity—has not slowed over the past six decades. This steady growth equates to an annual increase of approximately 33 kilograms of wheat per hectare, highlighting continued productivity gains worldwide.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWMY9wKjf77_r	2024-11-27T15:25:46-08:00	
Food Additive Carrageenan (E 407) Could Disrupt Intestinal Barrie...	The food additive carrageenan - also known as E 407 - is used by the food industry as an emulsifier and thickening agent in numerous finished products. Studies have shown that the additive can lead to the development of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers and increased blood sugar levels in animals. However, it is not yet known what effect carrageenan has on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in humans. This question has now been investigated in a clinical study led by DZD researchers Prof. Dr. Med. Robert Wagner and Prof. Dr. Med. Norbert Stefan. Increasing the permeability of the small intestine In the study, young, healthy men with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m² (average BMI 24.5 kg/m²) were given either carrageenan in addition to their normal diet, in an amount roughly equivalent to two to three times the daily dose consumed in the USA, or a placebo. Both groups were observed over a period of two weeks. The results showed an increase in the permeability of the small intestine, most likely due to inflammation of the gut. 'Our investigation suggests that the consumption of carrageenan, similar to what has been observed in animal studies, can impair the barrier function of the intestine,' explains Prof. Robert Wagner. 'This could have long-term health consequences and increase the risk of inflammatory diseases.' The data indicated that participants with higher body weight experienced a reduction in insulin sensitity The primary endpoint of the study was insulin sensitivity—the effectiveness of the blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin—which decreases early on before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Although the insulin action was not significantly altered by carrageenan in the 20 study participants, the data indicated that participants with higher body weight experienced a reduction in insulin effectiveness, especially in the liver, with increased consumption of carrageenan. Furthermore, more overweight men tended to increase the inflammatory markers in the blood and show signs of inflammation in the hypothalamus—the brain region responsible for sugar metabolism and appetite—under higher carrageenan intake. Further research on the health impacts of carrageenan is necessary. 'Our subjects were, on average, probably still too healthy to show significant metabolic effects from carrageenan,' says Prof. Norbert Stefan. 'However, in older or overweight individuals, the effects could be stronger. To confirm this, further studies in these population groups are necessary.' The researchers emphasize the importance of further investigations into the effects of carrageenan on the human body. 'Given the widespread use of carrageenan in foods, potential health risks should be taken seriously,' concludes Prof. Wagner. 'It’s important that we understand how food additives can affect our health in order to make informed recommendations to the public.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homF8i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-27T15:23:52-08:00	
New Paper Provides Insight Into ‘Boycott And Buycott’ Of Russian ...	More than ten per cent of Chinese citizens who took part in a survey say they are willing to boycott Russian goods and most likely disapprove of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, says new research led by Lancaster University. This important finding, say the researchers, indicates that a substantial minority of the Chinese population might not share the official position of the Chinese Communist Party despite widespread propaganda and censorship. Published this week in the Journal of Contemporary China, the research ‘Willingness to Boycott Russian Goods in China: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Preferences in an Authoritarian Context’ is authored by Dr Barbara Yoxon, of Lancaster University, Xue Bai, of Lancaster University and Richard Turcsanyi, of Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, says the article, the government of the People’s Republic of China has refused to condemn the violence and developed stronger economic and diplomatic ties with its authoritarian neighbour. Recent surveys show that most Chinese people hold a positive view of Russia, despite its war with Ukraine. Unlike previous research, the article investigates the motives of those Chinese citizens who are likely to oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It uses original survey data from 3,029 respondents in China collected as part of the ‘Sinophone Borderlands—Interaction at the Edges’ project to better understand the patterns of political engagement in an authoritarian regime. The paper suggests there is potential for anti-Russian political action in China and suggests that more organised anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian campaigns are possible in the future. That action, says the paper, would have the scope to disrupt the profit margins of Russian companies hoping to escape Western sanctions. In 2023, Russian consumer goods made up 5.1% of China’s 2023 imports and are likely to become even more common in China as Russia becomes more isolated from the Western world. 'While this share of the Chinese market might seem like a low figure, it is important to note that China is home to more than 1.5 billion consumers and even small decreases in the Sino-Russian trade volume would be a significant loss to Russian companies as the war with Ukraine continues,' says the article. By focusing on the interaction between political ideology and political consumerism, the article has identified a group of individuals who are most likely to participate in activities that go against the ideological status quo in China. This is a new avenue of research which goes beyond previous studies that focus on ethnocentric and nationalist causes of Chinese boycott and buycott practices. To help determine who is willing to boycott Russian goods, the article delineated three broad political leanings in China: liberals, neo-authoritarians, and the New Left. The results indicated that liberals, who show higher support for free market policies and lower support for social authoritarianism, are more likely than others to express willingness to boycott Russian goods. The paper argues that liberal individuals are more supportive of the liberal international order and believe that Russia and China should work with, rather than against, multilateral institutions. This means liberals are more likely to interpret NATO’s actions in Eastern Europe as defensive and see Russian actions against Ukraine as unprovoked, aggressive and disproportional. The article found that individuals with neo-authoritarian and New Left leanings are less likely to support the boycott of Russian goods. Neo-authoritarians, who desire free market reform but support the existing sociopolitical structures, were against boycotting Russian goods. They believe that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is an extension of the rivalry between authoritarian China and the liberal United States. They believe that supporting Russia, an allied autocracy, is in China’s national interest. For the New Left, the belief that NATO and the liberal international order is a form of neocolonial domination by the United States has also led to greater levels of support for Russian goods. While it is not surprising, adds the paper, that individuals with more liberal leanings are likely to oppose Russian actions, this is the first study to date to clearly demonstrate such a link. Commenting on the paper Dr Yoxon says: 'The surprising level of anti-Russian attitudes in China suggests that an organised campaign to boycott Russian products might already be underway in China. 'Our findings are important because they show that alternative forms of political participation can be a safe and convenient way for citizens of authoritarian regimes to express their political preferences.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homG-dhbmywnIt	2024-11-27T15:21:30-08:00	
Fowl Play: Why The Hunt For Thanksgiving’s Favorite Bird Could Ge...	The turkey may be the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving dinner table now, but harvesting the iconic holiday bird could become harder in the holidays to come. If hunters continue to follow their current strategies and prey continue their same routine, turkeys may become tougher to harvest in the future, according to new research from the University of Georgia. 'Hunters should be willing to adapt because the turkeys are also adapting as well. If we continue to harvest individuals that are close to risky areas associated with hunters, turkeys will adjust their behavior and could become harder to detect and harder to harvest,' said Nickolas Gulotta, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in UGA’s Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. Gulotta studied risk-taking and exploratory behavior from 109 wild male turkeys across Georgia Wildlife management areas and how they acted in response to both hunters and predators. He and other researchers found that a turkey’s choice of movement and the level of risk associated were directly impacted by hunters and natural predators. Bold birds don’t always benefit Most of the tracked male turkeys showed frequently daring behavior. They traveled close to areas where hunters parked their cars, popular trails and roads, as well as wide open areas. That’s great news for hunters — but not so great for the turkeys. 'If turkeys are closer to these open areas, it’s going to be easier for both a hunter and a predator to detect them. Across both study sites in general, turkeys that took more risks were more likely to be harvested,' Gulotta said. That bodes well for the initial waves of hunters. But when future turkeys see how that turned out for their predecessors, they are unlikely to make those same choices. That means hunters may have to get more creative to find the birds and be more patient. 'Turkeys are obviously adapting and learning that if you’re closer to risky areas, then there’s potential to be harvested. That’s why some of them are adopting less risky behaviors that essentially make them less detectable,' said Gulotta. 'If hunters harvest birds that are riskier and more detectable, it could become more difficult to harvest turkeys because we could be left with a bunch of individuals that are harder to detect.' Predator vs. poultry presents another challenge for turkeys The turkeys that avoided those areas beneficial for hunters often remained static or in high cover areas to survive. A big giveaway for hunters is when turkeys gobble. So, when the birds don’t move around or yap in open spaces, that makes things more challenging for the humans. Turkeys don’t keep calendars, though, so when the hunters vacate and those relaxed routines remain, predators can move in. 'There are certain traits associated with outlasting the hunting season, like hiding in areas with good cover and reducing the distance traveled within a day. But in turn, if turkeys stay in the same area and don’t travel a lot, then they’re going to be more likely to be detected by a predator,' said Gulotta. 'It’s kind of a catch-22 where if they can survive that hunting season, they’re most likely going to be fine. But at the same time, too, if they don’t travel that fast and are predictable, then they have the potential to be killed by a predator.' Future fowl and humans can learn from each other Individual behaviors of turkeys can of course vary, and overall survival techniques are something that can be inherited. This study shows a need for tailored hunting strategies based on local conditions. If an area is patterned with the habitual actions of hunters, then turkeys could become harder to harvest over time. Gulotta said that could also have a long-term impact on hunting license sales and overall hunter satisfaction. 'The turkeys closer to areas that hunters use are the ones that are harvested,' Gulotta said. 'So if we continue to harvest them like that across the Southeast, then there’s the potential that we could shift the behavioral strategies of wild turkeys making them more difficult to harvest.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homEMqhbXSisRU	2024-11-27T15:19:34-08:00	
Oceans Emit Sulfur And Cool The Climate More Than Previously Thou...	Researchers have quantified for the first time the global emissions of a sulfur gas produced by marine life, revealing it cools the climate more than previously thought, especially over the Southern Ocean. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows that the oceans not only capture and redistribute the sun's heat, but produce gases that make particles with immediate climatic effects, for example through the brightening of clouds that reflect this heat. It broadens the climatic impact of marine sulfur because it adds a new compound, methanethiol, that had previously gone unnoticed. Researchers only detected the gas recently, because it used to be notoriously hard to measure and earlier work focussed on warmer oceans, whereas the polar oceans are the emission hotspots. The research was led by a team of scientists from the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) and the Blas Cabrera Institute of Physical Chemistry (IQF-CSIC) in Spain. They included Dr Charel Wohl, previously at ICM-CSIC and now at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK. Their findings represent a major advance on one of the most groundbreaking theories proposed 40 years ago about the role of the ocean in regulating the Earth's climate. This suggested that microscopic plankton living on the surface of the seas produce sulfur in the form of a gas, dimethyl sulphide, that once in the atmosphere, oxidizes and forms small particles called aerosols. Aerosols reflect part of the solar radiation back into space and therefore reduce the heat retained by the Earth. Their cooling effect is magnified when they become involved in making clouds, with an effect opposite to, but of the same magnitude as, that of the well-known warming greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide or methane. The researchers argue that this new work improves our understanding of how the climate of the planet is regulated by adding a previously overlooked component and illustrates the crucial importance of sulfur aerosols. They also highlight the magnitude of the impact of human activity on the climate and that the planet will continue to warm if no action is taken. Dr Wohl, of UEA’s Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences and one of the lead authors, said: 'This is the climatic element with the greatest cooling capacity, but also the least understood. We knew methanethiol was coming out of the ocean, but we had no idea about how much and where. We also did not know it had such an impact on climate. 'Climate models have greatly overestimated the solar radiation actually reaching the Southern Ocean, largely because they are not capable of correctly simulating clouds. The work done here partially closes the longstanding knowledge gap between models and observations.' With this discovery, scientists can now represent the climate more accurately in models that are used to make predictions of +1.5 ºC or +2 ºC warming, a huge contribution to policy making. 'Until now we thought that the oceans emitted sulfur into the atmosphere only in the form of dimethyl sulphide, a residue of plankton that is mainly responsible for the evocative smell of shellfish,' said Dr Martí Galí, a researcher at the ICM-CSIC and another of the main study authors. Dr Wohl added: 'Today, thanks to the evolution of measurement techniques, we know that plankton also emit methanethiol, and we have found a way to quantify, on a global scale, where, when and in what quantity this emission occurs. 'Knowing the emissions of this compound will help us to more accurately represent clouds over the Southern Ocean and calculate more realistically their cooling effect.' The researchers gathered all the available measurements of methanethiol in seawater, added those they had made in the Southern Ocean and the Mediterranean coast, and statistically related them to seawater temperature, obtained from satellites. This allowed them to conclude that, annually and on a global average, methanethiol increases known marine sulfur emissions by 25%. 'It may not seem like much, but methanethiol is more efficient at oxidising and forming aerosols than dimethyl sulfide and, therefore, its climate impact is magnified,' said co-lead Dr Julián Villamayor, a researcher at IQF-CSIC. The team also incorporated the marine emissions of methanethiol into a state-of-the-art climate model to assess their effects on the planet's radiation balance. It showed the impacts are much more visible in the Southern Hemisphere, where there is more ocean and less human activity, and therefore the presence of sulfur from the burning of fossil fuels is lower. The work was supported by funding from organisations including the European Research Council and Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homDiYE-5VYhRG	2024-11-27T15:17:22-08:00	
The Sound Of Traffic Increases Stress And Anxiety	Manmade sounds such vehicle traffic can mask the positive impact of nature soundscapes on people’s stress and anxiety, according to a new study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Paul Lintott of the University of the West of England, U.K., and Lia Gilmour of the Bat Conservation Trust, U.K. Existing research shows that natural sounds, like birdsong, can lower blood pressure, heart, and respiratory rates, as well as self-reported stress and anxiety. Conversely, anthropogenic soundscapes, like traffic or aircraft noise, are hypothesized to have negative effects on human health and wellbeing in a variety of ways. In the new study, 68 student volunteers listened to three 3-minute soundscapes: a nature soundscape recorded at sunrise in West Sussex, U.K., the same soundscape combined with 20 mile per hour road traffic sounds, and the same soundscape with 40 mile per hour traffic sounds. General mood and anxiety were assessed before and after the soundscapes using self-reported scales. The study found that listening to a natural soundscape reduced self-reported stress and anxiety levels, and also enhanced mood recovery after a stressor. However, the benefits of improved mood associated with the natural soundscape was limited when traffic sounds were included. The natural soundscape alone was associated with the lowest levels of stress and anxiety, with the highest levels reported after the soundscape that included 40 mile per hour traffic. The authors conclude that reducing traffic speed in urban areas might influence human health and wellbeing not only through its safety impacts, but also through its effect on natural soundscapes. The authors add: 'Our study shows that listening to natural soundscapes can reduce stress and anxiety, and that anthropogenic sounds such as traffic noise can mask potential positive impacts. Reducing traffic speeds in cities is therefore an important step towards more people experiencing the positive effects of nature on their health and wellbeing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homF1EKiUcN9u1	2024-11-27T15:14:42-08:00	
Unexplained Heat-Wave ‘Hotspots’ Are Popping Up Across The Globe	Earth's hottest recorded year was 2023, at 2.12 degrees F above the 20th-century average. This surpassed the previous record set in 2016. So far, the 10 hottest yearly average temperatures have occurred in the past decade. And, with the hottest summer and hottest single day, 2024 is on track to set yet another record. All this may not be breaking news to everyone, but amid this upward march in average temperatures, a striking new phenomenon is emerging: distinct regions are seeing repeated heat waves that are so extreme, they fall far beyond what any model of global warming can predict or explain. A new study provides the first worldwide map of such regions, which show up on every continent except Antarctica like giant, angry skin blotches. In recent years these heat waves have killed tens of thousands of people, withered crops and forests, and sparked devastating wildfires. 'The large and unexpected margins by which recent regional-scale extremes have broken earlier records have raised questions about the degree to which climate models can provide adequate estimates of relations between global mean temperature changes and regional climate risks,' says the study. 'This is about extreme trends that are the outcome of physical interactions we might not completely understand,' said lead author Kai Kornhuber, an adjunct scientist at the Columbia Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 'These regions become temporary hothouses.' Kornhuber is also a senior research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. The study was just published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study looks at heat waves over the past 65 years, identifying areas where extreme heat is accelerating considerably faster than more moderate temperatures. This often results in maximum temperatures that have been repeatedly broken by outsize, sometimes astonishing, amounts. For instance, a nine-day wave that hammered the U.S. Pacific Northwest and southwestern Canada in June 2021 broke daily records in some locales by 30 degrees C, or 54 F. This included the highest ever temperature recorded in Canada, 121.3 F, in Lytton, British Columbia. The town burned to the ground the next day in a wildfire driven in large part by the drying of vegetation in the extraordinary heat. In Oregon and Washington state, hundreds of people died from heat stroke and other health conditions. These extreme heat waves have been hitting predominantly in the last five years or so, though some occurred in the early 2000s or before. The most hard-hit regions include populous central China, Japan, Korea, the Arabian peninsula, eastern Australia and scattered parts of Africa. Others include Canada's Northwest Territories and its High Arctic islands, northern Greenland, the southern end of South America and scattered patches of Siberia. Areas of Texas and New Mexico appear on the map, though they are not at the most extreme end. According to the report, the most intense and consistent signal comes from northwestern Europe, where sequences of heat waves contributed to some 60,000 deaths in 2022 and 47,000 deaths in 2023. These occurred across Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and other countries. Here, in recent years, the hottest days of the year are warming twice as fast the summer mean temperatures. The region is especially vulnerable in part because, unlike places like the United States, few people have air conditioning, because traditionally it was almost never needed. The outbreaks have continued; as recently as this September, new maximum temperature records were set in Austria, France, Hungary, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden. The researchers call the statistical trends 'tail-widening'―that is, the anomalous occurrence of temperatures at the far upper end, or beyond, anything that would be expected with simple upward shifts in mean summer temperatures. But the phenomenon is not happening everywhere; the study shows that maximum temperatures across many other regions are actually lower than what models would predict. These include wide areas of the north-central United States and south-central Canada, interior parts of South America, much of Siberia, northern Africa and northern Australia. Heat is increasing in these regions as well, but the extremes are increasing at similar or lower speed than what changes in average would suggest. Climbing overall temperatures make heat waves more likely in many cases, but the causes of the extreme heat outbreaks are not entirely clear. In Europe and Russia, an earlier study led by Kornhuber blamed heat waves and droughts on wobbles in the jet stream, a fast-moving river of air that continuously circles the northern hemisphere. Hemmed in by historically frigid temperatures in the far north and much warmer ones further south, the jet stream generally confines itself to a narrow band. But the Arctic is warming on average far more quickly than most other parts of the Earth, and this appears to be destabilizing the jet stream, causing it to develop so-called Rossby waves, which suck hot air from the south and park it in temperate regions that normally do not see extreme heat for days or weeks at a time. This is only one hypothesis, and it does not seem to explain all the extremes. A study of the fatal 2021 Pacific Northwest/southwestern Canada heat wave led by Lamont-Doherty graduate student Samuel Bartusek (also a coauthor on the latest paper) identified a confluence of factors. Some seemed connected to long-term climate change, others to chance. The study identified a disruption in the jet stream similar to the Rossby waves thought to affect Europe and Russia. It also found that decades of slowly rising temperatures had been drying out regional vegetation, so that when a spell of hot weather came along, plants had fewer reserves of water to evaporate into the air, a process that helps moderate heat. A third factor: a series of smaller-scale atmospheric waves that gathered heat from the Pacific Ocean surface and transported it eastward onto land. Like Europe, few people in this region have air conditioning, because it is generally not needed, and this probably upped the death toll. The heat wave 'was so extreme, it's tempting to apply the label of a 'black swan' event, one that can't be predicted,' said Bartusek. 'But there's a boundary between the totally unpredictable, the plausible and the totally expected that's hard to categorize. I would call this more of a grey swan.' While the wealthy United States is better prepared than many other places, excessive heat nevertheless kills more people than all other weather-related causes combined, including hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. According to a study out this past August, the yearly death rate has more than doubled since 1999, with 2,325 heat-related deaths in 2023. This has recently led to calls for heat waves to be named, similar to hurricanes, in order to heighten public awareness and motivate governments to prepare. 'Due to their unprecedented nature, these heat waves are usually linked to very severe health impacts, and can be disastrous for agriculture, vegetation and infrastructure,' said Kornhuber. 'We’re not built for them, and we might not be able to adapt fast enough.' The study was also coauthored by Richard Seager and Mingfang Ting of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and H.J. Schellnhuber of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homMcdm6MKbHbC	2024-11-27T15:13:06-08:00	
Making A Difference: Efficient Water Harvesting From Air Possible	Harvesting water from the air and decreasing humidity are crucial to realizing a more comfortable life for humanity. Water-adsorption polymers have been playing a key part in atmospheric water harvesting and desiccant air conditioning, but desorption so that the polymers can be efficiently reused has been an issue. Now, Osaka Metropolitan University researchers have found a way to make desorption of these polymers more efficient. Usually, heat of around 100°C is required to desorb these polymers, but Graduate School of Engineering student Daisuke Ikegawa, Assistant Professor Arisa Fukatsu, Associate Professor Kenji Okada, and Professor Masahide Takahashi developed a liquid moisture adsorbent that requires only a temperature of around 35°C to do so. This became possible through the use of random copolymers of polyethylene glycol, which adsorbs water well, and polypropylene glycol, which adsorbs water slightly less well. The difference in their water-loving properties created a transfer mechanism that broke down the water clusters, freeing the water more easily. 'This technology has the potential to be applied not only to water supply in arid regions and places with limited energy resources, but also to ensuring access to water in times of disaster and emergency,' Dr. Fukatsu proclaimed. 'Improvements to this technology are also expected to lead to reductions in greenhouse gases and more efficient use of water resources,' Professor Takahashi added. 'From now on, we will aim to improve the liquid moisture adsorbent and increase the efficiency of the entire system in order to make it practical.' The findings are published in ACS ES&T Water.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fdORlbs475ok	2024-11-27T15:11:03-08:00	
Fossil Dung Reveals Clues To Dinosaur Success Story	In an international collaboration, researchers at Uppsala University have been able to identify undigested food remains, plants and prey in the fossilised faeces of dinosaurs. These analyses of hundreds of samples provide clues about the role dinosaurs played in the ecosystem around 200 million years ago. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. 'Piecing together ‘who ate whom’ in the past is true detective work,' says Martin Qvarnström, researcher at the Department of Organismal Biology and lead author of the study. 'Being able to examine what animals ate and how they interacted with their environment helps us understand what enabled dinosaurs to be so successful.' Palaeontologists from Uppsala University, in collaboration with researchers from Norway, Poland and Hungary, have examined hundreds of samples using advanced synchrotron imaging to visualise the hidden, internal parts of the fossilised faeces, known as coprolites, in detail. By identifying undigested food remains, plants and prey, they have recreated the structure of the ecosystems at the time when dinosaurs began their success story. The study focused on a previously underexplored region, Polish Basin, located in the Late Triassic time in the in the northern parts of the then supercontinent Pangea. The researchers built up a comprehensive picture of the Triassic and Jurassic ecosystems (from about 230 to 200 million years ago) by combining the information from the coprolites with climate data and information from other fossils: plants, bite marks, vomit, footprints and bones. 'The research material was collected over a period of 25 years. It took us many years to piece everything together into a coherent picture,' says Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, researcher at the Department of Organismal Biology and the study’s senior author. 'Our research is innovative because we have chosen to understand the biology of early dinosaurs based on their dietary preferences. There were many surprising discoveries along the way.' The coprolites contained remains of fish, insects, larger animals and plants, some of which were unusually well preserved, including small beetles and semi-complete fish. Other coprolites contained bones chewed up by predators that, like today’s hyenas, crushed bones to obtain salts and marrow. The contents of coprolites from the first large herbivorous dinosaurs, the long-necked sauropods, surprised the researchers. These contained large quantities of tree ferns, but also other types of plants, and charcoal. The palaeontologists hypothesise that charcoal was ingested to detoxify stomach contents, as ferns can be toxic to herbivores. The research addresses a significant gap in current knowledge: the first 30 million years of dinosaur evolution during the Late Triassic period. Although much is known about their lives and extinction, the ecological and evolutionary processes that led to their rise are largely unexplored. The study results in a five-step model of dinosaur evolution that the researchers believe can explain global patterns. The team emphasises that understanding how the first dinosaurs achieved their success can offer valuable insights into prehistoric ecosystems and evolutionary processes in general. The results show that dietary diversity and adaptability were crucial survival traits during the environmental changes of the Late Triassic. 'Unfortunately, climate change and mass extinctions are not just a thing of the past. By studying past ecosystems, we gain a better understanding of how life adapts and thrives under changing environmental conditions,' says Qvarnström. 'The way to avoid extinction is to eat a lot of plants, which is exactly what the early herbivorous dinosaurs did. The reason for their evolutionary success is a true love of green and fresh plant shoots,' Niedzwiedzki concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fZksEsZ2uwv0	2024-11-27T15:09:13-08:00	
Strategic Energy Investments In Emerging Economies: JERA’s Role I...	In a bold step that underscores Japan's commitment to global energy partnerships, JERA Co. Inc., Japan's largest power generation and energy company, has invested $1 billion in Bangladesh, solidifying its role in the country's burgeoning energy sector. This investment highlights the transformative potential of international collaboration in addressing energy demands and promoting sustainable development. JERA: A Global Energy Leader with a Vision for Innovation JERA, which stands for Japan's Energy for a New Era, is a cornerstone of Japan's energy infrastructure. It generates 30% of the country's electricity with a total domestic capacity of 61,000 megawatts (MW). Beyond Japan, the company operates power plants with a combined capacity of 13,700 MW in countries including the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. In addition to its power generation capabilities, JERA manages 35 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies, making it one of the world's largest LNG operators. The company's extensive portfolio spans six upstream projects and partnerships with LNG suppliers from 15 countries, reflecting its prowess in navigating the complex global energy market. A Strategic Move into Bangladesh's Energy Sector JERA's involvement in Bangladesh began in 2019 when it acquired the Meghnaghat 718 MW power plant from Indian conglomerate Reliance Power. This plant, once operational, will be Bangladesh's largest gas-based independent power producer (IPP). The project is backed by substantial investments from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and several major banks, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC, MUFG, and Société Générale, with insurance provided by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). The Meghnaghat project features cutting-edge equipment from General Electric (GE) and construction led by Samsung C&T Corporation under an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract. These contributions exemplify the blending of global expertise to deliver high-efficiency energy solutions. Challenges on the Path to Commissioning Despite significant progress, the Meghnaghat project has faced numerous challenges. Delays in constructing gas pipelines and securing consistent gas supplies have hampered operations. In some instances, priority for gas pipeline connections and supplies was given to local power plants, forcing JERA to finance the construction of a branch pipeline at its own expense. For the past eight months, the plant has struggled to secure the continuous gas supply necessary for commissioning and operations. According to Smitesh Vaidya, head of contracts and commercial at JERA Meghnaghat Power Limited, the project is just days away from completion, pending a reliable gas supply. 'We have made significant progress and are close to commissioning,' Vaidya said. 'With state-of-the-art facilities, highly efficient turbines, and competitive tariffs, the Meghnaghat project can significantly enhance Bangladesh's power grid and ensure uninterrupted electricity supply.' The Case for a Land-Based LNG Terminal JERA's vision for Bangladesh extends beyond the Meghnaghat plant. The company has expressed interest in establishing a land-based LNG terminal in Matarbari, a step that could revolutionize Bangladesh's energy infrastructure. Japan, a country prone to earthquakes and typhoons, operates 11 land-based LNG terminals that ensure stability and resilience in energy supply. Bangladesh, by contrast, relies on two floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) in the Bay of Bengal. These floating terminals are vulnerable to disruptions caused by cyclones and other extreme weather events. In 2024 alone, one of Bangladesh's FSRUs was out of operation for over nine months, severely affecting gas supplies and underscoring the need for more reliable infrastructure. JERA's land-based LNG terminal proposal is a timely solution that aligns with Bangladesh's growing energy needs and climate resilience goals. Expanding Horizons: Renewable Energy and Net-Zero Ambitions JERA's commitment to Bangladesh extends beyond LNG and gas-based power. In a letter to the government, the company outlined its interest in a broad spectrum of investments, including- • Renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind power.• Alternative energy solutions, including hydrogen and ammonia.• Expanding LNG supply chains to support industrial growth. The proposed investments could bring $2 to $3 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the next 5 to 10 years. JERA also plans to establish a local office in Dhaka, signaling its long-term commitment to the country's energy future. From a sustainability perspective, JERA's ambition aligns with Bangladesh's aspirations for net-zero emissions. The company envisions partnerships with the government to promote renewable energy and implement innovative technologies that reduce carbon footprints, fostering a greener and more resilient energy landscape. Bangladesh-Japan Partnership: A History of Trust and Growth Japan has been one of Bangladesh's most steadfast allies since the country's independence in 1971. Over the decades, Japan has provided financial and technical support for numerous infrastructure projects, ranging from bridges and roads to power plants and ports. JERA's investment is a continuation of this legacy, reinforcing Japan's role as a partner in Bangladesh's journey toward economic growth and sustainable development. Through initiatives like the Meghnaghat project and potential LNG infrastructure upgrades, Japan's contributions are shaping the future of Bangladesh's energy sector. Looking Ahead: Securing Bangladesh's Energy Future As Bangladesh seeks to expand its industrial base and improve the quality of life for its citizens, a robust and reliable energy supply is paramount. JERA's investments in the Meghnaghat power plant and its vision for land-based LNG terminals and renewable energy development represent a critical step toward meeting these goals. Realizing this vision will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Government support, particularly in ensuring timely gas supply and infrastructure development, will be key to unlocking the full potential of these investments. For Bangladesh, partnering with a global energy leader like JERA is more than an economic opportunity—it is a chance to build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive energy future. By embracing innovation and fostering international collaboration, the nation is poised to emerge as a model for balancing growth with environmental stewardship. As the Meghnaghat project nears completion, it stands as a testament to what can be achieved through perseverance, partnership, and a shared commitment to progress. JERA's journey in Bangladesh is just beginning, and its success could pave the way for a new era of energy excellence in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2faVo9CVLvkA5	2024-11-27T09:51:39-08:00	
Why The Russian Oreshnik Medium-Range Ballistic Missile Is A Game...	Russia now has a great strategic advantage over NATO In the twentieth century there were a number of major game-changers in war that enabled technology advantaged states dominate the geo-political world. The development of atomic weapons and use on Japan near the end of WWII, propelled the United States to strategic dominance, until the former USSR matched this weapons technology. Nuclear weapons enabled mutually assured destruction (MAD), which led to strategic détente until the present day. Its possible that the Russian experimental intermediate range Oreshnik missile system, incorporating new technologies may be such a game-changer in years to come. The hyper-sonic Oreshnik system, which reportedly can travel between Mach 10-12 is equipped with six rocket propelled warheads that can hit targets at such great speeds, making them very difficult to intercept and defend against. The range of potential warheads that can be loaded on the missile provide great versatility. These independent warheads can be guided very accurately onto their targets, minimizing collateral damage, if conventional weapons are used. The mobile nature of their launch systems, make the Oreshnik missile system difficult for the enemy to take out before launch, if they are camouflaged. The Oreshnik system surprised ‘western’ military experts. The use of these weapons on Ukraine as a test showed their effectiveness of hitting their assigned targets accurately, and the inability of Ukraine’s forces to intercept them. The Oreshnik intermediate ballistic missile system was the result of the US withdrawing from the Intermediate Range Ballistic Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019 under the first Trump administration. This is perhaps a massive mistake, as it has allowed Russia to gain a massive strategic advantage, unless the US has also clandestinely been developing its own system. The effect of the Oreshnik system on future warfare is that targets can be destroyed in a war theatre without the collateral damage nuclear weapons cause, leaving massive land masses uninhabitable for long periods of time. The Oreshnik system will save civilian lives, but destroy enemy command and control hubs, aviation and port facilities, troop concentrations, supple and logistic lines, and political targets, if necessary. If such a system is employed before a nuclear launch, then the nuclear deterrent can become ineffective in tactical warfare situations. In the current Ukraine situation, Russian President Putin has an alternative option to nuclear warfare, which until the Oreshnik development wasn’t available. Such capacity by the Russian military must create a caution in the minds of NATO military leaders. If nuclear warheads are used with the system, devastating blows could be made on NATO targets, without NATO forces having the ability to stop such strikes. In the Indo-Pacific region such intermediate range hyper-sonic systems could render intercontinental ballistic systems obsolete. Intermediate systems such as the Oserhnik system could devastate the military infrastructure of nations before they can utilise ballistic missiles. For countries like Australia, the AUKUS platform of nuclear submarines will do little against the potential threats intermediate hyper-sonic systems might pose. Countries like Australia may have to totally re-think its defence doctrine. In the future, the incentive to start any wars with the knowledge an enemy can immediately takeout aggressive forces before they act, will be a disincentive for attack. The Oreshnik missile system should change war doctrine in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fXax1fFwdiL_	2024-11-27T09:48:33-08:00	
Why Are Pomegranates Special? – OpEd	As pomegranate month comes to a close, it is an important time to recognize the significance that the fruit holds in society today as well as to spread awareness of the benefits of pomegranate cultivation. For centuries, pomegranates have held a unique significance across cultures and religions worldwide, celebrated for their medicinal, economic, and cultural values. In Christianity, for example, the numerous seeds of the pomegranate represent the unity of the church and a community of believers. Similarly, in Islam, pomegranates are mentioned in the Koran three times as examples of the good things created by God. In Judaism, pomegranates are a metaphor for the richness of the promised land. During the Jewish New Year, it is customary to eat the fruit one seed at a time, symbolizing their hopes for fulfilled wishes. Similar reverence of pomegranates has been seen across religious texts and ancient civilizations spanning the globe. Beyond cultural significance, pomegranates have also been recognized for their medicinal and nutritional benefits. Preparations of different parts of the plant, including the flower, fruit juice, rind, and bark, have been used to treat a wide variety of conditions, especially gastrointestinal kinds. Rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber, pomegranates also offer nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties that promote overall health and well-being. Despite being one of the earliest cultivated trees, pomegranates remain an essential agricultural crop today due to their growing requirements and economic viability. For one, their resilience to drought and adaptability to climates with cool winters and hot summers make them particularly valuable in arid regions. With relatively low water requirements and minimal inputs, pomegranate farming is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. In drought prone regions like India, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, farmers have reported increased incomes after expansion of pomegranate cultivation due to strong market demands and higher fruit price. Pomegranates offer farmers the opportunity to diversify their crops, moving away from subsistence farming towards a higher-value production and more sustainable agricultural production. The significance of pomegranates is only increasing as they are well suited to adapt to the harsher climatic conditions brought about by climate change. Currently in Morocco, there is a disconnect between farmers producing pomegranates and them processing and exporting their harvests, meaning farmers cannot take advantage of the high value that pomegranates can create. For example, the Oulad Abdellah cooperative in Morocco’s Beni Mellal region produces 12,000 tons of pomegranates annually, yet the majority of production is consumed in local markets and very little quantities are exported. Additionally, between 2023 and 2024, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) distributed 56,329 pomegranate trees in 10 regions for 228 villages across Morocco, benefitting over 1,800 farming families. Despite the region’s fertile soil and ideal climate for pomegranate cultivation, the lack of high-value industrial processing infrastructure prevents these farmers from realizing the true economic potential of their products. Therefore, to seize the opportunity for improvement, HAF proposes to build a modern production system in Beni Mellal, the country’s epicenter of pomegranate production, to produce organic pomegranate products like juice, concentrate, seed oil, and peel powder, both for export to the EU and for domestic sales. With local sourcing of raw materials and a gradual increase in scale of processing, this proposal has the potential to generate an annual revenue of 36 million dollars at full capacity, 41 percent of which would be net margin for farmers to directly benefit from. Not only will this improve the incomes of farmers and their families, but its benefits will spread across communities in the form of tax revenue for local governments, infrastructure improvements, and stable employment opportunities for the marginalized rural population, with an emphasis on women. While pomegranate month is ending, pomegranate cultivation offers an opportunity to create lasting sustainable benefits for many farmers around the world. Far beyond agriculture, pomegranates can be the first step in a transformative process of development, influencing progress in other critical areas like women’s empowerment, water and school infrastructure, and overall health of communities. Just as they were so valued many centuries ago for their diverse benefits, pomegranates can once again become an important staple in people’s lives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fZp-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-27T09:47:15-08:00	
Russia, Africa And Dynamics Of Nuclear Energy Cooperation – OpEd	Amid heightening of geopolitical situation, Russia, perceived as an isolated global player, has been exploring esteemed pathways to get admirable Africa's sympathy, this time capitalizing on its nuclear power technology. In practical terms, Russia has the potential capacity to support Africa's energy shortage which has hold back sustainable economic growth across the continent. Admittedly, Russia's journey, following the collapse of the Soviet era, over the past three decades, somehow, exemplifies the strength and potential of remarkable efforts taken at forging mutual energy cooperation. Perhaps, it's time to ask some critical questions as grounds for an insightful conversation into the degree of achievements and challenges, concretely on the promise of nuclear energy in Africa. Nuclear Topic Features at Summits As part of its geopolitical commitment to Africa, during a plenary sessions of the first and second Russia-Africa summits, held respectively in October 2019 and July 2023, Vladimir Putin highlighted Russia's nuclear energy cooperation with Africa. Acting in accordance with the norms of the national legislation of the Russian Federation and that of African States, for instance, the St. Petersburg summit declared among others, magnitude agreements with a focus on a wide range of pertinent questions of pursuing a joint work and outlined plans to strengthen nuclear policy as it would create a parallel basis for upgrading and raising consequently industrial development in Africa. Several speeches on Africa available at the Kremlin's official website, Putin has underscored, since his ascension to presidency 2001, the fact that the nuclear power industry, where Russia is a technological leader, offers several African partners the creation of an entire industry on a turnkey basis. Agreements on cooperation in the field of atoms for peace have been signed, and interestingly renewed as appropriate, with a number of countries in the region, while in some of them the work has never acquired any practical dimension except to create information propaganda. Joint efforts are currently being envisioned to implement the agreements reached in several previous years, at least for the past decade. According to analytical reports, African countries which signed agreements for such construction of nuclear plants by Russia as follows: Algeria (2014), Ghana (2015), Ethiopia (2019), Republic of Congo (2019), Nigeria (2012, 2016), Rwanda (2018), South Africa (2004), Sudan (2017), Tunisia (2016), Uganda (2019) and Zambia (2016). Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with Kenya in 2016 and Morocco in 2017. A simple 'memorandum of understanding' on nuclear with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali in July 2023 in St. Petersburg went viral world-wide as part of Russia's information propaganda, to show its preparedness to support their development initiatives of these French-controlled African states. Long before these summits, intergovernmental commissions set up between various African countries and Russia, nuclear diplomacy prominently featured at the ministerial levels at their regular meetings. After these meetings, cooperation on implementation of nuclear power was the light of the outcomes of discussions by heads of African regional organizations including the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the East African Community, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, and the African Export-Import Bank. Above-mentioned trends emphasized, as often described, trust and sincere friendship that characterizes Russia-Africa cooperation. Russia's ultimate showcase for nuclear has taken the central stage as a unique and diverse pathway to support Africa's economic development and upset energy deficiency which has affected more 800 million out of Africa's 1.4 billion people. And as a further step to strengthen strategic partnerships within its post-Soviet relations, Russian Rosatom State Corporation's official files starkly show bilateral agreements signed with more than 20 African countries. Africa's Nuclear Case Studies (i) South Africa: President Cyril Ramaphosa unswervingly promised to embark on a swift and vigorous economic resuscitation of South Africa. That proposed radical economic transformation has been crippled by energy shortage/crisis across the country, which is often rated as the best economic power in Africa. Corruption that hollowed out Eskom’s coffers under Jacob Zuma's presidency, lack of plant maintenance and sabotage were blamed for South Africa's electricity crisis. Credible reports said the government spent $1.6 billion from the budget for diesel purchases alone. Eskom's colossal debt, still equivalent to $23 billion. It suffers from electricity outages at troubled state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and rail and port bottlenecks take their toll, industrialization slowed, while social discontent dominates across the country. South Africa has had nuclear contract signed with Russia back from 2015 under Jacob Zuma, at the time of his presidency. According to research sources, main reason why the 2015 nuclear power agreement thrown out by the South Africa's parliament, it was an opaque unilateral deal with Moscow. South African pact with Russia's Rosatom to build nuclear reactors was deemed unlawful by a High Court in April 2017. The Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute (SAFCEI) and Earthlife Africa-Johannesburg had jointly filed the court application to stop the nuclear program. Both the Russian government and the administration of Jacob Zuma put pressure on the South African government to force through the deal by attempting to circumvent South Africa's procurement laws. The Russian government readily offered to build and operate up to eight nuclear power plants at a cost of R1 trillion ($66 billion). South Africa boasts of an excellent reputation on global stage and yet suffers from high youth unemployment, grappling with energy supply deficits and many other economic obstacles. Currently there is still down-to-earth broad disillusionment with the African National Congress (ANC). According to local African and foreign critics, despite its widened bilateral relations many foreign countries, Ramaphosa still consistently attributes weak economic performance on external factors. Corruption has become an unerasable characteristic feature of its today's politics. South Africa scored 41 points out of 100 on the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index. (ii) Arab Republic of Egypt: Quite recently in March 2023, Vladimir Putin spoke at the international parliamentary conference 'Russia – Africa in a Multipolar World' held in Moscow under the auspices of the State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly. In fact, one key question that featured during conference was that Rosatom building a nuclear power plant in Egypt and strategic plans to expand its involvement in the development of national energy systems in the African continent. Putin notably underscored a distinctive fact that in some African countries 100-percent funding would be provided by Russian State. With Arab Republic of Egypt in North Africa, it has been in the works for several years and has a chequered history for decades. The Nuclear Power Plants Authority (NPPA) was established in 1976, and in 1983 the El Dabaa site on the Mediterranean coast was first selected. With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, popular referred to as Maghreb region and part of the Arab World. Egypt is the third most populous country after Nigeria and Ethiopia in Africa. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centers of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities along the Nile Delta. Therefore, Egypt needs sufficient energy to drive its industries and for domestic utilization. Egypt's nuclear plans, however, were shelved after the Chernobyl accident. But, in 2006, Egypt announced it would revive its civilian nuclear power program, and build a 1,000 MW nuclear power station at El Dabaa. Its estimated cost, at the time, was $12.5 billion, and the plans were to do the construction with the help of foreign investors. In March 2008, Egypt signed an agreement with Russia on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Rosatom has shown interest not only Egypt but many other countries in Africa. Over the past two decades, at least, it has signed agreements irreversible guarantee the construction of nuclear energy plants and training of specialists for these countries. Rosatom State Corporation's Director General, Alexey Likhachev, emphasized these points at the first Russia-Africa summit that Rosatom has already been cooperating with more than 20 African countries, in particular, building the largest 'El-Dabaa' NPP in Egypt with an installed capacity of 4.8 GW. The total cost of construction finally fixed at $30 billion in May 2022. Research shows that Russia granted a loan $25 billion for the construction of the nuclear power plant which covers 85% of the work. The remaining expenses will be covered by the Egyptian side by attracting private investors. Under the agreement, Egypt will start payments on the loan, which is provided at 3% per annum, from October 2029. Requirements for Building Nuclear Nevertheless, Russia most often addresses nuclear policy with much propaganda these three decades after the collapse of the Soviet era. Majority of African states in search of establishing energy sovereignty relatively failed in identifying financial sources, and addressing, within the standard framework and the basic requirements set International Atomic Agency Commission. Arguably African leaders have to refine and review their political approach towards energy resolution by adopting nuclear energy, an important area of the bilateral cooperation between Russia and Africa. It has to be understood that a nuclear power program is a complex undertaking that requires meticulous planning, preparation, and investment in time, institutions, and human resources. The development of such a program does not happen overnight and can take several years to implement. Building a large-scale nuclear reactor takes thousands of workers, massive amounts of steel and concrete, thousands of components, and several systems to provide electricity, cooling, ventilation, information, control and communication. In practical terms, according to estimates, another critical question is the aggregate cost involved. There are no silver bullets when it comes to energy sources and as a future sustainable solution to energy crisis across Africa. Transparency for Building Cooperation Most of these post-Soviet years, Russia's growing opacity, agreements clouded in secrecy which feature in its policy is seriously affecting its image inside Africa. That however, it has been pushing nuclear technology to African nations both to turn a profit and to expand its political might on the continent. Despite the complexity of challenges and skepticism, there still lies significant opportunities for both bi- and multilateral cooperation between Russia and African countries. Russia and Africa has had an excellent relations dating from the Soviet times. From an objective assessment, Russia owes Africa absolutely nothing, and consequently has not made public financial commitment for investment in Africa. That has to be Africa's financial institutions preferred task of itemizing the continent's most significant priorities. Today, African countries face unprecedented challenges. Rapid population growth and the worsening energy crisis are constraining economic growth in the continent. Nuclear technologies can become a driver for socio-economic development and a comprehensive solution to the systemic continent-wide problems. But building nuclear power still faces huge financial difficulties across Africa. Without much doubts, Russia could effectively utilize its substantial nuclear technology for expanding its energy footprint on Africa's landscape. In a nutshell, Africa has long been in search for foreign finance to develop large-scale energy projects. Therefore, looking at the good foundation and highly valued the results at the previous two summits, it is now time for Russia seriously consider the unique policy perspectives and to take concrete action for deepening the Russia-Africa partnership, in addition to Egypt's El-Dabaa NPP, in building nuclear in other parts of Africa. Perhaps, the most important forward-looking approach is for the continental organization, the African Union (AU) can – and should – engage its members in a more structured manner and help them minimize the setbacks and particularly put together joint positions on this critical energy issues as relating to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and within the Agenda 2063.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fTSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-27T09:46:23-08:00	
Pivoting East: Bangladesh’s New Diplomatic Strategy – OpEd	In a remarkable pivot from its recent past, Bangladesh is intensifying efforts to distance itself from India's sphere of influence while seeking to strengthen ties with Pakistan and reinvigorate regional cooperation within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). These developments come at a time when growing public discontent with the previous government, under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid, has catalyzed a rethinking of the country's foreign policy and its internal political landscape. Under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, who governed Bangladesh for over a decade, the country's foreign policy was largely seen as being aligned with Indian interests, a strategy that many in Bangladesh have come to view as compromising national sovereignty. The recent actions of the interim government, which replaced Hasina's administration, signal a clear shift toward a more independent course in regional diplomacy. The disillusionment with the previous government reached a boiling point after allegations of serious human rights violations against Sheikh Hasina and her associates. The ex-Prime Minister, charged in nearly 170 FIRs, stands accused of genocidal acts, political repression, and widespread corruption. Many of these charges center around her administration's handling of the Rohingya crisis, its controversial crackdown on political dissent, and alleged misuse of power to consolidate ties with New Delhi. With several close aides of Hasina now arrested, the interim government's decision to freeze the financial accounts of her family underscores the deepening public anger. Critics argue that Hasina's pro-India stance undermined Bangladesh's sovereignty and allowed Indian influence to creep into the country's political and economic decision-making processes. A crucial turning point in this recalibration of Bangladesh’s foreign policy came on October 6, 2024, when Chief Advisor Yunus inaugurated the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters. This event marked a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to strengthen the autonomy of Bangladesh's military, which had previously been seen as subordinated to Indian interests. The Army’s newfound emphasis on national pride is further reflected in recent legislative changes that have rolled back laws providing extra protection to the Mujib family, the political dynasty that has ruled Bangladesh since its independence. The public sees these moves as part of a broader push for reform, signaling the country’s intent to break free from external pressures, particularly from India. One of the most significant moves by the interim government has been inviting the UN Commission for Human Rights (UNCHR) to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during Hasina's tenure. The fact-finding team’s presence in Bangladesh is viewed by many as an opportunity to expose the abuses tolerated under the previous administration, which critics argue were facilitated by India’s tacit support. While the investigation unfolds, Bangladeshis are closely watching the interim government's handling of Sheikh Hasina’s family, including her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy. Wazed, facing severe allegations of corruption and misconduct, has hired the American lobbying firm Stryk Global Diplomacy to sway U.S. policymakers in an attempt to mitigate the political fallout and maintain his family’s international standing. The rupture in Bangladesh-India relations became even more apparent at the 79th United Nations General Assembly, where India expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Yunus. India’s reluctance to engage with its neighbor diplomatically underscores growing frustration in Bangladesh with India's perceived interference in its domestic affairs. Further aggravating matters, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) held a closed-door meeting strategizing support for the Awami League, Bangladesh's ruling political party during Hasina's reign. This move was seen as an attempt to influence internal politics in Bangladesh, and has contributed to the diplomatic rift. In retaliation, Bangladesh recalled its envoy from New Delhi, signaling its intention to distance itself from India’s regional dominance. As Bangladesh distances itself from India, it is looking to strengthen ties with Pakistan, its long-time regional counterpart. A recent diplomatic meeting between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary and the Pakistani High Commissioner marked the beginning of a new chapter in bilateral relations. A follow-up Foreign Secretary-level meeting is scheduled for late November 2024, signifying a new commitment to regional cooperation. Bangladesh's removal of the 100% physical inspection requirement for Pakistani goods is expected to further facilitate trade between the two nations, signaling a thaw in what has often been a strained relationship since the 1971 independence war. The two countries are also working together to revive SAARC, a regional body that has long been sidelined due to political tensions, especially between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has expressed strong support for SAARC's renewal, along with Nepal, suggesting a regional agenda focused on economic integration and collaborative growth. Perhaps the most hopeful sign of changing relations is Bangladesh's promotion of educational exchanges with Pakistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has actively encouraged Bangladeshi students to explore academic opportunities in Pakistan, reflecting a growing desire for people-to-people connections. The moves by Bangladesh to assert its independence and realign with Pakistan also reflect broader regional trends. As India’s assertive regional policies increasingly face pushback, both Bangladesh and Pakistan are seeking to carve out a new space for themselves in South Asia. The push to revive SAARC could be a significant step in this direction, providing a platform for multilateral cooperation and economic integration. For Bangladesh, the road ahead appears to be one of reasserting sovereignty, breaking free from foreign influence, and promoting a vision of South Asia that is less dominated by any one power. Whether these ambitions can be realized, however, depends on navigating the delicate balance between regional cooperation and national autonomy. For now, Bangladesh’s diplomatic shift away from India and towards Pakistan appears to be a pivotal moment in the country's history, driven by a populace eager for justice, reform, and renewed sovereignty.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeL7e1CCfYEgtXJS0wx9yAF	2024-11-27T09:45:10-08:00	
A Renewed US-Pakistan Partnership To Counter Afghan Threats – OpE...	On November 19, the U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller addressed a question about Pakistan's security concerns under Afghanistan's Taliban regime, reiterating a critical point: 'We remain committed to engaging with government leaders and civilian institutions to identify opportunities to build capacity in detecting, preventing, and responding to threats posed by militant terrorist groups.' This statement is more than diplomatic rhetoric. It is a clear acknowledgment of the persistent and escalating dangers emanating from Afghan soil, underscoring the shared understanding between the United States and Pakistan that terrorism remains a potent threat to regional and global stability. The rise in cross-border attacks near the Durand Line and the brazen kidnappings of Pakistani security personnel paint a stark picture: Afghanistan, under the Taliban, is far from the bastion of order it claims to be. These incidents expose the operational prowess of militant groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and others, which exploit Afghanistan’s territorial and administrative gaps to target Pakistan and potentially other regional actors. For Pakistan, these threats are not just a matter of border security but an existential challenge. The narrative that Islamabad’s concerns are overstated or politically motivated does not hold up against the grim reality of attacks that destabilize not just Pakistan but the broader region. The Taliban's refusal—or inability—to curb these groups within their borders is not only a testament to their waning control but also a dangerous signal to the world. Miller’s remarks also signal that Washington sees Pakistan as a pivotal ally in combating terrorism—a relationship with a long and complicated history. The collaboration between these two nations is evolving into a pragmatic partnership based on mutual necessity. While the U.S. may have withdrawn its boots from Afghan soil, it has not turned a blind eye to the evolving threats that Afghanistan poses to South Asia and beyond. The intelligence-sharing, capacity-building, and joint counter-terrorism initiatives that Miller alluded to could mark a new chapter in this fraught yet vital partnership. However, addressing these threats requires more than bilateral efforts. The international community must recognize that an unchecked Afghanistan is a breeding ground for extremism that transcends borders. The Taliban’s repeated denial of the presence of terrorist groups within their territory, despite mounting evidence, is a dangerous delusion. It emboldens these groups, further threatening the fragile peace in a region already on edge. Pakistan’s insistence on international attention is not mere posturing; it is a clarion call for collective action. Without sustained global pressure on the Taliban to fulfill their commitments under the Doha Agreement, which includes severing ties with terrorist groups, the region risks spiraling into deeper instability. The emerging collaboration between the U.S. and Pakistan is a step in the right direction, but it is only the beginning. The challenge now lies in translating diplomatic assurances into actionable strategies that can curb cross-border violence and dismantle the terror networks entrenched in Afghanistan. For too long, the global narrative around Afghanistan has oscillated between neglect and reactive engagement. It is time for a sustained commitment to addressing the root causes of extremism in the region. The U.S.-Pakistan partnership can and must serve as the cornerstone of this broader international effort. Ignoring the threats emanating from Afghanistan is not just a disservice to Pakistan or the region—it is a perilous gamble with global security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeL7e1CCfYEgipZhy_LzYj7	2024-11-27T09:43:47-08:00	
Spain’s Complex Demographic Reality – Analysis	By William Chislett In 2023 there were 100,000 fewer births and 43,000 more deaths in Spain than in 2013. There have been more deaths than births every year since 2015. But for the influx of immigrants the population would have declined substantially –instead it has increased from 46.6 million to 48.6 million–. Not only is the annual number of babies born continuing to decline, but the number of voluntary abortions increased dramatically last year. Now one pregnant woman in four opts for an abortion –in 2013 it was one in five–. These numbers (see Figure 1) underscore a complex demographic reality and present serious challenges. On the one hand, Spain’s average life expectancy (84 years) is the longest in the EU, thanks to a healthier life-style and an efficient public health system –it consistently scores among the top seven performers in most of the models–. Spain’s ageing population includes many centenarians –indeed, the oldest woman in the world was a Spaniard who died this year at the age of 117–. On the other hand, the fertility rate of only 1.16 live births per woman is way down on the 2.8 to 3 throughout the 1960-75 period and also far below the 2.1 at which existing population levels would be maintained. England’s fertility rate is down to 1.44, the lowest figure since records began in 1938. Figure 1. Births, deaths and voluntary abortions, 2013-2023 201320152017201920212023Births425,715420,290393,181360,617337,380322,098Deaths390,419422,568424,523418,703450,744434,114Births less deaths+35,296-2,278-31,342-58,086-113,364-112,016Abortions108,69094,18894,13199,14990,189103,097Abortions as % of pregnancies20.318.319.321.521.124.2Source: INE and Health Ministry. Spain’s baby boom (from the mid-1950s to the late-1970s) came later than in most other European countries and those babies are now either retired or in many cases about to be: over the next 20 years 14 million people are forecast to retire. The ‘baby bust’ that followed the baby boom means there might not be enough workers to replace them. The number of babies born in Spain last year was the lowest since records started in 1941: 322,098 compared with the 434,114 deaths. In order to keep the economy growing and sustain public finances, the alternatives are: boost employment, particularly for women; more immigration; higher taxes; lower pensions; delayed retirement; or reduced public services. The Socialist-led minority government seems to have opted for immigration and is hoping that a proposal to legalise the status of around 500,000 undocumented migrants will pass smoothly through parliament. If so, it would be the ninth such mass regularisation in some 40 years. The Bank of Spain forecast in April that, on current trends, Spain will need around 25 million more immigrants over the next 30 years. The current foreign-born population stands at 9 million (18% of the population). Spain is not the only country in which deaths outstrip births. Among the big EU countries, the same is also happening in Germany, Italy and Poland (see Figure 2), while for the first time since the 1970s the UK also recorded more deaths than births in the year to mid-2023. France is not (yet) in that situation, but even so President Emmanuel Macron has called, rather melodramatically, for ‘demographic rearmament’, as if his country was going to war. The number of Spain’s abortions last year is also striking: one abortion for every four pregnancies, a similar proportion to France’s but far higher than Germany’s and Italy’s one abortion for every seven pregnancies, and Poland’s one per thousand. Figure 2. Population, births, deaths and voluntary abortions in selected EU countries, 2023 CountryPopulation (mn) at 1/I/24BirthsDeathsAbortionsGermany83.4693,0191,027,916106,218France68.4678,511631,153232,000(2022)Italy58.9379,339660,60056,500Spain48.6322,098434,114103,097Poland36.6272,451409,036425Source: Eurostat and United Nations. The abortion figures reflect countries’ different laws. In Poland, for example, where the influence of the Roman Catholic Church is now strong, abortion has been largely outlawed since the 1990s after decades of permissive legislation during the communist era. Spain’s laws, however, have been gradually liberalised since 1985. Last year’s rise of almost 13,000 abortions in Spain is partly attributable to a change in the law enabling 16- and 17-year olds to have an abortion without parental consent. Spain’s abortion rate in 2023 was 12.22 for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, up from 11.68 in 2022 and 10.46 in 2014. Just over 45% of women who had an abortion had used no form of contraception, a shocking figure. According to a survey published last month by the Spanish Contraception Society (SEC), 23.2% of fertile women hardly ever use contraception and almost 40% had used the morning-after pill, indicating that the real number of pregnancies avoided post- rather than pre-intercourse is much higher. The lack of protection is also seen in the alarming rises in gonorrhoea and syphilis –42% and 24%, respectively– between 2021 and 2023, according to the Instituto de Salud Carlos III. These figures are a sad reflection of the lack of sex education in schools, particularly the Roman Catholic concertados (State-subsidised private schools), which is a national disgrace. Figure 3. Fertility rates in selected EU countries (live births per woman) Live births per womanFrance1.79Germany1.46EU average1.46Poland1.29Italy1.24Spain1.16Source: Eurostat. Polls show that in principle couples would like to have more than one child. The main reason for not having more, according to the first-ever study on the issue by the state CIS pollster published last month, is ‘the lack of economic resources’ (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The main factors for having few children (%) %Lack of economic resources77.3Problems in reconciling work and life44.1In order not to limit professional opportunities26.4Because children are a big responsibility25.5Concern over the future that children will have23.7Because having the first child was delayed too long22.8Because of insufficient public aid20.6Source: CIS. As a result of the acute lack of affordable housing, in particular, Spaniards leave home on average at the age of 30 (EU average: 26). This, in turn, postpones couple formation and babies. The average age at which a woman has her first child is 31.6 years (EU average, 29.7 years). And many leave it even later, something that has made Spain’s fertility clinics a growth industry. Spain is now the EU country with the highest proportion of first-time mothers over the age of 40 (10.7% of births, double the EU average, and up from 6.8% in 2013). Maternity and paternity leave has been equalised (16 weeks at full pay), but much more needs to be done to encourage childbearing. These and other policies do not compensate for the lack of affordable housing (back in the 1970s, during the Franco regime, paternity leave was a symbolic one day). As a percentage of GDP, Spain’s family-benefits public spending is half that in northern European nations. Only Belgium, Denmark, Lithuania, Norway and Slovenia provide free childcare, something that Spain can only do if it raises more revenue from taxes. Unicef ranks Spain 20th out of 41 OECD and EU countries in childcare policies based on maternity and paternity leave, access, quality and affordability (see Figure 5). Figure 5.

As well as affordable, or better still free, childcare, work needs to be made more flexible and men should do more housework. There have been improvements in Spain in the latter two areas, but not enough. There’s a traditional Spanish saying to the effect that Todo niño nace con un pan debajo del brazo (literally ‘Every baby is born with a loaf of bread under its arm’). Unfortunately, nowadays more and more people seem to believe that a baby is in fact unaffordable.

It’s Time For The US To Bid Farewell To NATO – OpEd	By Alexander Coward In April 1949, as Cold War tensions between the United States and Soviet Union intensified, 12 nations came together to sign the North Atlantic Treaty, giving birth to NATO. The alliance was formed with a clear purpose: to provide collective defense against the looming threat of Soviet expansion. At that time, Europe was still reeling from the devastation of World War II, its economies in shambles and its militaries depleted. The US, triumphant in victory and solidifying its position as a global superpower, took on the mantle of protector, extending its military might across the Atlantic and halfway across Europe. Fast forward 75 years. The world has changed dramatically, yet NATO persists as a relic of a bygone era. The Soviet Union is no more, replaced by a Russia with a GDP smaller than Italy’s. The European Union, along with the United Kingdom, boasts a combined economy nearly ten times the size of Russia’s. France and the UK possess their own nuclear deterrents. Yet, inexplicably, US taxpayers continue to foot the bill for Europe’s defense. With Russia weakened, Europe is getting a free ride Some argue that Russia’s actions in recent years, particularly its invasion of Ukraine, justify the US’s continued NATO membership. They paint a picture of a resurgent Russian threat, echoing the Cold War narratives of the past. But this comparison falls flat when we examine the facts. During the Cold War, the US faced off against an empire of comparable might. The Soviet Union’s military and economic power posed a genuine threat to both Western Europe and US interests. Today’s Russia, however, is a shadow of its former self. With a GDP of about $2 trillion, it pales in comparison to the combined economic might of the EU and the UK, which totals more than $22 trillion. Moreover, the population demographics tell a similar story. Russia’s population is less than 150 million, dwarfed by that of the EU and UK totaling more than 500 million. The combined military spending of the EU and UK stands at $370 billion, far outstripping Russia’s total defense budget of $130 billion. Yet, despite these advantages, Europe continues to rely on the United States for its security. Ironically, the US’s persistent role in NATO may be making Europe less secure, not more. What matters for European defense isn’t raw might, but speed, agility and political will. NATO’s cumbersome decision-making process, requiring consensus among 32 members, is ill-suited to respond to modern threats. An army of motivated Polish and German fighters willing to fight and die to protect their freedom is a far greater deterrent to Russia than a US military that is truly awesome in its capabilities, but reliant on the whims of a foot-dragging US Congress for that to translate to the battlefield. The current arrangement doesn’t strengthen Europe; it weakens it, leaving the continent less prepared to address threats from Russia and elsewhere. While US citizens shoulder the burden of NATO’s defense spending, Europeans have grown complacent. They’ve built generous welfare states where they enjoy long vacations, early retirements and universal healthcare. Meanwhile, US workers struggle with rising healthcare costs, minimal paid leave and relentless anxiety about how they will pay the bills. This disparity is not just a matter of different priorities; it’s a direct result of Europe’s ability to skimp on defense spending, knowing full well that Uncle Sam will always be there to pick up the slack. It’s time to ask: Why should the US taxpayer subsidize Europe’s lavish lifestyle? A new era demands new priorities Proponents of NATO often point to the US’s nuclear umbrella as a critical component of European security. But this argument ignores a crucial fact: Both the UK and France possess their own nuclear arsenals, which was not the case when NATO was formed. These two European powers have more than enough nuclear capability to deter any potential aggressor. The idea that US nuclear weapons are necessary for European security is a Cold War anachronism that does not stand up to scrutiny. As we approach 2025, the world faces challenges that were unimaginable when NATO was founded. Climate change, cyber and biological warfare and the rotting minds of our children addicted to social media platforms like TikTok and video games like Fortnite are the true existential threats of our time. These are the battles that will define the 21st century and beyond, not a rehash of 20th century geopolitics. If there is a new Cold War between rival superpowers, it exists across the North Pacific, not the North Atlantic. It’s better for the US to leave Some will argue that leaving NATO is too risky, that it could destabilize Europe and embolden Russia. But this view underestimates Europe’s capabilities and overestimates Russia’s. By continuing its outdated commitment to NATO, the US is fostering dependency and resentment, preventing Europe from developing the military self-reliance it needs. Proponents of NATO often point to its invocation of Article 5 after the September 11 attacks as proof of the alliance’s value. However, this argument ignores a crucial reality: The response to the attacks would have happened with or without NATO. When faced with acts of aggression that demand a response, the United States has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to rapidly form and provide leadership to coalitions outside of formal alliance structures. The First Gulf War in 1991 serves as a prime example. In response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the US quickly assembled a coalition of 42 nations, many of whom were not NATO members. This 'coalition of the willing' included fighters from countries as diverse as Japan, New Zealand and Afghanistan. The swift and effective formation of this coalition underscores a fundamental truth: When genuine threats arise, nations band together to address them, which can be easier without the cumbersome framework of an organization like NATO. Game theory offers another compelling reason for the US to leave: the strategic value of unpredictability. In a world of mass surveillance where concealing actions is increasingly difficult, being predictable can be a significant disadvantage. Consider a poker game where one player always has a pair of kings, while the other has queens or aces with equal probability. Despite each player having the stronger hand half the time, the unpredictable player will on average win more. This principle applies similarly to military strategy. NATO’s rigid structure and well-defined protocols make its responses predictable. By leaving NATO, the US introduces an element of uncertainty that can serve as a more effective deterrent. Potential adversaries would no longer be able to rely on a known command and control structure or anticipate specific responses. This unpredictability can in turn force adversaries to be more cautious, preventing conflicts before they begin. Moreover, while it is true that P implies Q does not mean the same as not P implies not Q, there is often an implicit assumption that it does. By the United States declaring 'If there is an attack on a NATO country, there will be an overwhelming response from the United States' it suggests to potential enemies that 'If there is an attack on a non-NATO country, the United States will not respond with overwhelming force.' This is clearly seen in Ukraine, where Putin is in plain sight employing the principle: 'Ukraine not NATO, therefore Ukraine fair game.' The reality on the ground is that the Iron curtain no longer exists and we live in a world with fuzzy borders and hybrid warfare. The correct response to this is illustrated regarding Taiwan. Will America go to war to defend Taiwan? It might. That should be the answer to every question of that form. Will America go to war over a sabotaged undersea cable or gas pipeline? It might. Will it go to war over an act of terrorism? It might. Will America go to war to defend Europe? It might. America should go to war when the American President and Congress decide that it should, not because of a treaty from three quarters of a century ago born of a different age. By withdrawing from NATO, the United States would put Ukraine on equal footing with not just Poland but also France and Germany, and be a masterstroke of expanding not contracting American influence. In essence, by stepping away from NATO, the US would paradoxically enhance global security by keeping potential aggressors guessing about the nature and extent of possible responses to their actions. It’s time to go The time has come for bold leadership. President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory and Republican control of Congress provide a unique opportunity to reshape the US’s foreign policy. The nation must seize this moment to chart a new course. Leaving NATO will not only serve the interests of the US taxpayer, it will also help Europe by teaching it the pride of taking care of its own needs with its own hard work. The US’s departure from NATO won’t be easy. It will require careful diplomacy, detailed planning and time. But it is a necessary step for both the US and Europe to address the real challenges of the 21st century. And to those reading this in a nice coffee shop in a town square in Europe, I say this: If you want to continue enjoying your wine and your swimming pools, and your relaxed way of life, it’s time for you to fight for it — and pay for it — yourself.

The Maldives Presses Reset On Ties With India – Analysis	By Rishabh Yadav Maldivian President Mohammed Muizzu’s first state visit to India comes after a year of strained ties. He ran for president on an ‘India Out’ platform and, after coming to power, broke with the tradition of visiting New Delhi, instead visiting Turkey and, later, China. Muizzu finally met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the COP28 conference in December 2023 and visited New Delhi in June 2024 for the swearing-in ceremony of Modi’s third term. Muizzu’s recent visit promises to reset relations between New Delhi and Male, emphasising closer collaboration on development, trade, people-to-people ties and security. But regional geopolitics, domestic sentiment in the Maldives and India’s attitude towards its smaller neighbours may continue to be barriers. Since the Maldives’ democratic transition in 2008, two major groups — the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM)–People National Congress (PNC) coalition — have followed different approaches towards India. MDP governments under Mohammed Nasheed and Ibrahim Solih adopted an India-first approach in which New Delhi was the primary financial and security provider, but Abdulla Yameen’s PPM government intensified economic links with China and joined the Belt and Road Initiative. Maldives–India ties ruptured when Yameen asked India to remove its gifted helicopter and military personnel in response to New Delhi’s criticism of his crackdown on political opposition. The MDP under Solih recalibrated ties in 2018, with a focus on strengthening security partnerships and infrastructure projects. Yet Solih’s tenure also witnessed ‘India Out’ protests by the PPM–PNC coalition against New Delhi’s role in a naval dockyard project and broader military presence. The opposition accused the MDP of becoming a ‘slave of India’. Coalition leader Muizzu campaigned on an ‘India Out’ platform, promising to remove Indian military personnel and diversify security relations. After coming to power, Muizzu insisted India remove its 80 military personnel stationed on the island. Both countries reached a compromise by agreeing to replace the soldiers with civilian technical staff. The Maldives did not participate in the Colombo Security Conclave, a regional security dialogue, while also signing a security agreement with China and allowing a port call for a Chinese research ship. Relations further plunged after three Maldivian ministers made disparaging remarks against Modi, with matters escalating when Indian social media users called for boycotting the Maldives. Indian tourist arrivals fell from first to fifth position within a month. India also slashed aid to the Maldives by 48 per cent in its 2024 budget. Yet high-level exchanges between foreign ministers have begun to restore bilateral cooperation and reset ties. Muizzu then publicly denied pursuing an ‘anti-India’ agenda and labelled his approach ‘Maldives first’. India and the Maldives also held a defence dialogue to discuss defence cooperation projects and bilateral military exercises. India views diversification as limiting its own influence at the cost of China. But for Muizzu, diversification means engaging with different partners rather than subscribing to one, differentiating his coalition from its rival. Domestic politics demands Muizzu focus on growth. Facing an economic crisis, his recent diplomatic efforts have focused on easing the Maldives’ finances. The World Bank estimates the country’s public and publicly-guaranteed debt at US$8.2 billion — equivalent to 116 per cent of GDP — in the first quarter of 2024. US$1.37 billion and US$124 million of debt is in loans owed to China and India, respectively. The Maldives’ foreign exchange reserves have dropped to US$440 million, covering only 1.5 months of imports. These economic challenges have forced Muizzu to mend ties with India. The Maldivian government aims to restructure debt and settle trade in local currencies. It signed a cooperation agreement with Beijing, promoting financing through local currencies. India also stepped up its efforts by offering US$110 million of aid and contributing US$1.4 billion for infrastructure and development projects. India has also offered a currency swap worth over US$750 million. The decline of Indian tourists is another concern. Tourism is the Maldives’ largest industry, contributing 30 per cent of GDP and generating 60 per cent of foreign currency exchange. As of 22 October, India’s market share had plummeted to 6 per cent, down from 14 per cent in 2023. Muizzu has exhorted Indian tourists to visit the Maldives and highlighted opportunities for public–private partnerships in tourism ventures at the India–Maldives Business Forum. Muizzu’s policy shift is reflected in a document signed by India and the Maldives, transforming the bilateral relationship into a ‘Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership’. One notable change is intensified exchanges at the ministerial, parliamentary and local governance levels and institutionalising cooperation between national parliaments. This would allow both countries to have open communication channels across political party lines. This recalibration offers lessons to both countries. Muizzu has realised India’s geographical proximity makes it an indispensable development and security partner. And after regime changes in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, India is learning that investing in a single party or leader is not a prudent approach. The reset is a strategic gain for New Delhi as China strengthens its regional presence. Muizzu’s readjustment shows the difficulty of decoupling with New Delhi and how peddling anti-India populism subsides once an elected leader faces economic and governance challenges. Yet India should realise that small states are not without agency and may not view the region from its security lens. New Delhi’s best bet is to show its ability to be a reliable and accommodative partner through institutionalised mechanisms rather than a personalised approach to foreign policy. India should consider that while nationalistic fervour can be an electoral asset, it is a regional strategic liability.

US History Of Protectionist Tariff Train Wrecks – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo Protectionist tariffs are associated with a long history of economic and social calamities in America. An important reason for this is that protectionist tariffs are a political tool of plunder and theft, and people don’t generally take kindly to being plundered and robbed. The only real difference between a lobbyist for protectionist tariffs and an armed robber is that the robber is armed. If the robber says 'Give me a thousand dollars or I will shoot you' it is obviously an act of armed robbery. The thousand dollars goes out of your pocket and into the robber’s pocket. If lobbyists for the automobile industry succeed in convincing Congress to pass a tariff increase on cars that results in the average car being $1,000 more expensive, then that thousand dollars goes out of the pockets of car buyers and into the pockets of the (unarmed) care sellers. As John C. Calhoun once sarcastically said, what protectionist tariffs 'protect' us from is lower prices. The First Tariff War In 1824 the protectionist forces in Congress, led by Kentucky hemp grower Henry Clay who wanted high tariffs on imported hemp, succeeded in passing a tariff bill that doubled the average tariff rate. Since most of the tariff increases on dozens of products applied to manufactured products from the North, it created a North/South divide on the issue. The agricultural South would be forced to pay more for shoes, clothing, woolen blankets and coats, farm tools, and other manufactured goods just so the Northern manufacturers could make even more profits. The South viewed it as purely an instrument of plunder and theft. Of the 107 House of Representatives votes in favor of the tariff only three came from Southern states. In the U.S. Senate there were 25 yes votes with only two from Southern states. Emboldened by this success, Clay and his protectionist compatriots, mostly from the North, increased the tariff rate even further in 1828 to an average of around 50 percent. It was called the 'Tariff of Abominations' by Southerners. South Carolina’s politicians called it 'a system of robbery and plunder,' which of course it was. They adopted the Jeffersonian tool of an ordinance of nullification that declared the act to be 'unauthorized by the Constitution' and was therefore 'null, void, no law, nor binding upon this State . . .' All tariff collection in South Carolina was suspended on February 1, 1833. Tariff collectors were to be fined and imprisoned for collecting tariff taxes and the legislature allocated $200,000 for the purchase of firearms with which to enforce tariff nullification. There was the threat of secession (which the New England Federalists had similarly threatened fifteen years earlier) with President Andrew Jackson blustering about an invasion to enforce the tariff. They eventually compromised and reduced the average tariff rate over the next ten years in order to avoid secession with the Compromise of 1833. As soon as that ten-year agreement was up, the same Northern cabal of protectionists, who had the votes in Congress, raised tariff rates again, with the 'Black Tariff' of 1842. That led to the first meeting in South Carolina to seriously discuss secession. The meeting took place in Bluffton, South Carolina, organized by South Carolina Congressman Robert Rhett, and was attended by some five hundred prominent South Carolinians who became known as 'The Bluffton Boys.' They once again considered nullification as well as secession. The 1843 meeting had nothing to do with slavery; it was to protest the plunder of protectionist tariffs. At the time all Americans accepted both nullification and secession as legitimate rights of citizens as a means of influencing and controlling their federal government. No one threatened to bomb Hartford and Boston into a smoldering ruin when the New England Federalists held their secession convention in Hartford in 1814. John C. Calhoun was a unionist who opposed the 'Bluffton Boys' so they neither nullified the Black Tariff nor seceded at that time. Rhett became known by some as 'the father of Southern secession.' The Second Tariff War On the eve of the Civil War the average tariff rate had declined to 15 percent, the lowest of the nineteenth century, but the recession of 1857 was used as an excuse to pass the Morrill Tariff during the 1859-60 session of Congress (prior to Southern secession), which would more than double the average tariff rate to over 32 percent. It was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President James Buchanan (D-Pennsylvania Steel Industry) on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration. Then when Lincoln gave his first inaugural address, knowing that the lower South had seceded and refused to pay any more tariff tributes to Washington, D.C., he used the words 'invasion' and 'bloodshed' to describe what would happen in any state that refused to collect and send to Washington, D.C. the newly-doubled tariff tax (which accounted for more than 90 percent of federal tax revenue at the time). He kept his word and invaded the Southern states in a war that was over tax collection fogged by his colorful rhetoric about 'saving the union.' Saving tariff revenue was his real admitted purpose. According to the latest research as many as 850,000 Americans died in Lincoln’s tariff collection war with more than double that number maimed for life. That number alone is more than all Americans who died in all other wars. (The official War Aims Resolution of the U.S. Congress (Crittenden-Johnson Resolution), by the way, stated that the purpose of the war was NOT to disturb 'the domestic institutions of states,' by which it meant slavery, but to 'save the union'). Lincoln raised tariff rates ten times, leaving the average tariff rate at close to 60 percent by the end of the war, where it would stay until the federal income tax was adopted in 1913. That’s forty-eight years of protectionist plunder and theft. Protectionist tariffs always discriminated against American farmers. High protectionist tariffs impoverish America’s trading partners who are then less able to purchase American goods, primarily farm goods. In addition to paying more for items upon which higher tariffs are placed, farmers also find that much of their foreign business has dried up. They are effectively taxed twice. A political deal was cut such that America’s farmers would support a federal income tax if, in return, the tariff rate was reduced, which it was. That was in 1913. Then when the stock market crash of 1929 occurred the protectionists in Congress naturally used it as an excuse to radically increase the average tariff rate. They did so with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, signed into law by President Herbert Hoover in March of 1930 despite opposition by over 1,000 economists. The stock market tanked and farmers were left with an income tax and the highest tariff rates ever. The Kill-the-International-Division-of-Labor Tariff The Smoot-Hawley Tariff increased tariff rates on over 800 items with an average rate of 59.1 percent, as high as it had ever been. Twelve countries immediately retaliated by placing high tariffs on American imports into their own countries, spawning an international trade war. By March of 1933 international trade by the seventy-five most active trading countries had shrunk from $3 billion/month to less than $.5 billion/month, an 83 percent reduction. This meltdown of world trade imploded the international division of labor and greatly exacerbated the Great Depression. Think about all this the next time you hear President Trump wax eloquently and lovingly about protectionist tariffs and threaten 200 percent tariffs on country after country, oblivious to the societal train wrecks that protectionist tariffs have caused throughout American history.

The New Futurism: What A Meloni-Musk Alliance Could Mean For Euro...	By Arturo Varvelli Last week, Elon Musk got a slap on the wrist from Italian president Sergio Mattarella, after he backed Italian prime minister Georgia Meloni’s policy of detaining foreign migrants in Albania. Musk had said certain Italian judges 'need[ed] to go' because they questioned the legality of the detainment policy. The US-based entrepreneur’s support for Meloni has been growing since he attended her annual party in Rome last year. In September, Musk awarded Meloni with the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen award in New York, reaffirming their mutual esteem. In turn, Musk has become a cultural reference point for the Italian right, particularly under Meloni’s leadership. For years, Italian conservatives have struggled to find intellectual and cultural touchstones to match the influence of left-wing thinkers and movements. Musk provides them with a figure who embodies a new kind of 'cultural futurism'. His embrace of technology, space exploration, and unfettered free speech offers the Italian right an intellectual sheen they have long sought. An icon for the Italian right In some ways, Musk echoes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the early 20th-century Italian poet and founder of the Futurist social movement. Both figures managed to capture the imagination of their respective eras with bold visions of technological progress and societal disruption. Marinetti’s Futurism was a rallying cry for speed, innovation, and a break with the past – ideals that aligned closely with the early Fascist movement’s desire for radical transformation. Similarly, Musk’s ventures in electric cars, space exploration, and social media have positioned him as the new standard-bearer of technological progress, appealing to those who see the future as a realm of limitless potential. Just as Marinetti’s Futurism provided the early Fascists with a cultural framework for their revolutionary zeal, Musk’s hyper-technological vision offers Meloni and her allies a blueprint for their own aspirations. Musk could be both a liability and an asset for the Italian far-right. On the one hand, his focus on innovation could help drive European technological sovereignty. His electric car company, Tesla, is in talks with Rome about substantial investments in Italy, particularly in energy and automotive technology, which align with Meloni’s focus on boosting the country’s industrial base. On the other hand, his unpredictable nature could introduce instability, especially since his views diverge from mainstream European policies. Foreign policy implications The personal rapport between Musk and Meloni could have significant implications for Italy’s foreign policy. Both share hardline migration stances and see unchecked migration as a destabilising force. Musk’s social media could amplify views that align with Meloni’s rhetoric, potentially swaying public opinion in Italy and beyond. This could push the European Union into adopting even stricter border policies, a key goal for Meloni’s government. One of the most pressing concerns is how Musk’s influence might shape Italy’s stance on the war in Ukraine. Meloni has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, but Musk has courted controversy with a proposal to cede territory to Russia as part of a peace plan. His proposal could resonate with parts of Meloni’s base that are sceptical of prolonged engagement in the conflict. If Musk were to advocate for a more isolationist approach, for example, by suspending satellite internet services in Ukraine to encourage Kyiv to reach a settlement, it could embolden factions within Italy that wish to reduce support for Ukraine. Without Italian support, Europe would be in an even weaker position. The Meloni-Musk relationship could also shape Italy’s ties with the United States. With Donald Trump in the White House, Rome’s close relationship with Musk could become a double-edged sword. Meloni could leverage her rapport with Musk and Trump to secure favourable bilateral deals, such as reducing tariffs on Italian exports. However, there is a risk that she might lean too heavily on these personal relationships, adopting a self-serving transactional approach rather than pushing for a united European front. A wiser course The shrewder strategy for Meloni would be to use her influence to build a strong European consensus, particularly in defence and technology policy. For example, instead of pursuing bilateral deals with the US that could fragment the EU’s negotiating power, Italy could take the lead in shaping a European response to the next administration in Washington. This would involve coordinating with France and Germany to form a cohesive strategy on issues ranging from China to digital sovereignty. However, Meloni’s nationalist inclinations may make it difficult for her to prioritise European unity over immediate national gains. She is more likely to fight for Italian products than Europe. In times of populism, any US tariffs on Parmigiano Reggiano would be a domestic failure for her. For these reasons, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen should collaborate with Meloni on US policy – precisely because of the Italian prime minister’s close links to Musk and US Republicans. If Meloni, von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte united, the EU would be in a stronger position. These three non-leftist personalities could earn Trump’s trust, easing collaboration with the new US administration. Simultaneously, a united European front could give them an edge in negotiations with Washington. The Meloni-Musk partnership symbolises a new kind of futurism for the Italian right, one that seeks to redefine progress through the lenses of technology and national strength. However, for this vision to translate into tangible benefits, Meloni will need to balance her domestic priorities with broader European goals. Failure to do so could isolate Italy within the EU, turning a potential strategic advantage into a missed opportunity.

US Government Starts 2025 Fiscal Year Deep In The Red – OpEd	The U.S. government got off to a very bad start for its 2025 fiscal year. The U.S. Treasury Department reported that the federal government spent $257 billion more than it took in as revenue in October 2024. That is the second-worst figure ever recorded for the first month of the fiscal year. Only October 2020 has seen a bigger deficit. Of course, October 2020’s deficit of $284 billion happened during 2020’s coronavirus pandemic. That was when government-mandated lockdowns shut down much of the U.S. economy. Those lockdowns shrank the U.S. government’s tax revenue by billions while it spent billions to compensate for their negative impact. That’s what it took to make the worst-ever start of a fiscal year for the U.S. government in the modern era. There is no pandemic in October 2024. At $327 billion, the federal government’s tax collections are 37% higher than in October 2020. However, the U.S. government’s spending totaled over $584 billion, 12% higher than it spent in October 2020 during a national emergency. The Treasury Department used the chart below to illustrate the U.S. government’s revenues, spending, and deficit for October 20: The first month of the 2025 fiscal year follows a full year of excessive spending that delivered the federal government’s largest annual deficit since the pandemic. The budget results for October, the first month of the 2025 fiscal year, come after President Joe Biden’s administration turned in a full-year fiscal 2024 deficit of $1.83 trillion, the largest outside the COVID-19 era. Today, there is no national emergency that justifies the federal government spending so much money in October 2024. The pandemic effectively ended years ago. Why on earth is the U.S. government still spending money like the pandemic never ended?

Musk’s Aim To Create A ‘Super-Government’ In The US – Analysis	By Zhou Chao After the dust settled from the U.S. Presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump unexpectedly established an independent department outside the federal government system, namely the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump referred to it as 'the Manhattan Project of our time', with the goal to 'dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies'. The original Manhattan Project was a program started by the U.S. Department of the Army in 1942 to develop the atomic bomb. This time, Trump intends to 'blow up' what he describes as the corrupt government bureaucracy. The department even carries a patriotic mission, planning to deliver a smaller, more efficient government to America as a 'gift' on the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. After the department was announced, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were selected to lead it. Ramaswamy suggested reducing the federal workforce by 75% and expelling the children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. In September, he proposed laying off government employees based on their social security numbers and firing odd-numbered ones to halve the workforce. Musk recommended a 77% reduction, shrinking 428 federal agencies down to 99. On the other hand, he called on 'high-IQ small-government revolutionaries' to join this new government via X. Commentators are largely pessimistic about the department’s prospects, believing that its ambitious goals will be difficult to achieve. Some argue that the complexity of government governance is far greater than that of corporate governance and that the relevant experience in the latter is difficult to be effectively applied in the former. Therefore, the attempts by Musk and Ramaswamy are doomed to fail. Others point out that the practical scope of the DOGE department is very limited. Ramaswamy proposed cutting federal government spending by USD 2 trillion or more. However, the operational expenses of federal government departments account for only 1% of all fiscal spending, so even if these were completely cut, it would still fall short of the target. Reason magazine analyzed that the DOGE department’s operational space may be focused on expenditures that the federal government should not be involved in to begin with. For example, reducing federal grants to state governments, which accounted for 35% of state spending in 2023; or cutting the Pentagon’s budget, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office's deficit reduction plan, could save USD 995 billion over ten years. It could also prioritize cutting subsidies and tax incentives for the private sector, including preferential treatment for aerospace, semiconductor, clean energy, electric vehicle, and healthcare companies. However, in reality, the space for these actions is also limited. After all, in recent years, the flexibility of the U.S. federal government's fiscal maneuvering has been shrinking. According to China’s Donghai Securities' report U.S. Fiscal Policy: History and Trends, the U.S. government's mandatory spending in the 2024 fiscal year, which does not require Congressional approval, accounts for 73%, including statutory expenditures for social security, Medicare, defense, and nearly 13% for interest payments. Discretionary spending, which requires Congressional approval, only accounts for 27%, roughly USD 1.858 trillion. This portion includes spending on defense, education, environmental protection, infrastructure, and other areas, which cannot be entirely eliminated. In contrast to the widespread view, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out a unique possibility that many commentators and media outlets have failed to fully grasp regarding the establishment of the DOGE department and Trump's true thinking. Trump hopes to leverage Musk's capabilities to create an efficient 'super-government' to stand out among government institutions worldwide. The efficiency of such a government would resemble corporate management, which is why he enlisted Musk to take charge. The view that corporate management experience is largely inapplicable to the government sector is difficult to defend. Both in the U.S. and throughout world history, there have been many instances where corporate management practices were successfully applied to government operations. During the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, the U.S. government brought in many entrepreneurs to reform government operations, and the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, was formerly the president of Ford. The most successful example came during the Bill Clinton administration. Faced with bloated federal agencies, high budget deficits, inefficiency, and public services that were costly without yielding results, the Clinton administration, led by the Democratic Party, extensively borrowed successful practices from large private companies in terms of organizational downsizing, process simplification, and customer orientation, implementing three major reforms during its tenure. The first was to reorganize and reduce administrative programs and agencies. The principle was to determine what the government should and should not do based on the agency's mission. Following this principle, administrative programs were merged, reorganized, and reduced, leading to a streamlined administrative structure. The second was a major overhaul of rules and regulations. In 1995, President Clinton issued a series of directives on regulatory reform, requiring federal management agencies to abolish outdated and unnecessary rules, reward employees based on results rather than bureaucratic formalities, and change the long-standing focus on whether procedures were violated. From 1995 to the end of 1996, the federal government eliminated 16,000 pages of unnecessary federal rules that hindered the effective operation of public affairs and abolished a total of 640,000 pages of internal rules within various agencies. The third effort focused on reshaping government culture. During President Clinton's second term, transforming the administrative culture of federal agencies became a key focus in reshaping government. The goal was to create a new administrative culture that was results-oriented, performance-based, and customer-centered. The eight-year restructuring of the federal government has yielded significant results. In 1992, the U.S. federal budget deficit reached a staggering USD 290 billion, but by fiscal year 1998, it had turned into a surplus. Between 1993 and 2000, the restructuring involved cutting 426,200 federal civilian jobs, including 78,000 middle-management positions, making it the smallest federal workforce since the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration (1953–1961). In the present day, the government of Argentina under President Javier Milei is another example of success. After taking office, Milei significantly reduced public spending by billions of dollars, slashing the number of government ministries from 22 to 9, cutting over 30,000 public sector jobs, halting all infrastructure projects, and even closing the state-run television network. These actions helped to ease the fiscal burden, bringing Argentina's inflation rate down from over 300% to 2.7% by October of this year. The country also overcame a severe budget deficit, with its sovereign credit rating upgraded by two notches to CCC. Foreign exchange reserves saw a net increase of USD 19 billion this year. As investor confidence in the Argentine market grew and a plan to forgive depositors' debts was implemented, the government successfully attracted nearly USD 20 billion in dollar deposits back into local banks. At the same time, the Milei government successfully avoided street protests caused by a surge in poverty by protecting and even expanding certain welfare programs, with the strengthening of fiscal capacity being an important foundation. This allowed the government to effectively address the short-term spike in poverty rates. In fact, even the World Bank now believes that the worst period for Argentina has passed. Therefore, corporate management experience can indeed be applied to government operations, but previous U.S. administrations did not persist in doing so due to their own limitations. Furthermore, for the DOGE Department, the primary goal of layoffs or spending cuts is not just about reducing personnel or cutting expenses, but rather about improving efficiency. Over the past 15 years, inefficiency within the U.S. government has become increasingly apparent. In the field of aerospace launches, inefficiency and high costs have even led the U.S. to depend on Russia for long-term space launches, while the inefficiency of U.S. infrastructure has also been widely recognized. As for Elon Musk, there are several notable characteristics of his management practices: 1. Strong emphasis on first principles (focusing on the fundamental nature of things and the core issues of a problem); 2. Skilled at using technology and efficiency to reduce costs, not relying on monopolies to inflate prices, nor on establishing a stable banking system as the financial foundation. Musk's companies primarily use technology to lower costs in competitive markets. 3. Minimize intermediary steps in processes as much as possible; 4. Accelerate cycle times. The job posting on the DOGE Department's X platform account stated that candidates must have exceptionally high IQs and be willing to work over 80 hours a week, focusing on the monotonous task of cost reduction, with zero compensation. It is clear that Musk and his team’s approach is to focus on the department's core business, selecting the most competent and passionate individuals to take on the work, maximizing the abilities of the right talent, and aiming for fewer people handling multiple roles rather than many people handling one. They do not consider additional factors like ethnic diversity when recruiting, nor do they intentionally seek to hire minorities. After Musk acquired Twitter, he drastically reduced the workforce from 8,000 employees to 2,000, yet Twitter's operations did not collapse, and everything continued normally. At SpaceX, after a successful rocket launch, the key team members in the celebratory photo were few in number. Musk achieved what NASA had failed to do. This remarkable increase in efficiency shows how such reform logic, once implemented, could comprehensively improve the efficiency of the U.S. government at all levels, enhancing its ability to advance and implement policies. With efficiency improvements, many aspects will be fully driven forward. With a focus on efficiency, the U.S. government’s requirements for government procurement will become more detailed and stringent, and cost audits will be more rigorous and thorough. This will force government contractors to actively reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance service quality. The cost of government procurement is also expected to decrease further, significantly increasing the likelihood of achieving government spending reduction targets. After improving efficiency and reducing expenses, the government will be able to free up more fiscal space to subsidize the truly needy and vulnerable social groups, further lowering the time costs for the public. There will basically be no situation where, as some people believe, a sharp reduction in social welfare for the public. As for concerns that the government’s power structure might significantly constrain the Trump administration, while these worries are not without basis, they still seem somewhat exaggerated. First, in this election, the Republican Party achieved a nearly sweeping victory, successfully gaining control of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Trump's almost crushing victory over Kamala Harris has made him a hero of the Republican Party. Even before and after the election, many prominent Republican figures defected, significantly strengthening the 'Trump-centric' unity within the party. Second, the Democratic Party still holds significant influence and will almost certainly interfere with Trump's subsequent governance and attempt to block his policies. However, in this election, due to dissatisfaction with the economy and illegal immigration, the Democratic Party's long-time stronghold, namely the minority groups, showed clear signs of division. A large number of Black and Latino voters shifted their support to Trump and the Republican Party. In order to maintain its main voter base, the Democratic Party may have to compromise on a series of issues with the Republicans and Trump, weakening its ability to oppose them. Third, the U.S. President holds executive power, and reforms within the President's authority are carried out within his own team and administration. With Trump's support, the likelihood of Musk and others successfully advancing reforms is high. The eventual result could lead to a 'super-government' unlike anything else in the world, resembling Tesla's 'Gigafactories'. As a political legacy of Trumpism, it could have a profound impact on the operation of the U.S. government. Final analysis conclusion: The 'super-government' that Musk aims to build will be characterized by extremely high efficiency, which will bring about a series of positive changes on multiple levels. The improvement in efficiency is remarkable, and it will place immense pressure on governments around the world, as it will be difficult to compete with such a model. Although many of Trump and Musk's ideas are still just concepts or drafts at this stage, Trump's term is only four years, and both he and the Republican Party will likely focus more on deeply implementing 'Trumpism' and solidifying its political influence. Their desire to do so will be strong and resolute. The traditional establishment in the U.S. will find it much harder to divert Trump's attention, as it did during his first term.

The Mainstream Media’s Big Lie – OpEd	Eduardo Porter joined the chorus of people telling us that the inequality of the last four decades was just the result of the free market in his Washington Post column. As Porter puts it: 'A paper last year by economists from Princeton and Columbia argues that Democrats started losing the working class back in the 1970s, when they bought into the notion that the government should let market forces rip, dropping the New Deal approach of improving workers’ lot via strong unions, job guarantees, minimum wages and protectionism — and instead assisting the economy’s losers via taxes and transfers.' He then argues that this is the source of the rise in working class support for authoritarianism. The problem with this line is that we did not let market forces rip. Government-granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the f**king market. They are hugely important in the economy, likely shifting more than $1 trillion a year ($8,000 a family) from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from these monopolies. Higher drug prices are the most visible transfer, but these monopolies also add hugely to the price of a wide range of other items like computers, software, smartphones. Then we also have government support for the financial industry. This was most visible during the financial crisis when the government directly saved many of the largest financial corporations in the country from bankruptcy. There are many other supports for the financial industry, such as deposit insurance, which are less visible. This sector is the source of many of the largest fortunes in the economy. We also have rules of corporate governance that allow CEOs and other top executives to rip off the companies they work for. This allows hugely bloated pay at the top which comes at the expense of ordinary workers. These rules are not 'letting the market rip.' They are written by politicians who get campaign contributions from top executives. Also 'free trade' has never meant free trade in highly paid professions like physicians’ and dentists’ services. If these highly paid professionals were subject to the same sort of competition as autoworkers and textiles workers their pay would be considerably lower, and healthcare would be cheaper for the rest of us. I go into these issues in more detail in my book Rigged (it’s free), but the basic point should be clear. There is a widely repeated lie that inequality was driven by the natural workings of the market. The reality is that politicians of both parties worked to structure the market to bring about more unequal outcomes. The media and most of the academic establishment actively push this lie at every opportunity. And people are pissed. To be clear, I’m sure that almost none of them know anything about patent policy or the rules of corporate governance. They just know that the rules are structured against them, and they are absolutely right. And elite outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Atlantic won’t let anyone make this obvious point in the spaces they control.

The Magic Number Is 2.5 In The UK – OpEd	In Europe it can be 2.0 or 2.5, while in the US it’s somewhere between 4 and 6 Those numbers in the above headline are the percentages of Gross Domestic Product that each country’s government and politicians figure needs to be spent on the military annually in order to be 'safe' from potential Russian aggression. Just to give readers a 'sense' (if such a term can be applied to the concept of defense by percentages of national economic activity), that 4- 6% 'safety' figure for the US represents an the share US GDP that military spending in the 2022 fiscal year represents. In FY2022 the actual dollar figure for he total military budget was somewhere between the $768.5 billion which the Office of Management and Budget reports went directly to the Pentagon and all the armed forces branches under its jurisdiction, and the $1.58 trillion figure which also includes all the military spending that goes to other agencies like the NSA, CIA, Energy Department (nuclear arsenal), NATO, Veterans Affairs, etc. and interest on the national debt for America’s wars. Now think about this for a moment. The world is currently at the edge of a precipice like the sheer face of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park portrayed above as the US has been prodding and provoking Russia over Ukraine now for a decade, threatening to bring that former soviet of the old USSR into NATO. Once Russia invaded Ukraine to prevent such a thing from happening right on it’s eastern border, Washington has been providing advanced weapons as well as satellite intelligence to the Ukrainian military to help it kill Russian soldiers. Most recently, the provocations have reached the scary point of providing Ukraine with longer-range missiles which can strike deep inside Russia itself to hit military targets and key infrastructure like rail centers and oil depots. Britain, America’s faithful poodle, has joined in this dangerous game by providing its own longer-range cruise missile the Storm Shadow. Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin has responded by accurately declaring as 'acts of war' the escalatory actions by the US and UK in supplying these new weapons to Ukrainian troops, training them in how to use them, and providing them with the use the precise geolocation data from US military satellites necessary for successful guidance to targets inside Russia . He followed this up by openly changing Russia’s rules for the use of nuclear weapons to include targeting any nuclear powers that provide non-nuclear powers with the weapons to attack Russia. Certainly anyone can understand the logic of that change. If Russia were for example to give Cuba or Venezuela missiles that could strike Florida or the US Gulf Coast and one of those countries were to start firing them at US targets, and Russia began flying in or shipping in more rockets, would the US refrain from attacking Russia, or its planes and ships and limit itself to bombing Cuba or Venezuela? Of course not! To make matters even worse, after d Putin sent a powerful message by ordering the firing of a new Russian hypersonic strategic missile with a range of over 3000 miles to hit a city in central Ukraine with six independently maneuverable warheads. The missile, which Putin said was a 'test,' took 15 minutes from its launch site in central Asia to reach the target \city of Dnipro. The explosions there were relatively small and involved conventional explosives, but the point was made that the same warheads are designed to carry nuclear bombs. Putin pointedly said that the UK itself or any country providing weapons to Ukraine to strike targets in Russia, not just Ukraine itself, could be targets of Russian missiles like this new one called the Oreshnik. The Pentagon confirmed that it has no anti-missile system that could defend against this new Russian missile. Okay, so what is all this nonsense about assigning percentages of GDP for military spending that are supposed to assure the safety of the US and the nations of NATO Europe all about? If Russia has nuclear missiles that cannot be stopped, how is increasing the percent of GDP spent on a country’s military got anything to do with keeping the country 'safe'? There has been no word fromBiden’s White House or British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s No, 10 Downing Street about reversing the permission granted to Ukraine to use UK and US-supplied longer range rockets to hit deep inside Russia, as Ukraine has just. done. No word either on whether more such missiles will be supplied to Ukraine, as that country’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for. If this fraught situation doesn’t sound insane, I don’t know what does.. Here’s the situation: Russia’s over-confident army was initially bloodied by Ukrainian forces backed with US and NATO supplied weapons, but eventually its much larger military figured out how to deal with those weapons and it has been steadily degrading Ukrainian forces, who have reportedly suffered 500,000 casualties and are losing ground daily. The US and UK missiles, unless supplied in vast quantities, will not turn the tide of battle, yet even if the small number currently n Ukrainian hands are used they could spark a Russian strike on Ukraine’s main government buildings in Kiev or even the huge US embassy compound there (the US Embassy was evacuated a few days ago because of fears that could happen). Then where are we? (It’s an act of war to deliberately attack a country’s embassy.) Wars Have often begun small but then grow in tit-for-tat escalations. When nuclear weapons are added to that equation the time between steps on the upward-moving stairway can occur very quickly, as generals look at an opponent’s missiles, and their own and wonder if they hold their fire whether they will find their own missiles struck before they can launched, leaving them at the mercy of the enemy’s nukes. Given that risk, in a crisis a leader or even local commander could easily decide that if 'use it or lose it' is the operative situation, launching first is the safest bet. And then it’s game over. Full scale nuclear war is on. And all those percentage-of-GDP spending won’t have accomplished a damned thing. The absurdity of it all was highlighted today as it was reported that Britain’s PM Starmer, after approving the launch of a British Storm Shadow missile by Ukraine into Russia, said Britain, which is facing a budget crisis at present that has it cutting winter heating subsidies for poor people, has 'no defense' against a Russian missile attack, but that he would boost Britain’s military spending, despite the budget crisis, from 2% to 2.5%. Would such a spending boost offer protection? Not when designing and building a whole new generation anti-missile system takes years and with no guarantee of success. All he’s doing is offering magical thinking to the anxious masses. The proper response to this current situation is to call a halt to escalation in Ukraine and negotiate an immediate cease fire between Russia and Ukraine with negotiations for an end to that to commence at the same time. The idea of defense budgeting by percent of GDP has been idiotic from the outset. After all, GDP actually shrank during the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which automatically made the existing military spending a larger percentage of each country’s total economic activity, but with no gain in national security of course. This kind of numerical nonsense would never be permitted if the budget were about education or healthcare spending. It’s only in the area of national security where huge parts of the spending is kept secret, hidden in black boxes like the CIA budget. And it turns out that all that $1.58 trillion the US is spending on 'defense' (sic) isn’t making us or the world any safer. In fact it appears to be putting us in the greatest danger humanity has been in since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, except that back then we had a brilliant man, John F Kennedy, who knew when to fold ‘em and backed away from a nuclear war by secretly agreeing to remove nuclear tipped Jupiter missiles the US had provocatively placed just inside Turkey’s border with the Soviet Union — the whole reason Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev started setting up nuclear missiles in Cuba in the first place. Now we have a brain-addled lame-duck President Biden with only weeks left in his White House tenure threatening us all with nuclear war in an attempt to leave office saying he 'stood with Ukraine.' That’s 100% nuts!

Ironic Dependency: Russian Uranium And The US Energy Market – OpE...	Be careful who you condemn and ostracise. They just might be supplying you with a special need. While the United States security establishment deems Russia the devil incarnate helped along by aspiring, mischief-making China, that devil continues supplying the US energy market with enriched uranium. This dependency has irked the self-sufficiency patriots in Washington, especially those keen to break Russia’s firm hold in this field. That, more than any bleeding-heart sentimentality for Ukrainian suffering at the hands of the Russian Army, has taken precedence. For that reason, US lawmakers sought a ban on Russian uranium that would come into effect by January 1, 2028, by which time domestic uranium enrichment and conversion is meant to have reached sustainable levels. The May 2024 Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, signed by President Joe Biden as law H.R.1042, specifically bans unirradiated low-enriched uranium produced in Russia or by any Russian entity from being imported into the US. It also bars the importation of unirradiated low-enriched uranium that has been swapped for the banned uranium or otherwise obtained in circumstances designed to bypass the restrictions. At the time, Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm struck a note of hollering triumphalism. 'Our nation’s clean energy future will not rely on Russian imports,' she declared. 'We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States. That means American jobs supporting the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to a clean, safe, and secure energy economy.' This does not get away from current circumstances, which see Russia’s provision of some 27% of enrichment service purchases for US utilities. The Russian state-owned company Rosatom is alone responsible for arranging imports of low-enriched uranium into the US market at some 3 million SWU (Separative Work Units) annually. Alexander Uranov, who heads the Russian analytical service Atominfo Center, puts this figure into perspective: that amount would be the equivalent of the annual uranium consumption rate of 20 large reactors. Given this reliance, some legroom has been given to those in the industry by means of import waivers. H.R.1042 grants the Department of Energy the power to waive the ban in cases where there is no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium available to enable the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or US nuclear energy company and in cases where importing the uranium would be in the national interest. The utility Constellation, which is the largest operator of US nuclear reactors, along with the US enrichment trader, Centrus, have received waivers. The latter also has on its book of supply, the Russian state-owned company Tenex, its largest provider of low-enriched uranium as part of a 2011 contract. No doubt knowing such a state of play, Moscow announced this month that it would temporarily ban the export of low-enriched uranium to the US as an amendment to Government Decree No 313 (March 9, 2022). The decree covers imports 'to the United States or under foreign trade contracts concluded with persons registered in the jurisdiction of the United States.' According to the Russian government, such a decision was made 'on the instructions of the President in response to the restriction imposed by the United States for 2024-2027, and from 2028 – a ban on the import of Russian uranium products.' Vladimir Putin had accordingly given instructions in September 'to analyse the possibility of restricting supplies to foreign markets of strategic raw materials'. The Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom confirmed that the ban was a 'tit-for-tat response to actions of the US authorities' and would not affect the delivery of Russian uranium to other countries. In a Russian government post on Telegram, the ban is qualified. To make matters less severe, there will be, for instance, one-time licenses issued by the Russian Federal Service for Technical and Export Control. This is of cold comfort to the likes of Centrus, given that most of its revenue is derived from importing the enriched uranium before then reselling it. On being notified by Tenex that its general license to export the uranium to the US had been rescinded, the scramble was on to seek a specific export license for remaining shipments in 2024 and those scheduled to take place in 2025. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Centrus warned that any failure by Tenex 'to secure export licences for our pending or future orders […] would affect our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results in operations, and competitive position.' While Tenex had contacted Centrus of its plans to secure the required export licenses in a timely manner, a sense of pessimism was hard to dispel as 'there is no certainty whether such licenses will be issued by the Russian authorities and if issued, whether they will be issued in a timely manner.' The sheer, sweet irony of it all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-lohquz_oOlm	2024-11-26T16:45:58-08:00	
Russia Lacks Icebreakers Its Arctic Fleet Needs To Function In Ea...	Russia has more icebreakers than any other country, something it celebrates and that most other countries see as guaranteeing Russian dominance in the region. Most of these ships, however, are small and diesel, rather than nuclear, powered and lack the most advanced electronics and are incapable of helping ships far from the Russian coast (see EDM, November 25 [1], [2]). This means that Moscow’s ability to keep the Northern Sea Route (NSR) operational year-round is still far from guaranteed, and Russia faces particularly serious difficulties in the route’s Eastern portion and to its North (see EDM, June 12, 2023). These areas are now cooling rather than warming, given the irregular pattern of climate change, undercutting Moscow’s ability to trade with China and, more generally, advance its expansive claims to the Arctic seabed (The Barents Observer, August 6; AANII, August 8). Moscow’s challenges with its shortage of deep-sea icebreakers have become increasingly evident. This is underscored by its much-ballyhooed icebreaker construction program, which Russian experts acknowledge is unlikely to materialize in the near future. Additionally, Deputy Commander of Russia’s Northern Fleet Vice Admiral Oleg Golubyov recently admitted that ships in the eastern Arctic often drift at night to avoid sea ice or the risk of running aground in poorly surveyed areas. This occurs because they lack the necessary icebreaker escorts to operate safely 24 hours a day (IAREX.ru March 31; Profile.ru, November 9; Arctic Today, November 22). Such a danger is very real and was highlighted several years ago when a large number of ships, civilian and naval, were trapped in the ice for weeks (The Barents Observer, November 9, 2021; Window on Eurasia, December 30, 2021). Golubyov’s admission is indicative of Russia’s often ignored problems with the NSR, the Arctic Ocean more generally, and its fleet of icebreakers. In an interview with that fleet’s newspaper, Na Strazhe Zapolyarya, Golubyov says that this year, ships under his command encountered heavy sea ice in the Eastern Arctic waters between Wrangel Island and the Russian Federation as well as beyond toward the Bering Strait. Lacking icebreaker support, these Russian naval vessels had no choice but to drift at night and move only when the two helicopters accompanying them could survey a safe route forward during daylight hours. Neither he nor others want to rely on such an arrangement and it is one that Moscow hopes to overcome by building more icebreakers, despite all suggestions that global warming will make that costly exercise unnecessary. Such problems are compounded, Golubyov continues, by the fact that in the region, much of the seabed remains unmapped and shallow waters can trap ice, posing particular dangers to ships. The Russian admiral’s words call attention to environmental issues in the NSR that are all too often ignored. While global warming has left the Western half of the NSR ice-free for most of the year, the situation in the Eastern half is very different. In fact, temperatures have cooled in recent years, and ice has become a larger problem (Profile.ru, May 31, 2022; The Barents Observer, November 16, 2022; Window on Eurasia August 8). To counter the cooling temperatures, keep the NSR open and trade with China flowing, and allow Russia to project power far into the Arctic, Moscow has announced an ambitious program of icebreaker and ice-capable ship construction (see EDM, September 11, 2018, September 4; Profile.ru, May 31, 2022; East Russia.ru, August 1, 2022). Longstanding and intractable problems in its shipbuilding branch, including corruption and the impact of sanctions, and cutbacks in government financing as a result of the war in Ukraine, however, means that Russia is unlikely to be able to build anything close to the number of needed vessels, Moscow experts say (Kommersant, October 12, 2023; EDM, December 12, 2023;Window on Eurasia, April 4). All the more so due to the development of its shore-based support facilities along the NSR, which has nearly stopped (see EDM, September 11, 2018, June 4, 2022). This has created a new geo-economic and, therefore, geo-political situation, as far as icebreakers and the Eastern Arctic are concerned. While Russia maintains a dominant position internationally, as far as icebreakers are concerned, its dominance is increasingly a facade more than real. On the one hand, most of its icebreakers are smaller and capable of handling ports but not open sea routes, as Golubyov acknowledges. On the other, Moscow is increasingly concerned with keeping the Eastern Arctic, where ice remains and even is currently on the increase, and thus needs more icebreakers to maintain trade with China and lend credence to Moscow’s expansive claims to the Arctic Ocean and its mineral-rich seabed (see EDM, October 29, 2019). Both these claims and the kind of difficulties Golubyov’s remarks suggest Moscow is facing in the eastern Arctic, however, are leading other countries to consider building more icebreakers of their own and be in a position to challenge Russia in the future. Among those doing so are Canada, Finland, the United States, and China (The Barents Observer, July 10, July 12; TRT Russian, July 15; see EDM, November 25). All of them can see that Russia is overextended as far as icebreakers are concerned, not only keeping vessels in service long after they should be scrapped but also failing to meet deadlines for building new ones (Window on Eurasia, July 18). The Russian dominance that intimidated them earlier is now dissipating (see EDM, June 12, June 26, 2019). Among these countries, the one that has made the most rapid progress is China, which has not only built more icebreakers in recent years than any of the others but, even more importantly, has significantly reduced the time it needs to construct each of them (see EDM, July 23, 2020). For now, Moscow hopes that China, its ally against the West, will help it maintain its presence in the Arctic, given Chinese interest in Russia’s use of the NSR. Russian officials fear that at some point, China will assume a dominant position in the Arctic and be able to elbow Russia aside (see EDM, July 12, 2018, June 12, 2019, March 6, 2021, February 1, 2022). That is all the more likely in the coming years, given that Moscow experts say that Russian yards will not be able to build anything compared to the number of ships, icebreakers in particular, that Moscow needs to maintain its current status (Window on Eurasia, July 18). Russia’s inability to reliably send ships through the ice in the Eastern Arctic is a clear sign of the beginning of a major geopolitical shift. Western governments will have little choice but to deal with it if they do not take timely action and expand their own icebreaker fleets as well.

Israel Reaches Ceasefire With Hezbollah In Lebanon	Israel agreed late Tuesday to a ceasefire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon that could end more than a year of fighting by early Wednesday when the truce takes effect. Even as Israel’s military bombarded Hezbollah targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a national television audience that he would urge his Security Cabinet ministers to approve a ceasefire, which they did a short time later. The United States, along with France, played a key role in brokering the settlement. At the White House, President Joe Biden called the ceasefire 'a critical step … to end the violence' in the Mideast. He said that Iran and its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas militants in Gaza, 'have paid a heavy price' in more than a year of fighting Israeli forces. He said the Israeli-Hezbollah agreement 'is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' But Biden warned, 'Let me be clear, if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and pose a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense consistent with international law, just like any country in facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.' The outgoing U.S. leader, with less than two months remaining in his four-year term, said that with Hezbollah agreeing to end its attacks on Israel, 'Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages [it is holding in Gaza], including American citizens.' 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push for Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza,' Biden said. He said that the Israel-Hezbollah agreement showed that 'peace is possible.' Netanyahu said he favored a truce with Hezbollah so Israel could focus its attention on the broader threat Iran poses to the Jewish state, refresh its forces and supply of munitions and isolate Hamas in its ongoing fight against Israel in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that if Hezbollah renews its attacks on Israel or rearms itself, Israel would immediately resume its bombardment of militant sites in Lebanon. 'The length of the ceasefire will depend on what happens in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'With the full understanding of the United States, we are preserving full military freedom of action — if Hezbollah breaks the agreement and seeks to arm itself, we will attack.' Netanyahu’s move toward a halt in nearly 14 months of fighting with Hezbollah came after hours of Israeli bombardment of militant targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The Israeli attacks targeted 20 buildings that the military said were Hezbollah strongholds, warning noncombatant residents living there to flee to safety and maintain a distance of at least 500 meters. It was the largest number of buildings targeted in a single day where the Israel Defense Forces warned residents about an impending attack. The airstrikes sent billowing clouds of dark smoke into the sky over the Lebanese capital. At least 10 of the strikes were simultaneous, in what the Israeli air force described as 'a widespread attack.' The attacks appeared to be a last attempt by Israel to gain the upper hand in its war with Hezbollah, since Netanyahu, even before speaking to his countrymen, had signaled he was open to a ceasefire. The militants began attacking Israel in October 2023 in support of Hamas militants fighting their war with Israel in Gaza. The Cabinet-level talks occurred at the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The ceasefire deal, brokered by U.S. and French diplomats, would halt the fighting and start a 60-day period in which Israel and Hezbollah would withdraw from southern Lebanon. Ahead of the deal, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a news conference at a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Italy that the ceasefire was 'the best way to guarantee there is peace, there is stability.' Blinken said the deal to end Israel-Hezbollah fighting also could push Hamas to reach a long-stalled ceasefire pact in Gaza because it would no longer have an Iranian-funded ally fighting Israel on a second front in northern Israel and Lebanon. Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces are obligated to retreat south of the Lebanon-Israel border, while Hezbollah moves north of the Litani River. The plan calls for the Lebanese army, which is not involved in the Israeli-Hezbollah fighting, to patrol the region between the two warring sides. Even as Netanyahu said he favored the deal, it was not clear whether some of his far-right colleagues in the Israeli parliament would go along with the proposal. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem suggested last week that the militants would agree to a truce if Israel stopped attacks on Lebanon and Lebanon retained its sovereignty. But difficulties remained in reaching a ceasefire, such as how Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the border area would be monitored. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had earlier in the day called on Israel to agree to the ceasefire, saying there are 'no more excuses.' Speaking to reporters ahead of the G7 meeting, Borrell said a ceasefire is 'absolutely necessary' for civilians displaced by several months of intensified fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. The G7 comprises the world’s leading industrialized democracies. Borrell expressed hope that Netanyahu’s government would approve a ceasefire on Tuesday without seeking to add additional stipulations that could delay or derail an agreement. 'No more excuses. No more additional requests. Stop this fighting. Stop killing people. And let’s start thinking on peace,' Borrell said. U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was close. Speaking to reporters during a press call, national security spokesperson John Kirby described recent talks in Beirut led by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein as 'constructive,' adding, 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction.' In New York on Monday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said negotiations toward a ceasefire are 'moving forward' but have not been 'finalized.' He added that Israel would retain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. 'We will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt [with] in southern Lebanon. I hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail, again, we will be there,' Danon said. Meanwhile, Lebanon's deputy speaker, Elias Bou Saab, said there are no major obstacles to implementing a ceasefire deal. A five-nation committee, chaired by the United States and including France, will oversee the ceasefire process, according to Bou Saab. The fighting in Lebanon has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing hundreds of thousands. On Monday, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it has provided emergency aid to more than a half million people in Lebanon since the conflict began. The WFP said it plans to reach 1 million people and is continuing to work to deliver critical assistance to affected communities. In the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the Middle East warfare, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,235 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters, while the Health Ministry says more than half are women and children. The United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries designate Hamas and Hezbollah as terror groups.

Sudan: RSF Accused Of Widespread Sexual Violence	Sexual violence against women and girls of all ages is rampant in war-torn Sudan, including rape, gang rape, forced marriages and sexual slavery. A new United Nations report found that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia is using sexual violence as a deliberate tactic 'intending to terrorize civilians.' 'The majority of rape and sexual and gender-based violence was committed by the RSF,' the report, published on October 29 by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan, stated. '[It’s] part of a pattern aimed at terrorizing and punishing civilians for perceived links with opponents and suppressing any opposition to their advances.' Mission Chair Mohamed Chande Othman said women and girls in territories under RSF control are victims of what amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,' the Tanzanian lawyer said in a statement. 'The situation faced by vulnerable civilians, in particular women and girls of all ages, is deeply alarming and needs urgent address.' Since fighting began in April 2023, Sudan’s brutal civil war between the army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands of people and forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes in the world’s largest displacement crisis. The U.N. report revealed a pattern of gender-based violence by the RSF as its fighters have advanced in several Sudanese states, particularly in Khartoum, Darfur and El Gezira. Several women have taken their lives in central El Gezira state after being raped by RSF fighters, according to rights groups and activists. 'The RSF started a revenge campaign in areas under the control of [former RSF general] Abu Kayka,' Hala al-Karib, head of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (Siha), told the BBC. 'They looted, killed civilians who were resisting and raped women and little girls.' While documenting gender-based violence in Sudan over the course of one week in late October, Siha confirmed three cases of suicide by female victims of sexual violence in El Gezira state, Karib said. According to the U.N. report, sexual violence also has taken place during attacks on shelters for internally displaced people and on civilians fleeing the fighting.The report said that the RSF committed sexual crimes 'with particular cruelty' in western Darfur, including the use of 'firearms, knives and whips to intimidate or coerce the victims while using derogatory, racist or sexist slurs and death threats.' 'First-hand sources informed of rape of girls as young as 8 years and women as old as 75,' the report stated. Although the Sudanese Armed Forces also has been accused of sexually abusing civilians, the U.N. report said that the RSF was responsible for 'sexual violence on a large scale.' It also said the RSF and allied Arab militias have carried out 'abduction, recruitment and use of children in hostilities.' Nigerian scholar and advocate Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, one of the U.N. fact-finding mission’s three experts, said the RSF is destroying lives with impunity and must be held accountable. 'These women, girls, boys and men in Sudan who are increasingly exposed to sexual and gender-based violence need protection,' she said in a statement. 'Without accountability the cycle of hatred and violence will carry on.' Othman said the situation continues to deteriorate and underscores the need for urgent protection of civilians. 'Ways must be found to create conditions for the immediate deployment of an independent protection force,' he said. 'There is no safe place in Sudan now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-tjmfSxqyDz7	2024-11-26T16:23:53-08:00	
Myanmar: Wa Rebels Reject Thai Demand To Withdraw From Bases Alon...	Ethnic rebels in eastern Myanmar’s Shan state on Tuesday dismissed calls by the Royal Thai Army to withdraw from nine military camps along a disputed portion of the border with Thailand, suggesting Bangkok take the issue up with the ruling junta. The United Wa State Army, which controls an autonomous region of Shan state, has designated the townships of Tachileik, Mongsat, Mongton, Hway Aw and Pong Par Kyin -- near Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province -- as part of its '171 Military Region.' Leaders of the Wa army, or UWSA, met with officers from the Thai Royal Army in Chiang Mai, Thailand from Nov. 18-19 to discuss tensions along the border, after which Thai authorities demanded that the rebels withdraw from the nine military outposts by Dec. 19, according to Thai media reports. On Tuesday, the UWSA responded to the demand, saying troops withdrawals must be decided as part of official bilateral talks. 'This is a matter of negotiation for the two governments,' said UWSA liaison officer Nyi Rang, referring the issue to Myanmar’s ruling junta, which seized power in a February 2021 military coup d’etat. UWSA officials said tensions between its forces and the Thai military are highest along the border with Shan’s Mongton and Mong Hsat townships. Beginning Monday, the Royal Thai Army has been reinforcing its troops in the area, further stoking the border spat, a resident named Aung Kyaw told RFA Burmese. 'At present, no clashes have occurred, but troops on both sides remain in a standoff,' he said. 'It is hoped that conflict can be avoided to prevent any loss of life or property. The situation should be resolved peacefully.' Aung Kyaw said that residents of the area are concerned by military preparations on both sides of the border. Long-running dispute The areas under dispute between Myanmar and Thailand were previously under the control of Myanmar’s ethnic Mong Tai Army. However, amid conflict between Myanmar’s army and the Mong Tai army, the former deployed allied Wa forces to the areas, according to observers of ethnic issues in Myanmar. Following a 1989 peace agreement between Myanmar’s military and the UWSA, more than 80,000 ethnic Wa people migrated to eastern Shan state, and the Wa forces established strong military bases along the Thai border, observers say. Than Soe Naing, a commentator on military and political affairs, told RFA that the UWSA will not leave these stronghold areas, with a population that now numbers more than 100,000 within its 171 Military Region. 'The UWSA has established positions in this area with the approval of former Major General Khin Nyunt of the Myanmar military to block the Mong Tai Army from importing supplies from Thailand,' he said. 'The UWSA is unlikely to relinquish these disputed areas quietly, despite Thailand’s demands for their withdrawal. If Thailand carries out military action, clashes between the two neighboring countries are inevitable.' Several Myanmar and Thailand governments have attempted to resolve the long-running dispute along the two countries' shared border, with little success. Thailand made similar demands to the UWSA during a township-level meeting in Tachilek in June 2023, which the Wa army also dismissed. But the stakes are higher this time around, with Bangkok issuing a deadline and the Royal Thai Army deploying reinforcements to the border. Attempts by RFA to contact the Thai Embassy in Yangon via email received no response by the time of publishing. Thailand downplays tensions Despite the rising tensions, Col. Rungkhun Mahapanyawong, the Royal Thai Army’s 3rd Army Region spokesman, described the situation at the border as 'normal.' 'The situation along the borders of [Thailand‘s] Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son remains normal - people are living their lives as usual and the [parties] along the border have good relations with one another,' he said at a press conference at the Royal Thai Army’s 3rd Army headquarters in Phitsanulok province. 'The reported areas are not yet demarcated,' he said. 'Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing.' However, he warned that Thailand will protect its national sovereignty if necessary. 'The 3rd Army Region is ready to do its best to defend the nation’s sovereignty and protect the Thai people,' he said. Attempts by RFA to contact junta spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun for a response to UWSA reports of territorial disputes went unanswered Tuesday. Junta unlikely to engage A former military officer turned political commentator told RFA that the junta has little interest in the disputes between the UWSA and the Thai government. 'This border dispute is not even equal to one hundredth of the importance of friendly relations between the two countries,' said the former military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'The [junta] ... is preoccupied with internal affairs, so they aren’t interested in this dispute and won’t address it.' Tensions with Thailand come as the UWSA faces pressure from Beijing to end hostilities with the junta amid conflict at the border China shares with northern Shan state. Other Myanmar political commentators told RFA they believe that in renewing its demands on the longstanding territorial disputes, the Thai government is taking advantage of a time when both the Myanmar military and the UWSA are dealing with internal conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-lxAoQP4mfPS	2024-11-26T16:21:37-08:00	
US Hastening The Shift To A Multipolar World – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif Nothing speaks of the US applying double standards when it comes to respecting international law and UN bodies than its reaction to the International Criminal Court’s issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on war crime charges. The Biden administration was quick to reject the ruling, arguing lack of jurisdiction by the court. President Joe Biden called the decision 'outrageous.' But Republican lawmakers were more belligerent, with Sen. Lindsey Graham threatening America’s allies, such as Canada, the UK, France and Germany, that if they were to cooperate with the court’s ruling, the US would crush their economies. Others called for a bipartisan resolution sanctioning the court and its prosecutor. Graham said that the US would be next on its list if the International Criminal Court was not sanctioned. This contrasts with the US and Graham cheering the court when it issued arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudan leader Omar Bashir. The world has been moving slowly from a unipolar to a multipolar reality for years. But Israel’s horrific war on Gaza has accelerated that process. The US has weakened the UN Security Council by exercising its veto power on multiple occasions to derail draft resolutions calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. The fact that many so-called Western liberal democracies defended Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, with some remaining unapologetic today, has strained the rules-based order to breaking point. There are clear indications that Israel’s horrific military conduct in Gaza under the guise of self-defense has had significant geopolitical implications that can be seen in the erosion of America’s status as the world’s sole superpower. This position was achieved following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the world is deeply polarized again. The Global South no longer sees the West as the defender of universal values and the rule of law. Israel has put itself above the law, but what has made its exceptionalism, as a lawbreaker, the norm is America’s blind support and blatant partiality even before the war on Gaza. For years, the US, which had appointed itself as the exclusive broker of a political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, looked the other way as Israel expanded its illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories, demolished Palestinian homes, killed and imprisoned thousands and imposed an apartheid regime on millions of Palestinians under occupation. Moreover, it used its power in the UNSC to derail any move to hold Israel accountable before the law. Under the Trump administration, the US went even further by unilaterally recognizing Israel’s illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and Syria’s Golan Heights. By doing so, the US itself became a rogue state, violating international law and becoming culpable in Israel’s war crimes. In the coming months and years, it is almost a done deal that the US will give the go-ahead for Israel to annex the West Bank, and maybe Gaza as well, and kill any prospect for a Palestinian state. All this would be illegal under international law and UN resolutions. In addition to the diverging international response to the war on Gaza, with the US today standing almost alone in its explicit support of Israel’s actions, Washington’s indifference to the position of its allies has diminished its moral authority and diplomatic influence in certain regions, particularly the Middle East and the Global South. The war has exposed limitations in the current UN system, particularly the Security Council, potentially accelerating calls for reform to better reflect a multipolar world order. Countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India and Turkiye are echoing such calls. The US has been losing its global hegemony for a number of reasons, such as the meteoric rise of China as an economic and military power, the birth of new Global South coalitions and blocs, such as BRICS and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the emergence of regional powers like Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Indonesia. Furthermore, the increasing global reach of non-Western cultural influences and media is challenging the dominance of traditional Western soft power. The proliferation of diverse media sources and social media platforms has challenged traditional Western-dominated narratives about global conflicts, reflecting a more multipolar information landscape. It is not only America’s global dominance that is eroding. The EU is seeing an unprecedented shift in public sentiments toward the far right, which is dominated by euroskeptics, anti-immigration populist figures and Islamophobic policies. These political undercurrents will weaken the bloc’s global influence as it faces existential challenges. In the Middle East, countries are distancing themselves from confrontational American policies, such as Washington’s rivalry with China and Russia. This is evident in Saudi Arabia’s opening to Moscow and Beijing, while maintaining a close working relationship with the US based on what best serves its national interest. Turkiye and Iran are also keeping all lines open as they forge new alliances based on the shared interests of the neighborhood. The shift toward a multipolar world is a reality that coincides with the eclipse of US global hegemony and Trump’s 'America First' policy. As America turns inward, its global dominance will diminish. Moreover, its audacious challenges of the rules-based order will accelerate the drive toward a collapse of the post-Second World War entities that the US helped build. But the path toward a multipolar world remains fraught with challenges. Unresolved conflicts will test the existing global system, while new ones may pave the way for the birth of fresh alliances and platforms of regional cooperation.

Interview: Could A Demilitarized Zone End The Ukraine War?	By Vazha Tavberidze (RFE/RL) -- Lieutenant Colonel Jahara 'Franky' Matisek is an active-duty U.S. Air Force officer, a former command pilot, instructor, and Bronze Star recipient, and a professor in the national security affairs department of the U.S. Naval War College. He has researched and written widely on issues of technology in future warfare, hybrid warfare, and security force assistance. In a conversation with RFE/RL's Georgian Service, Matisek talked about the state of the Russian invasion at the 1,000-day mark and whether the United States has really done all it can for Ukraine. He also floated the notion of a huge demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Belarus. And he said Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion in Kursk already called 'B.S.' on Moscow's threat of a nuclear response to invasion. Matisek's views are his own and do not represent the official position of the U.S. military or the U.S. government. RFE/RL: Roughly 1,000 days into Russia's full-scale invasion, where do we stand in the Ukraine war? How is it looking? Jahara 'Franky' Matisek: In some ways, it's looking worse, in other ways, it's looking better. The things I would say are looking better are that you have more European unity on training and equipping Ukrainian forces. I would also contend that the U.S. has actually been quite lackluster in the training of Ukrainians, that we've only trained about 20,000. So any perceptions that the U.S. is doing everything for Ukraine, it just isn't true. I would argue that there is also concern about what the next [U.S. President-elect Donald Trump] administration might be doing in regard to the Ukraine war. And if we must put on our 'doomcasting hat' about where this is looking more negative, it is obviously the insertion of North Korean troops into the war. That adds another element. The question becomes: Is this just a limited insertion of 11,000 North Korean troops? But when you start hearing rumors that the North Koreans may end up giving Russia up to 100,000 troops, that's highly concerning because, through the course of the war, Russia seems to be running out of viable manpower to do effective combined-arms maneuvers and have a well-trained and well-equipped army to carry out current operations. So they have to rely on 'meat-wave' assaults (operations with large numbers of troops with little regard for individual survival), and the meat-wave assaults work as long as, from a Russian perspective, those people were disposable anyways. You know, it is very telling about how they work: They basically force the Ukrainians to expose their defenses and positions to take care of the meat-wave assault. Meanwhile, the Russian VDV [Airborne Forces], who are obviously comparatively better than most Russian forces, are able to then use precision fire over time to basically slowly pick off Ukrainian defenses. Again, the negative is that the Russian war machine continues to grind on. They are still taking more territories, especially in eastern Ukraine. And there is a big question mark as to whether Moscow has achieved its war aims of undermining Western political support for keeping this war up into the third year, especially as we don't know what the incoming Trump administration is going to do. RFE/RL: With all that in mind, in this theater of war, which act are we watching, and how far are we from the grand finale Matisek: If you're [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in Moscow, you obviously want to exploit this sort of lame-duck presidency [of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden]. So you could argue it's quite good that the Biden administration finally relented on allowing longer-range strikes [by Ukraine] into Russian territory. And the Ukrainians have already launched several ATACMS [ballistic missiles into Russia]. The range of the ATACMS is only about 300 kilometers.... RFE/RL: Isn't it a fallacy to refer to them as long-range? They are distinctly short-range. We're not talking about Tomahawks here. Matisek: Well, for the [U.S.] Army, 300 kilometers is a long-range weapon system. But you're 100 percent right, long-range for the army means something very different from the navy or the air force. I'm an air force pilot, so when I think 'long-range,' I think I can hit anything on the planet from wherever I am. I like to use the term 'anti-strategy' for the narrative that the U.S. basically got cornered into allowing long-range missiles and deep strikes into Russia when it's 300 kilometers. You can drive that in a few hours; that's not long-range if it's a day trip. So the fact that we even allowed ourselves to get into that debate -- self-defeating, self-deterring, loop or spiral or cycle, whatever you want to call it -- is really unfortunate because, again, it gave the narrative to Putin, which he obviously seized upon. He just released a new, updated Russian nuclear doctrine. The two biggest things he did in there were [to assert that] any conventional attack on Belarus is now considered an attack on Russia. And the other thing I found very notable is the inclusion of verbiage -- essentially it's directed at Ukraine -- about a country attacking us with the support of a nuclear power -- so that's potentially the U.S., the French, the Brits -- we consider that also within the realm of a response with nuclear weapons. I think it's 'red line' bluffing, because the U.S. and the collective West have been crossing Moscow's red lines for the last three, four years. But it's an attempt to control the narrative and to signal to the West that 'Hey, you can't touch this because we've now drawn the line [whereby] your participation in this war, the very act of it, makes you culpable in a potential nuclear war.' RFE/RL: In that case, they don't need to wait for another escalation by 'the West.' By that Russian logic, the United States is already involved and is therefore a potential target for a nuclear strike. So what are they going to do to implement it? Matisek: Well, I don't think it's any change because Russia already had a nuclear doctrine that if their territory is invaded they're allowed to have a nuclear response. Well, the Ukrainians already demonstrated that that was a line of bullshit. So I don't think the Russians are using a nuclear weapon anytime soon. The Russians can talk, they can rattle the saber about this all they want, but in the end, it would actually do more harm to the Russian war machine. It would hurt them even more, it would make them more isolated. The rest of the world is going to judge the actions of Moscow and them using a nuclear weapon when the survival of the Russian state and Russian leadership is not at stake. RFE/RL: If we could return to the second half of the previous question: How close are we to an endgame, provided the current trends continue and assuming no Trump intervention happens? Matisek: I could see this going on another three years. RFE/RL: Looking at the battlefield, is there still a case to be argued in favor of Ukraine winning this on the battlefield, retaking all its territory and driving Russians out, or has that ship sailed? Matisek: If I were to cast this into a campfire metaphor: Imagine a big campfire, and if the campfire is the standard of retaking Luhansk and [the rest of] Donbas and Crimea, the chances of that happening are merely a warm ember, and the fire is mostly out. So it does not look good, given current trends, things that I do believe could change -- that would be the European Union sending an EU-flagged mission into Ukraine and drawing a line in the sand, saying that 'Russian forces will not cross these lines because we view this as an invasion of Europe.' RFE/RL: How likely is that, given what we've seen from Europe? And curiously enough, one of the peace plans that emerged from President-elect Trump's camp actually includes creating a demilitarized zone and manning it not with U.S. but European troops. So now, without a hint of sarcasm, how realistic is it that Europe says yes to that? Matisek: The idea of the Russian forces eventually making it to Kyiv or farther west over the next three to five years would compel the Europeans to do that, along with the Americans telling the Europeans, 'You have to do this.' And there is a model for this; it is basically how North Korea and South Korea had to be essentially split up. Is that a best ideal outcome? No, of course the best ideal outcome is all Russian forces leaving the entirety of Ukraine. But we have to go back to being realistic. How much are the Americans and the Canadians and the Europeans willing to fight and die for every centimeter of Ukrainian territory? And that becomes a question of political willpower and domestic politics. I think it's just an easier sell having to lock this in place. And you essentially create a huge DMZ [demilitarized zone], essentially between Ukraine and Belarus, Russia, and the occupied parts of Ukraine. And that would just basically be millions of land mines and Ukrainian defense bases, with probably European Union-flag forces essentially as observers, peacekeepers, and as a part of that sort of deterrent line. It would essentially become just one big trip-wire deterrent, if you will. That would be an ideal outcome for a lot of countries, especially in Europe. It's really depressing and unfortunate, but it's hard to make that case to the average American or average European, that this war is worth actually fighting and dying for. It's worth fighting for, yes, but… RFE/RL: Dying for it is a different matter. Matisek: Exactly. RFE/RL: We are talking hypotheticals now, right? If that plan became a reality, somebody would have to man the DMZ, right? It couldn't be only Ukrainians. Matisek: It would have to be a European Union-flag mission. NATO would not want to be charged with that type of mission. RFE/RL: Because of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty, providing for common defense in the event of an attack on any member]? Matisek: Yes. RFE/RL: Then we enter the very murky territory of who would actually be willing to send troops there. And further, equally murky territory would be what happens if there is any sort of renewed military conflict and those troops get in harm's way? Matisek: So, on the first point, I would argue that most Eastern European countries are willing -- the Baltics would be willing to send forces, and Poland for sure -- and then it becomes kind of murky after that. I would argue the French would probably be willing to do it, and I bet the Germans would also be willing to do it. And I would argue we already kind of know who'd be willing to do this, because a template kind of exists: NATO has the EFP, the Enhanced Forward Presence, in the Baltics already, a sort of trip-wire deterrent force. RFE/RL: But they are very conveniently under the NATO umbrella. These ones wouldn't be. Matisek: Yes, but, for the sake of argument, there is enough overlap between the EU and NATO, they could use an EFP, they could borrow part of the EFP construct. And I would contend that you would probably get a similar mix of forces from the EU in addition to the Canadians and the Brits and even Norwegians, I bet. RFE/RL: Since we are discussing armies and, to an extension, manpower: Which is the more pressing issue for Ukraine at this stage, shortage of equipment or shortage of manpower? Matisek: It's manpower, manpower, manpower. The Europeans and the Americans and the Brits, all these countries that are willing to train Ukrainians, they could train more; it's just a question of whether Ukraine can send more. And get them enough military-aged men and women, as women are also allowed to serve in the Ukrainian Army. So that becomes a huge part. We know it's in Germany's interest not to allow Ukraine to fall either; I think a big report came out just last week about the anticipation that, if Ukraine were to fall or be abandoned, that Europe would expect 10 million to 15 million Ukrainian refugees and that would be way more disruptive economically and politically. So, yeah, it's manpower. The only thing you can do to offset the manpower things is having more and more drones. Because they don't have the manpower, you really see the Ukrainians emphasizing cheap drones that are unjammable, that use AI, and that is a way to overcome the manpower issue. But at a certain point, you still need people on the ground to man the drones. RFE/RL: We have already discussed the ATACMS green light from the United States. Let's circle back to it. What has shifted in the Biden administration's calculations that made them think that now is the time? Matisek: Oh, it's definitely that the administration has been under a lot of pressure because of the insertion [into Russia's Kursk region] of the 11,000 North Korean troops. They've been under a lot of pressure, I think, internally and externally, about letting the North Koreans get involved in this war without any sort of tit-for-tat-type response. The South Koreans are quite upset and angry about this as well. So this had to be a natural response. RFE/RL: The general consensus seems to be that it's coming way too late, but still the question needs to be asked: What's the expected impact? Matisek: Again, the tit-for-tat escalation by the current administration has just been too little too late, constantly. That seems to be a theme -- too little, too late, too much open debating, too much time to give Russia an ability to adjust before these weapons and stuff are used so that you can't exploit them in the moment. I guarantee you, Russians did their best to disperse after that announcement, in terms of massing formations and trying to get things out of stockpiles, just to minimize how much damage can be done by ATACMS. So that's what I find unfortunate about it, that the U.S. is trying to incrementally escalate but do it very openly, and that actually undermines the intent and the purpose. And honestly, this is still a war, so when you do things like this, it makes it feel more like a war of politics and diplomacy than an actual war of militarily defeating Russia and neutering their ability to invade a neighbor ever again.

Indonesia Considers Repatriating Foreign Drug Convicts; President...	By Tria Dianti Indonesia is weighing a 'humanitarian' plan to return incarcerated foreign drug convicts to their countries to serve their remaining sentences, with the president initially approving the transfer of the 'Bali Nine' heroin traffickers back to Australia. Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia’s new president, initiated the plan to send home foreign drug prisoners on a case-by-case basis, a law ministry spokesman told BenarNews. Human rights advocates praised Indonesia for first agreeing to return death-row Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, and then the remaining members of the 'Bali Nine,' named because the nine Australians were arrested while attempting to smuggle more than 16 pounds of heroin out of the Indonesian island in 2005. However, some criticized Prabowo for agreeing to the Australians’ return saying it undermined the Indonesian justice system, while others hoped the plan was a true attempt at reform. Ali Nurdin, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights, said compassion played a central role in the decision to transfer Veloso and the five Australians to their home countries. 'One reason for this policy shift is the humanitarian aspect. The mothers of these inmates are elderly and cannot frequently travel here,' Ali told BenarNews. He said the ministry was reviewing their return to ensure it complied with regulations. Law Minister Supratman Andi Agtas, however, told reporters on Monday that a mechanism for the transfers was already being worked on. 'It could be ready by December or early next year,' he said. 'But in principle, the president agrees with this and we are preparing it.' Prabowo’s spokesman and advisers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BenarNews. Indonesia has some of the world’s harshest drug laws and faces a growing drug abuse problem with an estimated 3.6 million users, according to a 2022 state report. Prabowo’s predecessor, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, declared a 'drug emergency' and during his two terms oversaw the executions of 18 drug convicts by firing squad, including two 'Bali Nine' members. These executions were carried out despite international criticism and appeals for clemency. Filipina Veloso was scheduled to be executed with the two 'Bali Nine' members in 2015, but her execution was postponed at the last minute after Manila requested that her case be reviewed. Veloso was convicted for smuggling heroin, but has long claimed she was a victim of human trafficking. Those who trafficked her have also been prosecuted in the Philippines. No date has been set for Veloso’s return, although Indonesian officials said she must still serve her sentence when back home. Officials in Manila said Veloso could be back in the Philippines before Christmas. Some Australian newspapers reported that the remaining 'Bali Nine' members could also 'be home in time for Christmas.' Seven 'Bali Nine' members were sentenced to life without parole. One died of cancer in June 2018, while another had her sentence commuted in November of that year. The remaining five – Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens and Si Yi Chen – are in Indonesian prisons. Australia’s national broadcaster, ABC reported that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had lobbied Indonesia’s Prabowo for them to serve the rest of their sentences in Australian prison when the two leaders met at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. Indonesia’s law minister said the repatriation efforts were 'important to maintain our good relations' with other countries. '[But] foreign national prisoners being transferred to their home countries does not mean they are free,' Supratman, the minister, said on Sunday according to a transcript of his remarks. [T]hey must complete their prison terms in their respective countries according to Indonesian legal decisions.' Dinna Prapto Raharja, an international relations scholar, believes Prabowo made a poor decision in agreeing to return the 'Bali Nine' members. Veloso was a victim who deserved an earlier release, but the Bali Nine were convicted of severe drug offenses and should face their punishment, said Dinna, of Synergy Policies, a Jakarta-based think-tank. 'It’s not a good precedent for us. This is not the president’s domain,' she told BenarNews. 'The president can grant clemency, but sending the Bali Nine back to Australia without going through proper legal procedures is wrong.' Some in Australia agreed with Dinna, as reactions on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) showed. X user @tom_mende wrote: 'There is no humanitarian case. They wanted to spread their poison for personal profit devoid of any morality or humanity. No second chances.' 'The Bali nine are criminals: do the crime, do the time,' wrote another X user, @TafPomScotiPole. Usman Hamid, executive director of human rights group Amnesty International Indonesia, hopes Prabowo’s proposal is not merely opportunistic and instead involves a genuine reform of the country’s harsh drug policies. 'This should be the start of a consistent human rights-based approach to drug cases, regardless of whether they involve foreigners or citizens,' he told BenarNews. '[But] the question remains whether this …is merely an ad hoc decision influenced by political interests and diplomatic pressures.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-rVeiPtDcMc_	2024-11-26T16:02:14-08:00	
Saudi Arabia Approves FY2025 Budget, Forecasts $27bn Deficit Amid...	By Dayan Abou Tine Saudi Arabia on Tuesday approved the state budget for fiscal year 2025 with revenues projected at SR1.18 trillion ($315.73 billion) and expenditure at SR1.28 trillion, leading to a deficit of SR101 billion. The Finance Ministry forecasted Saudi Arabia’s Real GDP growth at 4.6 percent in 2025, up from the 0.8 percent estimate for 2024. This growth will be driven by a rise in non-oil sector activities, according to the statement. The figures align with projections from the ministry’s pre-budget statement in September, showing a 4 percent decline in revenues, a 4 percent decline in expenditures, and a 12 percent lower deficit compared to the latest FY 2024 estimates. The FY2025 forecast are based on a baseline scenario, which represents a middle ground between higher and lower revenue projections, taking into account potential changes in economic activity and global petroleum market conditions. The ministry projects the deficit to remain at similar levels in the medium term, with SR130 billion in 2026 and SR140 billion in 2027, driven by the government’s strategic expansionary spending policies aimed at fostering economic diversification and sustainable growth. Revenues are expected to rise over the next two years, reaching around SR1.3 trillion by 2027. The Kingdom’s total debt is projected to reach SR1.3 trillion in 2025, equivalent to 29.9 percent of GDP, reflecting a sustainable level to meet financing needs. Revised projections for Saudi Arabia’s 2024 budget indicate a deficit of SR115 billion, with total debt expected to reach SR1.2 trillion, or 29.3 percent of GDP. The fiscal year 2025 budget prioritizes maintaining essential services for citizens and residents, while accelerating spending on key projects and sectors. It focuses on preserving fiscal stability and achieving long-term sustainability by managing government reserves and maintaining sustainable public debt levels, ensuring the Kingdom’s resilience against unforeseen economic shocks. In a statement following the weekly Cabinet session, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman emphasized the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the Kingdom’s economic base. 'We will continue to work on expanding the economic base and enhancing the Kingdom’s financial position,' he stated. He also highlighted the pivotal role of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth funds—the Public Investment Fund and the National Development Fund—in driving economic stability and achieving Vision 2030 objectives. 'These funds are essential to diversifying the economy and supporting long-term investments,' he said. Saudi Arabia’s economy is advancing through strategic reforms and robust investment initiatives under Vision 2030, emphasizing diversification and fiscal sustainability. Key objectives include increasing the private sector’s contribution to GDP, growing the share of foreign investment, and boosting non-oil exports. The strategy also prioritizes reducing unemployment and accelerating investment growth by enhancing the business environment, providing innovative financing solutions, and attracting regional headquarters of multinational companies to establish a strong presence in the Kingdom. Key enablers, including the PIF, are driving private sector growth, launching transformative projects, and fostering new industries. These efforts, outlined in the 2025 budget statement, aim to boost social and economic outcomes while ensuring resilience against global challenges and long-term prosperity. Breakdown of projected government revenues and expenditures The ministry projects tax income at SR379 billion in 2025, making up around 32 percent of total revenues. This represents a 4 percent increase compared to the 2024 estimates. The majority of these levies, accounting for 77 percent, come from taxes on goods and services. According to the ministry, this growth is driven by sustained improvements in economic activity, the ongoing development of tax administration, and enhanced collection processes, all of which have contributed to a boost in total tax revenues. In terms of sector-specific expenditures, the military sector received the largest allocation at SR272 billion, marking a 5 percent increase compared to the 2024 estimates. The health and social development sector followed with a 20.25 percent share amounting to SR260 billion. General items with 14.95 percent share of 2025 budgeted expenditures will be allocated SR192 billion. Financing the deficit The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the National Debt Management Center develops an annual borrowing plan aligned with the Kingdom’s medium-term debt strategy, ensuring long-term debt sustainability. This strategy not only diversifies financing sources, encompassing both domestic and external markets, but also enhances the Kingdom’s standing in global debt markets. Additionally, the government is expanding its financing channels by tapping into bond and sukuk issuance, loans, and alternative funding models like project and infrastructure financing, as well as collaborating with export credit agencies. According to the Ministry of Finance, the Kingdom maintains a robust fiscal position, underpinned by substantial financial reserves and manageable public debt levels. This fiscal strength provides the government with the ability to manage potential economic shocks and meet its financing needs across short, medium, and long-term horizons, while securing favorable borrowing terms from both domestic and international markets. The crown prince also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to fiscal reforms that have already improved Saudi Arabia’s credit ratings. While the projected deficit for 2025 signals short-term fiscal challenges, the government is focused on ensuring long-term economic sustainability. He noted that this year’s budget will continue to prioritize economic diversification, with significant emphasis on empowering the private sector and fostering growth in small and medium-sized enterprises. The crown prince stressed that, despite global economic uncertainties, Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to navigate external challenges and play an increasingly central role in regional and global economic stability. 'Our economy is well-prepared to overcome challenges,' he said. He also emphasized the importance of long-term financial planning to maintain momentum on Vision 2030 initiatives, underscoring the government's focus on spending efficiency and transparent execution of the budget to meet its strategic goals. Moody’s upgraded Saudi Arabia’s credit rating to 'Aa3' from 'A1' on Friday, highlighting the country’s progress in diversifying its economy beyond oil. The Kingdom is investing heavily in Vision 2030 initiatives, focusing on sectors like tourism, sports, and manufacturing, while also attracting foreign investment. Despite lower oil prices and reduced production, Saudi Arabia continues to adjust its spending, delaying or scaling back some Vision 2030 projects while prioritizing others. Moody’s revised the country’s outlook to stable, reflecting uncertainties in global economic conditions and the oil market. In September, S&P also upgraded Saudi Arabia’s outlook to positive due to strong non-oil growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-qFCFsuWCKvr	2024-11-26T15:59:18-08:00	
Pentagon Consults With Interagency Partners On Israel-Lebanon Cea...	By Jim Garmone Israel and Lebanon have agreed to a ceasefire which could lead to a cessation of Hezbollah attacks on Israel and the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, according to news reports. The U.S. Defense Department will play a role in the ceasefire, but there are few details, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Tuesday. 'We're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire,' Ryder said during a Pentagon news conference. 'We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make.' DOD has worked tirelessly with interagency partners and international allies and friends to end the conflict in the region. 'The Department of Defense plays an important role within our interagency here in the U.S. and on working with partners in the region to prevent a wider conflict,' he said. The conflict between Israel and the Iranian proxy Hezbollah has killed approximately 3,800 people and wounded about 16,000, Lebanese officials have said. 'We've seen diplomatic means as key to enabling both Lebanese and Israeli citizens to return to their homes on both sides of the blue line,' Ryder said. 'That's probably the most significant [development], as well as just the simple fact of reducing the amount of violence that we're seeing and the destruction and death on both sides of the border.' Ryder said the United States would like to see a ceasefire in Gaza as well. 'Certainly, we still want to see a situation in Gaza where there is a ceasefire, so that we can increase the flow of humanitarian assistance and restore a sense of stability and security in that region,' he said. The ceasefire with Lebanon could carry over to Gaza. There is 'a lot of potential good could come out of this ceasefire [with Lebanon],' Ryder said. Ryder was asked about reports of drones flying over bases in the United Kingdom that the United States uses. The general said none of the incursions has impacted base residents or the missions of the units on those bases. 'We're, of course, continuing to work with host nation authorities and our mission partners to ensure the safety of our personnel, our facilities and equipment,' he said. 'You know, the bottom line is, it's something that we're going to take seriously. We're continuing to look into it, but as of right now, it has not had any significant mission impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-vIGg4NdYvKo	2024-11-26T15:55:43-08:00	
Iran Says It Will Arm New Warship With Long-Range Missiles	The commander of the Iranian Navy unveiled plans to put into service a new homegrown military vessel that will be equipped with long-range vertically-launched air defense missiles. Rear Admiral Shahram Irani conducted an interview with Tasnim on the occasion of National Navy Day. Highlighting the Navy’s progress in manufacturing a broad range of equipment, the commander said a new homegrown vessel, called 'Kurdistan', will be unveiled in the near future. He noted that the new warship will be furnished with 'Sayyad' air defense missile system which can vertically fire long-range missiles. The commander also said another new vessel, named 'Zagros', will come into operation, adding that the Sabalan destroyer’s missile capabilities have been quadrupled. The Navy has also developed coast-to-sea missiles with ranges in excess of 1,000 kilometers using innovative technologies, he stated. Praising the Iranian Navy’s progress in the submarine industry, Rear Admiral Irani said manufacturing heavy and super-heavy submarines has been on the agenda. He said the Navy is developing a heavy submarine, dubbed 'Be’sat', which will be furnished with up-to-date arms and become operational after the necessary tests. Asked about the Navy’s drone power, the commander said his forces will receive two types of 'strategic drones' manufactured by domestic experts. While the Iranian Navy has focused its attention on the UAVs for patrol and reconnaissance, considering the nature of its operations, such as ensuring maritime security, supporting ships, and combatting the sources of threat in combat, it will also begin to develop logistical naval drones that can carry heavy payloads, assist the vessels in an emergency, ship medical equipment and even persons, and transfer medication and blood shipments at a long distance away, the commander added. In a meeting with Navy commanders in November 2023, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei lauded the Iranian Navy’s 'eye-catching and incredible advances' after the victory of the Islamic Revolution. 'In the early years of the Revolution, the presence of the Navy beyond the territorial waters was unimaginable, but now the Navy circumnavigates the globe mightily and formidably and returns home proudly,' the Leader said. In that meeting, Rear Admiral Irani said the Navy’s two principal policies are 'expansion of sphere of influence in the sea' and 'reliance on technology and science' with the purpose of strengthening the Establishment’s power.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-imLmjAsogzc	2024-11-26T15:52:45-08:00	
Today’s Perspective – OpEd	By Dr J Scott Younger The last few weeks have been some of the most unusual that have taken place. Two wars continuing with no end in sight, not to mention internal disputes in Sudan and Myanmar which seldom draw press attention, swamped by almost constant news over the US presidential election. The presidential election was the strangest that the US had ever held, a person charged with many misdemeanours, Donald Trump, albeit a former president himself, representing the Republican Party against Kamala Harris, the current Vice-president of the opposing Democratic Party. All the way through, the polls said the result was too close to call. The result, however, astonished most people, and concerned many others across the world. Trump won by a big margin, and the Republicans for the upcoming 4 years have a total grip on the legislature. He will have authority to push ahead with his programme with little domestic opposition to stand in his way. Why are people across the world so worried? In the latter days of Trump’s campaigning, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man by all accounts, appeared at his side on the stage, prancing around like an over grown schoolboy with too many toys that he did not know what to do with. Presumably, he has a suitable arrangement that will help Trump with outstanding personal issues in return for a job in Trump’s cabinet management team. Musk has to make the civil service slimmer and more efficient to carry out the Trump programme; in charge of ‘draining the swamp’ that is Washington! He has years of experience to bring to the job!! As the cabinet team is chosen, one person who must cause some concern in Middle East quarters is the ambassador designate to Israel. He does not believe in a two-state solution. nor does he believe in a country called Palestine. This must be music to Netanyahu’s ears; he can go ahead with all his plans, squeezing out their neighbours, the indigenous people. The Israelis have been clearing the northern part of Gaza of Palestinian people and intend to take over the land with the aggressive settlers, who came down recently to have a look at their ‘new property’. Neither UN staff nor foreign media have been allowed into Gaza, and they have been given 3 months to get out completely. The Israelis say that they are meeting their obligation for humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, but all parties say it is simply not so – less than 20% of requirement. The citizens of Gaza have to put up with a daily bombing and continued loss of life, just in case they want to stay! The Israelis say they are bombing Hamas targets, although all the damage caused is usually a school building providing shelter for homeless people, mostly women and children, a further few killed. President Biden has two months left in office to do something about Gaza and the Palestinians, but nothing will be done. He will continue with his weak, hopeless foreign n policy that has marked his time in office ever since the undignified scramble out of Afghanistan leaving the Afghanis in the hands of the Taliban. The squeezing out of the Palestinian people on the West Bank continues unabated. The far-right settlers come down from the north, armed, with the Israeli military standing by. The settlers give the locals, who generally have owned and farmed the land for generations back to the days of the Ottoman empire, are given a week to leave, resistance being threatened at gun point and worse, imprisonment and sometimes shooting. The UN marks it down as another point to take up as a criminal act by the Israeli Government, some day in the future, to take to the Court of Human Rights, and the west stands by for leadership and action by the US. However, with the new US ambassador coming in next year the situation can only become worse for the Palestinians because the Trump presidency would appear to back the Israeli position. The Palestinians side say they will resist but how? Trump stated that he would bring peace to the Middle East, which is good. But how does he get the Israelis to understand what is needed and not their current stated goal to dominate the whole territory, which was once known as Palestine. Now it is a far cry from what they agreed to in 1948 when they were given the right to assume ownership of a fair slice of the land. The President-elect has a good rapport with the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, and would seem to encourage him by appointing a pro-Israel ambassador designate. Hamas and Hezbollah are designated terrorist organisations by the US and west, but we forget that Israel aggression in the past brought them about. We can only hope that Trump sees things as they are and can bring about a just and fair peace. Most Israelis want the same. An escalation of hostilities, albeit they are mostly one-sided, will risk bringing in other players and expansion of the war. Trump has an opportunity to show the just side of the US in world affairs. Perhaps a compromise? The other war that will require Trump’s early attention is the rather longer war, 3 years that the Russians, thanks to Vladimir Putin, have put on Ukraine. It is hard to believe that in the early years of this century, Russia and the west were approaching a reasonable level of if not total détente. Something happened in 2004, Putin, who had control of the Kremlin by that time, changed and the west were to be viewed as the competitors, sometimes aggressively. Everything became answerable to him, even the oligarchs. Perhaps he felt that Russia was not getting the respect it was due and he felt it was his duty to restore the pride in nation that it had in Peter the Great’s Day. That meant some ‘empire’ of lands lost when the Iron Curtain collapsed had to be regained, e.g. Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, and so on. It was not unhelpful that a percentage of oligarchs’ earnings came back to the Kremlin/Putin. Putin, by all accounts is a very wealthy man, and many people have died because of his ambitions. The lesson of history! However, Putin is a ‘good’ friend of Trump’s from all accounts, telephoning him with congratulations of his election success. If this is properly used then Trump could use this to end the war, although a fair amount of comprise will be needed, which will not greatly please Volodymr Zelenskyy. In stopping the outflow of US$, as Trump has indicated, both NATO and Ukraine will suffer. Perhaps a compromise, however unsatisfactory in some quarters, will be agreed involving a monitored border as indicated previously. The war will hence cease. Some of Trump’s early appointments have been described as shocking, laughable, and unbelievable, even by many Republicans. These are defence secretary, Pete Hesgeth, health secretary, R F Kennedy, and attorney general, Matt Gaetz. They, like Musk, have little or no experience of the job they are supposed to be doing. It is very apparent that personal loyalty to Trump himself is more important than job experience. The defence secretary designate perhaps feels ‘threatened’, because the heads of the armed forces at the Pentagon have higher rank than he achieved when he was in military service, although a decorated war veteran, and he is seeking their replacement. Interesting times The next seven weeks will see a transition with world leaders adjusting to the quite different tone of the US presidency. In addition, a sign of the times, the recently completed meeting on climate change, COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, was like a ‘damp squib’. It was a failure, most of the key countries for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) were not present, the US, China, and the leader of the host country boasted about Azerbaijan’s development of fossil fuels. I predict that if there are any more Climate Change meetings they will be totally different in concept. We shall have a US administration under Trump for four years going full bent on drilling for fossil fuels; they don’t believe in Climate Change. They have centuries of fossil fuels readily available and they are going to use them to benefit the economy – America First. China, while it uses 50% of the world’s coal produced are investing extensively in solar panels and have started to invest in clean nuclear, and gradually will make a transition to renewables. They have embraced the electric car market, while the American market for electric cars has stalled. Interesting times, if concerning.

Sustainable Transport Key To Achieving Asia-Pacific Region’s Deve...	Across the Asia-Pacific region, especially in urban centres, electric cars and buses are increasingly replacing gasoline-powered ones as a means of transportation. Aided by the ubiquity of smart devices, smart mobility and other transport innovations are significantly reshaping everyday life through ride-sharing apps, driver assistance technology and real-time traffic management. With new highways and railways operationalized in the last decade, the region is getting yet more connected, while the ongoing digitalization of road, rail and maritime freight transport further improves efficiency and cost reduction. These are part of the wider trend of sustainable transport development, which benefits everyone through making the transport of people and goods safer, 'greener,' more efficient and more accessible. Countries across Asia and the Pacific have made great progress towards these goals, but major challenges remain. More cooperation will be needed to advance these trends and overcome obstacles. The transition to sustainable transport leads to interlinked benefits that are felt across multiple aspects of life. The move towards public transport, walking and cycling not only improves general mobility by relieving congestion stress, but also significantly cuts down on emissions from personal vehicles, reduces the risk of road accidents and promotes physical fitness. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps offer personalized transport solutions tailored to individual needs, reducing fuel consumption and waste, while connected and autonomous vehicle technology improves traffic flow and prevents crashes – by UN estimates, up to 80 percent of non-alcohol ones – by minimizing human error. Coupled with inclusive transport planning, these developments make it much easier for the elderly, disabled, pregnant women and other underserved populations to access transport solutions and fully engage in society. The knock-on effects across economic growth, health, climate action and social inclusion thus make sustainable transport a key enabler of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. The good news is that the Asia-Pacific region has made solid progress towards sustainable transport. Coordinated regional development of transport infrastructure continues to advance economies of scale to meet increased demand in freight transport. Currently, approximatively 145,000 km of Asian Highways, 121,000 km of Trans-Asian Railways and 275 dry ports cover all parts of the region and almost 99.7 per cent of the total population, while the region also hosts the world's ten largest container ports and accounts for more than half of the global maritime trade. In addition to the widespread adoption of smart mobility solutions, countries are in general committed to the decarbonization of their roads, railways and maritime transport, with plans to electrify transport modes and promotion of fuel efficiency and the use of clean sources of fuel. Most countries saw a decline in road traffic deaths in the last decade, and several have made progress in improving gender equality in the transport sector. However, this path is fraught with challenges. Most of the projected future growth in global transport demand will take place in the Asia-Pacific region, owing partly to rapid urbanization and a growing appetite for personal vehicles. While the most tangible effect of this growth will be the rise in greenhouse gas emissions due to the ongoing heavy reliance on fossil fuels, these trends also add additional strain to existing urban transport systems, many of which are underinvested. Missing links and sub-standard quality of infrastructure, coupled with lack of transport facilitation, continue to increase costs and delays of international transport, especially in landlocked developing countries. Likewise, small island developing States continue to show limited and often stagnant levels of their maritime connectivity, hindering their integration into the regional and global economy. The disparity in technological capabilities between countries, as well as current gaps in meeting low-carbon transport goals, hinder the effective adoption of region-wide smart mobility systems and net-zero strategies, respectively. And despite improvements, a person in Asia and the Pacific loses their life in a road accident every 45 seconds. Women only make up approximately 16 per cent of the regional transport workforce, a slightly lower figure than the global average. Government representatives gathered in early November and assessed these achievements and challenges within the framework of the Regional Action Programme for Sustainable Transport Development in Asia and the Pacific. Many tasks, such as transport decarbonization, cannot be overcome by any country alone; meanwhile, the benefits of transport innovations such as digitalization and automation will only be fully realized if widely implemented. With Asia and the Pacific 32 years behind in achieving the SDGs, accelerating sustainable transport development benefits everyone so everyone needs to get on board to make it happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCEdbDNTlv_q	2024-11-26T09:35:40-08:00	
NATO-Ukraine Council Meets Following Russia’s Launch Of Intermedi...	Ambassadors met in the NATO-Ukraine Council (NUC) today (26 November 2024) to discuss the security situation in Ukraine following Russia’s launch of an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) last week. Senior Ukrainian military officials briefed the Council via video link. During the meeting, NATO Allies reaffirmed their support for Ukraine. The attack, which targeted Dnipro, is seen as another attempt by Russia to terrorise the civilian population in Ukraine and intimidate those who support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s illegal and unprovoked aggression. As earlier noted by the NATO Spokesperson, Farah Dakhlallah, 'deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO Allies from supporting Ukraine.' The NATO-Ukraine Council provides a forum for consultation between Allies and Ukraine on security issues of common concern, including Russia’s war of aggression. The meeting was chaired by NATO’s acting Deputy Secretary General, Boris Ruge. The next meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council is due to take place during the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers that will be held on 3-4 December.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilJhtEeCvgevt	2024-11-26T09:34:24-08:00	
Ateneo Develops AI To Forecast Market Interest Rates	Mathematicians from the Ateneo de Manila University have developed artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning tools that can help predict money market interest rates, invaluable for decision-makers in business and government. In simple terms, the market interest rate is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving it. This changes based on supply and demand: if many people are borrowing but few are saving, rates go up; if the opposite happens, rates go down. Interest rates are also affected by inflation (since higher prices mean higher rates) as well as by countries’ central banks (which adjust rates to help the economy grow or to control rising prices). Essentially, interest rates help determine how money moves in the economy. 'Interest rates are among the most important macroeconomic factors considered by both government and private entities when making investment and policy decisions. A reliable forecast is a requisite to sound management of exposure to different types of risk,' the researchers explained. The Ateneo researchers tested two deep learning models: Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Vanilla Generative Adversarial Networks (VGAN). Both successfully anticipated changes in Philippine Benchmark Valuation (BVAL) rates before and during the pandemic, showcasing the models’ robust capability to potentially foresee economic fluctuations and market disruptions. MLP is a type of artificial neural network that passes the data through a series of cells, each of which processes the information in its own way and adds to the network’s overall understanding of the data. This method is often used for image recognition and machine translation because of its ability to find complex patterns in data. Meanwhile, VGAN actually consists of two networks: a generator that creates synthetic data, and a discriminator that evaluates the data’s authenticity. By working in opposition to each other—hence, 'adversarial'—the networks are able to refine and improve their analyses. Conceptual diagrams of artificial intelligence learning models, MLP (top) and VGAN (bottom). SOURCE: Bata et al. The researchers found that both models produced reliable forecasts of one-, three-, six-month, and one-year BVAL rates within the limits of the datasets used. They successfully predicted key trends by incorporating as many as 16 domestic and global economic indicators, including inflation, exchange rates, and credit default swaps. MLP showed strong performance with fewer variables and simpler structures, making it an efficient choice for straightforward analyses. Meanwhile, VGAN excelled more in analyzing complex scenarios, achieving high accuracy when working with larger datasets. The practical implications of these AI deep learning models are substantial, according to the researchers: financial institutions could potentially deploy them to manage market, credit, liquidity, and other risks; and governments could also potentially use these models to optimize debt issuance strategies by reducing borrowing costs. The study highlights the growing role of AI in financial decision-making and suggests exploring more advanced neural network designs to further enhance forecasting accuracy. It is hoped that businesses and policymakers will come to embrace these technologies in order to gain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving data-driven landscape. Halle Megan L. Bata, Mark Jayson A. Victoria, Wyonna Chezska B. Alvarez, Elvira P. de Lara-Tuprio, and Armin Paul D. Allado published their paper, 'Deep Learning Approaches in Interest Rate Forecasting,' last November 15 in the journal, AIP Conference Proceedings.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilJBoB-mSaVzK	2024-11-26T09:33:21-08:00	
RoboCop29 – OpEd	The recent (nomadically arranged Climate event called Review Mechanism – Conference of the Parties to the UN FCCC, or shortly) COP – this time the 29th, hosted by Azerbaijan – showed once again how the natural process of climate change is being misused as an instrument of political and techno-economic dominance and deeper psychologisation of developed countries over developing world. Nature does not change. Change, as a cosmic constant, is a nature itself. Still, even Heraclitus understood, that this force is never eruptive or destructive (explosive, combusting and polarising), but eternally gradual and constructive; holistic, inclusive and implosive. Look up the evening skies and this backbone of night above us: That will be the exact way how entire clockwork of universe functions. Hence, Climate change is an intrinsic, cyclical process that takes place over millions of years. Our planet went through significant climatic variations long before the emergence of modern civilization - from ice ages to warm periods. All credible scientific data shows that the Earth's temperature has changed dramatically throughout its geological history, even without any human influence. Although Homo Sapiens undoubtedly has its impact on the troposphere, it is fundamental to understand that human activities are still sequesterable part of the Earth’s eco-system. Nature has exceptional self-regulatory mechanisms that maintain equilibrium despite various changes and periodic disruptions. For example, varying CO2 levels throughout the geomorphologic history of planet, and its relation to the growth size properties and quantities of Earth’s biota, etc. Despite these well-established facts, the developed countries, which have built their wealth and posture on carbonics over the past 200 years, are now trying to impose expensive and often untested ‘green technologies’ all over the world, using the climate change as an excuse. Ultimately, these ‘novel technologies’ would require a new financial and technology-transfer exposure and dependency for the poor of South vis-à-vis North. De-psychologisation of issues, de-monopolisation of technologies Thus, the promised 300 billion dollars a year for the developing (and LDC – the Least Developed) world – as ‘won’ in Baku – is not a solution, but yet a new form of economic dependence. (Although the group of Vulnerable-77 – including Small Island Nations – vocally demanded 500 billion per annum.) A new market of beforehand patented technologies under the control of handful multinational corporations is being created, while ignoring the fact that nature itself is the best at regulating climate processes. Nature conservation – to say understanding the intrinsic self-regulatory designs, is a key. But, this calls for the multilateral and all-stake-holders approach founded on real scientific facts, not on politically motivated or profit-driven myopic agendas. Global South have a right to economic progress (so-called Right to Development, and Right to Link Trade to Development as fundamental achievement of the UN through UNCTAD final acts decades ago). The imposition of expensive technological solutions and limiting access to cheaper energy sources and solutions directly hampers developing world. It is particularly worrying that the natural processes of climate change are being used as an excuse to create new financial, technological, even psycho-social control mechanisms. Sustainable environmental protection necessities reasonable management of natural resources and respect for fundamental laws of nature (intrinsic processes), not expensive, psychologised and monopolised technological intervention that disrupts the self-regulatory mechanisms of nature. /The very same, simple efficient accessible and affordable, principle should be applied to our medicine: Real health protection assumes reasonable consumption of organic food and respect for natural intra-body processes, and not expensive and harmful chemical (or similar artificial) interventions that can disrupt the intrinsic self-regulatory mechanisms of our body./ It is time to rethink the current approach to climate change (alarmism for exclusivity and monopolisation purpose), and architect a model that will truly serve nature conservation, not the interests of large corporations and (few related circles of influence, concentrated within the several) developed countries. We need a system that will respect intrinsic and indigenous designs, and enable sustainable development for everyone, without creating new forms of politico-economic subordination. After all, holistic and all-inclusive is a mechanism that nature itself uses when creates, preserves and enhances. Eruption, polarisation, exclusion collisions are rare occurrences when our nature is about to destruct and eliminate. Consequently, instead of fighting natural climate cycles, we should rather focus on protecting our environment from provoked encouraged and extended armed conflicts, from unjust distributions of eruptive asymmetries, from over-exploitation and over-production and to it related pollutions of all sorts velocities and spectres, while respecting the right of all peoples and generations to learn, develop and prosper. The 3M principle, as easily quantifiable SD matrix is beautiful in its simplicity: maximum good, for maximum spices (not to forget: continents, nations generations and classes too) over maxium period of time. The new Bandung of 1955 is needed today. This spirit that engaged South for the first time in history, and soon after gave a birth to the NAM (Non-Aliened Movement) could be the right answer at the right time. (Neither of the present formats fits: G-7, G-20, BRICS.) Strong and powerful block of Climate ‘alarmists’ must be faced with the New Bandung, NAM, or to say Climate ‘realists’, block of a raising yet not coherent South. Climate Change and sustainability are planetary issues that require our universal response. Instable and unjust international order, as such, is more of a problem generator than of a solution provider. Our developed world can hold its might – but Global South has its Right.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCVDYOUiYon8	2024-11-26T09:32:18-08:00	
Robert Reich: The One Big Constraint On Trump – OpEd	Will anything stop Trump? He will have control over both chambers of Congress, a tractable Supreme Court, a political base of fiercely loyal MAGAs, a media ecosystem that amplifies his lies (now including Musk’s horrific X as well as Rupert Murdoch’s reliably mendacious Fox News), and a thin majority of voters in the 2024 election. He doesn’t worry about another election because he won’t be eligible to run again (or he’ll ignore the Constitution and stay on). Of course, there are the midterm elections of 2026. But even if Democrats take back both chambers, Trump and his incipient administration are aiming to wreak so much havoc on America in the meantime that Democrats can’t remedy it. The Republican-controlled Senate starting January 3 won’t restrain Trump. Yes, Trump overreached with his pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Apparently even Senate Republicans can’t abide sex trafficking girls for drug-infested orgies, but this is a very low bar. So, as a practical matter, is anything stopping Trump? Yes, and here’s a hint of what it is: On Friday, Trump picked Scott Bessent to serve as treasury secretary. Bessent is the man Elon Musk derided only a week ago as the 'business-as-usual choice' for treasury secretary, in contrast to Howard Lutnick, who Musk said would 'actually enact change.' Musk’s view of 'change' is to blow a place up, which was what Musk did when he bought Twitter. Over the last two weeks, Musk has convinced Trump to appoint bomb-throwers Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Health and Human Services and Pete Hegseth to Defense, and to put Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget. But Bessent is the opposite of a bomb-thrower. He’s a billionaire hedge fund manager, founder of the investment firm Key Square Capital Management, and a protege of the MAGA arch-villain George Soros (he’s also gay, which the MAGA base may not like, either). Why did Trump appoint the 'business as usual' Bessent to be treasury secretary? Because the treasury secretary is the most important economic job in the U.S. government. Trump has never understood much about economics, but he knows two things: High interest rates can throttle an economy (and bring down a president’s party), and high stock prices are good (at least for Trump and his investor class). Trump doesn’t want to do anything that will cause bond traders to raise long-term interest rates out of fear of future inflation, and he wants stock traders to be so optimistic about corporate profits they raise share prices. So he has appointed a treasury secretary who will reassure the bond and stock markets. Stock and bond markets constitute the only real constraint on Trump — the only things whose power he’s afraid of. But wait. What about Trump’s plan to raise tariffs? He’s floated a blanket tariff of 10 to 20 percent on nearly all imports, 25 percent on imports from Mexico, and 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. Tariffs of this size would increase consumer prices and fuel inflation — driving interest rates upward. (The cost of tariffs are borne by American businesses and households, rather than foreign companies.) Tariffs could also invite retaliation from foreign governments and thereby dry up export markets for American-based corporations — in which case the stock market would tank. (The last time America raised tariffs on all imports — Herbert Hoover’s and Congressmen Smoot and Hawley’s Tariff Act of 1930 — the Great Depression worsened.) In short, tariffs will rattle stock and bond markets, doing the exact opposite of what Trump wants. So Trump has appointed a treasury secretary who will soothe Wall Street’s nerves — not just because Bessent is a Wall Street billionaire who speaks the Street’s language but also because the Street doesn’t really believe Bessent wants higher tariffs. Bessent has described Trump’s plan for blanket tariffs as a 'maximalist' negotiating strategy — suggesting Trump’s whole tariff proposal is a strategic bluff. The Street apparently thinks tariffs won’t rise much when other countries respond to the bluff with what Trump sees as concessions. Instead, the Street expects Bessent to be spending his energies seeking lower taxes, especially for big corporations and wealthy Americans, and helping Musk and Ramaswamy cut spending and roll back regulations. It’s a sad commentary on the state of American democracy when the main constraint on the madman soon to occupy the Oval Office is Wall Street. I suppose we should be grateful there’s any constraint at all.

Donald Trump Provides Ray Of Hope For Ending Regional Conflicts –...	During Donald Trump's recent successful Presidential election campaign , there are two points which he repeatedly stressed namely ' America first policy ' and his desire to stop the war between the countries . Obviously, his America First policy mean that he would stop the flow of illegal migrants into USA, though one cannot be sure as to whether he would be able expel the illegal migrants already present in USA. Further, Trump is likely to impose tariff on import and export of goods to protect and ensure the growth of American economy. Of course, imposition of tariffs is a double edged weapon and there is limit beyond which this cannot be done,. All said and done, no one can find fault with Trump for his America First policy, which is and which should be the country's policy of leader of every country. What concern the world more than his America First policy is that his repeated assertion that Ukraine Russia war should stop immediately . With regard to Hamas Israel war , he may not have said so in such clear term. However, he has expressed view about the need for peaceful Middle East region. This approach of Donald Trump is in refreshing contrast to the postures and policies implemented / action initiated by several earlier Presidents of USA. The world community certainly views such policy pronouncement of Donald Trump with level of seriousness, expecting that he would implement his plans, and would bite the bullet if it becomes necessary to achieve his objectives. Donald Trump's concern for world peace and to stop war in the world appears to be genuine and there is no need to doubt his intention. During his earlier term as U S President, after a few rhetorics against North Korea, Trump travelled all the way to Singapore to meet the President of North Korea to build bridge of peace with that country. This is a remarkable peace initiative, though this was not followed by his successor , resulting in the relation between North Korea and USA back to square one. As on today, there is still no clarity as to how Trump would stop the Russian Ukraine war and Israel Hamas conflict. However, some initial signs are encouraging after successful election of Trump as U S President. The President of Russia and President of Ukraine have started talking about peace possibilities discreetly , as both the countries are conscious of the fact that this war is causing enormous damage to the economy of both the countries. Now, Trump has made a statement that President of Ukraine should meet Russian President to create right climate for ending the war . Possibly, America's suspension of arms support to Ukraine would make Ukraine agree for the peace initiative and Russian President would also be in favour of peace, if American support for Ukraine would end or taper. One can be sure that Russia will not let go this opportunity to get out of this Ukraine conflict, after it has badly burnt its fingers with its initial expectation of short war with Ukraine not materialising. There is also a ray of hope of the conflict between Hamas and Israel ending, with Israel official announcing that Israel cabinet meeting would decide on approving Lebanon cease fire deal with Israel. It is said that this proposal would entail Israel military withdrawal within 60 days. It is true that only two hands can clap and the desire and compulsive need to end the conflict has to be there in the countries involved. There is a visible trend now being seen that the two hands will clap. This is certainly due to what can be called as Trump effect and the world would be grateful to Trump, if he could ensure the cessation of the ongoing wars. Rightly or wrongly , there is a broad world view that the policy and priority of USA government to interfere in the affairs of other nations is one of the chief reasons for several conflicts that have taken place in the past. Many people think that past US governments have been imagining that God has created USA to police the world. Possibly, Trump's approach to world peace would ensure that this negative image of USA amongst world community would be erased to some extent. Today, there is also a developing view across the world that China has definite greed for territorial expansion and for economically and industrially dominating the world. Trump's efforts for world peace and its success would also considerably depend on his ability to tame China and show its place. China need to end its military conflict with India , Philippines and its military posturing against Taiwan and give up its efforts to dominate weak countries by driving them into debt burden. Some discerning observers are of the view that the recent efforts of China to have sort of peace with India when Chinese President met Indian Prime Minister, could be due to Trump effect. Anyway, there is no doubt that Trump provides a ray of hope for ending regional conflicts and there is expectation that he would ensure protection for America's interests at no cost to other nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilFJB1Dgb_-Yx	2024-11-26T09:28:03-08:00	
Arrest Warrants From The Hague: The ICC, Netanyahu And Gallant – ...	The slow, often grinding machinery of international law has just received a push along with the issuing of three arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court. They are for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and, rather incongruously, Hamas figure Mohammed Deif. The last issue is somewhat odd given claims by Israel that he was killed in an airstrike in July, though Hamas has never confirmed nor denied the fate of the man also known as Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri. The issue of the warrants was the culmination of a request on May 20 by the ICC prosecutor to a Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and three senior Hamas officials. Two have been withdrawn, given the confirmed killings of both Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh. On November 21, the three-judge panel of Pre-Trial Chamber I unanimously rejected Israel’s assertion that the ICC lacked jurisdiction over the Situation in the State of Palestine in general and over Israeli nationals more specifically, 'as the Court can exercise its jurisdiction on the basis of the territorial jurisdiction of Palestine.' The Chamber also rejected Israel’s request that the Prosecution provide a new notification of an initiation of investigation into its authorities under the ICC Statute, given that the parameters of the investigation had not essentially changed. Nor had Israel pursued a request for deferral of the investigation when given the chance in 2021. The arrest warrants, issued in accordance with the law of international armed conflict, remain the most telling aspect of the determinations. Despite being classified as 'secret', the Chamber deemed it important to release some degree of detail on what they entail. Accordingly, it found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility as 'co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts'. There were also reasonable grounds to believe that both figures bore 'criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population.' The ghoulish picture of alleged conduct is sketched with chilling detail. The alleged crimes against humanity against the civilian population in Gaza were deemed to be widespread and systematic. It was reasonable to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant had, with intent and knowledge, deprived the population of Gaza of such necessities to survival as food, water, medicine, medical supplies, fuel and electricity 'from at least' October 8, 2023 to May 20, 2024. This finding was easy to reach, largely because humanitarian aid had been impeded and restricted without evident military necessity or justification under international humanitarian law. When decisions to allow or increase humanitarian aid into Gaza were made, these were conditional. The warrant for Deif, as chief commander of the military wing of Hamas (the al-Qassam Brigades) was issued because the chamber found 'reasonable grounds' to believe he had allegedly been responsible for various crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence) and traditional war crimes. It remains to be seen whether that can be executed appropriately, given the likelihood that Deif is no longer alive. International law remains a curious creature, one of mixed shape and uneven maturity. Being based on the mutual, grudging acknowledgment of conventions between countries, its success, or failure, depends on mutual observance. ICC warrants to arrest international figures have been issued with varying results, with signatory states of the Rome Statute making their own decisions whether to execute them. Political interests can rear a nasty head, blowing off legally minded types keen to see judicial proceedings pursued by member states. When an ICC warrant was issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over the alleged directing of attacks on civilians in Ukraine and the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation, the spectacle of such a figure being hauled off to The Hague was simply too much for countries keen to engage with the Kremlin. Putin, for instance, was assured by Mongolia on a state visit this year that he would not be arrested, despite the country being a party to the ICC. More caution was exercised by Putin regarding the BRICS meeting in Johannesburg in 2023, probably due to such experiences as those of former Sudanese president, Omar Al-Bashir. Despite being the subject of ICC arrest warrants in 2009 and 2010, the defiant leader, wanted for a string of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians in Darfur, tested the waters by visiting South Africa in 2015 for an African Union summit. His presence, however, interested the judicial authorities, who ordered him to stay in South Africa while consideration was given to his potential arrest. Bashir’s exit was prompt, leading to a ruling the following year by the South African Court of Appeal that the failure by the authorities to arrest him was unlawful. A Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC also found that the warrant should have been executed as part of South Africa’s obligations, and the Sudanese leader could not rightly have claimed immunity from arrest during his visit. The warrants against the Israeli figures will have some practical effects. Gallant and Netanyahu will think twice before travelling to member states of the Rome Statute, though such states will naturally reach their own decisions on the issue. But while it is hard to see these men being carted off to proceedings in The Hague bar exceptional circumstances, the warrants have provided a fillip for civil society groups in Israel. The indomitable efforts of the non-profit B’Tselem organisation called the ICC efforts 'a chance for us, Israelis, to realize what we should have understood long ago: that upholding a regime of supremacy, violence and oppression necessarily involves crimes and severe violation of human rights.' Unfortunately for the starving and dying in Gaza, the pity of war will not, at least at this time, halt before any stern judicial eye, especially one cast from an international court.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilL6kQ0Ik1MLS	2024-11-26T09:25:52-08:00	
Special Interest Subsidies Do Not Support The Diverse 8 Billion O...	When governments go into business, citizens start to suffer. When governments support laws that promote a level economic playing field for all in a free enterprise system, citizens prosper. A good example of this is the United States. Under the free enterprise system, this small coalition of little more than 13 disparate colonies grew to become the most imposing industrial power in the world in just over 100 years. Under the system we have today in which government spending picks winners and losers in the business world and hires massive amounts of people, we have amassed an unsupportable debt of more than $100,000 per person. This is beyond the personal debt that is burdening our citizens today. Yet, we still have advocates that want to transfer personal debt to national debt and further burden our posterity. This cannot end well. The poorest American is richer than most of humanity. Of the eight billion now on this planet, more than five billion are living on less than $10.00 a day, and almost half the world — over three billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day, and billions are living with little to no access to electricity. This is the benefit of dictatorships and oligarchies disguised as democratic republics controlling these disadvantaged people. The most important commodities we have today are the products and fuels made from fossil fuels that did not exist 200 years ago Oil produces raw materials for more than 6,000 products manufactured by different industries that are demanded by the 8 billion on this planet. Without oil, all of our products would cost much more. The fossil fuel industry also provides transportation fuels. Today, we have more than 50,000 merchant ships, more than 20,000 commercial aircraft and more than 50,000 military aircraft that use the fuels manufactured from crude oil. The fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of jets moving people and products, and the merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space programs, are also dependent on what can be manufactured from crude oil. Those fuels also support the 1.4 billion cars in the world and the 14 million trucks registered in the world. The second most important commodity we have today is electricity. It is the perfect commodity to control on a national level to enhance the boot of oppression on its citizens. Subsidies for continuous, uninterruptible, and dispatchable power from coal, natural gas, and nuclear are JUST for electricity, the same electricity that CANNOT exist without the products and components made from the oil derivatives manufactured from fossil fuels. Subsidies help control the production of electricity in a manner that keeps it scarce and expensive. Most electricity is produced with coal and natural gas. Natural gas is replacing coal, but, beyond that, the mix has not changed much despite the massive subsidies poured into the coffers of those willing to incorporate inefficient and expensive production of electricity in favor of the inexpensive and plentiful sources. This is reflected in the fact that coal and natural gas are producing 95% or more of the proportion of electricity they were even a decade ago. Renewable energy subsidies have driven costs for electricity to double or triple their retail costs in some countries compared to a decade ago, even though quality of air has suffered in that same time frame. Yet many advocate ridding the world of coal, natural gas, and oil no matter how much it costs people. Maybe we ought to rethink this radical and expensive transition. Remember, you the citizens pay for all government expenses, including costs of electricity production infrastructure, whether it is in taxes or direct utility bills. We all know that special interests financially support the Government decision makers, and thus the Government policies financially support the special interests with subsidies. The Press paints these subsidies as 'free money' and we seem to ignore that this money really comes from the poor people and their children. If rich people paid the taxes, they would not remain rich, so it must come from somewhere. Since subsidies come from all of us, maybe we should be careful how we use them. It turns out that most of the subsidies go to foreign businesses, many of which support the exploitation of slave labor to mine for the 'green' minerals and metals to produce the windmills, solar panels, and EV batteries as well as the infliction of environmental degradation to 'their' landscapes just to reinforce mandated EV’s, wind turbines, and solar panels in 'our backyards'! We also pay foreign companies to install them. This reality reveals the imperialistic nature of US politics which exploits the world’s poor people to fuel our desire for luxury. This is patently immoral. The 'renewables' industries would disappear without US government subsidies. Ironically, allowing free enterprise competition to supply your electricity would result in far less costs to the consumer, as it does for all products. In fact, nuclear power is the cheapest and least imposing way to produce electricity when all subsidies are eliminated. This was proven in the 1960s and 1970s throughout the world. Today, China leads the world in the production of new nuclear power plants. Are they seeing something the rest of the world is not? How do countries justify personal power and control of their citizens through a subsidy process that takes money from their people to produce an inferior product and increase their daily expenses? Since the US has taken the lead in all technological advancements during the industrial revolution started in the mid-to-late 1800s, it makes sense that we lead the rest of the world into production of cheap, clean energy using nuclear power. One way to do that would be to petition individual state Governors to show the Federal government how it is done. Compete the production and delivery of electricity like our citizens demanded of the long-distance phone call business. After all, how better would your life be with competitive one cent per kWh electricity over the possibility of one dollar per kWh electricity that data centers would bid for electricity if production stayed the same while their demands soared? When people know the possibilities, the transition to nuclear power will happen quickly. Transition should happen without the elimination of cheap production of electricity through natural gas and coal until the market drives the transition to nuclear power. Imagine the massive increase in quality of life around the world with easily affordable electricity delivered to every household. If the US will not take the lead with a 'New Nuclear Posture for a Hungry world' that is fully supported by Oliver Stone’s 105-minute movie 'NUCLEAR NOW', our adversaries will.

On Rawalpindi’s Imminent Military Campaign In Balochistan – OpEd	When Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong publicly declared that its citizens being 'attacked twice in only six months,' was 'unacceptable,' Pakistan’s Foreign Office reacted by calling this statement 'perplexing.' However, it was abundantly clear that Islamabad had sensed the full import of this not-so-discreet warning from its ‘iron brother.' So, Islamabad’s recent announcement regarding a 'comprehensive military operation against terrorist organisations operating in Balochistan,' comes as no big surprise. There’s no doubt that terrorism needs to be dealt with firmly. However, it's equally important that troops involved in counter-terrorist operations don’t go overboard and act with hatred or vengeance because those who have picked up guns against the state are the soldiers’ countrymen. That’s why professional armies the world have evolved a code of conduct for their rank and file, and soldiers are psychologically conditioned to discharge their duties impartially and without prejudice. The human rights record of the Pakistan army and other security forces under its command however doesn’t quite measure up to expected standards and the reason for this serious shortcoming isn’t too hard to find. Instead of sensitising its rank and file on this issue, the army hierarchy in Pakistan has instead encouraged creation of an environment that encourages animosity towards their countrymen who have for ideological, political or other reasons picked up the gun. To further motivate its soldiers, Rawalpindi has even fallen back on Islamic history. In an attempt to downplay popularity of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan [TTP] terrorist group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir has given it the moniker 'Fitna al-Khawarij,' a name drawn from an early Muslim group that broke away from mainstream Islam. The idea of portraying TTP as a terrorist group that misuses religion to justify the violence it perpetuates and champions objectives that are un-Islamic is laudable. Whereas such a depiction can well arouse religious emotions amongst soldiers and make them feel that they are not professional soldiers but ‘Ghazis’ [defenders of the Faith] and thus sanctify excesses against these so-called ‘enemies of Islam’. Similarly, using the phrase 'sent to Hell' while referring to terrorists killed is in bad taste for many reasons, especially when it comes from an army that prides itself for professionalism and military ethics. First, it’s not humans but our creator who decides the final destination of the deceased and so, the pompous declaration that someone has been ‘sent to Hell’, smacks of arrogance and borders on sacrilege. Secondly, it is universally expected that death should have a very sobering effect on the living and so, even though we may harbour intense hostility towards someone, but once he’s no more, to brag about having sent him to Hell is something that’s downright pathetic! Human Rights Watch [HRW] 2011 report contains an interesting revelation that clearly reveals the sordid side of Pakistan army’s counter-terrorism campaigns. Bashir Azeem, the 76-year old secretary general of Baloch Republican Party [BRP] told HRW investigators that during his 'unacknowledged detention' in 2010, a Pakistani official had told him that 'Even if the president or chief justice tells us to release you, we won’t. We can torture you, or kill you, or keep you for years at our will. It is only the Army chief and the [ISI] chief that we obey.' [Emphasis added]. Even though HRW is a reputed global human rights watch dog and has no axe to grind with Pakistan yet Rawalpindi will undoubtedly rubbish the God-fearing septuagenarian BRP general secretary’s testimony ibid, so purely for the sake of discussion let’s give Pakistan army the benefit of doubt and take its denial at face value. However, will Rawalpindi care to explain what exactly its media chief implied in 2019 when while replying a question on enforced disappearances in Balochistan by saying, 'We don’t want anyone to be missing, but war is ruthless-everything is fair in love and war'? [Emphasis added]. It’s not only rights groups and activists who are critical of the cavalier ways of the Pakistan army and its utter disregard for human right violations in Balochistan as facts speak for themselves. If enforced disappearances in Balochistan are merely a myth [as Rawalpindi maintains], then what impelled Baloch women who traditionally remained within the four walls of their houses to come out and undertake a 1,800 kilometer long March from Turbat near the Iran border to the Pakistani capital followed by a sit-in in peak winter? Defence of Human Rights Pakistan [DHRP] is an independent organisation working for release of illegally detained Pakistani citizens headed by Amina Janjua, a half-widow whose husband was forcibly disappeared in 2005. When all efforts to trace him proved futile, instead of approaching the police or judiciary, Ms Janjua ultimately sought the help of Pakistan army’s media chief in 2019. If the Pakistan army isn’t complicit in orchestrating enforced disappearances in Balochistan, then why did the knowledgeable DHRP chairperson choose to specifically approach a Pakistan army General for help? Pakistan army’s impending campaign in Balochistan will be a bloody one. While on the one hand Baloch fighters are a determined lot and will fight till the end, the Pakistan army on the other hand will use every ground based and aerial weapon platform at its disposal to pulverise what it believes are terrorist hideouts. Since it’s not accountable to anyone, Rawalpindi will not hesitate in targeting areas inhabited by innocent civilians. Furthermore, imposition of media censorship purportedly for ‘operational reasons’ will ensure that [like always] news of atrocities committed by the Pakistan army remain unreported. How will things pan out in Balochistan once the military campaign commences isn’t very difficult to prognose. Pakistan army will definitely suffer casualties and in order to keep up its own image as well as assuage public anger it will have to produce dead bodies of the attackers, ensuring that they exceed the number of soldiers killed. Rawalpindi is also under severe pressure to do something that would placate Beijing, which is enraged by attacks on Chinese citizens by Baloch fighters. The Pakistan army knows that the easiest way to do this is to create the illusion of having decisively crushed the Baloch separatist movement by producing a surfeit of body bags containing mortal remains of sarmachars [Baloch insurgents] as evidence thereof. The only problem is that abducting innocent Baloch youth, murdering them in cold blood and then presenting them as Baloch fighters could lead to widespread public unrest but with years of experience, Rawalpindi has already worked out an alternative. More than 2,500 Baloch men have been forcibly disappeared by the Pakistan army and its intelligence agencies and even we assume that 50 percentage have been secretly murdered, there are still enough Baloch people lodged in secret jails to cater for the requisite number of corpses to cool down Beijing’s frayed temper and public outrage would be an easy job. As such, resorting to rampant abductions and producing their corpses for 'pushing up' the number of casualties inflicted by the army won't be necessary. Though repugnant, this endeavour is a win-win situation for the Pakistan army because dead men tell no tales! Postscript: Excesses committed by the Pakistan army against the Baloch people would even make the most stone-hearted squirm with horror and revulsion. In an undated video that definitely predates his short lived honeymoon with Rawalpindi, PTI chief Imran Khan can be heard saying, 'Our army [is] bombing people in Balochistan,how can we bomb our own people, is there any army [there that] you are bombing? It is our own people with their children, but it is important to understand are we just bombing our people, just think about the sin of bombing villages with the women and children…You are talking about six million people in the tribal areas that are being bombed, their economy has been shattered, they are living in refugee camps, how are they sustaining, and what about the extra-judicial killing that is going on'? [Emphasis added]. This is unfortunately the raw reality of Pakistan army military campaigns in Balochistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCRsehwduQ-7	2024-11-26T09:20:57-08:00	
The Israel-Lebanon Conflict: Urgent Global Intervention Needed – ...	Recent hostilities between Israel and Lebanon have escalated into a deadly crisis, capturing the world’s attention and raising urgent calls for international accountability. As Israeli airstrikes devastate parts of Lebanon and Hezbollah retaliates with relentless aggression, the death toll has surged past 492, with no end in sight. This conflict, steeped in historical grievances and geopolitical rivalry, demands immediate action to avert further humanitarian and regional catastrophe. The roots of this clash are deeply entrenched in decades of animosity between Israel and Hezbollah. Over time, Lebanon has become a proxy battleground, where regional and international powers pursue their agendas at the expense of innocent civilians. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, represents a persistent threat in Israel’s eyes, and sporadic clashes have now exploded into a full-scale confrontation. This dispute transcends territorial disagreements; it reflects a broader struggle for dominance and ideological survival in a volatile region. Regional dynamics have played a critical role in fueling the violence. Hezbollah’s influence, viewed as an extension of Tehran’s power, remains a source of concern for Israel and its Western allies. At the same time, Lebanon’s political and economic fragility has left its government powerless to manage Hezbollah’s actions or shield its people from Israeli strikes. Calls for restraint by influential actors like Saudi Arabia and Egypt are complicated by their own alliances and strategic interests, further undermining efforts for resolution. On the global stage, the response to this crisis has been tepid and insufficient. While the United Nations and prominent leaders have voiced concern and urged de-escalation, there has been little concrete action. Diplomatic efforts in the past have often failed to bring about lasting peace, and the current situation underscores the urgency for meaningful global intervention. Powers such as the United States and Russia, both deeply invested in the region, must set aside military interests to prioritize peace-building and stability. The toll on civilians has been devastating. Lebanese families, already grappling with economic hardships, now face relentless bombardment and widespread destruction. Essential infrastructure, from hospitals to schools, has been crippled. Meanwhile, Israelis endure the constant fear of Hezbollah’s rocket fire. The human cost of this conflict is immense, and immediate humanitarian aid is crucial to support those caught in the crossfire. Relief agencies must be empowered to provide food, shelter, and medical assistance to affected communities on both sides of the border. Despite growing calls for a ceasefire, the cycle of violence persists. Israeli leaders have vowed to continue their military campaign until Hezbollah’s capabilities are neutralized, while Hezbollah, emboldened by regional backing, frames itself as a defender of Lebanese sovereignty and Palestinian rights. This unrelenting exchange of hostilities threatens not only regional stability but also the prospects for lasting peace in the Middle East. The principles of international law and human rights provide a critical lens through which to examine this conflict. Israel’s actions, justified as self-defense, must still comply with humanitarian laws that prohibit disproportionate force and mandate the protection of civilians. At the same time, Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket attacks targeting Israeli non-combatants constitute clear violations of international norms. Both sides must be held accountable for their actions to prevent further erosion of the rule of law. A sustainable solution to this conflict requires robust diplomatic engagement. While past negotiations have failed due to political entanglements and external interference, the need for a multilateral approach has never been more pressing. Regional stakeholders, along with international organizations, must facilitate dialogue that addresses core issues of security, sovereignty, and territorial rights. The 2006 UN-brokered ceasefire offers a framework, but it must be strengthened with mechanisms for enforcement and sustained commitment to peace. The Arab world, too, bears a shared responsibility in resolving this crisis. A unified and proactive approach by Middle Eastern nations is essential to curb further bloodshed and instability. The normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states through the Abraham Accords presents both opportunities and challenges. While these agreements signify a shift in regional dynamics, they must not detract from addressing the underlying grievances fueling the Israel-Lebanon conflict. The international community must also recognize the broader implications of inaction. This conflict serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of peace in a region riddled with historical rivalries and unresolved disputes. Without immediate and decisive action, the suffering of civilians will intensify, and the potential for regional escalation will grow. In conclusion, the unfolding crisis between Israel and Lebanon underscores the need for urgent global intervention. Diplomatic rhetoric must translate into tangible actions that prioritize human lives and uphold international law. The world cannot afford to stand idle while the cycle of violence continues to claim innocent lives. It is only through restraint, humanitarian support, and a commitment to long-term peace that the region can hope for a stable and secure future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilBXImImev-nK	2024-11-26T09:19:14-08:00	
Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – Analysis	By Jennifer DiMascio Background The U.S. Army is developing the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) to serve as a next-generation aircraft for vertical lift, air assault, maritime interdiction, aeromedical evacuation, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, and tactical resupply. The Army intends for FLRAA to eventually replace the Sikorsky UH- 60 Black Hawk medium-utility helicopter, which was designed more than 50 years ago. Army Futures Command Commanding General James E. Rainey testified that the Army needs FLRAA to have the ability to fly twice as far and twice as fast as previous rotorcraft, a capability he called essential for operations in the Pacific region. The Army is under contract with Textron Bell to build a FLRAA prototype of its V-280 demonstrator aircraft. The Administration has asked Congress for $1.26 billion for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025 (see Table 1). UH-60 Black Hawk The Army plans to begin operating FLRAA in the 2030s and, in the meantime, continue to purchase Black Hawk helicopters. According to Army budget documents, the UH- 60M is 'the Army’s utility helicopter for the near and midterm force,' supporting maneuver commanders in airassault, general support command and control, and aeromedical evacuation. The Administration’s FY2025 budget request proposes continuing the purchase of 24 Black Hawks annually under a five-year contract that began in 2022 and ends in 2026. The service may also follow through on another multiyear proposal to purchase up to 255 UH-60s from FY2027 to FY2031. The Black Hawk is operated by at least 35 governments. Future Vertical Lift FLRAA is one component of the Army’s plan—launched in 2009—to modernize its aviation assets. That Army effort, called Future Vertical Lift (FVL), focused on replacing Cold War-era aircraft with rotorcraft that could fly more supplies, faster, for longer distances, more reliably, and with less logistical support. That plan took on even greater relevance as the U.S. military turned its attention to potential conflict with China and Russia, which have advanced air defenses that would force the United States to operate at longer ranges. Under FVL, the Army had intended to develop FLRAA, a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and two new Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) programs. The Army proposed canceling FARA in its FY2025 budget request. The Army plans for FLRAA’s and FVL’s UASprograms to continue. (See CRS In Focus IF12592, Army Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Program Proposed Cancellation: Background and Issues for Congress, by Jennifer DiMascio.) To achieve 'transformational increases in speed, range, and maneuverability,' the Army is seeking FLRAA, an aircraft that would cruise at speeds of up to 280 knots—compared with the Black Hawk’s cruising speed of 151 knots. The Army states FLRAA should fly with up to 12 passengers for at least 1,700 nautical miles (nm) without refueling. FLRAA should be able to fly at altitudes of 6,000 ft., and up to 95-degree heat. In 2014, the Army awarded initial contracts to Bell and a Sikorsky-Boeing team, marking the start of a FLRAA competition. Each team produced a demonstrator, from which the Army could select a vendor that would produce an eventual prototype aircraft. Bell developed a V-280 Valor demonstrator, which flew for the first time in December 2017. Sikorsky and Boeing built the SB-1 Defiant X demonstrator, a compound helicopter that uses twin coaxial rotors for lift and a pusher propeller to generate speed. The Defiant flew for the first time in March 2019. In 2022, the Army awarded a $1.3 billion contract to Bell Textron to deliver by 2025 a digital FLRAA prototype based on the firm’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor aircraft. Sikorsky challenged the contract award, but the Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld the Army’s decision, citing Sikorsky’s failure to adequately address a requirement for a modular open system architecture (MOSA) that would allow for faster, easier software upgrades. Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2017 and 2021 (P.L. 114-328 §805 and P.L. 116- 283 §804) required major defense acquisition programs to adopt a MOSA approach. Bell V-280 The V-280 uses a tiltrotor design. Tiltrotors can take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then tilt their rotor blades forward to fly like an airplane. The U.S. Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force operate another tiltrotor aircraft, the V-22 Osprey. Bell chose a more conventional design for the V-280 compared with the V-22, according to an industry official. For example, the clutch design on the V-280 is simpler, and the V-280 has a straight wing, which eliminates the need for the kind of mid-wing gearbox that exists on the V-22. Bell has teamed with Rolls-Royce on a propulsion system for the V-280: two Rolls-Royce AE1107F turboshafts, the same engine as the V-22. Other FLRAA subcontractors include Spirit AeroSystems (composite fuselage); Safran (landing gear); Moog (flight-control computers and other components); GE Aerospace (common open architecture, digital backbone, voice and data recorder, and health awareness system); and Astronics Corporation Electrical (power and distribution system). Program Status The Army says its FY2025 budget request would fund activities for FLRAA engineering and management and development. Among other things, the funds would continue development of a digital backbone with an underlying structure that meets the Army’s MOSA objectives. As stated above, the Army prioritized an open system approach to the FLRAA program to ease future sustainment, facilitate software upgrades, and connect more easily with other sensors and weapons. In May 2024, the Army designated FLRAA as a 'pathfinder program,' one that would set an example for how to implement digital engineering to achieve those goals. U.S. Special Operations Command has reportedly contributed to design discussions and requested the FLRAA include space on the aircraft to house a specialized radar in the nose, add hardware for a refueling probe, and other modifications. On August 2, 2024, the Army announced that FLRAA had entered the Milestone B engineering and manufacturing development phase, following a successful preliminary design review in April and an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council meeting in June. The service said the Milestone B decision allowed the Army to exercise the first of nine contract options, including the detailed design and build of six prototype aircraft. The first FLRAA prototype flight is planned for 2026. Low-rate initial production would then follow in 2028, with initial fielding of aircraft planned for 2030. FLRAA Funding The House-passed version of the FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the FY2025 NDAA, and versions of the FY2025 Defense Appropriations Act passed by the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommend fully funding the Administration’s request for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025. Considerations for Congress Oversight by Congress may include the following: Army officials have stated that future attack aircraft should be flown without humans in the cockpit. Other industry officials say that human pilots will always have a role on the battlefield. Members of Congress could conduct hearings or discussions about the need for human pilots, which could affect the future of the FLRAA program. Congress may continue oversight of experimental efforts for FLRAA to work with other platforms, including Air-Launched Effects. ALE could be a swarm of small UAS that could provide surveillance, target tracking, jamming, or communications to expand the FVL’s ability to operate in contested environments. The Army is continuing to manufacture UH-60 Black Hawks for its own use and use by foreign governments. Members of Congress may consider the feasibility and budgetary implications of modernizing the Black Hawk alongside the creation of the new FLRAA platform. Some Members have expressed concern about the choice of a tiltrotor aircraft, pointing to recent fatal accidents involving V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee in S.Rept. 118-204 'encourages' Army officials in charge of aviation to collaborate with Navy officials on lessons learned about development and operation of tiltrotor aircraft that might be applied to the FLRAA. Congress may examine whether or not that has taken place and what resulted. Congress also may consider oversight of whether FLRAA meets the Navy’s needs for a Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike platform.

Tajikistan’s Afghan Conundrum – Analysis	By Bruce Pannier (FPRI) -- Tajikistan’s policies toward neighboring Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are reaching a pivotal moment. Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and his government have always viewed the Taliban as a threat, and that position has not changed since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. However, there is a bigger threat to Tajikistan growing in Afghanistan, and it might take cooperation with the Taliban to neutralize it. Additionally, the other Central Asian countries and China, Iran, and Russia are engaging with the Taliban government. Tajikistan risks missing out on opportunities that these countries are opening in Afghanistan. Following the lead of these countries presents Tajikistan with a different set of problems. Tajik authorities have been warning the country’s people and the international community about the Taliban threat for nearly 30 years. Tajikistan’s rigid stance against the Taliban government has brought Rahmon’s government support from Tajikistan’s people and other countries. Making peace with the Taliban will be difficult to explain to Tajik citizens. It will also remove one of the greatest incentives for foreign governments to continue decades of generous financial and security support for Rahmon’s government. Enemies from the Start President Rahmon is unique among the current leaders of countries bordering Afghanistan. He is the only leader who was in power when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, all the Central Asian presidents, except the Turkmen president, viewed the Taliban as a threat and shunned any contact with them. Rahmon’s government and the government of Uzbekistan’s then-President Islam Karimov aided ethnic Tajik and Uzbek groups fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. The potential danger from the Taliban was acutely felt in Tajikistan where there was civil war from 1992 to 1997. The Rahmon government’s battlefield opponent was the United Tajik Opposition, a coalition of groups in which the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) was the backbone. In the early years after the Taliban appeared, most people knew little about the group except that they were Islamic extremists. Rahmon had reason to be one of the strongest critics of the Taliban. Other governments alarmed at the Taliban’s advance through Afghanistan also saw that Tajikistan, the poorest Central Asian country emerging from a five-year civil war, needed assistance to ensure the Taliban could not find a foothold or sympathizers inside Tajikistan. The Taliban and other militant groups continued operating in northern Afghanistan after foreign forces entered the country. Tajikistan became a frontline in the war on terror, and Rahmon realized that warning about threats from Afghanistan prompted countries and organizations to send additional finances and security assistance. His continued opposition to the Taliban after August 2021 earned Rahmon invitations to visit the European Parliament and France in October 2021. A Safer Border Tajikistan’s government is slowly opening ties with the Taliban. The first reported contact occurred after militants from the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) launched several rockets from northern Afghanistan into Tajikistan on May 7, 2022. Former Tajik security officer Samariddin Chuyanzoda traveled to Kabul on May 14 to meet with Taliban representatives. The Taliban were facing sporadic attacks from ISK before foreign troops departed Afghanistan, and those attacks continue to this day. The Taliban claim that, among the ISK militants they have killed or captured in the last three years, some are citizens of Tajikistan. Just weeks before Chuyanzoda made his trip to Kabul, ISK increased its recruiting propaganda in the Tajik language, targeting Tajiks in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. There are also the militants of Jamaat Ansarullah, a terrorist group originating in Tajikistan that allied themselves with the Taliban during the final years foreign forces were in Afghanistan. During the first months after the Taliban’s recapture of Afghanistan when the Tajik government and Taliban were exchanging threats, the Taliban stationed Jamaat Ansarullah militants, freshly armed with US weapons seized by the Taliban when they took control of Afghanistan. According to reports in February 2024, Tajik and Taliban officials met at the request of Tajikistan toward the end of 2023 to discuss what to do with the Jamaat Ansarullah fighters. Tajik authorities reportedly wanted the Jamaat Ansarullah militants extradited to Tajikistan. The Taliban instead offered to act as a mediator in negotiations between the two groups. Jamaat Ansarullah’s leadership said they would only talk if the Tajik government met several unreasonable—for Tajik authorities—conditions including declaring Tajikistan an Islamic state and removing Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan. However, contact between Tajik and the Taliban had been established. As recently as August 2024, Saimumin Yatimov, the leader of Tajikistan’s security service, visited Kabul to reportedly discuss strengthening ties between Tajikistan and the Taliban. Aside from militants, Tajikistan risks being left out of trade routes through Afghanistan that are being planned or already slowly opening. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have all been working with Taliban officials to improve connectivity between Central Asia and Afghanistan and hopefully extend proposed trade routes to Iran and the Arabian Sea. Among these projects are the Trans-Afghan railway connecting Uzbekistan (and through Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries) to Pakistan, a railway from Kazakhstan through Turkmenistan and on to Herat, Afghanistan with spurs to Iran or continuing through Afghanistan to Kandahar and Spin Boldak on the Pakistani border. Another proposed railway is the 250-mile Tajikistan–Afghanistan–Turkmenistan (TAT) line. That project dates back more than a decade. However, in August 2024, Tajikistan’s Transport Ministry signed a protocol with the Korea International Cooperation Agency for a feasibility study for the 30-mile Tajik section of the railway. Tajik Transport Minister Azim Ibrohim said the line would connect Tajikistan to markets in South Asia, and acting South Korean Ambassador to Tajikistan Jeon Sung-sik said the railway would 'enable Tajikistan to access maritime routes and become a crucial link in international transportation.' China has shown interest in this route also as part of a multimodal trade route that passes through eastern Tajikistan to the Chinese border by road. Tajikistan has continued to export electricity to Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power. The power transmission lines were built during the years foreign troops were in Afghanistan and in the months after the Taliban seized control, Tajikistan’s electricity shipments to Afghanistan were one of the only links preserved with Tajikistan’s southern neighbor. The Taliban said early on that they would pay for the electricity, and they have kept their word. In February 2024, the World Bank announced construction of the Central Asia–South Asia (CASA-1000) power line had resumed. CASA-1000 aims to use hydropower plants in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to bring one thousand megawatts (MW) of electricity to Pakistan and 300 MW to Afghanistan. The Trade-Off Afghanistan has been a constant source of concern since Tajikistan became independent in 1991. For Tajikistan, an amicable understanding with the Taliban represents an unprecedented sense of security plus economic and trade opportunities. There are complications, however. Rahmon has repeatedly called the Taliban a threat to the security of Tajikistan and Central Asia more broadly for 30 years. Rahmon has mentioned the plight of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power and called for an inclusive government. Those remarks have earned Rahmon some rare widespread public support in Tajikistan. How would Rahmon explain to his people that the Taliban can be a partner to Tajikistan? Underscoring the sensitivity of this problem, Rahmon banned the IRPT saying they were a terrorist group. Before being banned, the IRPT was the second largest political party in Tajikistan, behind Rahmon’s People’s Democratic Party of Tajikistan. The 1997 Tajik Peace Accord appointed IRPT representatives to government positions. Until 2015, the IRPT had deputies in the lower house of the Tajik parliament. The IRPT is far more moderate than the ultra-Orthodox Taliban whose brutal rule of the late 1990s has carried over into the current regime. So how can the IRPT be such a threat? And how can the Taliban be a party with which Tajik authorities can associate? More importantly, the Tajik government has profited greatly from being a neighbor to unstable and menacing Afghanistan. Tajikistan has always been donor dependent and has received generous help largely because it has been a frontline against Islamic radicalism coming out of Afghanistan. Social programs, education, water purification, energy projects, and more have been funded by international organizations and individual countries. Part of the reason for this aid was to improve the socioeconomic situation in Tajikistan and strengthen the resolve of the country’s people against the lure of groups such as the Taliban or ISK. Security cooperation is probably the key benefit Tajikistan has received. On September 1, 2021, the US Embassy in Tajikistan posted on its website that a US-funded project had just launched to build new facilities for a Tajik border guard unit stationed along the Afghan frontier. The statement said some of the new additions 'will allow the Border Patrol to quickly deploy forces to border areas in response to threats.' The statement noted that, since 2002, the US government spent more than $300 million to repair or reconstruct 12 border posts, nine border crossings, and three training centers for border guards. The US has also provided nonlethal aid to Tajikistan’s border guards including border surveillance, night-vision equipment, jeeps, quadbikes, and sniffer dogs. The European Union as a body and individual countries within the EU, NATO, Russia, China, and other parties have also provided military equipment and uniforms and built facilities for border forces. Conclusion If the Tajik government and Taliban can reach a durable truce and establish some form of cooperation, the threat level for Tajikistan diminishes. The concerns of foreign governments and organizations for Tajikistan’s security also subside. Peace with the Taliban could significantly reduce the amount of foreign financial and security assistance Tajikistan has become accustomed to seeing. In an odd contradiction, instability in Afghanistan has been good for Rahmon’s government. However, harsh stability in Afghanistan imposed by the Taliban could halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that has been propping up the Tajik government for three decades.

G20 Economies Should Target Reforms To Boost Medium-Term Growth P...	For most Group of Twenty economies, growth is poised to weaken over the next five years and remain well below what was typical in the two decades before the pandemic. That’s one of the biggest shared challenges for the group, which accounts for about 85 percent of global gross domestic product. Growth is more robust across the African Union, which joined the G20 last year, but booming populations mean those economies also must create jobs for millions of young people entering the labor market. For both groups, as well as the European Union, lifting growth is essential to improving outcomes for people, and there's a common solution: implementing priority reforms can significantly boost prospects for growth over the next five years, or medium term, as our new report to the G20 outlines. Our analysis also indicates that payoffs from structural reforms are greatest when they are carefully sequenced and reflect social consensus. Various challenges underscore why it’s time to invest in growth-enhancing reforms. Subdued productivity growth, reinforced in some countries by adverse demographic trends, holds back potential growth, as Chapter 3 of the April 2024 World Economic Outlook details. Sustainable growth also is imperiled by elevated public debt, and increased geoeconomic fragmentation and protectionism. As the Chart of the Week shows, the biggest priority across countries in these groups is reforming fiscal policy frameworks to aid lasting consolidation of government budgets. Specifically, most G20 advanced economies and several EU economies would benefit from tighter public spending limits, while for most G20 emerging market and developing economies reforms to boost government revenues should be prioritized. Several African Union countries could benefit from enhanced fiscal transparency. For many G20 and African Union economies, there are two other key areas for high priority structural reforms. First, the quality of education and skill training must be improved to better match skills with job opportunities. Second, reforms to accelerate the energy transition are essential, such as improving renewable energy capacity, enhancing the carbon tax efficacy, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. In several African Union economies, governance reforms are also urgently needed to strengthen the rule of law, fight corruption and improve public finance management.

Manila Takes A Bold Stance On The South China Sea – Analysis	By Edcel John A Ibarra The Philippines’ new ‘unyielding’ foreign policy on the South China Sea seems to be unsettling ASEAN. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has launched a transparency initiative that exposes China’s illegal aggression in the South China Sea. The Philippines has also strengthened its defence cooperation with the United States and allied countries and has begun exploring military agreements with new partners. Altogether, these moves are viewed as undermining ASEAN neutrality and non-alignment. While similar criticisms may be levelled against other ASEAN members, ASEAN remains neutral and non-aligned despite the Philippines’ policy shift. ASEAN is known for not choosing sides among the great powers, but this is not because each member adheres strictly to neutrality and non-alignment. Some members are known to have chosen sides because of geographic, historical or economic factors. These diverse national-level stances contribute to ASEAN’s overarching neutrality and non-alignment. If ASEAN imposed neutrality and non-alignment to all members, it would contravene its core norm of non-interference and cause internal disagreements. Given that no ASEAN member has been strictly neutral and non-aligned, the terms are also nebulous. On the South China Sea issue, ASEAN countries are binding themselves to strict interpretations. Legal and historical definitions of neutrality and non-alignment do not prevent ASEAN from speaking out against China’s maritime assertiveness. Under the Law of Neutrality, states do not lose their neutral status when they verbally condemn a belligerent state, as long as they do not materially assist the other side. Similarly, under the Bandung Principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, states are justified in calling out aggression against their territorial integrity. Neutrality and non-alignment are compatible with taking a principled stance, but ASEAN still often settles for watered-down language or silence. Since ASEAN is known to be pragmatic rather than principled, the Philippines is fulfilling a function that no other member would dare—enforcing the norm of a rules-based maritime order. The Philippines’ transparency initiative and its public rebukes of China’s aggression work towards this goal. While these strategies are seen as increasing tensions, if the Philippines remains silent on the South China Sea, the rules-based maritime order it seeks would be endangered. Public rebukes against China help Filipinos internalise the norm, making it politically costly for future Philippine administrations to ignore it. Rebukes also help during norm cascades. Ridicule and constant reminders of a norm’s parameters should make deviations less likely in the long term, if not by China, then at least by other states. If this function were left to the United States or a Western power, rivalry with China would intensify, making it important that rebukes come from the region. The Philippines’ decision to re-embrace the United States must be understood against the backdrop of China’s maritime assertiveness and ASEAN’s unwillingness to stand up against it. A different policy might have emerged from Manila if China had tempered its aggression and ASEAN offered stronger support. Early in his presidency, Marcos sought to continue his predecessor’s friendliness toward China. But China’s aggression has made this policy untenable. Without a long-overdue ASEAN–China code of conduct in the South China Sea, future Philippine presidents will find themselves defending the Philippines’ maritime rights as affirmed by the arbitration award. Though often forgetten now, the Philippines’ policy U-turn began during the last two years of president Rodrigo Duterte’s leadership. Duterte had to deal with increasing incidents with China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in the retraction of the cancellation of a key military agreement with Washington, keeping the alliance alive. The Philippines’ re-embrace of the United States is not external interference. In the South China Sea, the United States is not an external party. While it is not a claimant of territorial or maritime space, it is a claimaint of maritime rights. Insofar as China’s actions threaten these universal maritime rights, Washington and the rest of the world are dispuntants in the South China Sea. Policymakers in Manila believe that some form of military balance is needed but because the country’s armed forces are weak and ASEAN will not commit to a common defence posture, the remaining option is to make the most of the Philippines’ longstanding alliance with the United States. Some fear that this risks turning the South China Sea into a militarised zone—but even without the United States, it already is. The Philippines is not relying solely on the United States. It has been courting new strategic partners since 2010, a policy which Marcos has continued. The Philippines has three other strategic partners—Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Like other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines is hedging, but only with states that share its principles. If ASEAN feels unsettled by the Philippines’ recent actions, it has itself to blame. As the region navigates the US–China rivalry, the diversity of responses emerging from within ASEAN will prove beneficial. Rather than equating this diversity with disunity, it may be better interpreted through the logic of pluralism—instead of seeking unity for unity’s sake, each country should be free to contribute to order-building in ASEAN as they see fit.

Who Is Calin Georgescu, The Far-Right Winner Of Romania’s Preside...	By Tony Wesolowsky and RFE/RL's Romanian Service (RFE/RL) -- Experts had tipped a far-right candidate as one of the favorites in Romania's presidential election, predicting a runoff with an established politician in a poll monitored closely as a barometer of populism in Europe and eroding public support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. The experts were right and wrong. Yes, a far-right candidate will go to Romania's presidential runoff on December 8. But it wasn't the one they and polls were predicting. Calin Georgescu, an independent who barely registered in pre-election polling, not only did better than expected: The 62-year-old agricultural engineer won the November 24 first round with about 22 percent of the vote. The race for second place turned into a drama of its own. The leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was in a tight race with Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union, a pro-Western liberal. With 99.9 percent of the vote counted, it was Lasconi, an ardent backer of Romania's membership in NATO and the EU as well as a vocal supporter of Ukraine, who emerged as the second-place finisher. Disappointment With Liberal Incumbent Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and NATO member country. The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy, and judicial appointments. Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on December 1 that will determine the country's next government and prime minister. The outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, ends his second term after a decade in office. For many voters, he and his ruling National Liberal Party have been a disappointment, with Iohannis widely criticized for his figurative absence during crucial events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Voter concerns included corruption, inflation, and the state of the health and education sectors. Another issue was the conflict in neighboring Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to President-elect Donald Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment, including a Patriot missile defense system, but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Surprise Win But it was Georgescu's surprise showing that grabbed headlines. Ahead of the vote, experts were focused on a different far-right figure. Opinion polls showed that George Simion, leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), was in second or even first place. Analysts had expected Simion, a vocal supporter of Trump, to face Ciolacu in the second round. Simion has campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighboring Ukraine. Georgescu was also a prominent member of AUR, which had picked him as their choice for prime minister. But he left the party in 2022 amid criticism from senior AUR leaders that his pro-Russian, anti-NATO stance was detrimental to the party's image. In a 2021 interview, he called NATO's ballistic missile defense shield in Deveselu, southern Romania, a 'shame of diplomacy,' claiming the military alliance would not defend any of its members in case of a Russian attack. He has also said Ion Antonescu, Romania's de facto World War II leader who was sentenced to death for his part in Romania's Holocaust, and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the pre-World War II leader of the Iron Guard -- one of Europe's most violent anti-Semitic movements -- were national heroes. Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's Environment Ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. TikTok Campaign Like other fringe politicians, Georgescu is savvy with social media. His TikTok account had 1.6 million likes. On it, he has posted videos of himself attending church, doing judo, running on a track, and speaking on podcasts. Just days before the vote, Georgescu launched a TikTok campaign calling for an end to aid for Ukraine, apparently striking a chord with voters. He has also sounded a skeptical note on Romania's NATO membership. His anti-Western messaging is routinely amplified on Russian, state-run media and Kremlin-friendly social media. After casting his ballot, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted 'for the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.... The vote is a prayer for the nation.' His other stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production. Simion said he congratulated Georgescu and that he was 'very happy that approximately 40 percent of the votes of Romanians went toward the sovereign option' and that he would be in the second round. The runoff vote on December 8 will offer a stark choice between Georgescu and Lasconi, who among the leading candidates was the most bullish on Romania's membership in the EU and NATO, even calling for a greater NATO presence in Romania. Lasconi was also the only leading candidate to reject Ukraine making territorial concessions to secure peace.

Could An Increase In The Supply Of Gold Cause A Boom-Bust Cycle? ...	By Frank Shostak According to the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), the artificial increase in the money supply via central bank expansionary monetary policy lowers the market interest rate. This, in turn, causes the market interest rate to deviate from the natural rate, determined by the market. Consequently, this leads to the boom-bust cycle. Understanding this, on the gold standard, where money is gold and—assuming that there is no central bank—an increase in the supply of gold will also result in the lowering of the market interest rates. This would cause a deviation of the market interest rates from the previous interest rate. Consequently, this is going to set in motion a boom-bust cycle. This means that even on the gold standard, without the central bank, we could still have boom-bust cycles. According to Murphy, 'The unsustainable boom occurs when a newly created (or mined) quantity of money enters the loan market and distorts interest rates, before other prices in the economy have had time to adjust. In principle, this process could occur even in the case of commodity money with 100 percent reserve banking.' Note again, according to Murphy, the increase in the supply of gold also could set the boom-bust cycle in motion, though Mises believed, in practice, this theoretical possibility would have a negligible effect. Murray Rothbard disagreed with this. He held that increases in the supply of gold could not set in motion the boom-bust cycle. For him, the key reason behind the boom-bust cycle is the act of embezzlement brought about by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank, which sets in motion an increase in the money supply out of 'thin air.' According to Rothbard, 'Inflation, in this work, is explicitly defined to exclude increases in the stock of specie. While these increases have such similar effects as raising the prices of goods, they also differ sharply in other effects: (a) simple increases in specie do not constitute an intervention in the free market, penalizing one group and subsidizing another; and (b) they do not lead to the processes of the business cycle.' Following this reasoning, what uniquely sets the boom-bust cycle into motion is the artificial, inflationary increase in the money supply. The increase in this type of money sets an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., the diversion of wealth from wealth-generators to non-wealth-generators and their projects). The expansionary policy of the central bank impoverishes wealth producers and enriches first possessors of the newly-created money and credit. For Rothbard, then, the boom-bust cycle emerges because of the expansionary policies of the central bank, which set in motion the act of embezzlement. A major contributor to the inflationary process is commercial bank credit expansion. This type of credit is facilitated by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank. This expansionary monetary policy produces false economic prosperity—the economic boom. When the limited savings come under pressure because of the false economic boom, banks start to accumulate non-performing assets. Consequently, they necessarily slow the expansion of artificial credit. As a rule—pressured by increasing price inflation—central bank’s also respond by tightening monetary policy. The unsound investments and ventures, dependent on loose artificial monetary policy, cannot survive the monetary contraction. An economic bust results. It is the act of fraud which sets the boom-bust cycle into motion via inflationary additions to the money supply. This artificial expansion of money and credit is also responsible for price inflation. Gold and the Boom-Bust Cycle? The reason why miners mine gold is because there is a market for it. Gold contributes to the subjective well-being of individuals. In this sense, it is part of the pool of wealth. Now over time, individuals have discovered that gold—being originally useful in making jewelry—has a great appeal as the medium of the exchange. As a result, they may begin to assign a much greater exchange-value to gold than before. Hence, the increase in the supply of gold amounts to the increase in wealth, distinct from the inherently artificial nature of inflation. When a producer of gold exchanges it for goods, he is engaging in the exchange of something for something. He is exchanging wealth for wealth. New gold in a system requires production and/or exchange. Phony Warehouse Receipts, Fiat Money, or Fiduciary Media Cause Boom-Bust Cycles Contrast this with the unbacked by gold 'receipts' that are used as the medium of the exchange. These receipts were issued without the corresponding gold deposited for safekeeping. These receipts generate the same outcome as the counterfeit money does, yet on a much larger scale. This sets the stage for increased consumption without contributing to production or savings. Unbacked fiat certificates set in motion an exchange of nothing for something which, in turn, distorts the price-structure and the structure of production and leads to boom-bust cycles. This also sets the stage for widespread embezzlement once these certificates are employed in an exchange for goods and services. Through the signals from the increased purchasing and investments, this creates an artificial economic boom. Once this process slows down or stops altogether, it halts the diversion of wealth to various activities that emerged because of inflation. As a result, these activities come under pressure and an economic bust results. Without the inflation of money and credit, which divert wealth to them, these economic activities are in trouble. Without easy money, they cannot survive or continue at the same current rate. By contrast, in the case of an increase in the supply of gold, no fraud is committed here. The supplier of gold—the gold mine—has increased the production of a demanded commodity. Therefore, in this case there is not an exchange of nothing for something. The gold producer, by producing something demanded in the market, can exchange it for other goods. He does not create empty money to fraudulently divert wealth to himself. We can thus conclude that the gold standard, if not abused, is not conducive of boom-bust cycles. The gold standard has nothing to do with embezzlement. That said, the inflationary increase in the money supply and the increase in the supply of gold are going to generate a change in price relations and possibly the market interest rate. This addition of gold does not set the boom-bust cycle. A boom-bust cycle, by its nature, is generated by artificial additions to the money supply. If the interest rate change is due to an increase in the supply of gold, which is an increase in wealth, no boom-bust cycle is going to emerge. Cantillon effects, however, will result. An increase in the supply of gold can cause the prices and the market interest rate to change and this is likely to cause fluctuations in economic activity. However, boom-bust cycles are not about free market fluctuations, they are about inflationary monetary policy. Boom-bust cycles are generated by an act of embezzlement. Such cycles are about the diversion of wealth from true wealth-generators to the holders of the new-created and artificial money. In a free market economy, there are continuous changes and there is no stability as such, but that does not equate to the disruptions caused by monetary interventionism. Conclusion The key for the emergence of the boom-bust cycles are inflationary increases in the money supply. These increases set in motion an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., changes in price relations, the diversion of wealth, and distortions in the capital structure). The increase in the supply of gold is not the same. The increase in the supply of gold is an increase in the supply of wealth and production. This increase does not lead to the exchange of nothing for something. Contrary to non-wealth-generating and unsound activities, true wealth-generating activities can support themselves without inflationary expansion of money and credit to divert wealth to themselves. Artificial increases in the money supply, not increases in the gold supply, bring about the menace of the boom-bust cycle.

Trump Card Or Sisyphean Mission? – OpEd	As President Trump finalises his dream team to make the United States (US) great again, the most intriguing appointment is of Elon Musk and Vivek former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite its name, the department is not a government agency though it has been suggested that its main aim is to help business tycoons such as Musk dodge government regulations by leveraging their wealth to influence policy making. It is an advisory commission that, according to Trump, will ' work from outside government to offer the White House 'advice and guidance' and partner with the Office of Management and Budget to 'drive large-scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before'. DOGE Role Model for the World? DOGE is an undertaking which many countries in the world should be looking at closely not only for its impact in the US but also as a possible role model for their own governments. This applies to western allies of the US where disillusionment and distrust of government has become pronounced as evidenced by recent polls. It is also found in countries in the developing world where the rapid and unchecked growth of their bureaucracies - increasingly bloated, outdated, unaccountable and corrupt - has hindered rather than contributed to their socio-economic progress. Trump explained that the surprise move was to shock government systems and to 'pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies'. According to Musk, if DOGE succeeds, it can trim up to US$2 trillion from the current US federal budget of US$6.4 trillion whilst Ramaswamy has touted that it could reduce the number of federal employees by as much as 75%. Trump has also been vocal that it is to address 'massive waste and fraud' in government spending. Less prominent in pronouncements on DOGE is that it is to drain the swamp and to battle the deep state that Trump and supporters see as the main reason for his inability to implement the policy reforms of his first term. 'Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state,' the president-elect told supporters at his first rally of the 2024 election cycle. This is easier said than done. Not only have previous attempts at trimming back the federal bureaucracy failed - the most recent during Reagan’s presidency - it can be expected that key forces within Congress, the federal bureaucracy and deep state actors - will fight to kill off attempts at downsizing the bureaucracy as this threatens their influence and power. Why DOGE Will Fail The campaign to disparage and stymie DOGE has already begun in earnest with US mainstream media giants such as CNN and New York Times fully engaged in bad mouthing the proposed agency even before it has begun work. The most favoured line of attack for now is that the new agency is an attempt at revenge and retribution by Trump. Mainstream media voices are being joined by those from the American left concerned that DOGE may be a tool for big business. A recent report in Jacobin, a leading socialist print and social media outlet described DOGE as 'asinine and dystopian' and expressed the hope that its relationship with the Trump administration 'flames out spectacularly' ( There may be a number of other possible outcomes, apart from flaming out, arising from this unprecedented attempt at institutional reform The one with the highest possibility is that it will fade out - not spectacularly but probably with a whimper. Conceived as a advisory task force - a high powered think tank at best according to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the centre-right American Action Forum - it has no evidence of bipartisan support or budget to get its plans going, DOGE is dependent on the persuasive power of Musk and Ramaswamy. Both are entrepreneurs without political experience to bring to the congressional jungle where their business prowess will not count for much. Meanwhile, their promoter, Trump, will have bigger battles on his hands so this particular 'shock and awe' approach is likely to prove short-lived. A second is that while DOGE may bring about some closure of governmental agencies, the process of downsizing through encouraging early retirement and voluntary departure is much more difficult than in the private sector. There will be a thicket of legal and political challenges to overcome from progressive and conservative quarters that have constituents who are a part or supportive of the federal bureaucracy elite ensconced in Washington D.C. As for draining the swamp and fighting the deep state, these too appear a losing battle. More likely is that even if the current Democrat swamp is drained, it will be a partial drainage and will be refilled with supporters from Trump's own swamp looking out for their own rather than America’s interests and well being. The deep state with its support groups embedded in the FBI, CIA, Defence and Justice departments and the military industrial complex will be the hardest obstacle for DOGE to overcome. The warning shots have already been fired at Trump. Expect these to continue with Musk and Ramaswamy as the latest targets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMbX8_h92VyV	2024-11-25T16:10:21-08:00	
What The FDA Gets Wrong About Drug Ads – OpEd	There are only two countries in the world where drug manufacturers are allowed to advertise their products directly to consumers: the United States and New Zealand. Drug companies in the United States, for example, are spending $4 billion a year on TV ads alone. The typical TV drug ad these days usually touts the benefits of a drug—maybe with a lot of singing and dancing—and closes with a brief rapid-fire list of possible side effects, as parodied on Saturday Night Live. That’s about to change. After 15 years of studying the matter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is going to require the ads to show less about the benefits and more about the side effects and risks. A new bill in Congress would impose similar restrictions on social media platforms. Under a Trump administration, regulations could become even harsher. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (Donald Trump’s pick to head Health and Human Services) wants to ban drug ads completely. Kennedy claims that drug ads are such an important source of revenue for the networks that they influence what is allowed on the regular programming (e.g., avoiding criticism of Pharma). Here is what the regulators and would-be regulators are missing. Our most important health care problem is not that people are taking too many prescription drugs. They are taking too few. Why Drug Advertising Is Good The social value of drug advertising is that it alerts patients to the fact that there is a possible remedy for a chronic illness. The payoff is that the viewer might seek medical advice from a doctor and get a prescription, where appropriate. There is no social value in ads that list risks and negative side effects. The information will always be too clipped to be understandable, it won’t be remembered anyway, and it is useless unless a doctor finds that the patient is a candidate for the drug. The time to discuss side effects is when patients are under a doctor’s care. Studies show that we get our best return in medicine on drugs. Per dollar spent, the return on investing in drug therapy is much higher than what we are getting from investing in doctor care or hospital therapies. For example, Columbia University’s Frank Lichtenberg has estimated that three quarters of the increase in life expectancy that we’ve enjoyed in recent decades is the sole result of our adoption of modern drugs. Yet we are underinvesting in drugs, as reflected in undertreatment rates for chronic illness in this country. Take diabetes. Studies show that only 2.4% of people with prediabetes receive a prescription for metformin (the preferred treatment) within a year of their diagnosis. Even among obese patients, the figure is only 10.4%. Three years after an initial diagnosis, when the patient is even more susceptible to the disease, the treatment rate is still surprisingly low: 3.9% overall and only 14% for obese patients. Or consider hypertension. One out of every four patients with the problem is not being treated at all. And only half of adults with hypertension have their blood pressure under control. Almost as bad as not getting the prescription people need is not taking the drug once it is in hand. Both problems arise for similar reasons. Nearly half of all Americans suffer from at least one ongoing or chronic health condition, and nearly half of these are not adhering to a needed drug regime. There are an estimated 125,000 deaths per year in the United States due to medication nonadherence. Further, an estimated 33% to 69% of medication-related hospital admissions are due to poor adherence. The total cost estimates for medication nonadherence range from $100 billion to $300 billion every year, when both direct and indirect costs are included. Nonadherence and failure to get a prescription in the first place occur for a variety of reasons: lack of information, misinformation and unfounded fear—all of which can be combatted with more, not less, information. Current Rules Restrict Use of Valuable Drugs Not only are the new rules ill-advised, the ones in force right now are already causing considerable harm. That’s because a drug prescribed by doctors—no matter how useful and widespread the application—cannot be advertised, even to doctors themselves, unless the use has been FDA- approved. Once a drug has been approved for one use by the FDA, doctors may find that it has other uses—even though the effectiveness of these other uses has never been studied through an FDA-approved trial. These are called 'off label' uses. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of oncologists had prescribed medications off-label in treating cancer patients. Another study found that about half of chemotherapy drugs are administered for conditions not specified on their FDA-approved labels. For pediatric care, physicians order at least one off-label drug in 18.5% of office visits. The practice is most common in neonate cancer patients, with 83% of visits involving an off-label prescription. For the population as a whole, about 10% to 20% of all prescriptions are for off-label uses. It is hard to exaggerate how unreasonable FDA regulations are in this regard. Even if researchers publish research findings on the off-label use of a drug in the New England Journal of Medicine, a drug company is not allowed to share that article with doctors. If they do, the drug company’s decision makers could wind up in prison! When it comes to the potential of drugs to treat chronic conditions, more information is better than less. And this is especially true in an age when there is so much misinformation on the internet. We should let people learn about the positive benefits of drugs from TV ads and other venues. That will encourage them to seek a doctor’s counsel. The doctor’s office is the place where risks and side effects should be discussed.

Mozambique: Security Force Crackdown Kills, Injures Children, Say...	Mozambican security forces deployed to suppress nationwide post-election protests have killed at least 10 children and injured dozens more since October 24, 2024, Human Rights Watch said. Police have detained hundreds of children, in many cases for days, without notifying their families, in violation of international human rights law. The protests and ensuing government crackdown have led to severe disruptions of education throughout the country. 'The Mozambican security forces that have used force unlawfully against protesters and bystanders have also showed a shocking disregard for the lives of children,' said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. 'The authorities should immediately release all those held, including children, for exercising their rights to free expression and assembly.' Post-election tensions escalated on October 24 after supporters of the independent presidential candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, and the leading opposition party, Optimistic People for the Development of Mozambique (Partido Optimista pelo Desenvolvimento de Moçambique, Podemos), rejected the official declaration that the ruling party and its candidates were the winners of the October 9 election. Mondlane had claimed victory the day after the polls closed. The ensuing protests called for by the opposition began largely peacefully. However, government security forces used live ammunition, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Protesters responded by burning tires, blocking roads, and throwing rocks and other objects at the police. On October 29, Mondlane called for a weeklong nationwide shutdown, culminating in a major march in Maputo, the capital, on November 7. In response, Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda accused Mondlane of causing terror and urged people not to join the protests because it could 'end up degenerating into acts of vandalism and violence.' The deputy police chief, Fernando Tsucana, during a live television interview with the privately operated station STV on November 3, pledged to ensure security on the streets and urged parents to send their children back to school. Many schools had been closed because of the violence. A spokesman for the Education Ministry, Manuel Simbini, told Human Rights Watch that the government had instructed schools to make alternative provisions for almost 13,000 students who were unable to take their final exams across the country due to the violence. A 26-year-old woman said that her sister was among those parents who believed the authorities’ pledge of safety and sent her 13-year-old daughter to school on November 4, despite the reported violence in their neighborhood. 'The situation was already tense with many police officers around,' she said. 'But my niece had to go to school because the teacher had scheduled a written test for that day.' On her way back from school just before 11 a.m., the girl was caught in a crowd of people fleeing tear gas and gunfire by the security forces. One of the bullets hit her in the neck, and she instantly fell to the ground and died, two witnesses said. Human Rights Watch documented nine additional cases of children killed and at least 36 other children injured by gunfire during the protests. The mother of a 6-year-old boy in Maputo’s Chamanculo neighborhood said that on November 5 they were standing in line to buy bread around 10 a.m., when nine riot police officers arrived in a pickup truck. Without warning they fired teargas and live bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside the bakery. She said: 'We tried to run away, but there was no place to go or hide, so a bullet hit my son in the stomach.' She added that police officers took him and other injured people to the nearby Chamanculo hospital for medical treatment. The media reported further violations of children’s rights by the security forces and some protesters, including vandalizing schools, burning classrooms, and endangering children’s lives. Footage shared on social media on November 4, which Human Rights Watch geolocated to have been recently recorded outside a school in Tete province, appears to show dozens of children in school uniform fleeing in panic, after security forces allegedly threw tear gas canisters into their school premises. Human Rights Watch also documented the arbitrary detention for several days of children whom the security forces allegedly arrested during protests without notifying their families. The Mozambican Bar Association reported on November 6 that it had secured the release of over 2,700 people detained throughout the country for participation in the post-election demonstrations. Feroza Zacarias, head of the bar association’s human rights section, said that a significant number of the detainees were children and adolescents. A 17-year-old girl was arrested on November 17 during a 'pots and pans' protestin the capital’s Jardim neighborhood. Her father said the family only learned about her whereabouts two days later from the bar association. He said that when police officers at the station demanded payment of 25,000 meticals (around US$392) for his daughter’s release, he refused to pay on a lawyer’s advice. His daughter was released on November 21, without charges, after the bar association intervened. Mozambican authorities have publicly criticized the involvement of children in the protests. The National Council of Defense said in a statement that it 'deplore[d] in the strongest terms the involvement of children and the veiled attempt to subvert the legitimately established democratic order.' The statement did not mention children’s right to protest and the need for accountability for abuses against children. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child both affirm children’s rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Under the convention, children found in conflict with the law should be detained 'only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.' 'Concerned governments should press Mozambican authorities to stop unnecessary and excessive use of force against child protesters and bystanders and urgently address the harm to children’s education,' Ngari said. 'Those found responsible should be held accountable.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCsAGWefyARB	2024-11-25T15:57:44-08:00	
Divide And Conquer: Political Riptides Threaten To Overwhelm The ...	Once again we find ourselves approaching that time of year when, as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln proclaimed, we’re supposed to give thanks as a nation and as individuals for our safety and our freedoms. But how do you give thanks for freedoms that are constantly being eroded? How do you express gratitude for one’s safety when the perils posed by the American police state grow more treacherous by the day? How do you come together as a nation in thanksgiving when the powers-that-be continue to polarize and divide us into warring factions? You can see this struggle—to reconcile the hope for a better, freer, more just world with the soul-sucking reality of a world in which greed, meanness and war continue to triumph—in John Lennon’s two songs, 'Imagine' (which exhorted us to 'Imagine all the people livin’ life in peace') and 'Happy Xmas (War Is Over)' (which was part of a major anti-war campaign, which were released within months of each other in 1971. Lennon—a musical genius, anti-war activist, and a high-profile example of the lengths to which the Deep State will go to persecute those who dare to challenge its authority—made clear that the only way to achieve an end to hunger, violence, war, and tyranny is to want it badly enough and work towards it. All these years later, we still don’t seem to want those things badly enough. Peace remains out of reach. Activists and whistleblowers continue to be prosecuted for challenging the government’s authority. Militarism is on the rise, all the while the governmental war machine continues to wreak havoc on innocent lives. For those of us who joined with Lennon to imagine a world of peace, it’s getting harder to reconcile that dream with the reality of the American police state. Those who do dare to speak up about government corruption are labeled dissidents, troublemakers, terrorists, lunatics, or mentally ill and tagged for surveillance, censorship or involuntary detention. And then there are those who remain silent while the world falls apart. By doing nothing, the onlookers become as guilty as the perpetrator. It works the same whether you’re talking about kids watching bullies torment a fellow student on a playground, passersby watching someone dying on a sidewalk, or citizens remaining silent in the face of government atrocities. There’s a term for this phenomenon where people stand by, watch and do nothing—even when there is no risk to their safety—while some horrific act takes place: it’s called the bystander effect. Historically, this bystander syndrome in which people remain silent and disengaged—mere onlookers—in the face of abject horrors and injustice has resulted in whole populations being conditioned to tolerate unspoken cruelty toward their fellow human beings: the crucifixion and slaughter of innocents by the Romans, the torture of the Inquisition, the atrocities of the Nazis, the butchery of the Fascists, the bloodshed by the Communists, and the cold-blooded war machines run by the military industrial complex. Psychological researchers John Darley and Bibb Latane mounted a series of experiments to discover why people respond with apathy or indifference instead of intervening. According to Darley and Latane, there are two critical factors that contribute to this moral lassitude. First, there’s the problem of pluralistic ignorance in which individuals in a group look to others to determine how to respond. Second, there’s the problem of 'diffusion of responsibility,' which is compounded by pluralistic ignorance. Basically, this means that no one acts to intervene or help because each person is waiting for someone else to do so. Their findings underscore the fact that evil prevails when good people do nothing. We see it all the time: when people are vocal about politics but silent in the face of human suffering and injustice, tyranny triumphs. For instance, psychologist Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment studied the impact of perceived power and authority on middleclass students who were assigned to act as prisoners and prison guards. The experiment revealed that power does indeed corrupt (the appointed guards became increasingly abusive), and those who were relegated to being prisoners acted increasingly 'submissive and depersonalized, taking the abuse and saying little in protest.' This is how imperial presidents preside over police states. So, what can we do? Be modern-day Good Samaritans and do your part to push back against the darkness. Recognize injustice. Don’t turn away from suffering. Refuse to remain silent. Take a stand. Speak up. Speak out. 'If you think there is even a possibility that someone needs help, act on it,' advises Zimbardo. 'You may save a life. You are the modern version of the Good Samaritan that makes the world a better place for all of us.' This is what Zimbardo refers to as 'the power of one.' All it takes is one person breaking away from the fold to change the dynamics of a situation. Here’s what I suggest: this holiday season, do yourselves a favor and turn off the talking heads, shut down the screen devices, tune out the politicians, take a deep breath, then do something to pay your blessings forward. Find something to be thankful for about the things and people in your community for which you might have the least tolerance or appreciation. Instead of just rattling off a list of things you’re thankful for that sound good, dig a little deeper and acknowledge the good in those you may have underappreciated or feared. When it comes time to giving thanks for your good fortune, put your gratitude into action: pay your blessings forward with deeds that spread a little kindness, lighten someone’s burden, and brighten some dark corner. Engage in acts of kindness. Smile more. Fight less. Build bridges. Refuse to let toxic politics define your relationships. Focus on the things that unite instead of that which divides. Do your part to push back against the meanness of our culture with conscious compassion and humanity. Moods are contagious, the good and the bad. They can be passed from person to person. So can the actions associated with those moods, the good and the bad. Acts of benevolence, no matter how inconsequential they might seem, can spark a movement. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, all it takes is one person to start a chain reaction. For instance, a few years ago in Florida, a family of six—four adults and two young boys—were swept out to sea by a powerful rip current in Panama City Beach. There was no lifeguard on duty. The police were standing by, waiting for a rescue boat. And the few people who had tried to help ended up stranded, as well. Those on shore grouped together and formed a human chain. What started with five volunteers grew to 15, then 80 people, some of whom couldn’t swim. One by one, they linked hands and stretched as far as their chain would go. The strongest of the volunteers swam out beyond the chain and began passing the stranded victims of the rip current down the chain. One by one, they rescued those in trouble and pulled each other in. There’s a moral here for what needs to happen in this country if we only can band together and prevail against the riptides that threaten to overwhelm us.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGD2wDmXW19XJ	2024-11-25T15:51:53-08:00	
The Hunter-Gatherer Guide To Keeping Society Equal – OpEd	There is a great deal of attention in modern societies to inequality and the social problems it causes. Often inequality is considered to be the unavoidable consequence of how society operates in many cultures, with large population numbers and competition for resources requiring a hierarchy of successful and less-successful individuals. While our globalized world may seem dominated by this kind of society, there remain groups around the world who even today live very differently, despite continual and sometimes inescapable pressure. Anthropologists, whose science is the study of humans, have been fascinated by the diversity of ways our species have found to exist, and never more so than when confronted with cultures whose ethos and way of being are radically different from the urban societies that dominate our world: where words are weapons that actually win; where showing off your skills will get you mocked, and where every aspect of life is carefully organized so that no one person should ever have any more power than anyone else. How do some people come to live in a group that has no one at the top, telling the rest what to do? Anthropologists call societies that do not have ranks egalitarian, which means that everyone in them is equal to everyone else. This is a form of social organization that is almost exclusively seen in groups of people who are not settled in one place, tied to one type of food or resource. Rather, they spend quite a lot of their time in small groups, moving around as suits their needs. These kinds of groups have been called hunter-gatherers, but a more accurate name might be foragers: they make their living by walking through their world and exploiting what comes to hand. More than a century of research into the groups who follow their food through the landscape, and do not tie themselves to one location or one crop, has built up a picture of societies that choose to organize themselves very differently from nation-states and kingdoms, and, most importantly, actively refuse to allow any sort of rank among themselves. For a long time, there was an assumption that egalitarian societies were egalitarian simply because they were... simple. Living in small groups and moving constantly, they just couldn't build up mountains of wealth to wield power over other people. And with very small numbers of people in a group—say no more than a few dozen—anthropologists theorized that it couldn't be that complicated to run a society, so you wouldn't need a chief or a king making big decisions. As archaeology has revealed the shape of our distant human past, it is clear that before about 15,000 years ago, every human on earth lived the same mobile lifestyle. Living with only what you can carry and constantly on the move would seem very taxing to the armchair academic of the previous century. The rather impolite implication then is that modern human societies who chose to live in these mobile, egalitarian societies, were simply the last vestiges of a primitive form of human social organization—people who hadn't 'evolved' civilization. It is actually quite remarkable that this idea that an equal society was an easy thing to maintain hung around for so long. One of the problems may have been that the groups who lived these mobile lifestyles were often in the process of being colonized and controlled when anthropologists arrived to study them, and so were in the middle of considerable social upheaval. But another problem may simply have been a failure of imagination. There was considerable shock when anthropologists like James Woodburn began to conduct fieldwork by actually learning the language of the group they were studying and going to observe and ask questions of the people themselves about how life worked in a small foraging group. His work with the Hadza people of what is now Tanzania set in motion a train of research that pointed out that life in a small group is anything but simple. Tempers flare, relationships break down, and when you depend on your group for survival, any social unrest could have fatal consequences. Groups from around the world who maintain an egalitarian ethos have shown that rather than being too simple to 'invent' rank, they are instead too complex to allow one person or group of people to simply take charge. Keeping everyone in a group on equal footing requires a huge amount of effort, and has to be constantly maintained. The Ju/'hoansi people of southern Africa reckon it is particularly important to 'cool young men's hearts'; to stop them being prideful and boastful if they display some special skill, everyone agrees it's very important to bring them back down to earth. A hunter is never allowed to distribute his own meat; instead, the distribution is done in public, with everyone watching. Among the Ju/'hoansi, the proper etiquette is to gently mock a successful hunter—for instance telling them the giraffe that they have killed and will be feeding several camps for days was actually a bit scrawny, perhaps. Mockery seems to be one of the most critical tools in the political inventory for groups that actively try to achieve equality. Jerome Lewis, an anthropologist who lived with the Mbendjele of Northern Congo for several years, tells how poor behavior is subtly (or not so subtly) corrected by women who act out whatever foolish or misguided thing someone has done. The improvisational theater always has an appreciative audience, and all of the group will laugh resoundingly at the person who has done something wrong. What might seem a recipe for social disaster in a group that must get along in order to survive is anything but; the mockery only ends when the person who is being made fun of eventually gives up and laughs along with the rest of the group. We can now see that in those groups that refuse to have ranks among themselves, there are many ways that equality can be actively maintained, but they are almost entirely social. Many groups have a policy similar to that of the Ju/'hoansi when it comes to sharing meat or indeed, anything else that is in the camp—that it would be the height of rudeness not to. Those who transgress against the rules of society may have to face their whole society laughing at them. Even when and where groups choose to move is determined partly by social concerns. If you live in a small group, it is very important to stay connected to friends and family who live somewhere else, in case, for instance, you decide you just can't stand who you are living with at the moment. It seems that the last human societies on earth to live the mobile lifestyles that our species maintained for hundreds of thousands of years do so largely as equals—but equals who must be very careful to stay that way.

A Reformist Program On Immigration (Or What Harris Might Have Sai...	The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social problems afflicting national working classes have been 'managed'—at least temporarily—by scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be 'tough on immigrants' showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as 'protecting the nation against an immigrant 'invasion'' widely prevailed. Appeals to morality, multiculturalism, and compassion for the plight of most immigrants failed to dissuade many on the left from disengaging and moving politically rightward. The center or moderate left needs but lacks clear, strong support for immigrants that does not alienate portions of their traditional electoral base. 'Me-too' opposition to immigration, even if less harsh and hostile than that of the professional demagogues, will fail, as Kamala Harris's campaign discovered. Moreover, classic left reformism suggests a radically different program on immigration. It is derived from the reformist program (the 'Green New Deal') to address climate change when it faced a parallel problem with job-holders in polluting industries. A parallel reformist program to deal with immigration might be called an 'Inclusive New Deal.' In contrast, conservative, right-wing, and fascistic political forces have used extreme opposition to immigration to grow their ranks. Those forces boldly accuse immigrants of bringing crime, disease, downward pressure on wages, competition for jobs, and burdensome, costly demands on schools, hospitals, and other public services. Even in the United States, a country mostly composed of successive immigrant waves (who obliterated and replaced the indigenous people), many of those immigrants' descendants now hold anti-immigrant views. Despite massive evidence to the contrary, they rationalize those views by insisting that, unlike former immigrants, today's differ in being 'unwilling to work.' Rightists advance their radical 'solutions' such as sharply tightening immigration rules, refusing all further immigration, and deporting millions. Even where moral, ethical, and religious traditions call us to welcome immigrants, right-wingers have found that anti-immigration politics can work well. They attack center-leftists for seeking future votes by being pro-immigration or only weakly anti-immigration. In the United States, they attack the Democratic Party for not putting their American-born constituents first. Patriotism, as defined by such rightists, now entails a strict anti-immigrant position that displaces traditional religions' endorsement of the opposite. Immigrants forced to arrive as slaves, Black people in the United States, for example, fared differently: their integration was mostly slower and much more partial. Brown immigrants who arrived as other than slaves also suffered slower and partial integration. Anti-Black-and-Brown racism added further discrimination and life difficulties to the experience of those immigrants. Institutionalized racism denied opportunities for such immigrant communities to develop their members' levels of education, job skills, businesses, personal wealth, and social confidence. All immigrants suffer delays in their access to those qualities and capabilities, but the addition of racism worsens and lengthens those delays, including in U.S. society today. The difficulties usually endured by immigrants slow and skew the development of the economy they have entered. The occasional explosions of immigrants' resentments and bitterness at their treatment—and the usually very violent subsequent repressions—then add further damage to their host economies. Repeated efforts by those opposed to immigration have rarely succeeded in stopping it. The broad range of social forces—including the persistent effects of colonial and neo-colonial subjugation, uneven capitalist development, and climate change—that propel people to emigrate usually outweigh their concerns for their own economic, personal safety, and family interests. For employers, immigration can cheapen labor costs by expanding the supply of labor power (especially when the opposite is threatened by falling birthrates or when capital accumulation risks bidding up wages). Undocumented immigrants offer employers notoriously outrageous opportunities for super-exploitation. Hence, they often support it. An important social cost of immigration is the opportunity it has regularly presented to demagogic politicians. They have repeatedly scapegoated immigrants to deflect genuine mass discontent where it might otherwise threaten the domestic employer class. Is there unemployment? The demagogue suggests that jobs are being preferentially reserved for immigrants. Are public services inadequate? The demagogue suggests that immigrants are placing excessive demands on them and corrupt officials are directing them to immigrants to secure cheap labor or votes. Demagogues often insist—again despite evidence to the contrary—that immigrants commit more crimes and bring and spread more disease than the native-born. The campaigns of Donald Trump and many Republicans scapegoated immigrants. Many Democrats' campaigns likewise featured the scapegoating of immigrants. In contrast, the real, basic economic problems of the United States were not seriously addressed in the latest presidential election campaigns. One of those is the immense gap between haves and have-nots that has widened over the last 40 years. Another is the economic instability that has the economy oscillating between inflation and recessions. Still another is the obvious decline of the American empire (the relatively declining roles of U.S. exports, imports, investments, and the dollar) within the global economy. These issues were marginalized or, more often, ignored. Instead, candidates relentlessly scapegoated 12 million undocumented immigrants (among the poorest of the poor) as if they were the cause of and thus to blame for the deep problems of U.S. capitalism, an economy of 330 million people. Likewise, they excoriated China for the economic competition its economic growth has brought to the United States. Doing that conveniently deflects blame from the corporate employers who made the decision to move production from the United States to China. As usual, all social blame or criticism must be kept from touching the U.S. capitalist system that accounts for those profit-driven decisions. Deep, costly, and lasting consequences have followed the demagoguery and divisions in societies that split over immigration. Much energy, time, and money is diverted from dealing with the nation's real economic problems to obsessive 'coping with' immigration (homeland security budgets, border patrol budgets, and wall construction and maintenance). Still more is devoted to housing, policing, feeding, and otherwise 'processing' undocumented immigrants. If high-priority policy instead created good jobs with good incomes for immigrants, huge portions of these social costs would be unnecessary. Moreover, worthwhile alternatives to failed existing immigration policies are available if sufficient political power places them on the social and political agendas of societies confronting immigration. A remarkable flaw of today's global capitalism lies in its provocation of massive migration of people alongside its massive, costly failure to plan or manage that migration. One such alternative policy could solve together the recurring problems of unemployment, inadequate housing and social services, and immigration. In the U.S. case, another Marshall Plan or 'Inclusive' New Deal, green or otherwise, is needed. It could create jobs performing public services (paid at or above the current median for such jobs) that would be provided, as a right, to every unemployed citizen as priority #1. As priority #2, equivalent jobs would be provided, as a right, to all immigrants. As priority #3, the jobs thus created would include expanding the housing and all other social services needed to adequately accommodate the entire population, native plus immigrant. The tragic social divisiveness of immigrant-vs-native competition for jobs might thereby be sharply reduced. Such an Inclusive New Deal could be funded by (1) billions of dollars no longer needed for unemployment insurance, (2) increased income and other taxes paid by newly employed native and immigrant workers, (3) increased taxes paid by businesses profiting from increased spending by those workers, and (4) an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on all personal wealth above $20 million. Immigration could be reduced for the first five years of this Inclusive New Deal to get it fully established and running. A major side benefit of this Inclusive New Deal would be the huge boost in receipts for Social Security. Another such benefit would be the reduced demands placed on social services by the better physical and mental health of all newly employed workers. Finally, as a social dividend from such an Inclusive New Deal, the official work week in the United States for all workers could be reduced from 40 to 36 hours (with no pay reduction). Imagine the enormous social benefits that would accrue to the entire U.S. population, native and immigrant, from this different reformist approach to the immigration issue. In the United States and beyond, such an approach would reduce the social divisions over jobs, incomes, housing, homelessness, social services, and immigration. A strong, growing economy attracts immigrants, integrates them productively, and thereby impresses the world. A weak, declining economy not only fails to employ all its people productively but by deporting immigrants advertises its failure to the world. A radical program would embrace the freedom to migrate as universal and therefore reorient the global location of investment to serve that freedom both domestically and internationally.

Seoul Confirms Casualties Among North Korean Troops In Russia	By Taejun Kang South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, or NIS, said on Monday it had 'specific intelligence' that North Korean forces in Russia had suffered casualties but it did not comment on a media report that 500 North Koreans had been killed in a Ukrainian attack with British missiles. The U.S. and South Korea have said that North Korean troops had been fighting against Ukrainian forces in Kursk. The U.S. has estimated more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Kursk and they had begun combat operations alongside Russian forces. Neither Russia nor North Korea have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops. Videos circulated by pro-Russian war bloggers indicated that up to 12 British Storm Shadow missiles struck a target believed to be a command headquarters in the village of Maryno on Wednesday. The site might have been used by North Korean and Russian officers, the defense news publisher Global Defense Corp reported. South Korea’s NIS, while confirming it had 'specific intelligence' to confirm North Korean casualties, did not provide any estimated casualty toll. It said it was closely monitoring the situation. Separately, The Wall Street Journal, citing Western officials, said the attack on the command headquarters also killed one high-level North Korean official. Ukraine’s military confirmed the use of the British missile, while Britain has not commented. Anti-air missiles, air defense equipment South Korea’s top security adviser said that in exchange for sending its troops to help Russia, North Korea had received anti-air missiles and other air defense equipment. 'Russia is believed to have provided equipment and anti-air missiles to strengthen Pyongyang’s vulnerable air defense system,' National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said during an interview with the South Korean broadcaster SBS on Friday. 'Following North Korea’s failed military spy satellite launch on May 27, Russia had already declared its intention to support satellite-related technologies [to the North], and it reportedly supplied various military technologies,' Shin said. 'We believe that there has also been economic aid in various forms,' he added. When asked about the possibility of the Russia-Ukraine war expanding into a wider war, Shin said it was unlikely. 'Especially, it is very difficult for Russia to actually use nuclear weapons,' Shin said. On the possibility of North Korea sending additional troops to Russia, Shin said: 'We cannot completely rule that out, but we have no confirmed information at this stage.' 'Russia currently does not have the multiple rocket launcher system and it remains to be seen whether all or part of the operational troops will go, but if all the assigned personnel were to go, it would be around 4,000 people at most,' he explained. The NIS confirmed last week that North Korea had exported additional artillery ammunition and launchers to Russia, including 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers, which raised a speculation that Pyongyang might send an additional artillery unit to Russia. Russian warning Russia warned that it would respond strongly if South Korea supplies lethal weapons to Ukraine, saying it would 'fully destroy relations between the two countries.' 'Seoul must realize that the possible use of South Korean weapons to kill Russian citizens will fully destroy relations between our countries,' said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko in an interview with state news agency TASS on Sunday. 'Of course, we will respond in every way that we find necessary. It is unlikely that this will strengthen the security of the Republic of Korea itself.' The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s official name. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in a press conference on Nov. 7 that while Seoul had provided humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine, the situation has changed with the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. 'If the North Korean military gains experience in modern warfare, it could become a critical problem for our security,' said Yoon. 'So we will now change the support method from the previous humanitarian nature to match the level of involvement of the North Korean military. We will not rule out weapons support to Ukraine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCaFXCh3gpZL	2024-11-25T15:44:56-08:00	
Pakistan: Civilian Carnage – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh On November 21, 2024, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy in the Kurram District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) killing at least 38 persons and injuring 11. At the time of writing, the death toll had risen to 43. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Kurram Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud disclosed that 'two separate convoys of members of the Shia community … were targeted by the terrorists in the Kurram district… both convoys consisted of around 40 vehicles travelling under police escort.' Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. 'The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,' said an unnamed local administration official, adding, 'Among the deceased 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community.' Meanwhile, the worst previous attack targeting civilians was recorded on September 29, 2023, when at least 55 persons were killed while another 100 were injured in a suicide blast targeting a 12th Rabiul Awwal procession near Madina Masjid at Alfalah Road in Mastung town (Mastung District), Balochistan. Mastung Assistant Commissioner Atta-ul-Munim had said that the explosion took place when people were gathering for the procession. The target were people of the Barelvi sub-sect of Sunni Muslims. Some of the other prominent attacks, each with 25 or more civilian fatalities, in Pakistan since the launch of the operation Zarb-e-Azb [Sword of the Prophet] on June 15, 2014, included: July 30, 2023: At least 54 people, including a Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) local leader, were killed and more than 100 sustained injuries in a suicide blast at the JUI-F workers' convention on Shanday Morr near the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) office in the Khar town of Bajaur District in KP. March 4, 2022: At least 57 worshippers lost their lives and 194 were injured when a suicide attacker detonated his explosives inside a Shia Mosque in the Koocha Risaldar area of Peshawar, the provincial capital of KP. Later, the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) claimed the suicide bombing. November 23, 2018: At least 33 people, including 22 Shias, were killed and more than 51 were injured in a suicide attack in the crowded marketplace near an Imambargah (Shia place of worship) in the Juma Bazar (Friday Market) of Kalaya town in the Lower Orakzai District of KP. July 13, 2018: A suicide bomber targeting a political rally of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) killed at least 128 people and injured over 200 in the Dringarh village of Mastung District. Both IS-KP and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP )'s 'Ghazi Force Lal Masjid' wing claimed responsibility for the attack. May 12, 2017: At least 27 people were killed and 40, including Senate Deputy Chairman Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Haideri's convoy in Mastung town, Mastung District, Balochistan. February 16, 2017: At least 76 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked the crowded Sufi shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the Sehwan Sharif town of Sehwan District in Sindh, injuring up to another 250. The blast took place inside the premises of the shrine as a dhamaal (meditative dance) was taking place, with a large number of women and children among the casualties. Devotees throng the shrine of the revered Sufi saint every Thursday to participate in a dhamaal and prayers. The IS-KP claimed responsibility for the attack. September 16, 2016: A suicide bomber killed at least 28 people and wounded more than 45 while they attended Friday prayers at a mosque in the Pekhan Killay area of Anbar tehsil (revenue unit) in the then Mohmand Agency of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Jama'at-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a breakaway faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. August 8, 2016: At least 70 persons were killed and over 100 were wounded in a suicide bombing at the emergency ward of Quetta's Civil Hospital, where scores of people had gathered to mourn the death of Balochistan Bar Association (BBA) President Bilal Anwar Kasi in a gun attack earlier in the day. Law enforcement officials said that the two attacks were connected and the blast was carried out by a suicide bomber. Fifty-five of the 70 dead were lawyers, including BBA's former President Baz Muhammad Kakar, former Supreme Court Bar Association Vice-President Syed Qahir Shah, Advocate Sangat Jamaldani, son of Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Secretary General Jahanzeb Jamaldani, and Advocate Dawood Lasi, son of Former Federal Minister Abdul Malik Kasi. March 27, 2016: At least 72 people were killed and more than 300 injured when a suicide bomber ripped through the parking space in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park situated near Allama Iqbal Town in Lahore, Punjab, while Christians were celebrating Easter. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack, with a spokesperson declaring, 'We claim responsibility for the attack on Christians as they were celebrating Easter.' December 29, 2015: At least 26 people were killed and 50 were injured as a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a NADRA office located on the link road in the Mardan town of Mardan District in KP. The explosion ripped through the front entrance of the regional branch of NADRA. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack. December 13, 2015: At least 25 persons were killed and 62 injured when a device containing about 35 kilograms of explosives ripped through a makeshift market in Parachinar town of Kurram Agency in FATA. Officials disclosed that the device, kept in a sack, exploded when a large number of people were buying second-hand clothes. Two militant groups - Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Al-Alami (LeJ International) and Ansarul Mujahideen (based in South Waziristan Agency) - claimed responsibility for the attack, with one of them (LeJ) asserting that the target was the Shia community. May 13, 2015: At least 47 Ismaili Shias were killed and another 24 were injured when unidentified militants opened fire in the Safora Chowrangi area near Dow Medical College in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Town, Karachi, Sindh. January 30, 2015: At least 61 Shias were killed and 50 were injured in a bomb explosion at Karbala Maula Imambargah in the Lakhi Dar area of Shikarpur District, Sindh. Jundullah, a splinter group of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Fahad Marwat, Jundullah 'spokesperson', declared, 'Our target was the Shia community… They are our enemies,'. December 16, 2014: At least 148 persons, including 132 children, nine school staff members and all seven suicide attackers, were killed when TTP militants stormed and opened fire at the Army Public School located on Warsak Road in the provincial capital, Peshawar. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that the attack was in retaliation to military operations in the North Waziristan and Khyber Agencies of FATA. November 2, 2014: At least 60 people, including children and women, were killed and more than 150 were injured when a suicide bomber detonated his suicide vest in a parking area, about 500 meters from the Wagah Border on the Pakistan side. Giving details about the incident, the then Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab, Pakistan, Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera, stated, 'A large number of people were returning after watching Rangers flag ceremony at Wagah border when a suicide bomber blew himself up near one of the exit gates.' Of these 17 incidents, nine were sectarian attacks. Since June 15, 2014, in 178 such incidents, at least 762 civilians have been killed, and another 979 have been injured. Such attacks have led to increased animosities between sectarian groups and led to several clashes. For instance, hours after the November 21, 2024, attack (above), deadly clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram which resulted in at least 39 deaths. The clashes continued till November 23 late night. Though 'both sides have agreed to a seven-day ceasefire, during which they will also exchange prisoners and return bodies to one another' as disclosed by Muhammad Ali Saif, spokesperson for the KP Government on November 24, given the fraught ties, particularly over the past few months, between the two sides, the ceasefire is unlikely to last longer. Notably, over 150 have been killed in such clashes in the region over the past five months. Meanwhile, overall civilian fatalities in terrorist violence have been on a continuous rise since 2020, after declining to 142 in 2019. Fatalities in this category increased to 169 in 2020, 215 in 2021, 229 in 2022 and 386 in 2023. At least 561 civilians have already been killed with over a month still left in 2024, the highest since 2015, when there were 866 such fatalities. Significantly, then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had had declared, in the National Assembly, on June 16, 2014, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb had been launched against terrorism and it would continue till its final objective of the restoration of peace and tranquillity in Pakistan had been obtained. 'I am confident the operation will be the harbinger of peace and security for Pakistan,' he asserted. As SAIR had noted then, 'Such vaunting declarations are not a novelty in Pakistan, but are difficult to reconcile with the country's broader strategic design and continuing exploitation of terrorism as an instrument, both of domestic political management and external strategic projection… In all probability, Operation Zarb-e-Azb will also come to an end sooner rather than later, without any decisive gains. The military may bring away the illusion that the terrorist assault at Karachi has been 'avenged', but the capacities and intentions of the terrorists are unlikely to be impacted in any significant measure.' Indeed, Operation Zarb-e-Azb has ended and so have other operations that followed , but terrorism continues to thrive in Pakistan. The hapless citizenry is unlikely to receive any respite in a situation where the Security Forces are themselves under increased threat, with over 636 SF personnel already killed in 2024, the highest in a year since 2013 (665).

India: Shadow From The Past In Punjab – Analysis	By Ruchika Kakkar On November 12, 2024, Shimla Singh, a terrorist associated with the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), was arrested in the Mansa District of Punjab. Gaurav Yadav, Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, disclosed that Shimla Singh confessed to his role in the grenade attack at the Jio Petrol Pump on Sirsa Road in Mansa District, in the intervening night of October 26-27, 2024. Shimla Singh revealed that he received the grenade from Garhshankar in the Hoshiarpur District of Punjab, on the instructions of KTF's current 'chief' Arshdeep Singh aka Arsh Dala. No casualty was reported in the incident. On November 10, 2024, DGP Yadav announced on X, the arrest of two key KTF terrorists - Anmol Preet Singh aka Vishal, and Navjot Singh aka Neetu - near Kharar in the Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar District of Punjab. The accused were involved in the murder of Gurpreet Singh Hari Nau in Faridkot, Punjab, on October 9, 2024. Investigations revealed their role in the killing of Jaswant Singh Gill on November 7, 2024, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, under Arsh Dala's instructions. On October 24, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Baljeet Singh aka Baljeet Maur, an absconding KTF member, from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in Delhi. Investigations revealed that he was involved in extortion, recruitment of new cadres, as well as terrorist funding to India-based associates. On May 2, 2024, Police arrested four KTF members for allegedly making an extortion demand of INR five million from a resident in the Muktsar District of Punjab. One .32-bore pistol, four cartridges, five cell phones, a scooter and a car, were seized from them. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since February 17, 2023, at least 15 KTF operatives/associates have been arrested across India (data till November 22, 2024), including 10 such arrests in 2024. In a press release dated February 17, 2023, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) declared KTF as a militant outfit, noting, 'It is a militant outfit and it aims to revive terrorism in Punjab. It challenges the territorial integrity, unity, national security and sovereignty of India and promotes various acts of terrorism, including targeted killings in Punjab.' KTF has collaborated with jihadist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ), to plot attacks in Punjab. In 2014, KTF and LeT planned to airdrop militants into Pathankot using a German-imported glider, though the mission failed due to technical issues. KTF remains active in attempting bombings, armed attacks, and targeting VIPs in Punjab, often coordinating with Pakistan-based jihadi elements. Some of the recent killings (apart from the two mentioned above) in which the role of KTF-linked operatives is suspected included: September 18, 2023: Congress leader Baljinder Singh Balli (45), was killed in Moga, Punjab. Arsh Dala claimed responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post.January 31, 2021: Hindu Priest Kamaldeep Sharma was killed by Kamaljeet Sharma and Ram Singh aka Sonain, in Jalandhar District, Punjab, on the directions of Arsh Dala and the then KTF 'chief' Hardeep Singh Nijjar. November 20, 2020: A member of Dera Sacha Sauda, Manohar Lal Arora, was killed at Bhagta Bhai Ka village in the Bathinda District of Punjab. An NIA First Information Report dated February 13, 2024, inter alia, observed, 'KTF terror associates have conspired to smuggle arms and ammunition into India, raise funds for activities of KTF through extortion and carry out targeted killings to create terror in the minds of the people of Punjab. They are also involved in the recruitment of persons into KTF for carrying out their terrorist activities… The KTF operatives are working in close collaboration with the Bambiha criminal gang to use the network including resources and logistics of the gang for the commission of terrorist and criminal activities in India… ' The Bambiha criminal gang which used to operate in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan has recently started operating in Delhi. 'Founded' by Davinder Bambiha who was killed in an encounter with police in 2016, it is currently led by Gaurav aka Lucky Patial, who is either in the United States or Armenia. The NIA is investigating at least seven KTF-linked cases. It has filed charge sheets in all these seven cases, against 31 persons. The KTF was founded in 2011 by Jagtar Singh Tara, a former Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) militant involved in the assassination of the then Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh on August 31, 1995. After escaping from Chandigarh's Burail Jail in 2004, Jagtar Singh fled to Pakistan, and later moved to Thailand to establish a militant training base. He was arrested in Thailand in 2015 and deported to India, after which he revealed ISI's role in shifting Khalistani training operations to Thailand. Supported by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), KTF is one of four militant groups, including BKI, Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), that spearhead ISI-backed violence in Punjab. Based in Pakistan, KTF has supporters in a number of countries, prominently including Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Thailand and USA. It is financially supported by ISI and linked to other various Khalistani leaders, including Rattandeep Singh and Resham Singh. Nijjar, who joined KTF in 2013 and was radicalized by Tara, became the chief of KTF after Jagtar Singh Tara's re-arrest. Nijjar was allegedly groomed by the ISI, who gave him arms and explosives training in 2012 and 2013, and subsequently worked doe the revival of KTF. Nijjar was declared a designated terrorist through a UMHA notification dated July 1, 2022, which, inter alia, read, Hardeep Singh Nijjar is chief of Khalistan Tiger Force… and is actively involved in operationalizing, networking, training and financing Khalistan Tiger Force module members… Nijjar is accused in various cases registered and being investigated by the Punjab Police… the Central Government believes that Hardeep Singh Nijjar is involved in terrorism and Hardeep Singh Nijjar is to be notified as a terrorist… On June 18, 2023, (8.27pm local time), Canada-based Nijjar was shot dead by two unidentified youth outside the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, in the British Columbia Province of Canada. Nijjar's assassination has become a major point of contention between India and Canada. Arsh Dala succeeded Nijjar as the 'chief' od KTF. A UMHA notification of January 9, 2023, designated Dala a terrorist, observing Dala 'is associated with Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF)' and 'is very close to Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist and runs terror modules on behalf of him.' Arsh Dala is reported to have been arrested in Canada following a shooting incident in Milton Town, Ontario, on October 28, 2024. On October 29, the Halton Regional Police Service (HRPS) disclosed that it had arrested two men on charges of 'discharging firearm with intent', after the duo had come to a hospital and one of them was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot wound and later discharged. Though It did not disclose their identity, both accused 'were held in custody pending a bail hearing.' It later emerged that the injured party was Dala. Meanwhile, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, 'We have seen media reports circulating since 10 November on the arrest in Canada of proclaimed offender Arsh Singh Gill aka Arsh Dala, the de-facto chief of the Khalistan Tiger Force. Canadian print and visual media have widely reported on the arrest… In view of the recent arrest, our agencies will be following up on an extradition request. Given Arsh Dala's criminal record in India and his involvement in similar illegal activities in Canada, it is expected that he will be extradited or deported to face justice in India.' However, given the current status of Indo-Canadian ties, it is quite unlikely that Dala will be extradited at any time in the near future. Whatever may happen in the case of extradition, it is quite clear that the threat emerging out of Canadian soil in the form of Khalistani terrorism/extremism and its linkages to gangsterism, including the threats arising from KTF, have been growing in recent times. Given the fraught relations between New Delhi and Ottawa since the Nijjar allegations, significant counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries will remain unlikely. If diplomatic pressure is to be increased on Canada to act against the Khalistani gangster-terrorist networks, India will have to address their manifestation on its own soil, as well as the many deficits in enforcement, investigation and prosecution that impede international cooperation on these issues.

Spain’s Center-Right ‘Foolish’ To Think EPP Would Upset EU Allian...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain's Partido Popular (PP) was foolish if it thought that European People's Party (EPP) leader Manfred Weber would break the grand coalition with the S&D and Liberals in the European Parliament in exchange for torpedoing future commissioner Teresa Ribera, Ignacio Molina, an expert on EU politics, told Euractiv.es. Molina is a senior researcher and EU policy expert at the Real Instituto Elcano, one of Spain's most prestigious think tanks. After a tense week in which the formation of the second European Commission, headed by Ursula von der Leyen, was up in the air because of the PP's veto on Ribera, the grand coalition of the EPP and the Socialist Group (S&D) with the Liberals has been saved, but at the cost of many wounds, Molina warned. 'If the PP really thought that they were capable of convincing the EPP to veto Ribera and thus break the grand coalition, they were really fooling themselves,' Molina told Euractiv.es. An agreement was finally announced last Wednesday between the EPP, S&D, and Renew Europe leaders, paving the way for the second von der Leyen team to be sworn in this week. Ribera will be the future commissioner for competition and vice president for a clean, fair, and competitive transition. 'It is likely that this week, the PP will abstain (in the vote on the new Commission). We will have to see to what extent they maintain their hard-line or accept the path of pragmatism which Weber has imposed by not wanting to break the grand coalition with the S&D group,' Molina stressed. According to the expert, although the PSOE and the PP have on many occasions coordinated their positions and voted together in the European Parliament, in the case of Ribera, the positions have become highly polarised, weakening this 'unity', which does not exist in Madrid, Molina recalled. No breaking of the status quo 'They (the PP) have taken political advantage of the floods (in Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha). But the attempt to erode Ribera came long before the catastrophe occurred. When (parliamentary) hearings were being prepared, the appearance of the new vice-presidents was left until the end because of rumours in Madrid that the PP was going to weaken her or even try to have her rejected,' Molina added. He recalled that 'since 1999, the European Parliament has always eliminated a commissioner candidate'. In 2014, the PSOE voted against former energy and climate action commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete (PP), who served in Brussels between 2014 and 2019. In the days before the 'white smoke' announcement for the new European Commission last Wednesday, the PP maintained a hard line. The party's spokesperson in Brussels, Dolors Montserrat, reaffirmed the formation's total rejection of Ribera. But despite the PP's now-dashed hopes, Molina believes that Weber never intended to break the alliance with the S&D and the Liberals. 'Weber wanted to please the PP, but he never wanted to destroy the grand coalition,' Molina said. 'Did anything justify Weber making things very difficult for Teresa Ribera? The answer is yes. But would he have gone so far as to break up the grand coalition? The answer is a clear no,' the expert added. In the same vein, the Elcano researcher recalled that despite a personal rivalry between von der Leyen and Weber, both from the CDU/CSU, one of the reasons that - in theory - could have partly justified Weber torpedoing Ribera, 'he cannot do whatever he wants'. Bleeding wounds in the wake of a fierce ideological battle Weber’s approach was: 'Let's listen to the PP by hindering the ‘anti-nuclear’ Ribera as much as possible, and maybe we can even get (Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro) Sánchez to change his candidate. That would be good for us' but, in reality, 'Weber was never willing to risk breaking the current status quo', Molina said. According to the expert, Weber never wanted to break the grand coalition because that would have meant 'falling into the hands of the far right (including the Patriots for Europe group). It was a very well-considered and rational decision on Weber's part.' However, although the PP did not topple Ribera, the future Spanish commissioner ‘has sweated blood this week. And that is not a bad thing for the EPP group,' Molina added. Moreover, according to the Elcano expert, the battle between the PSOE and the PP in Brussels 'will leave wounds' between the two parties, which until now have almost always voted as a united bloc on major issues affecting Spanish interests. The 'Ribera case' means that 'trust between PP and PSOE MEPs has been badly damaged, and this is a novelty because until now, the polarisation of Spanish political disputes has not usually been exported to Brussels.' 'With everything that has happened last week, things have changed and will leave scars on both parties,' Molina also warned.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGFL45X0am235	2024-11-25T15:38:08-08:00	
The Roadmap To A Just Peace In Palestine – OpEd	A major problem in American thinking relating to the Middle East is the utter rejection of the notion that Palestinian rights are fundamental, if even relevant at all, to the coveted peace and stability. In the years before the Trump administration’s so-called deal of the century was officially revealed on Jan. 28, 2020, successive US administrations had attempted to 'stabilize' the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinians. Earlier plans, or deals, rested on the premise of total marginalization of the Palestinian people and their cause. They included the Rogers Plan of 1969 and the Second Rogers Plan the following year, which culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978. When all such plans failed to subdue the Palestinians, Israel and the US began investing in an alternative Palestinian leadership that would be compliant with Tel Aviv’s will, often in exchange for money and a minimal share of power. The outcome was the Oslo Accords of the mid-1990s, which initially segmented the Palestinians politically, yielding competing classes, but ultimately failed to defeat their quest for freedom. Numerous other initiatives and plans, mostly proposed by the US and other Western entities, tried to conclude the Palestinian struggle in favor of Israel without having to deal with the inconveniences of pressuring it to respect international law. They all failed. The 2020 deal was another failed attempt. It was centered on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previously thwarted economic peace of 2009. For Israel, this new attempt was meant to be a win-win scenario: ending Israel’s regional isolation, amassing wealth, making the Israeli military occupation permanent and avoiding any accountability under international law, thus permanently defeating the Palestinians. The ongoing Israeli war and genocide in Gaza, the destabilization of the whole region and the ongoing Palestinian steadfastness and resistance are the final proof that there can never be real peace in the Middle East without justice for the Palestinians and other victims of Israeli brutality. No matter how many US-Western deals and initiatives are proposed in the future, this fact will not be altered. The same applies to those operating in a less official capacity but who are still committed to the same perusal of creative 'solutions' to the so-called conflict. Such notions may suggest that the lack of a solution reflects a lack of imagination and resolve or a dearth of legal texts that make a just end to the conflict impossible. However, a solution is readily available. Indeed, the solution to military occupation, apartheid and genocide is ending military occupation, dismantling the racist apartheid regime and holding Israeli war criminals accountable for their extermination of Palestinians. Not only do we have enough international and humanitarian laws and court orders to guide us through the process of holding Israel accountable, but also more than the needed critical mass of international consensus that should make this 'solution' possible. The main obstacle is the stubborn and unconditional US support of Israel, which has allowed the latter to flout international law and consensus for decades. International law regarding Palestine is not an outdated solution but a robust and growing legal discourse that refuses to entertain any Israeli or US interpretation of the war crimes, including the crime of genocide, underway in Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Territories. In February, the International Court of Justice held hearings that allowed representatives of more than 50 countries to articulate their political, legal and moral stances on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. While the acting legal adviser at the US State Department arguedthat the 15-judge panel at The Hague should not call for Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s legal adviser contended that the Palestinians’ 'use of force to resist oppression is an inalienable right.' In July, the court issued a landmark ruling that the Israeli occupation in all of its expressions is illegal under international law and that such illegality includes Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem and all of its Jewish-only settlements, annexation attempts, theft of natural resources and so on. In September, international consensus was achieved again, as the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Israel end 'its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within 12 months. This is a mere footnote in the massive body of international law regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Yet more is regularly being added to the already clear discourse, including last week’s issuing of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court for top Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu. With such clarity in mind, why then should Palestinians, Arabs and the international community entertain or engage in any new deals, plans or solutions that operate outside the realms of international law and standards? The issue is obviously not the lack of a roadmap to a just peace, but the lack of interest or will to implement it, specifically on the part of the US and a few of its Western allies. It is their relentless backing of Israel and financing of its war machine that makes a just solution in Palestine unattainable, at least for now. As far as Palestinians are concerned, there can only be one acceptable deal: one that is predicated on the full implementation of international law, including the Palestinian people’s right of return and right to self-determination. The continued US-Israeli attempts to circumvent this fact will never impede Palestinians from carrying on with their struggle for freedom.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGGogoS9DTmbc	2024-11-25T15:35:23-08:00	
Philippine President’s Office: VP Duterte Could Be Prosecuted For...	By Jason Gutierrez The feud between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice-President Sara Duterte has taken an astonishing turn with Marcos vowing to 'fight back' after his No. 2 openly warned that he would be assassinated should she be targeted and killed. Duterte’s public threats made over the weekend were being investigated, and if the evidence warranted it, she could be prosecuted, the Presidential Communications Office said, citing the Philippine justice department. President Marcos did not name his vice-president in a video conveying his response to her threats, but he termed as 'reckless' what he said were threatening statements that endangered the Philippines’ leadership. 'The statements we heard in the previous days were troubling. There is the reckless use of profanities and threats to kill some of us,' Marcos said in his video message on Monday. 'I will fight back,' he said, adding that 'such criminal' statements must not be ignored. 'If it’s that easy to plan the assassination of a president, how much [easier to plan against] ordinary citizens,' Marcos said. The Marcos and Duterte families had joined hands in an alliance to win the general election two years ago, but the partnership ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, Sara’s father. Duterte on Saturday said in an online press briefing that she had hired 'someone' to eliminate Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta and House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, in the event that she might be assassinated. 'No joke,' Sara Duterte said. Vice President Duterte later tried to walk back her remarks, saying they were hypothetical. In a statement Monday, she said that her remarks had been 'maliciously taken out of logical context.' The vice-president’s threats came after Zuleika Lopez, her chief of staff, was detained for contempt by the House. The House good government committee said it had found that Lopez was trying to hamper an inquiry into the vice-president’s alleged misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.12 million) from her budget as the VP and former education secretary. On Saturday, the Presidential Security Command issued a statement saying it had 'heightened and strengthened its security protocols.' 'Any threat to the life of the president and the first Family, regardless of its origin – and especially one made so brazenly in public – is treated with the utmost seriousness,' the statement said. 'We consider this a matter of national security and shall take all necessary measures to ensure the president’s safety.' ‘Not a normal statement’ On Monday, House Speaker Romualdez described the threats made by the vice-president as 'both alarming and unprecedented.' 'Let me be clear. This is no longer a joke. This is not a normal statement,' he said in a speech. 'This is a threat to our democracy, to our government, and the security of our nation.' Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), said it would subpoena Vice President Duterte as part of an investigation into her remarks at the press conference where she made the threats against Marcos. The NBI is the investigating arm of the justice department. The Vice President would be asked 'to appear within five days from today' to explain her remarks, NBI Director Jaime Santiago said. Were Duterte to ignore the subpoena, the bureau would commence its investigation using any legal evidence it had, Santiago said. 'Any and all threats against the life of the president shall be validated and considered a matter of national security,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said in a statement on Sunday. 'We underscore that the safety of the President is a non-partisan issue.'

Horn Of Africa Forum Opens In Djibouti Amid Ethiopia-Somalia Tens...	By Mohamed Olad Hassan Somali scholars, politicians and traditional leaders from across the Horn of Africa gathered in Djibouti on Monday for a three-day forum on strengthening regional stability. The annual forum, the eighth of its kind, was organized by the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Somalia, an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Mogadishu. Mursal Saney, executive director of the institute, said the forum is providing an opportunity for Somalis from across the region to discuss issues of concern. 'We have invited nearly 300 delegates including regional experts to provide them an opportunity to discuss and exhibit constructive ideas on how the Horn of Africa region can strengthen its stability and the importance of rule of law,' Saney said. This year’s forum comes at a time of growing tension between Somalia and Ethiopia over a port deal Addis Ababa signed in January with Somaliland, a breakaway region. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. The deal so far, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, gives landlocked Ethiopia a 50-year lease for a Red Sea port from Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The deal has angered Mogadishu, which has described it as an assault on Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991, following the collapse of the military government led by late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Somalia has never accepted Somaliland’s secession, nor has Somaliland received international recognition. In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. 'Because of its strategic location in the region and the fact that it is coming out of a conflict era, Somalia is thirsty for peace and regional stability, respecting the international law and the rule of law,' Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi said at the start of the forum. Also on Monday, Mumin Hassan Barre, Djibouti’s minister of justice and religion, said experts attending the forum should contribute to the well-being of the region. 'We see experts that know the region well, and I think the peace, stability and the solution of the region’s problems lie in the hands of its people, including the experts who gathered here,' Barre said. Somalis representing Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia are attending the event, as well as those from across the region and the diaspora communities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Mohamed Sheikh Nor contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMQUuQCeZiyG	2024-11-25T15:31:09-08:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Intensify In Lebanon Amid Rumors Of Imminent C...	By Najia Houssari Israeli attacks on targets in Lebanon intensified on Monday, as rumors circulated in Tel Aviv and Beirut about the possibility of a ceasefire agreement within two days. US envoy Amos Hochstein has been leading complex negotiations between Israeli and Lebanese authorities with the aim of ending the conflict, which began on Sep. 23 with Israeli airstrikes, followed by ground incursions into border areas on Oct. 1. Since then, Israel has assassinated senior Hezbollah leaders, and the confirmed death toll from the fighting stands at about 3,800. This figure does not include Hezbollah members killed on the battlefield, the numbers of which are difficult to ascertain because of intense shelling in southern areas. The escalating war has also resulted in the destruction of thousands of residential and commercial buildings in areas stretching from the south of the country to the southern suburbs of Beirut and northern Bekaa. Tensions continue to run high as the population lives in fear of the intense airstrikes, with ambulances and fire trucks remaining on standby in all regions. MP Elias Bou Saab, the deputy speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, said: 'We are optimistic about a ceasefire and there is hope. But nothing can be confirmed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What might put pressure on him is the battlefield.' Israeli aggression intensifies whenever peace negotiations move closer to an agreement, he added, in an attempt to put pressure on Lebanese authorities. 'We insist on our position regarding the inclusion of France in the committee overseeing the ceasefire implementation,' said Bou Saab. 'We did not hear anything about Israel’s freedom of movement in Lebanon, and we still speak only about UN Resolution 1701, with no additions and with an implementation mechanism.' Resolution 1701 was adopted by the Security Council in 2006 with the aim of resolving the conflict that year between Israel and Hezbollah. It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, the withdrawal of Hezbollah and other forces from parts of the country south of the Litani River, and the disarmament of Hezbollah and other armed groups. News channel CNN quoted a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister as saying talks were moving toward a ceasefire. Another regional source told the network: 'The agreement is closer than ever. However, it has not been fully finalized yet.' Israel’s ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, said an agreement 'could happen in a few days' but 'there are still some sticking points that need to be resolved.' The Israeli Broadcasting Authority quoted the country’s education minister as saying that Hochstein has the green light to proceed with an agreement. It added that a deal with Lebanon had been finalized and Netanyahu was considering 'how to explain it to the public.' Also on Monday, diplomat Dan Shapiro from the US Department of Defense held meetings with senior Israeli officials that focused on the members of a proposed committee to monitor the ceasefire, most notably the participation of France, and the details of a monitoring mechanism to be led by the US. One report suggested Washington had agreed to provide Israel with a guarantee it would support any military action in response to threats from Lebanon and to disrupt any Hezbollah presence along the border. According to news website Axios, the draft agreement for a ceasefire includes a 60-day transitional period during which the Israeli army would withdraw from southern Lebanon, to be replaced by the Lebanese army in areas close to the border, and Hezbollah would move its heavy weapons from the border region to areas north of the Litani Line. Against this backdrop of peace negotiations, the continual Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut intensified on Monday, following 10 strikes the previous evening. The attacks targeted Haret Hreik, Hadath, Ghobeiry, Bir Al-Abed and Sfeir. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and as Arab News visited targeted areas, residents said 'there have never been any Hezbollah offices in these structures, neither now nor in the past, and the buildings are mainly for residential purposes.' A lawyer called Imad said the apartment building in the Hadath area in which he lived collapsed when it was hit by an airstrike. 'It is unbelievable that they use Hezbollah as a pretext to destroy our homes, which we purchased through financial loans to provide shelter for our families. They intend to annihilate us all,' he said. The Israeli army said on Monday that an airstrike that hit the Basta area of central Beirut early on Saturday had 'targeted a command center affiliated with Hezbollah.' Efforts to help the injured and recover the bodies of the dead continued at the scene of the attack until Sunday evening. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 29 people were killed and 67 wounded. The Israeli army also carried out numerous airstrikes in southern Lebanon, mainly targeting the cities of Tyre and Nabatieh. Ten people were killed, including a woman and a member of the Lebanese army, and 17 injured in three airstrikes on Tyre. Also in Tyre, an Israeli drone killed a motorcycle rider in a parking lot near the Central Bank of Lebanon. And three civilians were killed by an airstrike in the town of Ghazieh, south of Sidon. From the southern border to the northern banks of the Litani River, no area has been spared from Israeli airstrikes, which have extended as far north as the city of Baalbek, and the town of Hermel close to the border with Syria. In the east, back-and-forth operations between the Israeli army and Hezbollah continued as the former attempted to gain control over the town of Khiam. Its forces advanced, supported by Merkava tanks, from the southern outskirts under the cover of airstrikes and artillery bombardment, moving into the center of the town and toward Ebel Al-Saqi and Jdidet Marjeyoun. The Israeli army also deployed tanks between olive groves in the town of Deir Mimas after an incursion into the town last week. It began advancing toward the Tal Nahas-Kfar Kila-Qlayaa triangle. Elsewhere, Hezbollah and Israeli forces clashed in the western sector of the Maroun Al-Ras-Ainata-Bint Jbeil triangle. Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli army positions on the outskirts of the towns of Shamaa and Biyada. Israeli forces carried out house-demolition operations in Shamaa. Hezbollah also continued to launch attacks against northern Israel. The group said its rockets 'reached the Shraga base, north of the city of Acre, and targeted an Israeli army gathering in the settlement of Meron.' Israeli medical services said one person was injured in Nahariya by falling fragments from a rocket.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGPdHMO9eLl5Q	2024-11-25T15:28:49-08:00	
Persecution Of The Press Is The New Normal In Bongbong’s Philippi...	By Danilo Araña Arao The Philippines is one of the most dangerous places to practice journalism not just in Asia, but in the entire world. Members of the media are often smeared as communists, arbitrarily detained or murdered for doing their jobs. Worse, this behaviour is normalised by large swathes of society despite a constitutional right to a free press. Close to 200 journalists have been killed in the line of duty since the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr was ousted in 1986 — four of them under the current administration of his son Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio has been detained since 2020 on trumped-up charges of illegal possession of firearms and financing terrorist activities. Toward the end of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term, the government blocked over two dozen websites, including the publications Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly over alleged links to terrorism. During Duterte’s term from 2016 to 2022, the major broadcaster ABS-CBN was shut down and popular online news site Rappler faced several legal cases, including tax evasion charges and registration cancellation that threatened its business operations. Duterte also banned a Rappler journalist from entering the Malacanan presidential palace. The former president’s penchant for sexist comments and sexual assault encouraged others to behave this way toward female journalists. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict established in 2018did not spare journalists, media workers and news media organisations from claims that Filipinos in these industries were part of a communist conspiracy, a practice known in the Philippines as ‘red-tagging’. The entire AlterMidya organisation, a network of alternative news media organisations known for grassroots reporting and critical analysis, has been repeatedly red-tagged and many of its members face regular harassment and intimidation. This situation has not changed under Marcos Jr. Journalist Percy Lapid was killed near his house after being accused of being a communist. Dozens of websites remain blocked, and Frenchie Mae Cumpio continues to languish in jail even as the call for her release has gone international. A culture of impunity remains entrenched in the Philippine press as the rich and powerful circumvent the law. Unsolved killings of journalists have resulted in the Philippines being perennially listed in the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Global Impunity Index for 16 consecutive years. Reporters Without Borders puts the Philippines at 134 out of 180 countries in its 2024 World Press Freedom Index and stresses that although the Marcos Jr administration may be ‘amiable’ toward the press, the ongoing media attacks are ‘still worrisome’. For its part, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has criticised Marcos Jr for his failure to protect and uphold press freedom. While the current administration claims to be transparent, Marcos Jr is largely inaccessible to the media and rarely entertains media queries. His actions suggest he does not place much value in freedom of information, given the lack of access offered to the president. Amnesty International has observed no progress in human rights under the Marcos Jr regime, nor have United Nations human rights officials. Such perceptions in the international sphere further amplify the impunity that affects Philippine society in general and the media in particular. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that there is little difference between Duterte and Marcos Jr in regard to human rights violations. Human rights group Karapatan documented 89 victims of extra-judicial killings and 13 cases of enforced disappearances from July 2022 to December 2023, among other empirical data painting a bleak picture. It does not help that Marcos Jr engages in disinformation, particularly historical denialism. He shows no remorse for what happened during his father’s dictatorship or denies the worst of it even existed. While there are news media organisations that are standing up to the current president, the Philippine news media have become mostly docile and compliant. The chilling effect is clear. Members of the media understand that if they push too hard they will wind up abused, imprisoned or even killed. Most in the industry want to avoid being the next victim. Certain media owners are either related to the Marcoses or are capitalists with diverse business interests, preferring to be on the good side of the government. They have for all intents and purposes become enablers of the regime’s media repression campaign. The Philippines must reject the normalisation of media repression. For those still fighting, the goal now is defending the constitutional right to press freedom and ending Marcos Jr’s culture of impunity.

New Strategic Synergy Between Vietnam And Malaysia – Analysis	The official visit by His Excellency To Lam, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to Malaysia creates a new chapter of Hanoi-Kuala Lumpur ties that has been rooted in historical friendship and strategic interdependence. This is Lam's first visit to Malaysia since being elected as head of the Communist Party of Vietnam in August this year, and the significance of the visit is further bolstered considering that the last time Malaysia received a visit from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam was in March 1994, a year before Vietnam's formal accession to ASEAN. The General Secretary outlined the key pillars of this new partnership, which include strengthening political trust and cooperation, particularly in defence and security, and this heralds a new chapter in strengthening political trust, and deepening synergy and partnership in areas of high politics. As Lam emphasised the need for strategic collaboration in upholding international law and contributing to regional peace, development, and prosperity, this mutual commitment elevates the combined strength and advantage in working closely together in facing common challenges in the future. The elevation to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership underscores the role of various critical sectors that benefit both nations, including green and digital economy, science and technology, new energy transition, high technology advancement,human resources development and people to people relations. Vietnam's support for Malaysia's role and upcoming role as the Asean Chair will see greater cohesion and support for promoting regional peace and stability while upholding the sanctity of international law and the rules-based order. Bilateral ties have been underpinned by the common strength and prospect of economic interdependence, especially on critical resources and technologies. Both are looking to bolster resilience and reliability in supply chain, food security, defence assurances and critical technologies of the future including semiconductor and Artificial Intelligence. It is a testament to the enduring friendship between our nations and reflects the shared commitment we hold in advancing greater partnerships for global prosperity. In the focus on developing human capital and people to people advancement, Lam spoke about the broader regional context, where education and training are essential drivers and foundations that enable ASEAN and its member states to thrive in an unpredictable world. Higher economic and trade ties will bring long lasting returns to both nations, as both face common geopolitical and global economic risks. Vietnam is emerging as one of the fastest growing economic power with the highest prospect in the world, and this will complement Malaysia's existing economic transition efforts. By capitalising on one another's strength and advantage, both will create a solid bedrock of economic and political stability not only for ASEAN but for the greater inter-regional development as emerging middle powers. As both share a similar foreign policy approach of non-alignment, peaceful advocacy for conflict management, and non use of force, both Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur are poised to reap greater regional and global expansion of economic and diplomatic roles and influence. Vietnam is committed to proactive, comprehensive, and extensive international integration, while simultaneously enhancing Vietnam's contributions and responsibilities in world politics, the global economy, and the advancement of human civilization.Both nations prioritize trade, international cooperation, and the advancement of investment and technology. Great Economic and Geopolitical Prospect of Vietnam Vietnam has exponentially expanded its economic credentials and leadership in the region since joining ASEAN, being at the forefront of the regional supply chain. and market and among the biggest upcoming economic players in the worldWith ongoing economic reforms and its advantageous location within the Southeast Asia region along with its advantageous demographic asset in its youthful population, Vietnam is poised for a global economic power. This is complemented by its enabling foreign policy of smart diplomatic outreach and advocacy for peace and stability. Maintaining a balance in diplomacy and forming strategic alliances will help solidify Vietnam's position as a stabilizing force in Southeast Asia and beyond, and as a power balancer in the increasing power rivalry, with a stabilising impact on the region and complement Malaysia's efforts. Vietnam has had growth over the last ten years with an average annual GDP increase of 6 to 7%. In 2023, Vietnam's GDP soared to $411 billion from $280 billion in 2018 – a rise that showcases its economic stability and progress. Vietnam is expected to see its economy grow significantly by 2034 with a GDP exceeding $700 billion and a GDP per capita surpassing $10 000 as it moves towards becoming a middle income nation. By the year 2030, it is estimated that Vietnam will see a rise in its middle class population to around 45 million individuals; this growth is expected to boost spending and increase the demand for premium products and services in the country. Vietnam's digital economy is projected to reach $57 billion by 2025 from $23 billion recorded back in 2022 due to the expansion of e-commerce platforms and IT services, alongside the rise of the fintech industry. Vietnam has also quickly become a major export production hub for global manufacturers like South Korea's LG and Samsung Electronics, suppliers to Apple, Inc. and auto makers like Honda and Toyota. The government of Vietnam has pledged to allocate $117 billion, towards infrastructure initiatives from 2024, to 2030 focusing on advancements and projects, and expanding ports such as Hai Phong and Cai Mep Thie Vai to facilitate commerce. Vietnam is at the forefront of the shift towards renewable energy in Southeast Asia.Renewable energy accounted for 13.7% of Vietnam's electricity generation in 2023. It plans to boost its wind and solar power capacity to 45 gigawatts by 2030. Vietnam's young, tech-savvy population is driving innovation. The country's workforce has a median age of 32.5 years and high literacy rates, fostering innovation in startups and technology. The prospects for the coming decade are solid, driven by strong economic fundamentals, strategic geopolitical positioning, and pragmatic foreign policy. Both countries have similar strategic economic positioning and power roles in uplifting the voice and role of ASEAN and beyond. By capitalizing on Vietnam's strengths and elevating strategic partnerships, Malaysia can serve as a strategic partner in reaping joint benefits to be on track to emerge as a joint economic powerhouse and a stabilizing force in regional and global geopolitics. The visit by Lam will prove to be a historic chapter for both nations in presenting a more united front amidst escalating challenges in the region, and to synergise new areas of critical partnerships in key sectors, especially in defence and security and economic and trade realm, further uplifting the trajectories for high-income nation status for both nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFyldmmbkFqPY	2024-11-24T16:05:08-08:00	
India-China Border Agreement: A Case For Military Buildup – Analy...	By Kartik Bommakanti With India and China reaching a limited agreement on the disengagement from and patrolling of the Depsang Bulge and Demchok areas in eastern Ladakh, there is widespread jubilation in some quarters. The celebration of this breakthrough announced on 21 October 2024, should be tempered by the reality that there is still a significant amount of disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction of forces to be completed by New Delhi and Beijing. Pending further negotiations, under the latest agreement, the following friction points were left out—Galwan Valley (PP 14), Pangong Tso (North and South Banks), Gogra (PP 17A) and Hotsprings (PP 15). These four areas are currently under buffer zones that prohibit patrolling, meaning the status quo ante, has not been restored completely. Meanwhile, with Depsang and Demchok, India and China have agreed to 'coordinated patrolling,' which one analyst described as an 'innovation.' This is misleading and deceptive because it is not an innovation, but a restriction on patrolling. There are three patrolling restrictions under the latest agreement. Firstly, each patrol team cannot exceed 14 troops. Secondly, the other side must be notified before embarking on a patrol. Thirdly, the number of patrols that Indian and Chinese forces can conduct cannot exceed two or three every month, to all the points they deem part of their territory in Depsang and Demchok. Indeed, though India can patrol areas in Demchok, it is not permitted to patrol Charding La—a key pass. In addition, there is a quid pro quo. Just as India has gained patrolling access to Demchok and Depsang up to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13, which it last secured access to in January 2020, China has gained a reciprocal concession by way of an 'escorted patrol' in the Yangste area of Arunachal Pradesh, as well as another location. These patrolling restrictions did not apply under the terms of the 1993 and 1996 agreements. Further, these 'innovations' are ultimately a concession to the Chinese because most of the territory that the Chinese occupied in April-May 2020 was primarily India-dominated, if not India-controlled, territory. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) maintains that '…verification patrolling has commenced on mutually agreed terms in Demchok and Depsang.' Nevertheless, restrictive conditions have been built into this agreement, in a quest to avoid clashes between Chinese and Indian forces. Only time will tell whether this arrangement will deliver the stabilising impact that the Modi government claims it is intended to achieve. Theoretically, clashes could still occur even under the new patrolling arrangement. Beijing has numerous opportunities to rake up trouble along the entire stretch of the 3,500 kilometres of contested boundary between India and China. India has had to accept these restrictive conditions as the price for resuming a limited patrolling agreement at Demchok and the Depsang Plains. The Chinese have compelled India to accept a shift in the terms of prior patrolling arrangements, and India’s consent implies a tacit acceptance of China’s case that earlier patrolling arrangements—as a result of agreements in 1993, 1996, 2005, and 2012—were unworkable or ineffective. Where does that leave India’s quest to restore the status ante of April 2020? Despite the Modi government’s impressive infrastructure build-up along the Sino-Indian boundary, which was one of the key reasons for the Chinese precipitating the ongoing boundary crisis, has New Delhi conceded to Beijing’s demands that it will limit further infrastructure development, especially the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) road? The government will have to come clean and clarify these matters. To its credit, the Modi government has invested heavily in border infrastructure and introduced vital changes in the military command structure. Under the interim budget in February 2024, the government has allocated more capital to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to beef up infrastructure in critical parts along the Sino-Indian border, such as the Nyoma Airfield in Ladakh, Shinku La Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh, the Nechiphu Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh and several others. Supplementing this infrastructure build-up, visible change is underway in the Indian Army’s conversion of its Headquarters Uttar Bharat (HQ-UB) into a new comprehensively operational Corp. This change is geared toward shifting the focus from the peacetime duties of the HQ-UB, which is now a Corps, to a Line of Actual Control (LaC) in the Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand sectors. These are very indispensable and laudable measures. Although the government is performing commendably on these two metrics, it is insufficient. Although the Modi government’s work on India’s border infrastructure paved the way for India’s military mobilisation against China’s annexation of Indian territory in April-May 2020, it has to do more to accumulate military strength through additional capital expenditure. Since 2017, well before the eruption of the current boundary crisis between India and China, there has not been significant growth in the defence budget, especially in capital acquisitions. Growth has been primarily in revenue expenditure which covers pensions, allowances, salaries and so on. This high growth of revenue spending is also driven by 'One Rank, One Pension' (OROP). Even with the introduction of the Agnipath recruitment scheme, cost savings that are intended to help pay for capital acquisitions in the armed services, will not reap benefits until many years later. Engagement with Beijing without militarily equipping the Indian armed forces with additional capabilities conveys weakness. It will run the risk of inviting more crises and possibly a serious military conflagration with the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

Liberty Squandered: The English Tradition From Magna Carta To Emp...	By Vibhu Vikramaditya The identity of a people often shapes the nature and trajectory of their government. In England, a deep-rooted belief in individual liberty has profoundly influenced the nation’s legal and cultural institutions, shaping English society from the early Middle Ages through the Industrial Revolution. This identity—forged through centuries of struggle and self-definition—established a legacy of individual rights, due process, and a balanced approach to law and order. The Magna Carta of 1215, for instance, set a groundbreaking precedent by binding even the king to the rule of law and affirming that Englishmen were 'free-born.' This commitment was further solidified by the development of English common law, which emphasized justice and protection for all citizens, regardless of rank, including the monarch. In 1707, however, a significant shift occurred with the Act of Union, which joined England and Scotland under a single British identity. This transformation required England’s traditions of liberty and local governance to adapt to a centralized imperial authority, reconfiguring individual freedoms within a larger imperial framework. Although these ideals persisted, they began to reflect the needs of an expanding empire, aligning liberty with broader, centralized control. The legacy of English liberty stands at a precarious threshold. The recent UK government advisory, 'Think before you post,' cloaked in public welfare, quietly undermines the freedoms that once defined English identity. Once a steadfast guardian of individual rights, the government now leans toward surveillance and constraint, drifting alarmingly from its founding principles of liberty and due process. This subtle shift suggests a future where the very freedoms that shaped English society are at risk of being quietly surrendered. Evolving Traditions of English Liberty The Magna Carta was originally a series of rebellious victories that compelled the English monarchy to state rights formally that had previously been assumed. First issued in 1215 by King John under pressure from rebellious barons, the document marked a significant shift by formally acknowledging several protections like the right to fair trial and justice. Although annulled shortly after by Pope Innocent III, it was reissued in 1216, 1217, and 1225 under King Henry III, each version reinforcing the principle that the monarchy was bound by law and individual rights were inviolable. Over time, the Magna Carta became a lasting symbol of accountable governance and the protection of fundamental rights, invoked repeatedly by the English against tyranny. The Levellers adopted and expanded upon the ideas of natural law in England during the Wars of Three Kingdoms (1639 -1653), Lilburne particularly argued that government must be based on a contract with the people, one that exists to protect the 'freeborn rights' of every individual. John Lilburne, a prominent Leveller, asserted that 'every man by nature was born with as much freedom as any other man.' Furthermore, Richard Overton, another key Leveller, linked the concept of freeborn rights to the ancient liberties of England, arguing that these liberties were the birthright of every Englishman and were to be upheld by the rational law of nature. He argued that every person should be judged by the law of nature or rule of reason. He advocated for the inherent rights of self-ownership and freedom from aggression, which he believed belonged to all individuals by their humanity. The Levellers’ manifesto, An Agreement of the People, advocated for constitutional reforms to establish a government that truly represented and protected citizens’ rights, including freedom of religion, the press, and conscience. It called for equality before the law, the rule of law, protection of private property, and a democratically-elected parliament. It inspired the Radical Whigs and, subsequently, the Liberal Party. In the 19th century, the Whigs and the Liberal Party championed these principles, promoting greater suffrage, the removal of trade barriers, and the elimination of price and wage controls to foster economic freedom and market competition. The Levellers’ vision resonated with common law’s principles of due process, reason, and communal judgment. Due process mandated transparency and adherence to procedures, safeguarding against arbitrary rule. Trial by jury empowered peers to judge, highlighting fairness and public accountability. Guided by precedent, common law ensured consistency and restrained the whims of those in power, emphasizing rational adjudication and judicial independence to ground justice in enduring principles over fleeting policies. In the early 17th century, Sir Edward Coke’s interpretation of common law reshaped English legal principles by establishing a framework of liberty that bound even the monarch. His ruling in Dr. Bonham’s Case (1610) argued that 'the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them utterly void' if they contravene basic principles of 'common right and reason.' This marked a foundational assertion that courts could nullify laws infringing on individual rights, prefiguring the principle of judicial review that would later become central to constitutional law. Coke’s landmark work, The Institutes of the Lawes of England, expanded on this philosophy, asserting that 'the king himself ought not to be under man, but under God and the law.' This statement directly opposed the doctrine of the divine right of kings, asserting that the monarch was also bound by common law, a revolutionary stance in his era. Coke’s interpretation insisted that law was supreme over all authority, positioning the judiciary as a crucial check on both royal and parliamentary overreach. Through his legal writings and judgments, Coke codified the view of common law as a protector of inherent rights and a constraint on sovereign power. His ideas set the stage for modern constitutionalism particularly in the United States and the rest of the world, cementing judicial oversight as a safeguard against the erosion of civil liberties by any governing power. From English Liberty to Imperial Subject: The Quiet Conquest of England In his 1899 critique, The Conquest of the United States by Spain, William Graham Sumner warned with biting clarity that while the United States had vanquished Spain militarily, it stood on the precipice of an internal defeat by adopting Spain’s authoritarian practices. Sumner’s words cut to imperialism’s core: in subjugating others, a nation risks eroding its own fundamental values, reshaped by the oppressive systems it enforces abroad. His warning is a clear caution against the lure of empire, where the conqueror risks self-loss in conquest. As England’s empire expanded in the 17th and 18th centuries, local English identity gave way to an imperial British identity, dismantling centuries-old liberties. Acts like the Navigation Acts (1651), Stamp Act (1765), and Declaratory Act (1766) ravaged colonial rights, restricting trade, undermining due process, and asserting Britain’s absolute control. The 1707 Act of Union suppressed Scottish autonomy, centralizing power for imperial cohesion. This legal onslaught sacrificed the 'free-born Englishman' ideal, replacing local justice with exploitation and deepening colonial resentment. The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 imposed taxes without colonial representation, violating the English constitutional principle that taxation required consent—rooted in the Magna Carta and reaffirmed by the 1689 Bill of Rights. These measures sowed resentment that ultimately led to the loss of the American colonies, as they fought to affirm their natural rights. The establishment of Vice-Admiralty Courts in the colonies marked a stark departure from English legal traditions. These courts, operating without juries and presided over by Crown-appointed judges, denied colonists the right to a fair trial—a bedrock of English justice. The Sugar Act of 1764 further empowered these courts to try smuggling cases that, in England, would have been heard in common law courts with juries. This denial of basic legal protections signaled Britain’s disregard for its own principles in favor of enforcing imperial dominance. The British Empire’s expansion necessitated an increasingly centralized government that directly interfered with local governance, diminishing the English tradition of decentralized authority. The Declaratory Act of 1766, for instance, unequivocally imposed Parliament’s supremacy, stripping colonial assemblies of any legislative power by allowing British lawmakers to legislate for the colonies 'in all cases whatsoever.' This act nullified the longstanding colonial self-governance system, effectively rendering local legislative bodies powerless and consolidating control in London. Moreover, the arbitrary expansion of executive power in both Britain and its colonies severely eroded the rule of law, enabling unchecked governmental authority. The Suspension of Habeas Corpus Act of 1794, enacted in response to perceived revolutionary threats, allowed indefinite detention without trial, a direct violation of the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act that had protected citizens from arbitrary imprisonment. This suspension prioritized state security over individual rights, marking a stark departure from English legal principles. In American colonies, governors wielded vast authority under the King’s commission, bypassing colonial assemblies and enacting laws or raising taxes without local consent, fueling resentment and ultimately rebellion. Such unilateral executive actions highlighted the extent to which the British Empire prioritized imperial control over the adherence to fair governance and legal integrity. In conclusion, while much of the foundational principles of English liberty has been eroded through imperial expansion and centralized authority, there is hope for a revival—a new renaissance of the ideals that once defined the nation. By reawakening the commitment to individual rights, due process, and accountable governance, society can reclaim its identity rooted in freedom and justice.

A Defining Moment In The Ukraine War – OpEd	The Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement on Thursday regarding the two attacks by Western long-range weapons on Russian territory on November 19 and 21 and Moscow’s reactive strike on a facility within Ukraine’s defence industrial complex in the city of Dnepropetrovsk with a hitherto unknown non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile named Oreshnik. On Friday, at a meeting in the Kremlin with the military top brass, Putin revisited the topic where he clarified that Oreshnik not really at an 'experimental' stage, as Pentagon had determined, but its serial production has actually commenced. And he added, 'Given the particular strength of this weapon, its power, it will be put into service with the Strategic Missile Forces.' He then went on to reveal, 'It is also important that along with the Oreshnik system, several similar systems are currently being tested in Russia. Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. In other words, we have a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems.' Putin reflected on the geopolitical backdrop: 'The current military and political situation in the world is largely determined by the results of competition in the creation of new technologies, new weapons systems and economic development.' Succinctly put, the escalatory move authorised by the US president Joe Biden has boomeranged. Did Biden bite more than he could chew? This is the first thing. The US apparently decided that Putin’s 'red lines' and Russia’s nuclear deterrence were the stuff of rhetoric. Washington was clueless about the existence of a wonder weapon like the Oreshnik in the Russian armoury that is as demonic frightening as a nuclear missile in its sheer destructive apocalyptic potential but will spare human lives. Putin added calmly that Russia intends to give advance notice to civilians to get out of the way before Oreshnik heads for its designated target to annihilate it. The shock and awe in the western capitals speaks for itself. Biden avoided commenting on the issue when asked by reporters. The Oreshnik is not an upgrade of old Soviet-era systems but 'relies entirely on contemporary cutting-edge innovations,' Putin stressed. Izvestia reported that Oreshnik is a new generation of Russian intermediate-range missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000km and potentially extending to 5,000km, but not intercontinental, equipped with multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRV) — ie., having separating warheads with individual guidance units. It has a speed between Mach 10 and Mach 11 (exceeding 12,000 kms per hour). The Russian daily Readovka reported that with an estimated 1,500 kgs of combat payload, lifting to a maximum height of 12 km and moving at a speed of Mach 10, the Oreshnik launched from the Russian base at Kaliningrad would strike Warsaw in 1 minute 21 seconds; Berlin, 2 min 35 sec; Paris, 6 min 52 sec; and London, 6 min 56 sec. In his statement on Thursday, Putin said, 'there are no means of countering such weapons today. Missiles attack targets at a speed of Mach 10, which is 2.5 to 3 kilometres per second. Air defence systems currently available in the world and missile defence systems being created by the Americans in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. It is impossible.' Indeed, a terribly beauty is born. For, Oreshnik is not just an effective hypersonic weapon and is neither a strategic weapon nor an intercontinental ballistic missile. But its striking power is such that when used en masse and in combination with other long-range precision systems, its effect and power is on par with strategic weapons. Yet, it is not a weapon of mass destruction — rather, it’s a high-precision weapon. Serial production implies that dozens of Oreshnik are in the process of being deployed, which means that no US / NATO staff group and no Anglo-American target intelligence unit in bunkers in Kiev or Lvov is safe any longer. Oreshnik is also a signal to the incoming US president Donald Trump who is ad nauseam calling for an immediate end-of-war settlement. Oreshnik, ironically, has been developed only as Moscow’s reaction to the hawkish decision by then US president Trump in 2019 to unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Soviet-American treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF). Hence this also signals that Moscow’s trust in Trump is near zero. To drive home this point, on the very same day Oreshnik emerged out of its silo, Tass carried an unusual interview with a top Russian think tanker affiliated to the foreign ministry and Kremlin — Andrey Sushentsov, program director of the Valdai Discussion Club, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s MGIMO International Relations Department, and member of the Scientific Council under the Russian Security Council. The following excerpts of the interview, plain-speaking and startling, should scatter the hypothesis that there is something special going on between Trump and Putin: 'Trump is considering ending the Ukrainian crisis, not out of any sympathy for Russia, but because he acknowledges that Ukraine has no realistic chance of winning. His goal is to preserve Ukraine as a tool for US interests, focusing on freezing the conflict rather than resolving it. Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The US continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.' 'The United States has regained its position as the European Union’s top trading partner for the first time in years. It is the Europeans who are bearing the financial burden of prolonging the Ukrainian crisis, while the US has no interest in resolving it. Instead, it is more beneficial for them to freeze the conflict, keeping Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia and as a persistent hotspot in Europe to maintain their confrontational approach.' 'Trump has made numerous statements that differ from the policies of Joe Biden’s administration. However, the US state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trump’s ideas will come to fruition.' 'Trump will have a two-year window before the midterm congressional elections, during which he will have a certain freedom to push his policies through the Senate and the House of Representatives. After that, his decisions could face resistance both domestically and from US allies.' Make no mistake, Russia is under no illusions. Putin will not waver from the conditions he outlined in June for resolving the conflict: the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya; Kiev’s commitment to abstain from joining NATO; the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia; and the establishment of a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine. Clearly, this war will continue on its course till it reaches its only logical conclusion, which is Russian victory. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev is spot on when he said in an interview with Al Arabiya yesterday that the use of Oreshnik missile 'changes the course' of the Ukrainian conflict. The Western capitals will have to reconcile with the reality that the scope for escalation of the war is ending. Make no mistake, if another ATAMCS strike inside Russia is attempted, it will have devastating consequences for the West. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic put it nicely: 'If you [NATO] think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal.'

Cambodia, Laos Sack Foreign Ministers In Preparation For More Com...	By David Hutt On Nov. 19, Sok Chenda Sophea, who was only brought in as Cambodia’s foreign minister last year, was given the heave-ho and replaced by his predecessor, Prak Sokhonn. The previous day, the urbane and much-praised Saleumxay Kommasith was dismissed as the foreign minister of Laos and demoted upstairs to the Prime Minister’s Office. It is unusual for foreign ministers in both countries to be reshuffled. Sok Chenda Sophea was only the third foreign minister since the ruling Cambodian People’s Party cemented its power in 1998; Saleumxay was only the fourth foreign minister since the communist takeover in Laos in 1975. In one interpretation, Saleumxay was merely a casualty of an ongoing carve-up of the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party by the Siphadones and Phomvihanes, the two most important political clans. It is expected that 2025 will be a year of horse trading and in-fighting between grandees ahead of the National Congress in January 2026, when the party’s new five-year leadership is announced. Saleumxay was replaced by Thongsavanh Phomvihane, previously head of the ruling communist party’s foreign policy commission and brother of the National Assembly chair, Saysomphone Phomvihane. Saysomphone stands a good chance of becoming the next party chief, but there are still doubts about whether Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, the scion of the Siphandone clan, will get a second term. Uncertain geopolitics ahead Once considered the party’s 'crown prince,' Sonexay’s reputation has suffered badly because of his handling of Laos’s ongoing economic catastrophe, which shows no signs of improving. Saleumxay was seen by some as a challenger to Sonexay, especially after impressing this year as the minister who guided Laos’s ASEAN chairmanship. Yet, he was not universally popular within the ruling communist party. Many apparatchiks perceived him as an aloof, independent-minded upstart who rose too quickly. Removing Saleumxay increases Sonexay’s chances of keeping his job. Putting a Phomvihane in the foreign ministry also increases that family’s influence, too. Beyond domestic political concerns, the removal of the two foreign ministers comes as their governments prepare for more uncertain times internationally. According to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, Prak’s reappointment will increase the 'government’s capabilities' amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. Prak is an experienced diplomat accustomed to fighting Cambodia’s corner amid new Cold War rivalries, whereas Sok Chenda Sophea was principally an economics-minded functionary – appointed last year because he wasn’t geopolitically-minded. The neophyte Hun Manet administration wanted a foreign minister who would focus entirely on increasing trade and investment, which was Sok Chenda Sophea’s sole remit as the former head of Cambodia’s investment council. Under Sok Chenda, the foreign ministry shifted many of its diplomatic duties, allowing it to concentrate on tapping foreign governments for more money. That left other ruling party grandees like Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen, still in power in Phnom Penh, to operate their own foreign policy – pursuing controversial issues, like the territorial disputes with neighboring Vietnam and Thailand, that could impair economic relations. Trump tariffs Phnom Penh presumably thinks this dual system is no longer workable. Donald Trump’s return as U.S. president in 2025 means Washington will no longer separate geopolitics from trade, so it makes little sense for Phnom Penh to do so, either. Moreover, it knows it will face a much more hostile relationship with the incoming Trump administration, with its threatened blanket 10-20% tariff on global imports when the U.S. is the largest purchaser of Cambodian goods. Trump also will bring Marco Rubio in as secretary of state. Washington’s leading China hawk is expected to take a much tougher stance on Beijing’s partners in Asia, such as Cambodia, and on mainland Southeast Asia’s vast scam industry that is increasingly victimizing U.S. citizens. Unlike Sok Chenda Sophea, Prak is more of a ruling-party partisan who can push back against U.S. criticism. Presumably, Phnom Penh realizes it’ll soon have to wade into a new fight with Washington, making it even more important to be on the best terms with Beijing. Beijing won’t be displeased by Prak’s return. Attuned to Beijing China is believed to have grown weary with some of the princelings installed in Hu Manet’s cabinet during last year’s vast generational succession process. It has been lobbying for the return of Prak, an old-style politician who understands how Beijing prefers things to be done. In Vientiane, Saleumxay did a good job in recent years of pitching Laos to the rest of the world, including the West, and as the only fluent English speaker in the Politburo was key to securing some important development assistance packages from Japan, the U.S., and European states. Yet Laos’s dire economic situation, particularly its massive debts to China, isn’t improving, and only Beijing has the ability to assist meaningfully. A damning report by the IMF published last week noted that Laos’s economy 'critically relies on the continued extension of debt relief from China.' Vientiane knows it must narrow its foreign relations again to focus squarely on China. Indeed, the communist party is eager to find a more senior role for pro-Beijing figures like Sommath Pholsena, currently a deputy president of the National Assembly and a childhood friend of Xi Jinping, China’s president. He’ll likely be the next National Assembly chair. Thongsavanh Phomvihane, the new foreign minister, started his career at Laos’s embassy in Beijing, has closer ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and is more of a party loyalist than Saleumxay. Like Prak, he’s an older, more traditional and safer pair of hands, someone who understands what Beijing wants and how to provide that.

Global Shifts Suggest Syria’s ‘Waiting Game’ Could Pay Off – Anal...	By Christopher Phillips At the height of Syria’s civil war, Bente Scheller, a political scientist and former German diplomat, published 'The Wisdom of Syria’s Waiting Game.' In it, she argued that Syrian foreign policy under President Bashar Assad and, before that, his father Hafez Assad had long followed a strategy of 'waiting out' international difficulties and crises. Damascus would rarely change the policies that provoked ire from outsiders, but instead waited for former critics to soften their stance.This has been Assad’s approach since the Syria conflict exploded in 2011, refusing demands to loosen his brutal grip on power, confident that, with considerable help from allies Russia and Iran, eventually it will be his enemies that bend. Thirteen years after many in the international community cut ties with Damascus and erected sanctions, the regional climate appears to be shifting, and Assad may believe that Syria’s waiting game is once again paying off.Syria’s international rehabilitation has already begun. Even during the civil war, Damascus was never fully isolated. As well as allies Russia, Iran, and China, significant powers, notably Brazil and India, declined to sever ties. As it became clear Assad would survive, a trickle of Arab states, such as the UAE, Egypt, and Jordan, which had called for his overthrow reestablished ties. In 2023, Saudi Arabia favored Syria’s return to the Arab League after its suspension 12 years earlier.But there is still a long way to go. While back in the Arab League and attending regional events such as the recent Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Assad is far from fully reintegrated. Jordan, among others, protests the flow of Captagon from Syria, allegedly overseen by the Assad regime, while trade and diplomatic relations with the Arab world remain far below pre-2011 levels. Despite low-level talks with Ankara, detente with Turkiye appears to have stalled over continued Turkish control of northern Syria. Meanwhile, relations with the EU and the US remain severed, with economic sanctions still in place.However, three recent developments could shift the dial. First, the Lebanon war. Almost 500,000 people have sought sanctuary in Syria since October, mostly Syrians who fled war in their own country during the previous decade. This helps Assad paint a more positive international image of his war-torn state — even if many refugees are reportedly trying to move on to either Iraq or rebel-held northern Syria. It also increases Syria’s importance to the international aid community and raises the, albeit remote, possibility that Damascus might be included in Lebanese peace talks.A further benefit is that though the decimation of its ally Hezbollah is a blow, it shifts the balance in the Hezbollah-Syria-Iran relationship more in Assad’s favor. Second, the continued rise of populist right-wing parties in Europe increases the chance that ties with the continent could improve. Populist governments in Hungary and Italy have already pushed for the EU to loosen sanctions in exchange for Assad taking back Syrian refugees, and Rome even reopened its Damascus embassy in September.A key development could be the German elections in February, should this result in a far-right Alternative for Germany triumph. Germany and France have led EU opposition to Assad and pushed against those calling for improving ties. But the AFD met with Syrian officials in 2019, and has previously mooted collaborating with Assad to repatriate many of the Syrians living in Germany. Even if the AFD is frozen out of government by other parties, a strong election performance might persuade Germany’s leaders to alter their uncompromising stance on Assad.Finally, there is the reelection of Donald Trump. On the one hand, there are signs that Trump’s return could benefit Assad. His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently noted how Trump wants to remove US troops from northeastern Syria. This would likely benefit Assad, who wants to recapture all this region. Kurdish forces, currently administering there under US protection, would probably be forced to reconcile with Assad in the face of the alternative: attack by Turkiye. Such an outcome could also help oil the stalled detente with Ankara. Neutralizing the Kurdish autonomous region might lessen Turkish security concerns or, alternatively, Assad might be more open to a phased Turkish withdrawal from the north, having recently captured the east.It is also possible that Assad’s relative neutrality during the Gaza war — not joining its allies Iran and Hezbollah in fighting Israel — may be rewarded with a less hawkish approach from the Trump administration. Tulsi Gabbard, named as director of national intelligence, visited Syria and met Assad in 2017 while a Congresswoman, and her nomination supports the possibility that the new White House could be less hostile. A softer US view of Russia under Trump might also benefit Assad. While the lifting of US sanctions on Damascus appears unlikely, Assad may hope that a less aggressive White House will enforce them less vigilantly.Yet, Trump showed during his first term how unpredictable he can be, and his approach could easily break the other way. Should Trump ramp up his hostility to Iran, as he did before, Assad is unlikely to cut ties with Tehran, which remains the cornerstone of Syria’s foreign policy. In such circumstances, Syria could once again be in Trump’s crosshairs.However, although the geopolitical wheel appears to be turning, it is far from clear Assad will seize this opportunity. It requires considerable diplomatic skill to utilize these changing circumstances effectively. Although the Syrian leader has followed his father’s 'waiting game' diplomacy, it is yet to be seen if he has inherited Hafez Assad’s ability to navigate a way back into international favor. Despite more advantageous conditions, Syria could yet remain a relative pariah. • Christopher Phillips is professor of international relations at Queen Mary University of London and author of ‘Battleground: Ten Conflicts that Explain the New Middle East.’ X: @cjophillips	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3HzjBmuI2jm	2024-11-24T15:57:57-08:00	
ZAVNOBiH And The Continuity Of Statehood In Bosnia And Herzegovin...	By Dr Mirko Pejanović Following the loss of its state independence in 1463 during the medieval era, Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a distinct multi-confessional, multicultural, and geographically cohesive entity until the mid-20th century, under the rule of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, and later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This status persisted until the imposition of King Alexander I Karadjordjević's January 6th Dictatorship in 1929 and the subsequent reorganisation of Yugoslavia into nine banovinas. Between 1941 and 1945, during the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina became the primary battleground for National Liberation and the anti-fascist struggle led by partisan forces against the occupying powers on Yugoslav territory. The idea of ZAVNOBiH emerged within the framework of the National Liberation Movement. After the organisational and political arrangements were made, the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) convened on 25 November 1943 in Mrkonjić Grad. During this First Session, 247 delegates from across Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a historic decision to restore and re-establish the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the will of the councillors of the First Session of ZAVNOBiH, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, enjoying equal status with the other five Yugoslav republics. This decision was confirmed at the Second Session of AVNOJ on 29 November 1943. During the three-year national liberation and anti-fascist struggle, the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina secured the right to politically shape and organise their homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a fraternal and indivisible state union—a union that enshrines the national equality of Croats, Serbs, and Muslims (Bosniaks). The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was solidified through the decisions made at the Second Session of ZAVNOBiH (Sanski Most 1944.), particularly in terms of establishing state institutions. At this session, the Decision on the Structure and Organisation of National Liberation Committees and the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights were adopted, guaranteeing democratic freedoms for citizens as individuals and equality among the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At its Third Session, held in liberated Sarajevo in 1945, ZAVNOBiH transformed into the Provisional People's Assembly and passed the Law on the Formation of the First People's Government of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina. The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, grounded in the principles of ZAVNOBiH, was constitutionally defined with the adoption of the First Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Constitutional Assembly of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1946. Since then, Bosnia and Herzegovina has functioned as a people's state with a republican system of governance. More than four decades of peaceful development For over four decades, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced peaceful development, characterised by complete unity in managing economic and social growth. Between the early 1960s and the 1990s, the country achieved remarkable progress and renewal in both economic and cultural spheres. Its economy was restructured, transitioning from basic to processing industries, and employment reached one million citizens. The population grew to over four million. All children of primary school age were included in basic education. In addition to the University of Sarajevo, universities were established in Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Mostar. The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ANUBiH) was also founded. All 109 municipalities were connected to Sarajevo, the capital, by paved roads. In the late 1960s, a historic decision formally recognised the national identity of the Muslim (Bosniak) people. This process of full national emancipation went hand in hand with the strengthening of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s autonomy and statehood within the Yugoslav Federation. The introduction of a multi-party system At the beginning of the 1990s, as the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation entered its final stage, Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the historic challenge of transitioning to political pluralism by introducing a multi-party system and deciding its political future through democratic means. The multi-party Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, elected in the country’s first multi-party elections in 1990, passed a decision in January 1992 to hold a citizens’ referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereign and independent state-legal status. All political parties, both ruling and opposition, supported the referendum, with the exception of Karadžić’s Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). In collaboration with Milošević’s regime, the SDS sought to dismantle and deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s historically established republican statehood. Through their democratic will, with a 64% voter turnout from all ethnic groups and 99% support for the referendum question, citizens decided that their country, homeland, and state should attain the status of a sovereign and independent nation. In this way, they determined the future of their Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on democratic and anti-fascist principles. Honouring the will of the citizens, the countries of the European Union, the United States, and a vast number of countries across the world granted Bosnia and Herzegovina international recognition in early April 1992. This overwhelming support from the global community culminated on 22 May 1992, when Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted as a full member of the United Nations. With its internationally recognised borders, Bosnia and Herzegovina attained international legal subjectivity in the final decade of the 20th century. Through the citizens’ referendum and the international recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the democratic forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina successfully countered efforts to divide the country and dismantle its republican statehood during this turbulent period. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina was denied the opportunity to peacefully develop its sovereign statehood and independence. This peaceful course was violently disrupted by an aggressive war imposed by Milošević’s regime. By the late 1980s, this regime had seized control of the former Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA), bringing it under its command. Using the military power of the JNA—renamed the Army of the Republic of the Serbian People in May 1992—ethnic cleansing of non-Serb populations was conducted in the territory declared as the Republic of the Serbian People. This campaign culminated in mass atrocities against civilians and the genocide of Bosniaks in Srebrenica. Resistance and defence of the sovereignty and multi-ethnic character of the state Democratic and patriotic forces mobilised to resist and defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multi-ethnic identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Leading the organisation of this resistance and defence was the multi-ethnic Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The wartime Presidency of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ensured political unity in directing the country’s defence efforts. This unity was defined in the Platform for the Activity of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Conditions of War, which reaffirmed the principles of ZAVNOBiH in light of new historical circumstances. Based on this Platform, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were established, with the defence of the country led by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the war were pursued through the state delegation’s engagement with peace plans within the framework of international peace conferences. After the United States assumed leadership in shaping peace initiatives, the Washington Peace Agreement was signed in 1994, followed by the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995. With the Dayton Peace Agreement of November 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina entered a historic era of peacebuilding and the development of state institutions. This process was based on the internationalisation of peacebuilding efforts, with the international community and the European Union authorised to play a role in fostering peace, strengthening the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and integrating it into Euro-Atlantic institutions (the Council of Europe, the European Union, and NATO). It is certain that compliance with the EU acquis during Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership negotiations will further develop solutions for the functioning of state institutions, which remain significantly constrained by the Dayton Constitution. At the start of the 21st century, a historic challenge emerged in the form of accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina's integration into the European Union. One of the key factors behind this momentum has been the geopolitical changes in Europe and beyond. Since 2022, peace in Europe—and consequently in the Western Balkans—has been jeopardised due to the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, violating its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In response to this threat, the institutions of the European Union decided, at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status for EU membership and to open accession negotiations. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, achieving membership in the European Union means overcoming the challenge of becoming a democratic, lawful, and economically prosperous state within the community of free nations and states in Europe. The majority of citizens strongly support an accelerated path toward EU membership, aspiring to achieve this goal by the end of the third decade of the 21st century. To realise this objective, comprehensive measures are required to ensure the effective functioning of the parliamentary majority at the state level. In this context, it is crucial to develop a unified reform agenda and establish full coordination between the activities of the international community and EU institutions on one side, and governing parties and civil society organisations on the other. Reinforcing political pluralism on civic principles It is essential to halt the destructive impact of ethno-nationalist policies and strengthen political pluralism based on civic foundations. One of the key levers for accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina’s integration into the European Union is the inclusion of a European clause in the country’s Constitution. This provision would facilitate the swift adoption of legislation enabling the transposition of the Acquis Communautaire by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this context, intensifying the activities of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) would be crucial. Leveraging its Bonn powers, the OHR should impose sanctions and exert various forms of pressure to eliminate individuals and entities that promote institutional blockades, deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s statehood, undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement, or endanger peace in the public political arena. The rising threat of nationalism advocating the secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina poses a serious risk to the country’s peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Preventing the evident dangers of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s disintegration will require the international community and the country’s democratic, multi-ethnic forces to accelerate its integration into the European Union. In addition to the threat of secession, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also grappling with the danger of demographic depletion caused by the large-scale emigration of its working-age population to European Union countries.

Sudan’s War Threatens To Create Widespread Ethnic Conflict – Anal...	Sudan’s war is inflaming ethnic tensions across the country and threatening to turn the battle between two military factions into a broader war along tribal lines. 'The escalation of war narratives by both sides is fueling ethnically charged rhetoric,' the Advocacy Group for Peace in Sudan (AGPS) said in a statement. The group said that inflammatory claims by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have spurred dangerous regional and ethnic mobilization. The AGPS compared Sudan’s rising ethnic animosity to the early stages of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. 'Sudan stands on the brink,' the group wrote, urging leaders on both sides to moderate their rhetoric and seek a peaceful solution to the conflict that has killed more than 62,000 and displaced millions since April 2023. Observers say attacks by the RSF on civilians in the al-Gezira and Darfur regions, among others, are driving the rise of ethnic militias as a form of communal self-defense. 'There is no safe place in Sudan now,' Mohamed Chande Othman, head of a recent United Nations fact-finding mission, said in a statement. In al-Gezira, the RSF launched a series of ethnically motivated attacks after one of its local leaders, Abu Agla Keikil, defected to the SAF. The attacks killed 124 civilians and led to more than 37 sexual assaults, according to journalist Martin Plaut, who writes about insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Plaut reported that five RSF advisors defected at the end of October. In Darfur, RSF assaults on non-Arab tribal groups, such as the Masalit, have mirrored the genocidal attacks on the population that the RSF’s predecessor, the Janjaweed, launched in Darfur 20 years ago. The RSF draws from Darfur’s ethnically Arab Rizeigat community. Sudan’s ethnically motivated attacks in West Darfur have included abductions of young and old women by RSF fighters for sexual slavery. Victims have reported their attackers telling them: 'We will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children.' Ethnic attacks in Darfur prompted two local militias, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement, to align themselves with the SAF against the RSF in April. Both groups are based in the non-Arab Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit communities. A day later, RSF fighters burned down several non-Arab villages in North Darfur. With 19 major ethnic groups and nearly 600 sub-groups among its 49 million citizens, Sudan risks devolving further into intertribal conflict as the war between the SAF and RSF continues, according to observers. If that happens, Sudan’s conflict could engulf neighboring Chad, which shares tribal ties along its border with Darfur. The Zaghawa tribe, for example, spans the Chad-Sudan border. So does the Rizeigat group that makes up much of the RSF. A tribal conflict in North Darfur could draw in fighters from Chad, according to Remadji Hoinathy, an expert with South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies. 'Zaghawa people from remote villages in Chad — who live along the border and are very armed — could absolutely be implicated in the conflict [in North Darfur],' Hoinathy told Al Jazeera. To reduce the threat of widespread tribal conflict, Sudan’s leadership must address Sudan’s historic ethnic and wealth disparities to build a common vision of the future, according to Hamdy A. Hassan. 'Achieving peace in Sudan requires a focus on the concerns of marginalized populations in conflict zones and deprived regions,' Hassan, a professor at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates, wrote in The Conversation. 'It also requires addressing the root causes of armed violence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF7-Nmm3a1kIP	2024-11-24T15:54:42-08:00	
India’s Caste Census Will Act As A hindrance To National Unity An...	The caste system, deeply rooted in India's socio-cultural fabric, has historically influenced various aspects of life, including social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The idea of conducting a caste census in India has sparked considerable debate, especially regarding its impact on meritocracy and its potential as a tool for equitable development. Even after 75 years of independence, India continues to wrestle with the complexities of the caste system, a challenge further compounded by vote-bank politics. The debate over conducting a caste census has intensified, raising significant concerns about its potential impact on meritocracy and the country's socio-economic development. Although, the intention behind the census is to address historical inequities, such measures risk exacerbating societal divisions. Recently, several states have conducted caste-based censuses to create a development model that addresses economic disparities and provides equal opportunities for marginalised communities. The goal is to identify these groups and direct resources toward their upliftment. While such initiatives seek to rectify social inequality and the unequal distribution of resources in India, they also present certain challenges. A caste census would generate detailed data on the socio-economic conditions of various caste groups, which could inform targeted policies to reduce disparities. However, while increasing reservations is designed to address economic gaps and offer equal opportunities to historically marginalised communities, it could undermine meritocracy in India. Marginalised communities often suffer from poor socio-economic conditions, which limit their access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential resources, putting them at a disadvantage despite their potential. The caste system, deeply embedded in India's socio-cultural fabric, continues to influence social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The impact of reservation policies on merit has already been evident, particularly in government services, universities, and academic institutions. One prominent example is the way candidates are elected based on caste, especially in the Hindi heartland. In India, it is often challenging for an intellectual, no matter how capable, to win elections on merit alone. One of the major drawbacks of increasing reservations based on caste is that the caste census could further undermine the principle of meritocracy by placing too much emphasis on caste-based benefits. However, a broader view of meritocracy reveals that it is not just about academic qualifications; it's about creating a level playing field. A caste census could help identify and nurture untapped talent by providing opportunities and resources to historically deprived communities. A More Inclusive Model Critics argue that caste-based reservations risk prioritizing benefits based on identity over ability, potentially undermining meritocracy. However, creating a truly meritocratic society requires equal opportunities for all, regardless of caste or background. The government could consider an alternative model where reservations are based on income rather than caste. This approach would provide benefits to economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste, ensuring that those with merit from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), or any other economically disadvantaged group could benefit equally. The caste system has polarized Indian society, creating divisions that weaken the social fabric. A more inclusive approach—one that considers both socioeconomic disadvantages and individual merit—could foster a more just and equitable society. True meritocracy is not just about academic scores and qualifications; it's about allowing everyone to realize their potential. Currently, India's reliance on quotas has often compromised merit. Decisions based on caste alone only deepen this divide, further eroding meritocracy by limiting opportunities for those with potential. The Way Forward If India is to achieve its development goals, it must reassess its reservation policies and embrace reforms that prioritize both equity and merit. Shifting the focus to socioeconomic status, rather than caste identity, could pave the way for a more united, just, and progressive nation. The caste census is socially divisive, and it is time for politicians to rise above caste-based politics and focus on the well-being of economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste. Unfortunately, many leaders lack the political will to move away from the caste-based quota system, which has worked in their favour. However, if India is to emerge as a global power committed to justice and equity, leaders must support a model that promotes reservations based on economic need. This would ensure that even those who do not belong to reserved categories but come from poor backgrounds are not excluded from the benefits of development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFxtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-24T15:52:55-08:00	
To Understand Trump, Take Him Seriously, But Not Literally – OpEd	By Josep M. Colomer To try to foresee the next four years with US President-Elect Donald Trump, we should remember what we learned during his first presidential term: It is a mistake to take him literally and mock him because he is not serious in his bravado. Better the other way: Take him seriously, but not literally. Trump’s advantage is that he is not guided by rigid ideological principles, in contrast to the bellicosity of both the 'neocons' and the 'woke,' but is open to pragmatic transactions — always, of course, if they satisfy his vanity or his business. Another advantage of his, paradoxically, is that there will be open results due to his incompetence and disorder. Let us review the agenda. The number one problem in the world today, and Trump’s greatest threat, is the climate crisis, which is accelerating its destructive consequences. Trump will undoubtedly promote fossil production, but the Environmental Protection Agency will maintain the protective and preventive regulations established over the past few years, 12 states will continue to apply restrictions on emissions, and large cities will continue to spread renewable energy. Regarding immigration, this time Trump did not insist on the wall (most of which he failed to build while he was last in the White House). In this campaign, he turned to 'mass deportations,' which can mean common-sense controls to cross the border, as already agreed with the Mexican government regarding non-Mexicans, or an illusory hunt for individuals without proper documents in neighborhoods, workplaces and family homes, which would not only be savage but logistically unfeasible. In reality, it is to be hoped that Congress will reactivate the bipartisan agreement for immigrants’ legalization and access to citizenship that Trump ordered to be stopped not because of its content but because it would have been approved during the campaign and would have taken away his favorite topic for demagoguery. As for Israel and Palestine, the biggest problem is that Trump is now prioritizing enmity with Iran, which finances and pushes Hamas and Hezbollah and whose agents tried to assassinate him twice (or perhaps thrice). He will have a hard time resurrecting the Abraham Accords that his Jewish son-in-law negotiated during his first term: exploring again the two-state solution in exchange for diplomatic recognition of Israel by Arab countries. Now, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will only accept it if Trump diminishes his hostility against Iran, where a 'reformist' candidate won the presidential election and seems to have appeased the fury. Regarding Ukraine, Trump boasted that he would 'fix it in 24 hours,' but was not very specific. Two days after the election, at the Valdai Forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin rushed to offer a peace agreement based on the 'self-determination' of the people of Donbas in exchange for respecting Ukraine’s borders. Putin also hinted that Russia could restore natural gas supplies through the Baltic to Germany, which Ukrainian agents destroyed. A Trump adviser has outlined a plan to defend Ukraine’s neutrality outside NATO for the next twenty years. All this sounds similar to the Minsk Agreements reached a few years ago by Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, which US President Barack Obama ignored. In the face of Trump’s disdain, the European Union may reinforce internal solidity and external autonomy. Many NATO members are already ceasing to be free-riders on the United States and are fulfilling their commitment to invest at least 2% of GDP in defense. Their number has risen from four to 23 in just six years. The biggest alarm raised by Trump’s election is that the future of democracy and legal security in the United States may be in jeopardy. Will there be 'revenge' against 'internal enemies,' and will he go after politicians, judges, generals, officials, journalists and other opponents? He may not need to once the pending court cases are canceled and he has satisfied his obsession with returning to power. The Senate Republican group has already rejected Trump’s nominee to lead it, and the Senate can veto some of his announced appointees. It is worth remembering that in his first term, Trump appointed three Chiefs of Staff in four years and changed most members of the Cabinet, including State, Defense, Justice, Interior and Homeland Security, a tenor of personal instability that is likely to continue. Some of Trump’s boasts may end in a major ridicule, such as ordering Elon Musk to cut a third of the budget. Incompetence could also sink him in the face of some unforeseen catastrophe, as happened to during US President George Bush’s second term with Hurricane Katrina and to himself with the COVID-19 pandemic. Will Trump be able to maintain a regular daily work schedule in his eighties, or will he, like Joe Biden, be busy only from 10 AM to 4 PM? It is not guaranteed that he will complete four years in good shape. Ultimately, Trump could also become a chaotic parody of the befuddled White House visitor in the film Being There (1979). As Mister Chance says, 'I can’t write. I can’t read. But I like to watch television.' Just like Donald the Returned.

Pam Bondi – Everything You Need To Know About Trump’s New AG Pick...	By James Fite Just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) bowed out as the US attorney general nominee, President-elect Donald Trump announced a replacement: Pam Bondi. As another longtime staunch Trump ally, Bondi may be everything the incoming president wants in an AG without all the scandal Gaetz brought to the table. The right loves her, and the left fears her, but who is this woman who may soon be in charge of the Department of Justice? Here’s everything you need to know about Pam Bondi but were afraid to ask. An Impressive Résumé The best place to start is where she has been and what she has accomplished – and that’s quite an impressive list. After more than 18 years as a Florida prosecutor, Pam Bondi burst onto the political scene in 2010 after she was elected to be the Sunshine State’s first female attorney general, a job she held until 2019. If confirmed, she’ll be just the third woman to serve as US attorney general. In her time as Florida’s AG, Bondi worked to end the opioid epidemic and shut down pill mills. Her approach resulted in a 52% decline in oxycodone deaths and an overall decline of 23% in prescription drug overdose deaths in Florida between 2011 and 2014, then-CDC Director Tom Frieden explained at the 2016 National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. An 'unprecedented national achievement,' he called it. She also tackled human trafficking and pushed the state’s crime lab to clear the backlog of more than 13,000 unprocessed sexual assault kits. Bondi overhauled the state’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and obtained more than $870 million in settlements and judgments. She also fought for consumer rights. In her tenure, she helped recover more than $1 billion in consumer protection, antitrust, and false claims settlements. She has since made a name for herself as a Trump ally. She served on his defense team during the first impeachment trial and co-chaired his 2020 re-election campaign. Bondi also served as chair for the Center of Litigation and co-chair of the Center of Law and Justice for the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank established in 2021 by former Trump advisers. Pam Bondi – The Left’s New Boogeyman? Even CNN Legal Analyst Elie Honig had to admit that 'Pam Bondi is, without a question, qualified to be Attorney General.' He went on to explain that Bondi’s level of experience is 'on par with, or better than most United States Attorneys General that we’ve seen over the past 50 years or so.' As impressive as her résumé is, however, you won’t read about it in the 'what to know about Pam Bondi' articles published by most left-leaning news outlets. About halfway down the AP’s piece, for example, Bondi’s work gets a one-line mention: 'As Florida’s top prosecutor, Bondi stressed human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers.' That, plus the fact she was the state’s first female attorney general, is about all the credit she gets. The AP and the many establishment news outlets that seem to practically copy and paste from it focus instead on Bondi’s loyalty to Trump, her work as a lobbyist, and 'a few of her own political issues.' Bondi issued an apology in 2013 after she looked to delay the execution of a convicted killer 'because it conflicted with a fundraiser for her reelection campaign.' She also received a $25,000 campaign contribution in 2013 from Donald Trump, around the same time her office declined to participate in New York’s lawsuit over fraud allegations involving Trump University. To quote Fox News’ Jesse Watters, 'you know Bondi’s a winner because the deep state sounds awfully nervous.' Indeed, the AP does come out and say that, if confirmed, 'Bondi would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump’s Cabinet given the Republican’s threat to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries and concern among Democrats that he will look to bend the Justice Department to his will.' A bit farther down, the outlet claims Trump 'sought to use the powers of the Justice Department to advance his own interests,' and that Bondi 'appears likely to oblige him.' College professor and MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson revealed the real reason the left fears her. In a talk with MSNBC host Ari Melber, Johnson explained: 'Pam Bondi is exactly what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear, because she’s competent. We may not agree with her ideologically, but she actually knows how to do this job.' He continued: 'So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking ‘Well maybe Matt Gaetz will screw this up and that will give us time,’ no. Pam Bondi knows what she is doing.' Regardless of where one falls on the ideological spectrum, the thoroughly freaked-out progressive left is right about a few things: Pam Bondi is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. She’s also far more likely to see a successful confirmation than the scandal-mired Matt Gaetz. And she does, in fact, know what she’s doing.

ECOWAS Collapses Abidjan-Lagos Highway – OpEd	Never underestimate the power of Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), also known as CEDEAO in French and Portuguese, created on 28th May 1975 as a regional political and economic union bringing together fifteen (15) countries of West Africa. Per the date of its established, this so-called regional bloc marks its 50th year in 2025, a significant historical celebration. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), ECOWAS generally has its primary common goal of working consistently towards achieving, what is first referred to, as 'collective self-sufficiency' for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to raise living standards of an estimated population of over 425 million people and to promote economic development based on the principles of inter-dependence, solidarity, and cooperation. Until writing this article, ECOWAS has frequently been discussing and reviewing the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project, one single regional infrastructure project these several years. It has shown its total commitment looking for funding while billions have been siphoned by leaders into foreign banks. African leaders are quick negotiating and paying for foreign military weapons but grossly unsuccessful in soliciting similar assistance from these external partners to invest in infrastructure development such as the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project. West African Highway Launched in 2017 The construction of this proposed grandiose West African highway has its own chequered history. The proposed project was successfully launched in 2017, and since then it has had series of high-powered meetings and conferences, technical studies has been conducted, and financing the construction and to its feasibility and practical operationalization. The Abidjan-Lagos highway, the six-lane dual carriage highway, is estimated at $15.1 billion. On resource mobilization, it was explicitly noted that ECOWAS had adopted a new regulatory framework on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) – an incentive for the entry of private sector in large investments like the nature of this project. The African Development Bank (AfDB) on behalf of the development partners offered its assurance for unwavering commitment to the realization of the highway. Akinwunmi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) has several times highlighted the importance of the Abidjan-Lagos highway as an infrastructure project in West Africa that would ease free movement of people, goods and services, generate social and economic activities, and ultimately promote cross-border trade within the region, its economic viability and enormous potentials especially now that African Union looks to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Noticeably, Africa has long been considered as a frontier for manufacturing, for technology, for food production. Africa is getting ready for business, it is busily building the world's largest single market of 1.4 billion people. Special Meetings and Technical Consultations Several meetings upon meetings, and upon meetings have been held since the project was proposed in 2017. Since 2017, paid meetings were held, experts were paid. The latest of such paid meeting was held in November 10-11, 2024. This roundtable was initiated following the instructions given to the ECOWAS Commission. Late September 2024, such roundtable meeting was held in Abidjan, capital city of Côte d'Ivoire, under the auspices of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID). The highway corridor is calculated to be approximately 1,080 km long. It will connect some of the largest and most economically dynamic cities Abidjan, Accra, Cotonou, Lomé and Lagos, while covering a large proportion of West Africa's population. It will also link very vibrant seaports in West Africa. In addition, it will serve all the landlocked ECOWAS member-states, for example Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the region. Nearly 40 million people are estimated to be living along the Abidjan-Lagos corridor while 47 million people travel along the axis every year. These are expected to be direct beneficiaries of the development of the project touted to be a real backbone of trade in the region. According official documents, this highway project falls in line with the key objectives of the ECOWAS Vision 2050, including (i) facilitating the movement of people and goods, and (ii) accelerating trade and transport, regional and international, improving road infrastructure. It is eventually expected that the transport corridor will be transformed into a development corridor to stimulate investment, sustainable development and poverty reduction within the entire region. West African Highway and AfCFTA The focal point of controversy and debate, these several years, are centered on mechanism of financing, the state-of-the-art management of this new mega-highway - from planning through practical construction to its final commissioning, ready for cutting-edge usage by the transport industry. The idea of prioritizing highway innovation, signalling a bold leap in West Africa's transportation infrastructure, is its recognizable potential transformative impact. Simply intended to improve and facilitate movement of services, goods and people across the region. The Abidjan-Lagos Highway highlights its potential to enhance regional connectivity and drive economic growth, especially with the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade (AfCFTA), the ambitious flagship of the African Union (AU). According to ECOWAS latest document issued after their two-day special meeting held on November 11 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 'experts have lauded findings of the study which has among others, unveiled a potential $6.8 billion investment prepared and ready to be implemented to unlock economic growth and enhance the viability of the proposed highway.' The overall objective is to identify and unlock the inherent and latent economic potential (short, medium and long-term) and commercial viability of economic and industrial value chain projects. These economic projects, once implemented, will also generate trade volumes and traffic to augment the viability of the highway. The final draft reports were issued after groups revisited (that was not the first time) several tolled bridges and roads in Abidjan for knowledge and experience sharing strategy envisaged for the Abidjan-Lagos Highway. At the end of the exercise, the study report (re)validated commitment to unlock the inherent and latent economic potential of the highway construction and estimated at $6.8 billion in potential investment in the region. Final Construction Still Out of Sight For the past few years, significant attention have been drawn by widely publicized announcement of securing enough funds from African banks and from external sources for the construction this regional highway which could become a cornerstone, and the public narrative of achievement by ECOWAS, which marks its 50th year in 2025. However, transport industry analysts, researchers and experts have already cast serious doubts and skyline skepticism if ECOWAS could live to this onerous task. Grandiose ceremony-infested ECOWAS future task of achieving its primary target of constructing 'speed-highway' remains an eternal dream. Noticeably, ECOWAS has little to celebrate, except its existence by name, (the golden jubilee) at its 50th year in May 2025. At least, Africans will rather jubilate over the authenticity of reforming and transforming the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF-Fb4avN7oh8	2024-11-24T15:46:32-08:00	
Pro-West PM Leads Romanian Presidential Vote, Russia-Friendly Can...	(RFE/RL) -- Partial preliminary results in Romania's presidential vote give Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu a narrow lead, but a surprisingly strong showing by pro-Russia candidate Cailin Georgescu has thrown the race into unexpected territory. With 80 percent of polling stations reporting on November 24, the pro-Western Social Democrat Ciolacu had 22.17 percent of the vote, according to election officials. But his opponent in an expected runoff round remains unclear after Georgescu – who has been criticized for his anti-NATO sentiments – was in second place with 22.11 percent. Pro-West Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union was third with 14.97 percent, while George Simion of ultranationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) had 14.94 percent. Experts said that results from the large cities – where Ciolacu and Lasconi are likely to poll stronger than Georgescu – could still decide the tight race. Two exit polls gave Ciolacu 25 percent of the vote, while Lasconi was second at around 18 percent. Georgescu and Simion trailed in the exit polls with 14-16 percent in the cluttered field of 13 candidates. The exit polls did not include diaspora polling, where Lasconi and Simion were expected to lead the balloting. Some observers said that even with Ciolacu's slim lead, the far right appeared to be the big winner in the vote. If no candidate receives over 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held on December 8 featuring the two top finishers, a week after a parliamentary election on December 1. Ciolacu was the favorite heading into the election and pre-vote surveys indicated five candidates had a shot at advancing to the runoff to succeed the outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, who is completing his second and final term after a decade in office. Fourteen candidates officially registered in the race, but Ludovic Orban announced he was withdrawing from the contest. Election officials put the turnout at just over 50 percent, or about 9.44 million voters casting their ballots. Long lines were reported at polling stations in the capital, Bucharest, ahead of the 9 p.m. poll closings. In 2019, total first-round turnout was 51.18 percent. In the second round, it rose to 55.1 percent. At three polling stations, turnout was reported at 150-300 percent. Officials said the high figure was due to supplemental lists holding more names than the permanent lists and by people voting in precincts they were not originally assigned. Georgescu, 62, who has been criticized in the Romanian media for expressing pro-Russia sentiments, claimed his shocking vote total represents a real victory for Romania. 'The rich of the system have become poorer, and the poor Romanians have become richer. It's an astonishing awakening in consciousness,' said the candidate, who utilized the TikTok social media platform to press his campaign. Following release of the exit polls, Lasconi told reporters that the results remain tight and that she will wait until official results are clear before 'rejoicing' over her potential placement in the runoff. Lasconi, a former small-town mayor and journalist, was the only presidential candidate who opposed the idea of Ukraine giving up land to Russia in a peace deal, saying doing so would embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'If Ukraine cedes territory, Putin won't stop,' she had said. 'We need to help Ukraine win this war.' She was also the most bullish among the top candidates on NATO, calling for the military alliance to have a greater presence in Romania. Ciolacu expressed pro-Europe sentiment leading up to the election. 'We will support the deepening of the European integration project for the benefit of citizens, and we will have a more active voice in the decision-making process at the European level,' he has said. Critics have charged Simion with being too Russia-friendly and, while he wants Romania to remain in NATO, said Bucharest should be 'neutral.' Despite the exit polls, Simion expressed confidence in reaching the second round. 'We were alone against the parties of the system, and we will enter the second round,' said Simion, who urged his supports to 'turn off the TVs' and ignore reports stating that a 'stranger,' Georgescu -- who had received little attention ahead of the vote -- was ahead of him in the exit polls. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Rima, a voter at a Bucharest polling station, told RFE/RL, 'There should be more opportunities for young people, so we don't have to leave the country after we graduate from high school or college.' 'The president should be more open-minded on some topics, especially international ones. That's what I want: to live in a free country where we as young people have a voice,' she said, without specifying her candidate. Romania's president has significant decision-making powers, including on matters of national security and foreign policy. Elected for a five-year term, the president can also reject party nominees for prime minister and government nominees for judicial appointments. Diaspora voting began on November 23, with initial figures indicating a higher turnout than in 2019 among those abroad, with about 675,000 of such votes cast by 6 p.m. on November 24, up about 90,000 from the 2019 election. In Moldova, more than 80,942 voted at 59 polling stations, with officials calling it a record high. In the first round of the 2019 Romanian presidential election, 43,307 people voted in Moldova. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship. Voting was also reported to be high in London, where almost 8,900 Romanians went to the polls. Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the Bucharest-based think tank GlobalFocus Center, told RFE/RL in an email that this is a high-stakes election for the NATO and EU nation. 'Romania is faced with two important realities next year: the threat of further instability and conflict in the region and globally, especially in the context of a [President-elect Donald] Trump White House,' she said, along with the risks of a 'deepening economic and financial crisis.' Foreign policy is also of concern to voters, namely Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5fa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-24T15:44:56-08:00	
Ralph Nader: From Mount Trump – How Trump Sees His World – OpEd	Let’s look at the political scene from Trump’s viewpoint. Sitting in his luxurious Mar-a-Lago palace receiving the daily obeisant supplicants eager to heed his every word and praise exuberantly his megalomania, Donald J. Trump can hardly believe his good fortune. Starting in the 2015 presidential race against 16 GOP primary opponents, Trump’s vituperative attacks were unleashed. Never in American history have words from a politician’s mouth ever metastasized into such unchallenged electoral victory and domination. His daily, hourly bullying verbal abuses flooded THE MASS MEDIA, which faithfully transmitted to tens of millions of people like clockwork – lying or false statements and tweets in the tens of thousands. Looking over his gigantic domain astride the country and soon the world, Trump can recount the pillars of his elected dictatorship. The Supreme Court in their impeachable June 2024 unconstitutional decision (Trump v. United States) has decreed that the President’s 'official conduct' (undefined) is immune from criminal prosecution for whatever they do. This 6 to 3 decision already fortifies Trump’s previous determination notoriously declared in July 2019 when he exclaimed 'Then, I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.' And he did just that, violating with impunity federal criminal statutes (See the December 18, 2019, Congressional Record, H-12197), violating the Constitution, defying over 125 Congressional subpoenas, and according to John Bolton his National Security Advisor, making 'obstruction of justice a daily practice in the White House.' Second, Trump has control of Congress with the Republican GOP majority in the House and Senate, however narrow. Congress is thus far showing no sign of resisting his demands for utter submission. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already signaled this abdication of his constitutional duty for checks and balances. Senate Majority Leader Senator John Thune is more circumspect. However mindful he is of the Senate’s constitutional duty of 'advice and consent' regarding Trump’s nominees, Thune has to worry about being overthrown and replaced at any time as Senate Majority Leader by hovering Trump loyalists. Trump wants the Senate to declare a recess for more than ten days to get his team of cabinet and agency nominees appointed without the usual confirmation hearings. This is an extreme demand. As constitutional law specialist, Bruce Fein asserts: 'Such contrived recesses serve no legitimate constitutional purpose. That would make such official acts voidable,' i.e., unenforceable. This illegal escape hatch for Trump is unlikely to materialize for some of his nominees whom the Senate majority will want to reject. Why? Because, for example, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services will be vigorously opposed by Big Pharma, the Big Food Processors, the Health Insurance giants, and the Big Global Warming Polluters (fossil fuels) industries whom he has long criticized and sued when he was an effective environmental lawyer. He doesn’t have much support from Democratic Senators due to his statements about vaccines and their side effects. Guessing, I expect the Senate will turn him down following a conventional nomination hearing. The military-industrial giants will oppose Tulsi Gabbard as Trump’s Director of National Intelligence. She is seen as too extreme a critic, too inexperienced, and likely not to 'get along by going along' with the entrenched national intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA. Trump’s choice for Secretary of Defense, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a veteran, with no managerial experience, has made harsh statements about military leadership, women, and Muslims. He evinces wanting to go on a vengeance kick and not on a mission to do what Trump has campaigned for, which is ending 'endless wars.' The 47 Democratic Senators are likely to be joined by enough Republican Senators to block his nomination. Trump’s choice of Chris Wright, head of a fracking company and a climate-denier, as Secretary of Energy, will get the full backing of the oil, gas and coal industries leading to an affirmative vote in the Senate. None of these problems bother Trump. Just as was the case with former Representative Matt Gaetz who was forced by disclosures, regarding his sexual aggressions and other negatives, to take himself out of the running nomination for Attorney General, Trump will find plenty of replacements willing to run a Justice Department which lets him do whatever he wants with impunity. At the end of the day, what matters to Trump is getting what he wants. He is warranted in such confidence. Who is going to challenge him? He believes correctly that it will not be the Supreme Court or Congress. The state legislatures will be on the defensive due to his willingness to cut grants and federal contracts to the states, including critical Medicaid services for millions of needy Americans, along with other traditional social safety net programs. The labor unions, worrying about a third of their membership being Trumpsters, among other inhibitions (See, Election Day Delirium by Chris Townsend), are not much of a factor, as they have tethered themselves (with few exceptions) to the Democratic Party bureaucracy. The citizen groups will file their lawsuits and wait for the expected court delays that spell 'Justice delayed is justice denied.' As for the mainstream media CEOs, Trump knows they want higher ratings and more readers so he has given them daily fodder for outrageous epithets, falsehoods, braggadocios and empty promises. In return, media outlets have faithfully published his crazed bloviations. The media has also reported his many corruptions, lies, ignorance of facts, bigotry, sexual escapades, and indictments – to no avail. The MAGA crowd just gets bigger. All the exposés, helped by blunders of prosecutors and partisan Trump judges, have fallen off Teflon Trump like water off a duck’s back. He has procrastinated releasing his full medical history, contrary to his promises in 2016, 2020 and 2024. He has also resisted releasing his tax returns. He now has not complied with ethical reports during the transition from Biden’s regime to his regime. Der Fuhrer Trump believes the rules that his presidential peers have followed do not apply to him. There is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Democratic State Attorneys General will sue and block some of Trump’s violative decisions. Some state prosecutors will go after the burgeoning corruption of Trump’s nominees and their corporate collaborators eager to raid the honey pots of Uncle Sam. But the biggest risk to Trump’s domination will be Trump himself and what damage he will be unleashing that workers, consumers and communities, even those who voted for him, will feel intensely. The assault on their health, safety and economic well-being may weaken Trump’s support. Once people start thinking that MAGA is really MABA (Make America Betrayed Again), the polls should start sliding propitiously from the sky-high expectations of the Paradise that Trump promised every campaign day. At his core, Trump is not all that much different than his worst predecessors. He continued several Bush/Obama wars overseas in his first term, intensifying his backing of war criminal Bibi Netanyahu. He later swallowed his campaign criticism of price-gouging drug companies. And of course, he loves Wall Street, Houston, (the fossil fuel giants), the corporate welfarists, tax escapes of corporate crooks, those who cheat consumers and crush workers’ rights. Remember that is the way he behaved during his former failed business exploits. Nobody stopped him then and he believes the stars of his destiny will not let anyone stop him now. Trump is at his core a corporatist and a corporate statist, who pushes bloated military budgets, lawlessness and police powers, all of which are the frameworks of American fascism. Buckle your seat belts people, and start the civic resurgence. (See my piece, Rise Up: Congress is Yours for the Taking in the new issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFy6vLuj96nsM	2024-11-24T15:43:05-08:00	
Trump’s Promise: What Ending Global Wars Means For US Defense And...	Donald Trump's recent announcement to end global wars if elected president has sent shockwaves through the American arms industry and international defense circles. This proclamation, while appealing to a war-weary public, raises critical questions about the future of U.S. arms exports, defense spending, and America's role in global security. To understand the potential implications, we must examine the current state of the arms industry, Trump's foreign policy stance, and the complex geopolitical landscape. The Current State of U.S. Arms Exports The United States has long been the world's leading arms exporter, a position that has only strengthened in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. foreign military sales reached a record high of $80.9 billion, marking a 55% increase from the previous year. This surge was largely driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted many European countries to bolster their defense capabilities. The U.S. government's role in facilitating these sales goes beyond mere profit-seeking. Arms exports are a crucial tool of American foreign policy, allowing the U.S. to strengthen alliances, maintain influence in strategic regions, and shape the global security landscape. The Biden administration has viewed robust arms sales as a means to counter Russian influence and support allies in an increasingly unstable world. Trump's 'End Global Wars' Stance Trump's pledge to end global wars is not entirely new. During his previous term, he often criticized U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and pushed for a more isolationist approach. However, the specifics of how he plans to achieve this goal remain unclear. It's worth noting that despite his rhetoric, Trump's previous administration oversaw significant arms sales and military operations abroad. His approach to foreign policy was often unpredictable, combining tough talk with a desire for diplomatic breakthroughs Potential Impacts on the Arms Industry If Trump follows through on his pledge to end global wars, it could have several significant impacts on the American arms industry: 1. Reduced Demand: A shift away from interventionist policies could lead to decreased demand for U.S. weapons systems, particularly from countries involved in ongoing conflicts. 2. Shift in Product Focus: The industry might need to pivot towards developing and producing defensive systems rather than offensive weaponry. 3. Domestic Market Emphasis: With potentially reduced foreign sales, arms manufacturers may need to rely more heavily on domestic military contracts. 4. Diversification: Some companies might explore diversifying into non-military sectors to offset potential losses in arms sales. Geopolitical Considerations Trump's stance raises questions about America's role in global security and its commitments to allies. Many U.S. allies, particularly in Europe and Asia, have come to rely on American military support and technology. A sudden withdrawal or significant reduction in U.S. involvement could create power vacuums and potentially embolden adversaries like Russia and China. The situation in Ukraine serves as a prime example of the complexities involved. While Trump has expressed a desire to quickly end the conflict, doing so without considering Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term security could have far-reaching consequences for European stability and America's credibility. Economic Implications The arms industry is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing high-skilled jobs and driving technological innovation. Any major shift in policy that affects arms exports could have ripple effects throughout the economy, particularly in regions with a high concentration of defense contractors. However, it's important to note that reduced military spending could potentially free up resources for other sectors, such as infrastructure or renewable energy, which could offset some of the economic impacts. Challenges to Implementation Implementing a policy to 'end global wars' would face several challenges: 1. Congressional Oversight: Major arms sales require congressional approval, and many lawmakers view these sales as crucial for national security and maintaining global influence. 2. Existing Commitments: The U.S. has numerous defense agreements and ongoing operations that cannot be easily or quickly dismantled without significant diplomatic and strategic consequences. 3. Industry Pushback: The powerful defense lobby is likely to resist any policies that could significantly reduce arms sales. 4. Geopolitical Realities: Global conflicts and tensions are often driven by complex factors beyond U.S. control, making it difficult to simply 'end' wars by decree. The Role of Diplomacy Trump's emphasis on ending wars could potentially lead to a greater focus on diplomacy and negotiation. This shift might create opportunities for conflict resolution and peace-building initiatives. However, critics argue that reducing military support for allies could weaken America's bargaining position in diplomatic negotiations. Technological Considerations The arms industry has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to hypersonic weapons. A significant reduction in military spending or arms exports could potentially slow the pace of innovation in these areas. Conversely, it might also encourage the industry to find civilian applications for military technologies, potentially driving innovation in other sectors. Global Arms Market Dynamics Any major shift in U.S. arms export policy would likely have significant impacts on the global arms market. Other major exporters, such as France, Russia, and China, might seek to fill any void left by reduced U.S. sales. This could lead to a realignment of global arms trade patterns and potentially affect the balance of power in various regions. Domestic Political Considerations Trump's pledge to end global wars may resonate with a public weary of long-term military engagements. However, it could also face opposition from those who view a strong military presence abroad as essential for national security. Donald Trump's pledge to end global wars, if implemented, would mark a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy with far-reaching implications for the American arms industry. While potentially reducing military engagements abroad, such a policy would face numerous challenges and could reshape global security dynamics. The arms industry, which has long been a cornerstone of American economic and strategic power, would need to adapt to a changing landscape. This could involve pivoting towards defensive technologies, exploring new markets, or diversifying into non-military sectors. Ultimately, the fate of the American arms industry under a potential Trump presidency would depend on the specific policies implemented, global geopolitical developments, and the industry's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. As the debate over America's role in the world continues, the arms industry finds itself at a crossroads, facing both challenges and opportunities in an uncertain future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF9RB809r9qnu	2024-11-24T15:41:25-08:00	
Trump ‘Incredibly Concerned’ About Escalation Of Munitions In Rus...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is 'incredibly concerned' about the escalating use of different types of weaponry in Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine, his designated choice for national security adviser said Sunday. Michael Waltz, now a Florida congressman, told 'Fox News Sunday' that the decision by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines to try to halt Russia’s battlefield ground troop advances has turned the fight in eastern Ukraine into something akin to 'World War I trench warfare.' Waltz said the decision 'needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict.' 'It is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front,' he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week the United States is sending the anti-personnel mines to Ukraine because of the changing nature of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the main battlefield. He said Russian ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading Moscow’s advance, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort.' Waltz said Trump, who takes office January 20, is concerned about the carnage but said that in the broad picture, the question that must be preeminent is, 'How do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?' 'We need to, we need to bring this to a responsible end,' he added. Trump has often claimed that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war even before he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president. Trump has never said how and refused to say during a campaign debate in September that he wants Ukraine to win. Biden gave Ukraine authority to launch Washington-supplied missiles with a 300-kilometer range deep into Russia in response to North Korea’s dispatch of 10,000 troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces. Within two days, Kyiv targeted weapons warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region with the missiles. Then, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a new experimental rocket, targeting Dnipro in Ukraine’s eastern region. 'This is a clear escalation,' Waltz said. 'Where is this escalation going? How do we get both sides to the table' for peace negotiations? Waltz, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, said he has been meeting with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. Waltz said that any U.S. adversary 'is wrong' if it thinks it can 'play one side off against the other' with the switch in power in Washington from Biden, a Democrat, and his long-time political foe, Trump, a Republican. Waltz said he is 'confident' Trump will restore peace 'in pretty short order' in the multiple conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel fighting Iran-funded militants — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But months of cease-fire talks on the conflict in Gaza are stalemated and talks to reach a halt in the Hezbollah-Israel fighting have yet to produce a deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5udE0KpbDHJ	2024-11-24T15:39:33-08:00	
Mikati Warns Israeli Military Action In Lebanon A Rejection Of Po...	By Najia Houssari An Israeli strike on a Lebanese army center on Sunday killed a soldier and wounded 18 others, the Lebanese military said, with the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, calling the attack 'a direct bloody message rejecting all efforts to reach a ceasefire.' The attack came as top EU diplomat Josep Borrell called for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to Lebanon. According to the Lebanese Army Command, the first adjutant, Diab Mohammed Jaafar, was killed when Israel targeted Al-Amariyeh checkpoint on the road between Tyre and the town of Naqoura. In a statement, Mikati said: 'Israel’s messages rejecting a solution are ongoing, and just as it turned against the US-French call for a ceasefire in September, here it is once again responding with Lebanese blood, blatantly rejecting the solution that is being discussed.' He called on 'the countries of the world and the relevant international institutions to assume their responsibilities on the issue.' Mikati’s condemnation came amid growing concerns that the Israeli military is trying to solidify its westward incursion in the coastal town of Al-Bayada, located between Tyre and Naqoura, while facing strong resistance from the eastern side of the border area in its positions in Khiyam. Israeli forces are trying to encircle the South Litani area from both sides. Hezbollah said it 'targeted a gathering of the enemy army s forces east of the city of Khiyam with a salvo of rockets,' and 'a gathering of Israeli forces at the Metula site (Israel’s outlet toward Khiyam) was targeted with a volley of rockets followed by an aerial attack with a squadron of assault drones … hitting its targets accurately.' The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched 160 projectiles toward Israel on Sunday. Sirens sounded across northern and central Israel, reaching Tel Aviv at successive intervals, forcing thousands of Israelis to head toward shelters. Footage from central Israel showed extensive material damage and fires. The Israeli military issued further warnings to residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate, targeting Bourj Al-Barajneh and Hadath. Former Israeli minister Benny Gantz claimed that the Lebanese government 'is leaving Hezbollah unchecked,' adding: 'It is time to act against its assets forcefully.' These developments came during a round of discussions conducted by Borrell, high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy, in Beirut with Mikati and Speaker Nabih Berry. In a statement, Borrell stressed the need for exerting pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire. Borrell emphasized that 'the situation in the Middle East, particularly here in Beirut, presents a significant challenge to the international community. The international community cannot remain inactive in the face of these events. The absence of peace in the Middle East has reached an intolerable level, and people are dying under bombardment.' He added that two months on from his last visit to Beirut, he now views Lebanon as on the verge of collapse due to the conflict, which has led to the devastation of numerous villages, as well as airstrikes aimed at Beirut and Baalbek. He also reiterated that 'the human cost is exceedingly high.' Borrell said Israeli airstrikes had claimed the lives of over 3,500 people in Lebanon, a figure three times greater than the casualties recorded in 2006. The only viable path forward, Borrell said, is an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701. Borrell praised the UNIFIL forces and confirmed the EU’s readiness to allocate &euro;200 million ($208.3 million) to the Lebanese Armed Forces. He emphasized the Lebanese need to 'assume their political responsibilities by electing a president and putting an end to this prolonged power vacuum that has exceeded two years.' Borrell said a ceasefire proposal for Gaza is pending Israeli government approval, and 'we, as the international community, need to work to ensure the respect of international law, as we see famine being used as a weapon of war through international law violations, the complete siege imposed on Gaza and the number of people that are dying in Lebanon.' He added that in his view the decisions of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for Israel’s activities in Gaza were not politically motivated and had been made under international law, which applied to everyone. 'We strongly support the court,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3x9MCMotad2	2024-11-24T15:37:43-08:00	
Austin Bolsters US Cooperation With Fiji, Concludes 12th Trip To ...	By Joseph Clark Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III signed a new agreement Saturday aimed at enhancing the United States' logistics cooperation with Fiji today as he closed out his 12th trip to the Indo-Pacific since taking office. The Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement is aimed at enabling the efficient transfer of fuel and medical supplies and the use of maintenance facilities during emergencies, culminating nearly a decade of negotiations between the two countries and underscoring the United States' commitment to building lasting partnerships throughout the region. 'This agreement will mean closer ties and closer logistics cooperation between our forces, including for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,' Austin said during a press conference. The secretary signed to new agreement alongside Fijian officials during a ceremony today at Black Rock Camp. Ahead of the ceremony, Austin met with Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General Baron Waqa for discussions on bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Fiji. In addition to finalizing the ACSA agreement, the two countries announced the beginning of formal negotiations on a Status of Forces Agreement that will empower the two countries to work more closely together. Austin also announced that the U.S. will provide $4.9 million in foreign military financing for small-arms recapitalization for Fijian forces, pending Congressional approval. Austin said continuing to strengthen the U.S.-Fijian relationship remains as a key focal point in the region. 'Our relationship is rooted in common values and our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,' he said. 'The Indo-Pacific is our priority theater and our partnership with Fiji and other Pacific Island Countries is vital to a free and open Indo-Pacific.' Austin's visit to Fiji, the first by a U.S. defense secretary, caps a series of engagements with regional counterparts showcasing the United States' unwavering commitment to the Indo-Pacific amid what Austin sees as a 'new convergence' of like-minded partners throughout the region. In addition to Fiji, Austin met with key U.S. partners in Australia, the Philippines and Laos in a continuation to the regional momentum he has built throughout his tenure. In Darwin, Australia, Austin met with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles and Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani Gen as part of the 14th Trilateral Defense Minister's Meeting. In a joint statement following the TDMM, the three leaders announced that Japan will increase its participation in Australia-U.S. force posture cooperation activities, including through annual trilateral amphibious training among the Australian Defense Force, Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and the U.S. Marine Rotational Force – Darwin. The joint statement also outlines steps to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, to include Australia's participation in the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. Following his visit to Darwin, Austin proceeded to the Philippines where he met with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. and Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro. While there, Austin and Teodoro attended an official signing ceremony for the newly established General Security of Military Information Agreement, that provides a legal framework enabling enhanced and expanded sharing of information and defense technology between the two countries. The agreement serves as a foundation for further enhancing interoperability between U.S. and Philippine forces and paves the way for additional security agreements in the future. Austin and Teodoro also broke ground on a new combined coordination center at Camp Aguinaldo in Manila to further enable information sharing between U.S. and Philippine forces. Later, Austin met with Marcos at Malacanang Palace in Manila where the secretary further underscored the strong ties between the two countries. Before departing the Philippines, Austin observed a Philippine Navy technical demonstration showcasing T-12 unmanned surface vessels provided by the U.S. through foreign military financing. The T-12 is a key capability used by Philippine forces to protect its sovereignty and operate throughout its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. Austin's stop in the Philippines was his fourth visit to the country since taking office, the most visits ever by a U.S. secretary of defense. In Laos, Austin attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member block of Southeast Asian nations. Austin met with a range of regional allies and partners on during the forum and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to regional security. He also announced the first-ever U.S. Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. The statement outlines the U.S. vision for deepening our practical cooperation across Southeast Asia. Austin also announced during the two-day series of engagements that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. 'We've been focused on working with countries, like minded countries to promote an open and secure Indo-Pacific region where countries can protect their interests and also feel free to sail international waterways and fly international skies wherever international law will allow,' Austin said today in discussing his most recent trip to the Indo-Pacific and, more broadly, the United States' progress over the past four years in strengthening ties throughout the region. 'We've accomplished a great deal,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF18i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-24T15:36:26-08:00	
Iran Confirms Plan For Talks With EU3	The Iranian Foreign Ministry affirmed that diplomats from Iran and the European troika will be holding talks about regional and international issues as well as Iran’s nuclear program. Spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry Esmaeil Baqaei announced on Sunday that deputy foreign ministers of Iran, France, the UK and Germany will convene on Friday, November 29, to discuss a range of bilateral, regional and international issues. Highlighting Iran’s policy of 'interaction and cooperation with the other countries' on the basis of respect, wisdom and expediency, Baqaei said the upcoming negotiations with the EU3 will be held as a continuation of the talks that had been held on the sidelines of the annual session of the UN General Assembly in New York. 'In the upcoming round of talks, which had been already planned in New York, a spectrum of subjects and regional and international topics will be discussed, including the issue of Palestine and Lebanon, as well as the nuclear issue,' he added. His comments came after Japan’s Kyodo News quoted Iranian diplomatic sources as saying on Sunday that Iran and the EU3 will hold talks in Geneva on the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF_hwhj6GpDnW	2024-11-24T15:34:57-08:00	
Maldives Embraces India Fully, Disengaging From China – Analysis	An Indo-Maldivian Comprehensive Economic and Defence Partnership Agreement is on the cards. Maldives was ardently pro-China from 2013 to 2018 during the Presidency of Abdulla Yameen. But it swung completely to the Indian side when Ibrahim Solih replaced Yameen. However, when Yameen's protégé, Mohamed Muizzu, won the Presidential election in 2023, he gave every indication of a swing back to China. But things turned topsy-turvy when India asserted itself strongly and balanced it by granting much-needed financial assistance to Maldives at a time when China offered no help, Muizzu buried the hatchet and embraced India wholeheartedly. With India and Maldives getting closer by the day, the two countries are aiming at signing a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership Agreement (CEMSPA). During the meeting between the Maldivian President Dr.Mohamed Muizzzu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on October 7, the leaders acknowledged that it was an opportune time for both sides to chart a new framework for cooperation with an aim to comprehensively transform the bilateral relationship to a 'Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership' which is people-centric and future-oriented and be an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. The latest in the series of Indo-Maldivian agreement was the MOU signed in New Delhi between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Maldivian Monetary Authority (MMA) to allow the use of the Maldivian Rufiyya and the Indian Rupee in Maldives-India trade. Indo-Maldivian bilateral trade is of the order of US$ 485 million. Between August 2023 and August 2024 the exports of India increased by US$ 41.7 million (104%) from S$ 40 million US$ 81.7 million, while imports increased by US$ 7.48 million (30.8%) from US$ 24.3 million to US$ 31.8 million. Uses of Local Currencies Trade The framework envisaged by the RBI-MMA MOU will enable exporters and importers to invoice and settle in their respective domestic currencies, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of trading in the INR-MVR pair in the foreign exchange market. The use of local currencies will optimise costs and reduce settlement time for transactions, the RBI said in a statement. 'The MoU encourages the use of INR and MVR in current account transactions, permissible capital account transactions, and any other economic and financial transactions as agreed upon by both countries,' an RBI statement said. The costs of the dependence on currencies outside of the region for the settlement of trade in the region results in cost for changing currencies for trade settlement; the instability in export prices in response to exchange rate changes and costs of hedging exchange rate risks. In contrast, the merits of using the local currencies for trade settlement reveals encouraging efficiency in trade and investment transactions; lowering the above mentioned costs; enhancing export competitiveness arising from cost effectiveness; and promoting trade and investment at the firm, country and regional levels. The RBI-MMA agreement will allow businesses in both countries to invoice and settle transactions in their respective domestic currencies, with the framework aiming to facilitate trading in the Maldivian Rufiyaa and Indian Rupee (MVR-INR) currency pair within the foreign exchange market, the Maldives' central bank said. The arrangement will enable businesses in both markets to pay for the import and export of goods and services with their local currencies. The use of local currencies would also reduce costs and improve settlement times, the MMA highlighted. 'This MoU is a significant step forward in enhancing trade and financial ties between the Maldives and India. By enabling the use of local currencies for bilateral transactions, it will strengthen economic cooperation, promote trade, and foster closer financial integration between the two countries,' the MMA said in a statement 'This collaboration marks a key milestone in strengthening bilateral cooperation between the RBI and MMA,' the RBI added, noting that the use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Maldives, deepen financial integration, and strengthen economic relations between the two countries. Growing Ties During President Muizzu's visit to New Delh in October, the two countries signed a bilateral currency swap agreement enabling the Maldives' central bank to draw a swap facility under two windows; a USD/EUR window and an INR window, respectively, against the MVR. The swap facility would allow the MMA to make multiple drawals up to a maximum limit of US$400 million in addition to INR 30 billion, within the existing 'Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC Countries, 2024-2027'. The USD/EUR swap facility is aimed at supporting the Maldives' foreign exchange liquidity requirements, while the INR swap facility would allow trade settlement in local currencies. The Maldivian President thanked India for its timely emergency financial assistance, including by way of rolling over Treasury-bills subscribed by the State Bank of India amounting to USD 100 million in May and September 2024 for a further period of one year that provided the much needed financial cushion for Maldives in addressing its urgent financing needs. He expressed appreciation for the decision of the Government of India to extend support in the form of USD 400 million and INR 30 billion as a bilateral currency swap agreement, instrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Maldives. India has agreed to extend full support for the timely completion of the flagship Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP), and to undertake a feasibility study to connect the islands of Thilafushi and Giraavaru as an extension. The two leaders also agreed to develop a state-of-the-art commercial port at Thilafushi island in order to de-congest the Malé port and provide enhanced cargo handling capacity at Thilafushi. The two countries have decided to explore collaboration for development of transshipment facilities and bunkering services contributing towards Maldives Economic Gateway project at Ihavandhippolhu and Gaadhoo islands of Maldives; and to jointly work in harnessing the full potential of Hanimaadhoo and Gan airports that are being developed with Indian assistance as well as other airports of Maldives. Towards this end, both sides will also consider measures to strengthen air connectivity, attract investments and collaborate for efficient management of these airports. Modi and Muizzu decided to establish an 'Agriculture Economic Zone' and tourism investments in Haa Dhaalu atoll and fish processing and canning facility at Haa Alifu atoll with Indian assistance and to further expand through additional financing the successful High Impact Community Development Projects to take the India-Maldives people-centric development partnership to every part of Maldives. FTA In view of significant untapped potential for bilateral trade & investment, the two sides agreed to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the two countries and to promote bilateral investments and closer engagements between the two business chambers and entities; steps shall be taken for disseminating information relating to investment opportunities and to improve ease of doing business; A decision was also taken to enhance efforts to boost tourism between the two countries through marketing campaigns and collaborative efforts and share expertise on implementation of digital and financial services. In this context, there was a decision to cooperate in the domain of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) by launch of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Unique Digital Identity, Gati Shakti Scheme and other digital services that will enhance e-governance and delivery of services through digital domain for the benefit of people of Maldives. While welcoming the launch of RuPay card in Maldives, which will enhance ease of payments for Indian tourists visiting Maldives, the two countries decided to work closely to extend similar services for Maldivian nationals visiting India. Energy Cooperation Given the role of energy security in ensuring sustainable development, the two sides agreed to explore cooperation through implementation of solar power and other renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to bring down energy costs and enable Maldives to achieve its NDC Goals, both sides will establish a framework for an institutional partnership which will include training, exchange of visits, joint research, technical projects and promotion of investments. Towards this end, both sides will also undertake a feasibility study to identify measures that would enable Maldives to participate in the One Sun One World One Grid initiative. Defence & Security Cooperation India and Maldives share common challenges in the Indian Ocean Region which have multi-dimensional implications for the security and development of both the countries. They resolved to work together in advancing the maritime and security cooperation for the benefit of peoples of both India and Maldives as well as for the larger Indian Ocean Region. Maldives, with its vast Exclusive Economic Zone, is exposed to traditional and non-traditional maritime challenges including piracy, IUU fishing, drug smuggling, and terrorism. The two countries agreed that India will work closely with Maldives in sharing of expertise, augmenting capabilities and undertake joint cooperative measures, as per needs and requirements of Maldives. The also agreed that the ongoing Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) 'Ekatha' harbour project at Uthuru Thila Falhu (UTF) with India's assistance will significantly contribute towards enhancing MNDF's operational capabilities, and agreed to extend full support for its timely completion. The two sides also agreed to support Maldives with provisioning of defence platforms and assets to augment capabilities of MNDF as well as that of the Government of Maldives in advancing its maritime and security requirements in line with its national priorities; India will support Maldives in enhancing surveillance and monitoring capability of MNDF with the provisioning of radar systems and other equipment. India will also support Maldives on Hydrographic matters, including, through capacity building and training, as per the requirements of the Government of Maldives. India will assist Maldives in the domain of Information Sharing by supporting the development of capabilities through infrastructure, training and sharing of best practices. It will inaugurate at an early date the state-of-the-art Maldivian Ministry of Defence (MoD) building in Malé, constructed with India's assistance, that will augment modern infrastructural capacity of the MoD.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EGX59dic3WUj	2024-11-23T17:27:28-08:00	
What Lies Ahead: Understanding Trump’s Return To Power – Analysis	By Manoj Joshi Donald Trump’s victory will lead to major changes in almost all policy areas in the United States (US), from tariffs and immigration to the Ukraine war. How they will be prioritised is another matter. Characteristically, Trump also appears to grapple with personal challenges, including a strong inclination to address perceived or actual slights and instances of perceived persecution. The coming Trump era could well be the most unpredictable and disruptive in our times. His appointments indicate that he intends to fulfil his election pledges, especially on immigration. Beyond policy and personal foibles, the US elections hold immense significance. Till now, the first Trump presidency has often been viewed as an aberration and the Biden term as the norm. Now, however, it is the latter which seems to be a discontinuity. The second Trump term, which has been an all-round victory for the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) forces, will now be the norm for the US in the near future. The Trump win was not a defeat of liberalism, with its emphasis on individual rights, the rule of law, and constitutional checks on the state. It was one for neo-liberalism, which pushed globalism, abandoned the working class, and emphasised money-making over everything else. The American working class was wiped out as manufacturing relocated to Asia. Instead of their plight, neoliberal Democrats focused on narrower strands of the deprived—racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and so on. As deprived people, they were often given a leg up, even as the original working class sank and became increasingly susceptible to the appeal of MAGA politics. While this originally attracted the white working class, Trump succeeded in getting the support of the Black and Latino working class as well. Many people think that Trumpism will be a self-limiting disease. That the impossibility of achieving the contradictory set of objectives it has set for itself will temper Trump’s impact. For instance, take the issue of tariffs. Trump said last month, 'tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.' Most economists agreed that 10-20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports tariffs will raise prices in the US. There is a school of thought which believes that enacting tariffs will be a negotiating tactic, and nothing more. If this is so, there are two possible outcomes—other countries will lower their trade barriers, or, the more likely outcome, retaliate with their own tariffs. This will lead to an inflationary situation, something that Trump should know proved to be poison for the Democrats in this election. The big target is Mexico. Trump has declared that he will raise tariffs 200 or 500 percent: 'I don’t care. I’ll put a number where they can’t sell one car' (in the US). Currently, Mexico is the US’ biggest trade partner and has sold 2.55 million cars in the US in 2023. Tariffs would hit companies like Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen, but it would also affect American companies like Ford, General Motors (GM), and Stellantis, whose supply chains extend to Mexico, while also using the country as a manufacturing base. For Mexico, it will be a double whammy, since the largest number of undocumented migrants to be deported are from the same country. With regards to immigration, Trump wants to close the border and begin the process of deporting up to 11 million undocumented migrants. He has appointed hard-liners Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan to undertake this task, signalling his intention of fulfilling his campaign promises. This is no ordinary task as this community is now woven into the US’ social and economic fabric. Vice President J. D. Vance has said that the target is to deport some 1 million illegal immigrants per year. Prising them out, setting up detention centres, overcoming legal challenges and encouraging them to return to their homelands could take years. It will also affect the economy since migrants are the backbone of agriculture and construction industries, and their presence has helped keep wages in check. A deportation process is likely to lead to inflation. In many of these areas, the real question is what Trump will decide to focus on. Apparently, there are no less than 40 agendas he has promised to begin pursuing from his first day in office. Definitely, avenging himself against those he says have persecuted him in the Biden administration will be a priority. Among the targeted persons could be Jack Smith, former Attorney General Merrick Garland, as well as Trump’s friends-turned-enemies such as John Kelly, former Joint Chief of Staff, Chairman General Mark Milley, and Liz Cheney. Another strand of his policy will be a change in the rules to allow the firing of any federal official. There could be large-scale firings, accompanied by the appointment of MAGA supportors in their positions. Foreign policy is an area that will experience a big change. The likely appointment of Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State signals a hardline approach. Rubio is known for his hawkish positions on Iran, China, and Venezuela, as well as his support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza. Ukraine is likely to be a big loser, though the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could also find itself in crosshairs. Both the US and European Union (EU) short-changed the Ukrainians in the last two years through their niggling weapons supply policies. Now Ukraine may be forced to cede territory to achieve peace, even while NATO’s status hangs in the air. JD Vance has suggested that the aim would be to have Russia and Ukraine ceasefire along the current frontlines, which means a loss of around 18 percent of Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022. The Vance plan would also guarantee Ukrainian neutrality towards Russia. As for Israel, Trump will be more supportive of Israeli military activities and would not, like the Biden Administration, use US military assistance as leverage to push Israeli policy in any specific direction. According to the Times of Israel, Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants an end to the Gaza war by the time he takes office on 20 January 2025. But there are other issues where the US position will benefit Israel as well—particularly, destroying Hezbollah in Lebanon and dealing with Iran. Trump had walked away from the nuclear deal with Tehran and begun a campaign of 'maximum pressure,' with harsh sanctions to push Iran to end its nuclear programme and its policy of arming regional proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. There is a lot of talk about Trump’s hardline views on China. But people often forget that in January 2020, he willingly signed a trade deal with China. There is no reason to believe that another such deal could not take place and also include the status of Taiwan also in it. America is in trouble. Its polarisation has deepened with this election and Trump’s attacks on the government have weakened the important infrastructure of American power. There is little doubt that the West-led multilateral world order that was put in place after World War II is headed for a change. It has been showing strain for some time now, but the MAGA victory could have sounded the death knell. The UN Security Council (SC) is more or less frozen with the divisions between Russia, China, and the West. As for the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trump has ensured that its appellate function was torpedoed in 2016, and now, with a tariff war around the corner, there is little chance that it will be able to do anything about that. The Biden administration had strongly backed NATO and America’s East Asian allies—Japan, South Korea, Philippines and Australia. In the case of NATO, Trump has questioned whether the US would honour the alliance’s mutual defence clause and has actually suggested that he would encourage Russia to 'to do whatever the hell they want' to any NATO country that doesn’t pay enough. All this is not necessarily bad. Countries of the Global South could benefit from the US’ retreat from its dominant role in world affairs. The new multilateralism fostered by organisations like BRICS could reshape the world to better serve Indian interests. But this is no ordinary task, this new multilateralism will have to go beyond its penchant for declarations and deliver results on the ground.

China’s Increasing Global Drone Footprint – Analysis	By Abhishek Kumar Darbey China has established the world’ largest Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry. It has become the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs, with its signature models—the Wing Loong and Rainbow Series UAV.1 According to the SIPRI Arms Transfer Database, between 2008 and 2018, China exported a total of 181 fighter/combat drones and 163 strike-capable UAVs. The UAE (22 per cent), Saudi Arabia (19 per cent), Egypt (15 per cent) and Pakistan (14 per cent) have been the most significant recipients of Chinese drones, during this time period.2 According to the SIPRI, China has delivered more than 200 combat drones to 17 countries in the period 2013–2023.3 Chinese Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) have been used on battlefields in the Middle East and Africa. For instance, the Nigerian Air Force has been using CH-3 fighter drone in operations against Boko Haram, and Saudi Arabia has used Wing Loong II drones in the war against Houthi militias in Yemen. Egypt uses Wing Loong-II fighter drones against militant groups in north Sinai.4 In Iraq, Chinese combat drones carried out 260 air raids against ISIL (ISIS) targets as of mid-2018, with a success rate of nearly 100 per cent.5 Iraq had purchased four CH-4B Rainbow fighter drones in 2015. Saudi Arabia has been one of the oldest and regular customers of Chinese drones, and has imported 70 Chinese combat drones. Saudi Arabia first purchased a few CH-4 drones in 2014 and has since acquired at least 15 of the more lethal Wing Loong II drones, with an expressed interest to buy 285 more. China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has set up a drone manufacturing unit in Saudi Arabia after the agreement was reached between Xi Jinping and King Salman in February 2017. The state-owned Saudi Technology Development and Investment Company (TAQNIA) and CASC subsidiary Aerospace Long-March International Trade (ALIT) have worked on establishing this manufacturing unit. Abu Dhabi was the first export customer for the Wing Loong II drones, and received the first units in 2017.6 Similarly, China sold at least five Wing Loong I drones to UAE in 2011. In early 2017, the UAE purchased five Wing Loong II fighter drones. The Pakistani Air Force purchased five CH-4 Rainbow combat drones in January 2021,7 and in May 2024, Pakistan ordered 10 more CH-4 Rainbow-series of combat drones at around US$ 24 million.8 In 2013, Myanmar purchased 12 CH-3 fighter drones.9 The Serbian military has purchased CH-92A Reconnaissance/Attack drones worth US$ 19.3 million in June 2020.10 Chinese drones are cheaper than their Western counterparts, and therefore, are more appealing to those countries with limitations of budget. The CH-4 and the Wing Loong 2 are estimated to cost between US$ 1 m and US$ 2 m each, while the US-made Reaper costs US$ 16m and the Predator US$ 4m, according to CSIS, the US-based think tank. China also offers flexible payment terms to interested buyers, and many African buyers pay the amount in terms of oil and other natural resources.11 China is able to keep pace with the market demands of military drones in terms of innovation and quality, as regards flight control, integrated navigation, relay data link system, sensor technology, among others.12[xii] China has successfully developed dozens of new generation military unmanned aerial vehicles, models and prototypes, including stealth unmanned aerial vehicles, foldable wing unmanned aerial vehicles, short-distance take-off and landing ring-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, micro unmanned aerial vehicles and flying wing unmanned aerial vehicles.13 In order to increase its market share, China is investing to upgrade its drone manufacturing units. In late 2021, Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (Chengfei), a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation, signed an agreement with the Zigong Municipal Government of Sichuan to jointly build ‘the largest domestic UAV industrial base (无人机工业园区)’ worth 10 billion Yuan (US$ 1.55 billion) to manufacture military and commercial UAVs. It got operationalised in 2023.14 PLA and Military Uses of Drones China has a number of UAVs in service with the PLA Rocket Force, PLA Ground Force/Army, PLA Air Force and PLA Navy.15 The PLA is currently equipped with several long-endurance reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, the PLA Air Force’s drone brigade uses the Wing Loong-2 (GJ-2) drone, and the PLA Army uses Rainbow-4 reconnaissance and strike drone. According to Chinese media reports, the PLA Army has begun using KVD002 medium-altitude long-flight reconnaissance and strike drone at the theatre command and group army levels, unveiled in September 2023.16 The TB-001 drone is not just a reconnaissance and strike drone, but can be used along with the PLA Rocket Force’s anti-ship ballistic missiles.17 In August 2021, the China Central Television (CCTV) disclosed that the PLA Rocket Force had mastered the ability to accurately hit large mobile ships thousands of kilometers away at sea by guiding the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles. China has improved its applications of drone for patrolling its land borders as well as coastlines, and particularly along the Sino-Indian border and Taiwan Strait. PLA’s UAV troops have been deployed in large numbers in the Western Theatre Command. At present, PLA has deployed ‘GJ-2’ drones and ‘Rainbow-4’ drones in the Western Theatre Command for reconnaissance activities along the borders. In 2019, the AV500W reconnaissance and strike integrated helicopter was also deployed on the Tibetan plateau. This unmanned helicopter weighs 450 kilograms and has a ceiling of 6,700 meters. It can carry four small laser-guided air-to-surface missiles to accurately strike enemy personnel and light vehicles.18 Similarly, China has been using its drones to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance activities in the East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Japan and Taiwan reported Chinese drone patrols over their claimed waters. In May 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that the WZ-10 UAV flew over the East China Sea and approached Japan.19 PLA used the BZK-005 and TB-001 drones to fly into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. Both drones have reconnaissance and attack capabilities. The BZK-005 is a large multi-purpose drone with a maximum endurance of 40 hours, and its cruising altitude is 3,000 to 7,000 meters.20 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed on 25 August 2023 that two Chinese drones flew around Taiwan for nearly 24 hours. The two Chinese drones identified were reconnaissance/attack drone ‘TB001’ and the reconnaissance drone ‘BZK005’.21 In August 2024, a Wing Loong 10 was seen flying along the Vietnamese coastline to the southern city of Nha Trang.22 In recent times, China has entered into foreign collaborations to develop military drones. On 25 September, Reuters reported that Russian UAV company IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned arms company Almaz-Antey, is working with Chinese specialists to develop a new drone model called Garpiya-3 (G3), which is a 2,000 km range attack drone. Another Russian firm Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial has set up 80-hectare ‘Advanced UAV Research and Manufacturing Base’ in Shenzhen in China that would be able to produce 800 long-range attack drones per year, similar to G3 attack drones. 23 Conclusion The Chinese military is gradually being equipped with drones of increasing lethality and capabilities. Chinese defence universities have special programmes to train PLA soldiers majoring in drone technology and applications. Chinese drone manufacturers such as DJI have captured a significant chunk of global civilian drone market. According to the 2023–2024 China Drone Development Report released by the China Air Transport Association, as of the end of August 2024, nearly 2 million drones were registered in China, an increase of 720,000 from the end of 2023. By 2025, the output of China’s civilian drones is expected to exceed 200 billion yuan.24 Chinese military drones, meanwhile, are widely being used in conflict hotspots across the world, particularly so in Africa and the Middle East. The PLA has intensified the military drones R&D as well as manufacturing activities. Going forward, the global footprint of Chinese military as well as civilian drone programmes is only expected to grow exponentially.

Germany At A Crossroads: Coalition Breakdown Portends Sweeping Ch...	By Melanie Banerjee On November 6, shortly after the results of the 2024 US elections became clear, Germany was plunged into political uncertainty when Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a confidence vote for January 2025. Given the flagging popularity of the coalition government, the confidence vote is likely to result in snap elections in February, well ahead of the expected date of September 2025. The catalyst for these events traces back to a leaked policy position paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), which proposed policies in stark contrast to the FDP’s coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens. The paper, titled Economic Transition for Germany: Economic Concepts for Growth and Intergenerational Fairness, contradicts and negates key aspects of coalition policy, including climate action, social security, taxation, and Germany’s Sonderweg thesis (the ‘unique path’). The disclosure effectively fractured the coalition, with Chancellor Scholz dismissing FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leaving the SPD and Greens to rule in as a minority government. Now evidently heading into early elections, the question arises: How will Germany’s economic transformation be impacted if these ideas are given central political consideration? Let’s examine. A Challenge to Germany’s Top-down Welfare State Germany takes pride in its socialist politics, which became a touchstone for modern Germany following the world wars, and whose emergence broadly shaped the German political economy of the 19th century before paving the way from aristocracy to democracy. These politics have been influenced by the Sonderweg thesis, which asserts the importance of German exceptionalism in the West. This school of thought believes in democracy and social reforms as a top-down approach, wherein the state is responsible for initiating and implementing reforms without demands ‘from below.’ In this context, for example, the German government drafted an enactment in May aimed at stabilizing pension levels and creating a generational capital fund for the Statutory Pension Insurance System. The leaked policy paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner argues against this top-down welfare model, stating that it is unsustainable from a budgetary perspective and exhibits anti-emancipatory characteristics that burden future generations. He also supported the debt brake (Schuldenbremse), a provision in the German Constitution (Basic Law) that limits government spending when potential revenues are insufficient. Lindner has described the rising costs of an ageing population as an intergenerational injustice that negatively impacts national finances. Various academics and policymakers have roundly criticized Lindner’s stance. The full impact of this policy shift won’t become apparent until the 2025 elections have run their course. But by risking concessions to Germany’s elderly population, in the context of a stagnant workforce and income levels, there is a growing opportunity for the rise of neo-Marxist ideals, which view retirees as rent-seekers, further exacerbating economic imbalances. Moreover, this assumption implicitly regards pensions as passive income, without considering factors such as investment expenses, income taxes on returns, personal spending, or charitable contributions. An obstinate focus on combining growth parameters with medium- and long-term political strategies, without factoring in economic consumption as part of the rate of capital or wealth growth, risks jeopardizing the future of the federal German economy. This approach may foster the belief that pensioners are not active participants in the economy, leading to the misguided notion that the growth rate of wealth is negative. Climate Policies on the Chopping Block The latest draft of Germany’s 2025 budget prioritized commitments to address negative climate impacts on the economy, allotting special funds to trigger the clean energy transition, especially in sectors such as affordable housing, supply chains, and EV charging. However, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has increasingly referred to Germany’s budget position on the Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF), adopted by the federal government in August 2024, as ‘politically enforced decarbonization,’ arguing that it is a leading cause of capital shocks to public finances, resulting in sluggish investments. Despite ongoing legislative proceedings that are expected to finalize the fund’s implementation by 2025, Lindner’s policy position does not address the constitutional mandate to re-draft the 2024 budget, following the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the debt limit in November 2023. The dissolution of the ruling coalition is likely to cast a shadow over the future of German climate policy, risking increased bureaucratic pressure and negative consequences for the implementation of the KTF. Furthermore, any bureaucratic delays in meeting Germany’s 2045 emissions targets will complicate the country’s industrial transition to renewable energy. Despite mounting pressures, Lindner has overlooked the position of Germany’s farming sector, which will be one of the most affected by these developments. The sector is already grappling with hyperinflation due to rising national CO2 emissions pricing, which also impacts transportation and heating. According to the DG Agriculture and Rural Development’s 2nd Report (EU Commission, Spring 2024), Germany was ranked among the top three Western European countries unable to afford a proper meal in 2022, surpassing the EU average. Additionally, the latest Global Food Security Index of 2022, published by Economist Impact, places Germany in the red for food security and access, ranking it 80th globally—among the lowest in high-income countries. The negative rating is attributed to a lack of a comprehensive food security strategy and agency, with no improvement since 2012. The collapse of the Traffic Light coalition has paved the way for a rise in pro-corporate political approaches in the upcoming snap elections of 2025, likely accompanied by demands for public budget allocations for subsidies and tax cuts. With German industries already struggling with fierce competition from Asian markets, a shock stimulus to boost industrial competitiveness could undermine medium-term growth potential and exacerbate existing economic imbalances. Public Versus Private Lindner’s policy recommendations have taken broad swipes at the ruling government’s regulatory standards, advocating for a series of corporate tax cuts and the abolition of solidarity surcharges (Solidaritätszuschlag or Soli) on SMEs and freelance workers, all in the name of boosting innovation and competition. While the recommendations may appear well-intentioned, the former finance minister seems intent on sacrificing the public sector and marginalized groups. Taken together, these proposals reflect a steadfast rejection of German budgetary sustainability, which is crucial in the current economic climate. The assumption that corporate tax cuts, facilitated by reduced public services, will eventually pay for themselves through future growth is, to put it mildly, flawed. Not only do these policy measures threaten to undermine public services in the long term, but they also risk destabilizing inflationary pressures in the short term, leading to economic turmoil. No Turning Back Given the present conditions, one might assume that Germany needs to transition into economic nationalism to preserve the prospects of the Sonderweg and its political economy. Ex-Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s position paper asserts intergenerational injustice as a leading consequence of Germany’s economic downturn. However, the turmoil within the current German administration following the finance minister’s policy recommendations has overlooked the positive aspects of internationalism that have positioned post-war Germany as a global leader. Moreover, with mobility, migration, and international trade at the center of Germany’s political triangulations, the position paper’s failure to address outward mobility, diasporic contributions, and social values that disfavor trade protectionism as a decisive factor in social renewal to sustain the German Sonderweg presents an exclusionary narrative. This risks threatening Germany’s position as a major economic bulwark in the Global North. If anything, Germany’s national growth owes its enormous economic profitability to the international division of labor. Although the post-pandemic economic struggles affecting the German working class are no trivial matter, Germany’s emotionally charged political debates about the values of German work (Deutsche Arbeit) are unfair in spirit, pitting the country’s crisis consciousness against the depoliticization of socio-political institutions. Among Ordoliberals such as Lindner, there exists a perception of the economy as an isolated order, one where results are a direct outcome of influence on the systemic order rather than on the processes themselves. This enables the scope of economic short-termism, devoid of future sustainability. For now, Germany’s political uncertainty illustrates demands for minimal state interventionism to stabilize the economy in the long term. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the theoretical currents of such economic liberalism in post-pandemic Germany will translate into a classical problem of secondary deflation or create a decentralized competitive order that paves the way for institutional integrity toward social reunification.

Iran’s Regime Reacts To IAEA Resolution Against Its Nuclear Progr...	On November 21, 2024, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors adopted a resolution condemning Iran’s regime for its lack of cooperation with the agency and provide a comprehensive report on its nuclear activities. This resolution, proposed by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States, was approved with 19 votes in favor, 3 against, and 12 abstentions In an effort to prevent the adoption of the resolution, which could activate snapback sanctions, Iran’s mobilized all available lobbying resources. Despite these efforts, the major European powers ultimately introduced the resolution, which was then approved by the Board of Governors. According to The New York Times, Abbas Araghchi, the regime’s foreign minister, contacted officials from member states of the Board of Governors, including Brazil, South Africa, Bangladesh, Algeria, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan, asking them to oppose the resolution. Alongside Araghchi’s lobbying and pressuring of Board of Governors’ member states via phone calls from Tehran and efforts in Vienna, Iranian officials and media issued a series of threats during and after a visit by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi to Tehran, warning of severe retaliatory actions should a resolution be adopted. However, after the blow of the Board of Governors’ resolution, Iran’s Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization issued a joint, fearful statement declaring their readiness for 'constructive engagement with relevant parties' in the 'development of a peaceful and indigenous nuclear program.' The weak joint statement claimed that the administration of Masoud Pezeshkian had prioritized continuing and enhancing cooperation with the IAEA since its inception to resolve outstanding issues. This stance contradicts earlier declarations by officials from these same institutions, who had stated that any resolution by the Board of Governors would signal the end of cooperation, mark the start of confrontation, and be intolerable. They had also threatened an immediate, severe, and 'regret-inducing' response if such a resolution were adopted. A state-affiliated media outlet, under the headline 'Iran Will Respond to the Counterproductive Actions of the Board of Governors,' wrote: '[Mohammad] Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, emphasized Iran’s cooperation with the IAEA but announced that if a resolution is adopted against Iran at the next IAEA meeting, Tehran will begin new nuclear measures even before the resolution’s adoption. Iran’s Foreign Minister also stressed this point in diplomatic terms.' Hassan Ghashghavi, the head of the nuclear committee of the regime’s Majlis (parliament), had explicitly stated before the resolution’s issuance: 'If a resolution is prepared against our country by the IAEA Board of Governors, we will undoubtedly and immediately take measures that will definitely be regret-inducing.' Following the weak joint statement by the Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization, Kazem Gharibabadi, the regime’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, issued an unconvincing threat, delaying the 'immediate and regret-inducing response' until after the snapback sanctions are reinstated. He stated: 'If they revert to the snapback mechanism and reinstate UN Security Council sanctions, the Islamic Republic will respond swiftly by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).' More absurdly, Gharibabadi foolishly added: 'This is a decision that the state made several years ago and has officially communicated to them in writing.' (State television, November 21, 2024). Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the former head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Majlis, attributed the regime’s weak and anxious response to the resolution’s impact as follows: 'The IAEA resolution was the first sign of a harsh winter for Iran. Europe has aligned itself with Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. They are demanding the rollback of nuclear activities and programs and the increase of inspections without offering any concessions.' Reuters reported on the consequences of the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution, stating that it compels the regime to cooperate with the IAEA. The Western powers behind the resolution intend to pressure the regime into negotiating new restrictions on its nuclear activities. However, it remains unclear whether the regime or its counterparts have the appetite or intention for another round of talks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EO6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-23T16:45:11-08:00	
Disparate Impact Is A Legal Trick – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya One of the most destructive fallacies of critical race theory is its insistence that racial disparities are caused by discrimination. The CRT premise is that any gap in racial attainment calls for an explanation, and—in the absence of any convincing explanation—they are compelled to conclude that such gaps are caused by discrimination. Many readers will be familiar with Thomas Sowell’s refutation of that argument. In arguing that disparities do not prove discrimination, Sowell challenges the premise that, in the absence of discrimination, we should expect all human beings to have equal life opportunities, experiences, and outcomes. In his book, Disparities and Discrimination Sowell 'argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong.' It is wrong to expect equal attainment from human beings—people have different skills, abilities, and talents, so we would have no reason to expect that, if they are all given an 'equal' starting point, they would all exhibit uniform and equal levels of attainment. The gap between black and white The civil rights industry is founded on the debunked premise that disparities are prima facie evidence of discrimination. A large part of civil rights enforcement is now devoted to collecting statistics which will reveal attainment 'gaps.' These gaps are then treated as presumptive evidence of discrimination which, at the very least, will merit an investigation from what Lew Rockwell called 'the anti-discrimination police'—the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Collecting data on race with a view to exposing attainment gaps is a well-funded industry. For example, in the context of educational attainment, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights had a budget of $178 million in 2024. Civil rights activists feel this is not enough to monitor all the gaps, and are requesting that the budget should be doubled: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, and the 91 undersigned organizations, we urge you to double the funding for the U.S. Department of Education’s ('the department') Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to $280 million in your FY2025 request to Congress. The Leadership Conference appreciated the $178 million requested for FY2024; however, this vital office, central to the function of the department as a whole, has been sorely underfunded for far too long. The Civil Rights Data Collection office of the DOE aims 'to ensure CRDC data is an accurate and comprehensive depiction of student access to educational opportunities.' They also collect 'data on access to and enrollment in mathematics and science classes,' which can be used to demonstrate a racial 'gap' in children’s 'educational opportunities' in the sciences. Making an effort preemptively to avoid having statistics that reflect a racial gap can help schools avoid costly investigations from the anti-discrimination police. This explains why, to avoid their statistics showing a racial gap in mathematics, some schools have decreed that in 'antiracist math practice' there are no 'correct' answers to mathematical problems. That way all the children’s sums can be marked by teachers as correct and voila—no statistical gap! By this means they propose to eradicate 'inequity in math': Educators around the country have come out to condemn a ‘Dismantling Racism in Mathematics’ program which tells teachers not to push students to find the correct answers to math problems because doing so promotes white supremacy. The program is centered around a workbook for teachers entitled ‘A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction’ which asserts that America’s education system – even mathematics instruction – reinforces the dominant power structures of white colonizers. Legal tricks and statistical chicanery Attainment gaps incur legal penalties through what Rockwell terms 'a legal trick,' or what M. Lester O’Shea terms 'legal, statistical and verbal chicanery'—the concept of 'disparate impact.' This concept was invented by the Supreme Court of the United States in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971). According to the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, the aim of this concept is to safeguard black people from 'the repercussions of past discrimination': The disparate impact regulations seek to ensure that programs accepting federal money are not administered in a way that perpetuates the repercussions of past discrimination. As the Supreme Court has explained, even benignly-motivated policies that appear neutral on their face may be traceable to the nation’s long history of invidious race discrimination in employment, education, housing, and many other areas. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430–31 (1971); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 176–77 (1980); Gaston Cty. v. United States, 395 U.S. 285, 297 (1969). Unlike the concept of disparate treatment, which relates to how public institutions treat racial minorities, the concept of disparate impact focuses entirely on the effect on the 'victim.' As the DOJ adds, 'In a disparate impact case, the investigation focuses on the consequences of the recipient’s practices, rather than the recipient’s intent.' This is why civil rights activists highlight the role of data in revealing the impact of educational policies on black students. Rather than examining the curriculum or school attendance records, they can just check the gap between white and black performance—the gap is treated as evidence that the 'educational opportunities' are not 'meaningful' and 'Dr.' MLK-style dreams are then said not yet to be 'actualized': OCR’s enforcement, policy, technical assistance, and data responsibilities have considerable impact on whether or not students’ access to equal educational opportunities are meaningful and whether the rights of marginalized students to receive the supports and opportunities they deserve to achieve their dreams are actualized. The result of this trickery is that the civil rights framework does not require evidence of 'discrimination' in the sense most people understand that term. It relies on statistical gaps. The government has transformed power conferred upon it to eradicate 'discrimination' into a bureaucratic industry based on data showing statistical disparities between racial groups. The reason people do not object to this—despite Sowell’s work being widely known and despite cases of businesses driven to bankruptcy by racial discrimination claims based on nothing more than statistical chicanery—is that it is still socially unacceptable to be 'racist.' Caldwell observes that, 'The innovations of the 1960s had given progressives control over the most important levers of government, control that would endure for as long as the public was afraid of being called racist.' Caldwell shows that declaring civil rights enforcement to be 'unconstitutional,' far from resolving the dispute, merely restates the problem in different words. The problem is the contestation between the old de jure Constitution and the new de facto Civil Rights 'constitution.' Constitutional lawfare is, therefore, not able to resolve the essential danger that was correctly identified by Lew Rockwell in 1995: The Constitution has never stood in the way of civil rights enforcement. In the name of stamping out illegal discrimination, fundamental rights like freedom of association are denied daily… Politicians are promising to do something about it, but they have missed the larger point. Our troubles don’t stem from 'quotas,' 'set asides,' and the like; they stem from the presumption that government should be monitoring 'discrimination' in the first place. Pass all the anti-quota laws you want. Until anti-discrimination law is repealed, nothing can block the march of big government. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

What Happens When China Puts Boots On The Ground In Myanmar? – An...	By David Hutt It now appears to be a question of 'when, not if' Chinese security personnel will arrive in Myanmar, with Beijing looking to secure its strategic interests in the war-torn country and those of its ally, the military junta that has lost large chunks of the country since the 2021 coup. The Irrawaddy online news outlet reported that the junta formed a 13-member working committee on October 22 to prepare the groundwork to establish a 'joint security company' with China. According to the report, the committee, chaired by Major-General Toe Yi, the junta’s deputy home affairs minister, is currently tasked with 'scrutinizing the importing and regulating of weapons and special equipment' until Beijing signs a drafted MOU on forming a 'security company.' After that, according to the narrative from Beijing and Naypyidaw, Chinese personnel would join a 'company' — more like a militia — alongside junta troops, which would be tasked with defending Chinese strategic and economic interests in the country. I’m told that China will send troops from the military and police in a 'private' capacity, giving the fiction of detachment. Yet this would not be a joint venture in anything but name. Does one seriously think that Chinese troops or police are going to listen to the Myanmar generals who have lost battle after battle to ethnic armies and ill-trained civilian militias over the past four years? Moreover, there is no reason to think that the China-junta 'militia' will stick to merely protecting Chinese nationals and Chinese-owned businesses in Myanmar. Chinese projects delayed It is true that Chinese assets have come under increased levels of attack from anti-junta forces in recent months. There is some logic, if you’re sitting in Beijing and Naypyidaw, in wanting to allow Chinese forces to help command most of northern Myanmar, giving junta forces a better chance of mopping up rebel forces elsewhere. The civil war has delayed key Chinese projects in the country, such as the long-planned China-Myanmar Economic Corridor between China’s Yunnan province and Myanmar’s Indian Ocean coast. Strategically key for Beijing is a port it wants to build in Rakhine state, allowing China to import oil and gas from the Middle East without ships needing to pass through the Malacca Strait, a potential chokepoint. This would be essential in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea, during which the Philippines or Taiwan could try to blockade Chinese trade, including oil and gas imports on which China’s economy depends. My sources say that the majority of the PLA contingent will be deployed to Rakhine state. According to statements released by Beijing, almost certainly intended to construct a peace narrative ahead of the deployment, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in August that he hoped 'Myanmar will earnestly safeguard the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.' When Min Aung Hlaing visited China earlier this month, his first visit since the coup, Chinese Premier Li Qiang instructed him to 'take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions, and projects in the country.' The reality, as Beijing knows well, is that the junta cannot ensure these things. That’s the entire reason why the 'security companies' are deemed necessary by the Chinese government. Offensive operations Once Chinese security personnel are on the ground in Myanmar, the fiction that they’re just standing guard outside a few industrial compounds or pipelines will become difficult to maintain. Indeed, they’re likely to have no choice but to mount offensive operations. The most obvious reason to expect this is that many Chinese-run enterprises are in territory currently controlled by resistance groups that will presumably need to be taken by Chinese forces. If not, why would Beijing make a u-turn on its existing policy, which had been to cajole and pay the ethnic militias to leave Chinese entities out of their fight with the junta? Secondly, after years of dallying, Beijing now clearly thinks that it cannot trust the anti-junta National Unity Government (NUG), presumably because it’s too pro-Western, nor most of the anti-junta ethnic militias – even those who have taken money from Beijing. Chinese authorities reportedly detained Peng Daxun, the leader of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), a militia that has inflicted heavy casualties on the junta, after he was summoned to Yunnan for a parlay last month. This may be a temporary detention pour encourager les autres, or it may be Beijing trying to dismantle disloyal militias more permanently. Yet, in essence, Beijing has now thrown its weight behind the junta because it presumably believes China’s interests would be best served by an outright junta victory. So if Beijing thinks the ultimate way of protecting Chinese business interests in Myanmar, for now and in the long term, is for the civil war to be ended and for junta forces to win the conflict decisively, the difference between Chinese security personnel conducting defensive and offensive operations is paper thin. Why wouldn’t Beijing use its troops to bring about its overarching goal? Why would Beijing overlook the opportunity to end a civil war that it wants over? Anti-China sentiment Why would Beijing merely send personnel to defend Chinese factories and pipelines for a few months or years if it thinks there is the possibility that forces hostile to Chinese interests could eventually take power nationally? Under these circumstances, Chinese personnel would think it justified, under the narrative of 'safeguarding the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions and projects in the country,' to wage offensive assaults against anti-junta forces across Myanmar. Granted, the junta is touchy about being seen as a lackey of Beijing — or about Myanmar becoming a protectorate of China. That is why Beijing has offered platitudes of a joint 'security company,' a fiction to get around Myanmar’s constitution that forbids the deployment of foreign troops. But what position will the junta be in to dictate what Chinese personnel can do or where they can go once they are in Myanmar? Lastly, does one imagine that anti-junta forces won’t retaliate against Chinese intervention, especially when that intervention is so clearly on behalf of the regime? Anti-China sentiment is running high in Myanmar and will boil over once Chinese troops and police step foot in the country. One can very easily imagine an escalating campaign of attacks by anti-junta forces on Chinese interests – increasing the incentives for Chinese security personnel to launch offensive operations. Once Chinese boots are on the ground in Myanmar, this means direct intervention by China – not merely an economic peacekeeping effort by joint 'security companies.' And Chinese personnel will have to conduct offensive operations – not just stand guard at Chinese-run factories and pipelines.

Abkhazia: Lots Of Drama Unlikely To Produce Change	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- A political crisis in the Russian-dominated, separatist entity of Abkhazia has been defused, but the underlying issue that prompted the unrest – legislation that would grant Russians favorable real estate investment privileges – remains unaddressed. In the end, Russia, the territory’s financial sponsor, is likely to end up getting what it wants. Opponents of the legislative measure to grant Russians insider access to real estate and other investment opportunities occupied the de-facto government’s offices in the Abkhaz capital Sokhumi on November 15, aiming to block passage of the bill. After a more than four-day standoff, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic, Aslan Bzhania, announced his resignation. In return, the protesters ended their occupation of government buildings, and an early election for the leadership of the territory, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s amid a civil conflict, was announced. Abkhazia’s de facto parliament has approved Bzhania’s resignation and on November 21 was still debating on a date for a snap election. The drama may end up being a case of much ado about nothing. Bzhania, who appears to retain Russia’s backing, has already announced his intention to run again. It remains unclear who opposition leaders will nominate as their candidate, or if they will opt to unify around a single candidate. The controversial Russian investment bill that was to have been debated and, likely, finalized on November 15, remains on the table, its fate uncertain. The agreement that defused the political crisis between the de facto government and its opposition did not address the fate of the bill. The Kremlin is unlikely to alter its intentions to dominate Abkhazia’s real estate market, even if Bzhania opponents come to power. According to sources in the Russian government, Moscow does not view Bzhania critics as opponents of the Kremlin’s wishes, the independent news outlet Vyorstka (Вёрстка) reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on November 18 emphasized Russia’s support for the swift normalization of the situation in Abkhazia, expressing hope it would remain within constitutional boundaries. When asked about the impact of the protests on bilateral relations, Peskov affirmed that ties with Abkhazia are 'a very important priority of our foreign policy.'

Poland: Warsaw Mayor Runs For President As Ruling Party’s Candida...	By Aleksandra Krzysztoszek (EurActiv) -- The Warsaw mayor won his party's primaries and will run to be the Polish president as the candidate of Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition (KO, EPP) alliance. In the primaries held on Friday (22 November), Rafał Trzaskowski beat foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, by wining 75% of the votes. 'I know that the winner will go to the elections with full determination,' Prime Minister and KO leader Donald Tusk said, announcing the outcome. Praised by his supporters for his skills and knowledge of foreign languages, Trzaskowski served as minister of digital affairs in the previous Tusk government between 2013 and 2014. He then became mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and was re-elected to the post in 2023. Trzaskowski thanked his voters and pointed out that KO had decided to hold primaries 'as a truly democratic party,' unlike the main opposition PiS (ECR), where party leader Jarosław Kaczyński has the final say. 'In PiS, just one voice counts. Here, every vote counts,' he said. Sikorski thanked his rival for a 'chivalrous competition' and praised his idea of organising primaries. He also called on those who voted for him to support Trzaskowski 'unconditionally' in the elections. 'Rafał, fight, fight, fight and win!' he told Trzaskowski. Trzaskowski is the clear favourite in the elections. According to the latest polls, he is likely to win no matter who the PiS nominates as its candidate. PiS to name its candidate on Sunday Incumbent Polish President Andrzej Duda is finishing his second term as president, the constitution stops him from running for another term. As a result, the PiS is looking for a new candidate, which it will announce as early as Sunday (24 November), according to party sources. The same sources suggest Karol Nawrocki, former head of the Institute of National Remembrance, will be the most likely contender. Other names that could be in the running include controversial former education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, MEP Tobiasz Bocheński, and former prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mateusz Morawiecki is the least likely candidate for the PiS presidential nomination, as his tenure as prime minister may weigh against him. He has also expressed interest in the ECR leadership, currently held by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (FdI, ECR). After the party lost power in Poland, because of the 2023 parliamentary election, from PiS's perspective, keeping the presidency is crucial, as it would allow the party to maintain influence over the government and veto legislation. For the same reason, it is essential for Tusk's ruling coalition to win since it would no longer have to deal with presidents who veto laws and hamper the implementation of his party's policies. These include restoring judicial independence, which is key for Poland to receive further EU recovery funds. While the ruling coalition initially considered nominating a single candidate for president, at the end of the day, each party decided to run a separate candidate. Last week, parliamentary speaker and head of the Poland 2050 party (Renew), Szymon Hołownia, announced his bid. The Left (S&D) is going to name their candidate soon. The opposition Confederation (PfE/ESN) party nominated its co-leader, Sławomir Mentzen.

MSMEs In ASEAN: Addressing The Financing Gap – OpEd	Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the life blood of ASEAN's economy. They make up for over 97% of all businesses, provide nearly 70% of employment, and contribute around 40% to the region's GDP. These businesses could be big or small - they could be the street-side food vendors in Bangkok, the family-owned coffee processors in Vietnam, and the tech startups emerging in Singapore's bustling ecosystem. Yet, despite playing a critical role in driving growth and innovation, they face a persistent, almost enigmatic problem: financing. Governments, banks, and even fintech platforms are pouring in funds to address this gap. Hence one would assume that it would be much easier for MSMEs to access the funds they need. But it may not be true. As per a report by ADB, there is a significant financing gap across ASEAN that exceeds a staggering $300 billion annually. It leaves many asking: Why, after so many initiatives and so much support, do MSMEs continue to struggle for financing? Governments of ASEAN member states are making strategic moves to tackle this issue. An example would be Indonesia's recent loan forgiveness program. The initiative was just recently launched in November 2024, which allows MSMEs with debts under 500 million Indonesian rupiah to clear their bad loans with state banks. The aim is to have over three million of these businesses get a fresh start and a second chance to succeed. On the private sector front, financial giants, HSBC, unveiled a $1 billion ASEAN Growth Fund which would also support MSMEs desiring to scale up digital platform businesses. Although the idea is simple, it is transformative. The initiative will empower MSMEs to embrace technology and thrive in the digital economy. Fintech platforms have got a head start and are rewriting the rules of MSME financing. Funding Societies is one of Southeast Asia’s largest MSME digital finance platform and it has already disbursed over $3 billion in loans. Partnerships with traditional banks are further amplifying this impact. Maybank is one of the large banks in southeast Asia that has recently invested in the platform and has commended the fintech firm for bridging the financing gap. The rise of digital lending and crowdfunding platforms has helped MSMEs immensely as now they can now bypass the cumbersome paperwork and collateral requirements of traditional loans. Yet, even with all these new developments in the finance landscape, many MSMEs are still deprived of the finances they so badly need to both start and grow their businesses. When starting an enterprise, MSMEs are unable to provide adequate collateral or formal financial records needed for securing loans from banks. Historically banks perceive MSMEs as high risk, which limits MSMEs access to resources. Fragmented regulatory environment across ASEAN further complicates the situation. Each country in the ASEAN region has its own definitions and rules for MSMEs and this creates unnecessary hurdles for regional financing initiatives. This lack of consistency often makes it challenging for cross-border financiers to introduce uniform lending products. Some MSMEs, despite running their businesses successfully for over a decade, are repeatedly denied loans just because they are unable to provide formal collateral. Banks often need land deeds or large deposits as collateral making it even harder for the MSMEs. Without access to formal financing, they often turn to informal lending where the interest could be exorbitant. Some MSME report that they are charged 2% to as high as 20% per month as interest from these informal lending channels. Without proper financing MSMEs cannot grow and the alternatives too are exploitative. These highlight the glaring mismatch between what MSMEs need and what is currently available. Indeed, the government programs and fintech platforms have made progress but there’s still a long way to go. Policymakers and financial institutions must rethink their strategies and address the root causes of these challenges. One immediate solution could be to develop a centralized credit database for ASEAN. Such a system would aggregate and share MSME credit information from across the region, thus, making it easier for banks and fintech platforms to assess risk and provide loans confidently. Harmonizing MSME definitions and regulations across ASEAN through a standardized framework would simplify cross-border financing and make regional initiatives more effective. Financial literacy programs tailored for MSMEs provide small business owners the much-needed guidance on managing finances and effectively using digital tools. Singapore’s SkillsFuture program and Malaysia’s SMECorp serve as strong examples of how targeted training can empower small business owners. ASEAN’s digital economy is projected to grow to $1 trillion by 2030 and this offers immense opportunities for MSMEs to integrate and thrive. MSMEs are the backbone of ASEAN economies. Although these businesses are small, their impact on economies and societies is massive. Hence the effort should be to not just to close the financing gap but to unlock the full potential of MSMEs as drivers of inclusive and sustainable growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBWSpE5FfLrj	2024-11-23T16:21:11-08:00	
Robert Reich: GM, Corporate Greed, And The Reason The Democrats L...	At the same time Democrats and progressives are justifiably enraged at Trump’s gonzo Cabinet picks, they’re all but mute about corporate America’s continued siphoning of economic gains to the top. Yet this siphoning has created the stagnant wages and insecure jobs that helped propel Trump into the presidency and give Republicans control over both chambers of Congress. Trump at least gave workers an explanation for what’s happened to them — although it was a lie: It isn’t undocumented immigrants or the 'deep state' or transgender kids or any other Trump bogeyman. It’s corporate greed. The most recent example: On Friday, GM announced it was laying off 1,000 workers. These layoffs followed another round of GM layoffs in August, which saw 1,500 jobs cut. The cuts affected both salaried and hourly staff, including some United Auto Workers members. Most of the workers being laid off Friday were notified via email early Friday morning. Some had been working for GM for over thirty years. GM says it has no choice. It must cut costs. This is what we hear again and again from corporate America. We’ll be hearing even more of this as Artificial Intelligence takes over white-collar as well as blue-collar jobs. No choice? GM is on track for making record profits this year, surpassing its 2022 record profit of $14.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2024 alone, GM made $3.4 billion. That’s a $200 million increase from the same period last year. GM CEO Mary Barra’s compensation for 2024 is $27.8 million. This includes a base salary of $2.1 million, stock awards of $14.6 million, stock option awards valued at $4.9 million, an 'incentive plan' compensation (as if she needed more incentive) of $5.3 million, other payment of $997,392, and perks (personal travel, security, financial counseling, company vehicles, and an executive health plan) valued at $389,005. The ratio of Barra’s compensation to that of the typical GM employee is estimated to be 303-to-1. In June, GM announced $6 billion in stock buybacks. This means $6 billion of GM’s record profits will be used to purchase its own shares of stock — thereby boosting share prices (and the portion of Barra’s compensation in stock grants and options) simply because fewer shares of GM stock will be in circulation. Keep in mind that the richest 1 percent of American hold over half of the value of all shares of stock held by Americans, and the richest 10 percent hold 92 percent. So, in fact, GM’s savings from axing 1,000 jobs will be transferred into the pockets of wealthy Americans (including GM’s CEO). Why aren’t Democrats up in arms about this? I haven’t heard Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, or any other leading Democrat say a critical word about GM’s latest move. Why isn’t Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer — who may be in the running for president in 2028 (assuming we have another election) — accusing GM of sacrificing jobs for profits that are siphoned off to big investors? Why aren’t Democrats, who still control the Senate and presidency, moving more aggressively to outlaw stock buybacks — which were considered illegal stock manipulations before Ronald Reagan’s SEC gave them the green light? Why aren’t they demanding that capital gains taxes be increased on the super-wealthy, whose stock gains this year alone have made America’s billionaires 30 percent richer? Why aren’t they moving to increase corporate taxes on corporations whose ratio of CEO pay to their median workers is more than 50 to 1? And impose even higher taxes if the ratio exceeds 100 to 1? (Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse, along with Representatives Barbara Lee and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have introduced just such a bill, but no one knows about it. Why isn’t the Democratic leadership loudly pushing this?) The lesson of the debacle of the 2024 election is that big corporations and the wealthy have shafted average working Americans, whose wages and jobs have gone nowhere for decades and who are understandably frustrated and angry at what they see as a rigged system. But Democrats have offered no alternative explanation for what’s happened to average working people or agenda for remedying it. Trump's baseless explanation and agenda are the only ones available. So it’s no surprise that many working Americans voted for Trump on Election Day. Now Trump and his Republican stooges think they’ve been given a license to blow the system up — initially by appointing a bunch of clowns, conspiracy theorists, and sexual predators to key posts. It’s important to rail against Trump’s appointments. But unless we attack the sources of the outrage Trump has tapped into, working Americans will continue to go along with whatever Trump and his lapdogs want to do.

Zelenskyy Says Putin Aiming To Regain Kursk Territory Before Trum...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia is seeking to drive his forces out of the Kursk region before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year but added that the military situation in the Donetsk region is the most critical for his country. 'I am certain that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to push us out before January 20,' Zelenskiy told reporters, referring to the day of Trump’s inauguration. 'It is very important for him to show that he controls the situation' in Kursk. Ukraine stunned the Kremlin by sweeping into the Kursk region in August, seizing nearly 1,400 square kilometers of Russian territory. With Trump promising to end the war upon entering office, Moscow could be forced to exchange land it seized in Ukraine for Kursk territory should it fail to push Ukrainian forces out in time. Putin has sent tens of thousands of Russian troops to Kursk who are mounting wave after wave of counterattacks, a source on Ukraine's General Staff said. Russia has regained about 800 square kilometers in Kursk or about 40 percent of the territory Ukraine seized, the source said. Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian troops are inflicting large-scale losses on Russian forces in Kursk. Russia has recently been losing as many as 1,500 troops a day to injury and death across the entire theater of the war, the most since the invasion began in February 2022, Ukrainian and Western officials said. 'Russia hasn’t suffered such losses as it is now suffering in Kursk,' Zelenskiy said. Russia has recruited more than 11,000 North Korean troops to help it take back Kursk territory. The North Korean troops reportedly arrived last month though it is unclear if they have taken part in fighting yet. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly gave permission this week to Ukraine to strike inside Russia with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles respectively. The missiles are precision, tactical weapons designed to hit command-and-control centers, logistics and arms depots near the front. Ukraine has already used the missiles to strike in Kursk and the neighboring region of Belgorod. Russian Advances Meanwhile, Russian ground forces continue to make incremental advances in eastern Ukraine, including near the town of Velyka Novosilka, according to Deep State, an open-source organization with ties to the Ukrainian Army, and confirmed by other analysts. Ukraine has been struggling to hold back the Russian advances due to a lack of manpower, raising concern about a possible breakthrough. While Russia is losing forces at a greater rate, the Kremlin is able to quickly replace them thanks to lucrative wages and incentives. Putin on November 23 widened those incentives, signing a law permitting the cancellation of debt for new army recruits volunteering to fight in Ukraine. The new law allows the state to forgive up to 10 million rubles ($95,835) of debt for those signing contracts with the Defense Ministry to fight in Ukraine for at least a year, beginning on December 1. The law applies to all potential recruits who have had debt collection proceedings opened against them before December 1. The maximum debt forgiveness is several times the average annual salary in Russia’s provinces. Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said in an interview published on November 23 that new technological advances will prevent a 'serious breakthrough' at the front. Ukraine and Russia have been rapidly developing reconnaissance and strike drones as well as electronic warfare weapons. The technology advancements have helped Ukraine partially compensate for its lack of manpower. In the interview, Zaluzhniy said that Russia will struggle to expand the front line and break through because it would require huge resources 'which the Russians no longer have.' Trump Presidency U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his counterparts from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations outside Rome on November 25-26 to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will be the last G7 meeting for the Biden administration, which is seeking to ensure that support for Ukraine is sustained when Trump enters office in January. Trump has criticized aid to Ukraine, raising questions whether he will continue support should a peace deal not be reached. The president-elect met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Florida on November 22 to discuss Ukraine and other issues facing the alliance. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly considering Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, for the new post of special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Zelenskiy told reporters that the war could end next year if Ukraine continues to get strong Western support. Zelenskiy spoke with media following the Grain From Ukraine Summit in Kyiv. Ukraine is one of the largest exporters of grains to world markets. Prior to the conference, Zelenskiy visited a memorial to the victims of the Holodomor, the man-made famine orchestrated by the Soviet government in the 1930s that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. In a clear reference to Putin’s war against Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: 'There is something we know for certain. They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EHU1m4isyQp_	2024-11-23T16:17:18-08:00	
How The West Prospers As The Rest Drown – OpEd	By Hafed Al-Ghwell Global financial systems are metaphorically connected vessels, in which the policies of one country can create ripples felt by another. Recently, a troubling phenomenon has emerged: Wealthier Western economies, in their bid to tame inflation — often driven by corporate greed or 'greedflation' — are adopting high interest rates. This seemingly domestic monetary policy has severe reverberations for the Global South’s poorer economies, precipitating a sovereign debt crisis of unprecedented scale.In their quest to tame domestic inflation, Western central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, often resort to hiking interest rates, a strategy that, while stabilizing their own economies, wreaks havoc on poorer nations. This policy tightens domestic credit but has dire global ramifications, particularly for emerging economies saddled with substantial dollar-denominated debt. As these rates climb, so do the costs of borrowing, making debt repayment increasingly untenable. For example, following the interest rate increases in 2022, many developing countries faced ballooning debt servicing costs alongside severe currency depreciation.These nations end up caught in a vicious cycle: They must allocate more of their scarce resources to debt repayment while their currencies weaken, further inflating their debt burden. The situation echoes the debt crises of the 1980s — often referred to as the 'Volcker shock' — that crippled Latin America and Africa, but now with the additional burden of complex, commercially sourced debt, leading to prolonged economic stagnation and deepening inequalities.The Global South’s debt crisis is not merely a financial predicament but a consequence of deeply entrenched imbalances in the global economic order. As Western nations, such as the US and the UK, enjoy the privilege of issuing debt in their own currencies, countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka are forced to borrow in foreign currencies, often at exorbitant interest rates. This structural disparity means that, while rich countries can manage high debt-to-gross domestic product ratios without existential threat — Japan’s stands at 254 percent — poorer economies buckle under far lower ratios.The result is a drain on their national budgets, diverting funds away from essential sectors like healthcare, education and infrastructure. For instance, Zambia’s external debt ballooned to $12.5 billion by 2021, driven partly by illicit financial flows and loss of export revenues to foreign investors. These dynamics lock these nations in a vicious cycle, with the burden of debt service stifling economic growth and perpetuating poverty, effectively allowing the Global North to outsource economic hardship to already-struggling economies. The question then becomes not just one of immediate debt relief, but of rethinking a flawed multilateral system that continuously disadvantages the Global South.Beyond the surface threats of potential default and sluggish growth, the relentless escalation of debt repayments forces poorer nations into austerity traps, decimating their socioeconomic fabric. Austerity measures, often mandated by international creditors like the International Monetary Fund, primarily hurt the disadvantaged, skewing income distribution by shifting benefits to the top 10 percent, while impoverishing the bottom 80 percent. The austerity cycle leads to stagnant or declining real wages and mounting unemployment, pressuring local labor markets to compromise on pay, worsening existing inequalities. This creates fertile ground for socioeconomic instability, directly impeding human capital development and long-term economic prospects. International financial structures, skewed toward creditor interests, thus perpetuate a cycle in which the Global South is structurally disadvantaged, effectively condemning it to tread water in a sea of debt as wealthier nations consolidate their prosperity.The disparity in global economic policy, with Western economies vigorously combating inflation through aggressive monetary policies, heavily burdens the Global South. As interest rates rise in the Global North, debt servicing costs for poorer nations soar, exacerbating their financial woes and precipitating potential defaults. High inflation and modest global growth compound these challenges, pushing 15 percent of poor countries into debt distress and leaving half on the brink.This is not merely about domestic stability, it also highlights an alarming neglect of the broader international economic repercussions. Such policies significantly strain global economic health, fostering inequality as these nations grapple with austerity measures, deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and hindered long-term recovery. This cyclical debt enmeshment prevents the Global South from achieving sustainable development, while rich nations consolidate their prosperity, laying bare a systemic financial inequity that threatens global stability.It is this precise dynamic that epitomizes how the West prospers as the rest drown. As wealthier nations move to protect their markets and labor forces, poorer countries continue to bear the brunt. An ensuing cycle of debt and dependency effectively ensures that, while the Global North establishes a semblance of economic order, the Global South remains ensnared in a web of borrowing and austerity. In recent years, the inevitable widening gap between the West and the rest of the world has become unsustainable.A comprehensive overhaul of international debt policies is long overdue. The current case-by-case basis of the G20 Common Framework is ineffective, failing to offer the predictability necessary for substantial debt relief. A more systematic approach is essential, one that includes a multilateral sovereign debt restructuring mechanism. This would facilitate fair and equitable treatment across all creditors, ensuring that countries can prioritize investments in green growth and climate resilience without being shackled by debilitating debt service obligations.Moreover, to address the urgency driven by climate priorities that have languished under underfunded commitments, a dual-pillar approach is necessary. Countries with dire debt situations require comprehensive restructuring involving all forms of international creditors — private, bilateral and multilateral. This should be reminiscent of the large-scale debt relief initiatives of the early 2000s, adapted to the current needs of climate and development investments. For less-indebted nations, enhancing credit and providing debt suspension through multilateral institutions could offer more fiscal space and reduced capital costs, enabling them to meet climate and development goals more effectively.Simultaneously, geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism pose significant risks to global cooperation. Multilateral dialogue between major global powers like the US and China is crucial to navigating these geopolitical frictions. Additionally, fostering a supportive environment for affordable lending from multilateral development banks and new issuances of special drawing rights can provide the necessary liquidity for emerging markets.Such innovative, equitable solutions are imperative — not only to address the financial disparities exacerbated by climate disasters but also to stave off the social instability that unchecked debt crises are bound to trigger. Thus, an urgent, holistic and collaborative strategy is essential for a truly balanced global economic order, before the West ultimately drowns the rest.

Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024: Redefining BJP’s Alliance Dy...	The assembly election results for Maharashtra and Jharkhand have been announced, highlighting a pivotal development in Indian politics. Maharashtra’s results have attracted significant attention because of its critical role in national politics, despite both states having their own political significance. Maharashtra, the second-largest state in India by population and political influence, has 48 Lok Sabha seats, positioning it as a key player in the national political landscape. The state’s role in the recent general elections, conducted six months ago, is crucial, particularly as the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, encountered a notable setback. The BJP, despite being the ruling alliance in Maharashtra, managed to secure only 17 Lok Sabha seats, indicating a disappointing performance for a party that excelled nationally. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh significantly contributed to the Congress and its allies' performance in the general elections, reflecting a broader trend. The general election results in Maharashtra provided a rare moment of hope, despite Congress’ national defeat. Rahul Gandhi characterized the party's robust performance in the state as indicative of a resurgence, enhancing optimism for the upcoming assembly elections. Congress and its allies sought to replicate their success, driven by confidence in their momentum.The assembly elections represented a crucial opportunity for the BJP to regain its standing. The party underwent a thorough introspection and strategic overhaul, re-energizing its cadre and revamping its campaign. This led to a focused three-month effort aimed at regaining Maharashtra’s trust through an aggressive campaign blitz. However, the recent assembly election results are not just about the balance of power in Maharashtra but also reflect the evolving political dynamics in India. They signify whether the BJP’s corrective measures have borne fruit or if Congress and its allies have managed to consolidate their gains from the general elections. The outcome of these elections will undoubtedly set the tone for future political strategies and alliances, not only in Maharashtra but across the nation. As the analysis of today’s results concludes, Maharashtra’s political importance is clearly reaffirmed. The BJP has secured 132 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena has added 57, and the NCP has claimed 41. This results in a total of 230 seats for the BJP-led NDA, highlighting the state's significance as an indicator of changing political dynamics in India. BJP's Course Correction and Historic Victory in Maharashtra Elections: Key Factors The BJP-led alliance’s success in the Maharashtra assembly elections was a testament to its strategic recalibration and ground-level mobilization. A combination of organizational unity, grassroots outreach, policy-driven engagement, and strategic leadership turned the tide in its favor. Below are the key factors that underpinned this victory: 1. Flawless Coordination Among Alliance Partners The BJP-led alliance, which includes the BJP, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction), and the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP, demonstrated effective coordination. This alliance effectively addressed seat-sharing and other contentious issues, unlike their opposition counterparts. Their unified stance provided a notable advantage, as even BJP candidates entered constituencies typically assigned to their allies without undermining the alliance’s unity. The Congress-led coalition experienced significant internal discord. The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP are in conflict regarding seat-sharing arrangements, resulting in public disputes. The disunity among opposition forces created confusion and mistrust among voters, resulting in a distinct advantage for the BJP. 2. RSS Cadre: The Backbone of BJP's Ground Campaign The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) played a pivotal role in mobilizing voters at the grassroots level. The BJP's strength lay in its ability to organize large rallies and mega-events; however, it was the RSS's detailed door-to-door campaigning that proved decisive. The RSS launched a targeted voter outreach program focusing on specific demographics, including the elderly and differently-abled individuals. The campaign effectively mobilized voters over 80 and those with disabilities, resulting in high voter turnout. The RSS conducted more than 60,000 statewide public meetings, establishing a direct link with voters. The meetings focused on local grievances, clarified the alliance’s vision, and established a strong support base. This extensive ground network provides a significant competitive advantage, as no other party in India has a similar organizational structure capable of influencing voters at such a detailed level. 3. Policy Implementation and Welfare Schemes The BJP effectively communicated its success in welfare policies, which appealed to voters. Initiatives aimed at women, including financial incentives, subsidized gas cylinders, and education programs, resonated with female voters, a key demographic in this election. The revision of Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and enhanced market access have been advantageous for farmers. Party workers closely observed the implementation of these programs, confirming that beneficiaries received their entitlements. The hands-on approach strengthened voter confidence in the BJP's dedication to governance. 4. Polarization and Strategic Leadership The strategic involvement of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was a key factor in BJP’s success, as his rallies effectively mobilized the Hindu voter base. The slogan 'Batoge to Katoge' (division leads to defeat) effectively polarized Hindu voters in support of the BJP. This message challenged the BJP’s characterization of 'vote jihad,' a term used to describe the alleged strategic voting behaviors of Muslim voters opposing the party. The opposition’s effort to consolidate Muslim votes and launching caste-based census agenda against the BJP proved ineffective in polarized constituencies, leading to a significant mobilization of Hindu voters in support of the BJP. The BJP’s campaign leveraged this dynamic, strengthening its support base. 5. Youth Engagement and Digital Campaigns BJP launched focused digital campaigns on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp to engage first-time voters. The campaigns emphasized job creation, development initiatives, and nationalist sentiments, targeting the aspirations of younger voters. The party's local leadership engaged with student unions and youth organizations, positioning the BJP as a party of growth and opportunity. This outreach reinforced their dominance in a key demographic. 6. Charismatic Leadership and Star Campaigners Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies played a crucial role in the campaign, emphasizing the BJP’s focus on development and national pride. His speeches attracted large audiences, generating momentum that resulted in votes. Devendra Fadnavis and Eknath Shinde were instrumental in localizing the campaign, focusing on regional issues, and effectively countering opposition narratives. The BJP effectively addressed macro-level issues and micro-level voter concerns, resulting in a turnaround that solidified its dominance in the state. Also, this victory reinforces BJP’s state-level dominance and boosts the party’s morale as it prepares for future challenges in the national political arena. Strengthening BJP’s Agenda Amidst a Fragmented Opposition The BJP’s lack of a full majority in the Lok Sabha necessitates reliance on ally support to progress its legislative agenda. A Congress win in Maharashtra would have bolstered the opposition, especially the I.N.D.I.A. Alliance, enhancing their ability to challenge BJP policies nationally.Maharashtra, being India’s second-largest state, holds significant political influence. The defeat of Congress undermines its momentum, hindering its ability to effectively challenge the BJP at the national level. Success in Maharashtra would have enabled Congress to more effectively challenge BJP’s policies, encompassing economic reforms and social issues. Now, the weakened position of Congress allows the BJP to strengthen its dominance within the NDA, thereby increasing its parliamentary power. The weakened and divided position of the Congress undermines the integrity of the INDIA Alliance, diminishing its effectiveness as a cohesive opposition to the BJP. The discord among Congress’s allies in Maharashtra, particularly between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction and Sharad Pawar’s NCP faction, has highlighted the alliance’s weaknesses. The BJP-led NDA Alliance is expected to strengthen by capitalizing on the opportunity to attract dissatisfied leaders from opposition parties. The results in Maharashtra will strengthen the BJP's strategy for other states, reducing the INDIA Alliance's overall influence ahead of the upcoming general elections. The discord within the NCP following the elections may lead to additional defections to the BJP, thereby strengthening its influence in Maharashtra and diminishing the opposition's morale on a national level. Increased Rajya Sabha Influence for BJP The Congress defeat in Maharashtra has notable long-term implications for the Rajya Sabha elections. Maharashtra contributes 19 members to the Rajya Sabha, highlighting its significance in shaping the upper house of Parliament. Congress, along with its allies Shiv Sena and NCP, has historically maintained influence in Rajya Sabha, attributed to their dominance at the state level. Their defeat in Maharashtra limits their capacity to obtain sufficient seats in the state assembly for nominating members to the Rajya Sabha. Opposition leaders from these parties are likely to face challenges in accessing Parliament’s upper house. Conversely, the BJP, traditionally weaker in the Rajya Sabha than in the Lok Sabha, is poised for substantial gains. The BJP's enhanced majority in Maharashtra enables it to secure Rajya Sabha seats for its candidates, thereby strengthening its legislative power. The loss of Congress enhances BJP’s capacity to advance its legislative goals while simultaneously undermining the opposition's attempts at unity. This victory represents a crucial advancement for the BJP in preparation for the 2024 general elections, while Congress and its allies must confront the challenge of reorganizing and developing new strategies following their electoral defeat. The BJP’s Electoral Mandate Redefines Alliance Dynamics in Maharashtra The BJP’s victory in Maharashtra has altered the power dynamics within its alliance, especially concerning the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The BJP’s current strengthened mandate enables it to assertively claim the Chief Minister’s position, a role it has traditionally relinquished to allies, despite its electoral advantages in past alliances where concessions were made for coalition stability. Key Historical Context 2014 Elections: In the 2014 Elections, the BJP secured 122 seats, making it the single largest party, yet it did not achieve a majority. The government was formed with Shiv Sena, granting substantial portfolios despite existing tensions. 2019 Elections: In the 2019 elections, the BJP formed an alliance with Shiv Sena, achieving a majority. However, the alliance disintegrated due to Shiv Sena's insistence on the Chief Minister's position. Uddhav Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in alliance with Congress and NCP. 2022 Elections: 2022 Political Shift: Eknath Shinde's rebellion led to the split of Shiv Sena, resulting in BJP appointing Shinde as Chief Minister while retaining a junior partner role in state leadership to ensure alliance stability. Post-2024 Election Dynamics The 2024 assembly elections represent a crucial juncture for BJP in Maharashtra, significantly altering the dynamics of political alliances. 1. Shiv Sena (Shinde Faction): Eknath Shinde’s faction, currently in the Chief Minister’s position, faces considerable pressure to transfer authority to the BJP. The faction's dependence on BJP's organizational and electoral strength has increased due to declining public support and internal divisions. The BJP’s vote share exceeds that of its allies combined, indicating a clear power imbalance within the alliance. 2. NCP (Ajit Pawar Faction): The NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar has diminished bargaining power due to a lackluster electoral performance. The emphasis will likely transition to maintaining essential portfolios instead of challenging the BJP's assertion of leadership. This change in alliance dynamics enables the BJP to not only attain the Chief Minister’s position but also to reinforce its dominance in Maharashtra’s political arena, thereby enhancing its influence at both state and national levels. Why BJP Will Push for Chief Ministership Reflecting Electoral Mandate: The BJP’s dominance in the alliance and its claim to the Chief Minister’s position aligns with voter preferences, thereby reinforcing the party’s brand in Maharashtra. Learning from Past Errors: The BJP has recognized the implications of the 2019 setback, where yielding the Chief Minister’s position to Shiv Sena resulted in the loss of government control. The BJP aims to avoid compromises that could lead to defections or internal power struggles within the alliance. Expanding Organizational Control: A BJP Chief Minister enables the party to strengthen its grassroots network and exert greater influence over state-level policies, especially in anticipation of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Precedents and Public Sentiment The BJP has consistently highlighted its focus on stable governance and decisive leadership, appealing to the electorate. Core voters in Maharashtra have previously shown dissatisfaction regarding concessions granted to allies. BJP's claim to the Chief Minister’s office meets its base's expectations and enhances accountability. BJP’s pursuit of the Chief Minister’s position appears assured, yet effectively handling ally expectations will be crucial. The party must provide strategic portfolios to its allies to sustain alliance unity while asserting its leadership position. BJP in Bihar effectively managed its alliances until the coalition structure collapsed. BJP is expected to take a pragmatic approach in Maharashtra by rewarding its allies and maintaining its leadership position. Conclusions The Maharashtra elections have altered the BJP’s position within its alliance. The party, backed by a strong electoral mandate and insights from previous compromises, is set to regain the Chief Minister’s position. This move would strengthen BJP’s control in Maharashtra and enhance its leadership role within the alliance. BJP's strong performance in key assembly by-elections in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan highlight its increasing momentum across various regions. The party experienced a setback in Jharkhand; however, the small state’s limited political significance is unlikely to hinder BJP’s resurgence. These outcomes reinforce BJP’s narrative of governance and organizational strength, establishing it as a significant contender for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. BJP is establishing itself as a leader in state and national politics, reinforcing its position as a central pillar in Indian political dynamics.

China Should Be Worried About North Korea: How To Make Beijing A ...	In recent days North Korea has become a problem child not only for China but for the US as well. Its dictator Kim Jong Un who rules by fear of persecution or death to those people he considers disloyal to his regime, a characteristic that all dictators have to perpetuate their rule. Adolf Hitler who had fought in the First Great War had this characteristic in abundance and took advantage of the burning of Reichstag and total disregard of the treaty he had signed with the Soviet Union. Recently White House confirmed that North Korea—a country with few allies and little money—had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. CHINA’S DISPLEASURE OVER RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES That proximity has irked China, North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Russia and North Korea signed an agreement on boosting economic cooperation following a meeting between trade officials in Pyongyang. Hungary will install additional air defense systems in the northeast of the country due to concerns over the fighting in Ukraine spreading into Hungarian territory. The Hungarian defense minister said the threat of escalation between Ukraine and Russia is 'greater than ever.' Russia became the top supplier of natural gas to the European Union in September for the first time since May 2022, according to a calculation by Russia’s RIA Novosti using Eurostat data. European purchases of Russian gas in September were valued at 1.4 billion euros ($1.47 billion), an increase of a third over the previous September. Roughly forty percent of the supplies is liquefied natural gas and sixty percent is pipeline gas. CHINA-SOUTH KOREA HOLD SECURITY DIALOGUE Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul—the first such meeting in nine years. This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China. The countries have not always seen eye to eye but their relationship has never come close to splintering. WHAT THE USA SHOULD DO? Instead of focusing on what could divide North Korea from China, the United States should collaborate with the Chinese government to rein in North Korea’s volatile behavior. Both the United States and China are ultimately invested in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula. Working together to restrain the North Korean regime is the best way to achieve it. Although North Korea is often imagined these days as a mere satrap of China, it is not, in fact, a Chinese vassal, and it has long sought to achieve a great degree of autonomy in its foreign policy. The two countries have endured many moments of friction in their relationship. The fact that China tolerated open criticism of North Korea’s leadership put further strain on the relationship between the two governments. During the rapprochement between China and the United States in the 1970s North Korea hosted Soviet naval ships in its ports and allowed Soviet fighter jets to enter North Korean airspace. CHINA’S DIPLOMATIC CONTACT WITH SOUTH KOREA. Throughout the 1980s, in response to North Korea’s tilt toward Russia, China increased its diplomatic contacts with South Korea. Relations between China and North Korea hit another low point in 1992, when China formally established diplomatic relations with South Korea against Kim’s wishes. China further irked North Korea by joining international sanctions against Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programs in 2006. Pyongyang, for its part, often acted without consulting Beijing on matters that could seriously affect China’s security. In 2006, following North Korea’s first nuclear test, Beijing accused Pyongyang of 'brazen' action, a term rarely used in official Chinese statements. North Korea’s nuclear tests violated a treaty between the two countries that requires them to 'consult with each other on all important international questions of common interest.' WHY NORTH KOREA TURNED TO RUSSIA Unsure of China’s intentions, North Korea has turned to Russia for economic, diplomatic, and military cooperation. Through these punitive measures, China is not just trying to chastise Pyongyang for cozying up to Russia; it’s also seeking to curry favor with the United States and Europe. Since the summit between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden in November 2023, Beijing has appeared determined to stabilize U.S.-Chinese relations so that it can still attract foreign investment from Western countries and maintain strong trading ties with them. In this context, North Korea’s belligerence toward South Korea and Japan and its military support of Russia has become a liability for China’s engagement with the West, because the United States and Europe see China as North Korea’s patron, and therefore as partly responsible for Pyongyang’s behavior. UNCERTAINITY IN CHINA IF NORTH KOREA IS PUSHED TO A CORNER. It is highly uncertain—even to China’s leadership—how Pyongyang would act if backed into a corner. In the worst-case scenario, Pyongyang may resort to attacking South Korea to deliberately create an external crisis, forcing China to intervene on North Korea’s behalf. Therefore, Beijing has to carefully assess the risks when considering how much it can push North Korea. In the current era of U.S.-Chinese strategic competition, North Korea’s value to China extends beyond its role as a buffer zone between Chinese and U.S. forces. From Beijing’s perspective, during a conflict with the United States over Taiwan, maintaining close ties with North Korea is advantageous because Pyongyang can help tie down U.S. troops in the region by keeping open the possibility of another war. But it remains uncertain whether Beijing would coordinate with North Korea before taking military action against Taiwan or whether they would even want to coordinate such involvement if it could lead to conflict spreading from the Taiwan Strait to the Korean Peninsula. US SHOULD PREVENT OUTBREAK OF WAR ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA To avoid such an outcome, the United States and its allies should focus on identifying interests they share with China: namely, preventing the outbreak of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Expecting Beijing to take extreme measures, such as suspending oil supplies or humanitarian aid to North Korea, is unrealistic. Instead of driving China and North Korea apart, Washington should try to capitalize on Beijing’s power over Pyongyang by urging China to clearly communicate two redlines to its partner. First, North Korea must refrain from directly assaulting South Korean lives and property, as it did in the 2010 Cheonan torpedo attack and Yeonpyeong Island shelling. Since these incidents, South Korea’s military doctrine has become far more offensive. Any North Korean attack, even on a limited scale, would trigger South Korean retaliation, and could spiral into all-out war. Second, North Korea must avoid conducting its seventh nuclear test. A seventh test would likely be geared toward developing a nuclear weapon with a small yield that would be easier to deploy. Such a test would be a sign of China’s weakening influence over Pyongyang and could spur Seoul to try to acquire nuclear weapons of its own—a position that both South Korea and the United States officially oppose but is gaining traction in Western policy circles. DEEPENING TIES WITH RUSSIA POSES CONCERN RELATING TO WAR IN UKRAINE AND SECURITY ON KOREAN PENINSULA. The deepening ties between Russia and North Korea have sparked significant concerns in the US regarding the potential impact on the war in Ukraine and security on the Korean Peninsula. But the rapprochement between Moscow and Pyongyang has also caused mixed feelings in Beijing, as they create new uncertainty for China. Despite being North Korea’s neighbor, economic lifeline and formal ally, China’s relations with North Korea are far from close, as recent developments indicate. North Korea’s condemnation of a joint statement by South Korea, Japan, and China during their first trilateral summit since 2019 was seen as a rare rebuke against China. The statement mentioned denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang’s provocative actions around the same time further signaled its displeasure with the summit. It is remarkable that the Kim regime chose to launch a military spy satellite into orbit during a major diplomatic initiative involving China. The last time North Korea clearly sought to embarrass China was shortly prior to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in May 2017, when it conducted a missile launch from a base near the Chinese border. Since then, the regional dynamics have shifted significantly. IMROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA WITH APPEARANCE OF XI-JINPING. After hitting their lowest point in decades in 2017, China-North Korea relations began to improve significantly following the first meeting between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un in March 2018. Despite having met five times since then, their relationship is not back to being 'as close as lips and teeth,' as described once by Mao Zedong. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s isolation from the West has led to a deepening of relations between Moscow and Pyongyang, resulting in enhanced military cooperation between the two states. It is believed that in exchange for large amounts of North Korean munitions and ballistic missiles for Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow is providing North Korea with military technology, increasing Pyongyang’s military capabilities. CLOSE RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA RELATIONS POSESS A CHALLENGE TO THE WEST Beijing, a key partner of both Pyongyang and Moscow, has refrained. However, the Chinese media was quick to blame the United States claiming that its 'hostile' policy has driven Russia and North Korea closer together, thereby undermining the security situation in both regions. The Chinese portrayal of the United States as the primary instigator of tensions reflects China’s belief that Washington is its greatest threat and enemy, not Pyongyang. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile capabilities, the United States has strengthened its military cooperation with South Korea and Japan, much to China’s dismay. Beijing has long accused Washington of using the North Korean nuclear issue as a pretext to expand its military presence in the region, thereby further exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WHAT DOES WASHINGTON WANT? Most of China’s foreign policy thinkers believe that Washington’s overall goal is not to deter North Korea but to contain China. Given that China views its foreign policy through the lens of its broader rivalry with the United States, both in Asia and globally, it is highly unlikely that Beijing will exert pressure on on either North Korea or Russia to resolve the conflicts in Northeast Asia or Europe. For China, the Kim regime remains an important buffer zone against an increasing encirclement by the U.S. and its allies, while Russia serves as an important ally in countering a U.S.-led world order. However, Beijing’s choice to not 'interfere' might, in the long run, undermine its own strategic interests. By staying on the sidelines as ties between Russia and North Korea deepen, China risks potentially exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WITH RUSSIAN HELP CAN KIM JUNG UN DEVELOP NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES? With Russia’s help, the Kim regime is likely to accelerate the development of its nuclear capabilities. This could lead to a stronger response from the United States, and, in a worst-case scenario for Beijing, lead up to the formation of what the Chinese call a U.S.-led 'Asian NATO' aimed at targeting China. Furthermore, an emboldened North Korea increases the possibility of a more aggressive and provocative behavior, possibly stepping up its weapon testing or, even more concerning, conducting a seventh nuclear test. This inevitably would place China in a position where it is exposed to the escalation of conflicts it prefers to avoid. As a result, Beijing would face intense international pressure, particularly from the United States, to take a stronger stance against the Kim regime. DESPITE BEIJING’S TOTAL SUPPORT FOR PYOGYANG RELATIONS WITH RUSIA IS A GREAT WORRY. Despite Beijing’s economic and diplomatic support for Pyongyang, they are anything but close friends. The very fact that Kim’s first post-pandemic foreign trip was to Russia rather than China raises questions about the current state of their relationship. While Kim Jong Un has now held two summits with Putin in less than a year, Xi Jinping has not met the North Korean leader since 2019. Moreover, North Korea’s efforts to strengthen its ties with Iran further alleviate its isolation signaling a strategic attempt toward diversifying its alliances and bolstering its nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation. These new dynamics significantly complicate China’s balancing act in the region. NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS IN WAR AGAINST UKRAINE In November 2024 Asia Policy Institute for China analysis has revealed confirmation by the White House that North Korea — a country with few allies and little money — had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang was already supplying Moscow with weapons: according to the Times of London, half of Russia’s shells used in the war have come from North Korea. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. That proximity has irked China North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. CHINESE REACTION TO NORTH KOREA’S TRUANCY Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Coincidentally it coincided with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang. Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul — the first such meeting in nine years. CONCLUSION This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China.

Eni Launches Hull Of Nguya FLNG, Confirming Schedule Of Congo LNG...	Eni announced Saturday the launch of the hull of the Nguya Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility in Wison shipyard in Nantong, China. The state-of-the-art FLNG will have a liquefaction capacity of 2.4 million tons per annum (MTPA), and will complement the existing Tango FLNG, which is operational since December 2023 with a capacity of 0.6 MTPA, bringing the total liquefaction capacity of Congo LNG project to 3 MTPA by the end of 2025. The ceremony was attended by the Minister of Hydrocarbons of the Republic of Congo, Bruno Jean Richard Itoua. Guido Brusco, Eni’s Chief Operating Officer, Global Natural Resources, said: 'We celebrate this milestone together with our partners as a testament of the solid collaboration between Eni and the Republic of Congo. We have been the first to believe in the value of Congo's gas, primarily for domestic power generation, and then for export. With the successful launch of the Nguya FLNG hull, the Congo LNG Project has reached an impressive milestone of 40 million hours worked without any Lost Time Injuries. This achievement underscores the project’s ongoing progress in valorizing Congo’s gas resources, while capitalizing on local and international opportunities to deliver further value for our stakeholders'. The timely launch of the hull confirms the company’s industry-leading time-to-market performances. Completion activities for Nguya FLNG have progressed at 80%, while overall Phase 2 timing - from FLNG contract award to startup - is expected to amount to less than 3 years, leveraging Eni’s fast-track approach that allows the execution of engineering, construction and commissioning activities seamlessly to rapidly develop new projects. Nguya FLNG has a reduced carbon footprint thanks to its design and technology, and to its zero-flaring approach, in line with Eni’s decarbonisation strategy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-23T16:06:01-08:00	
Ukrainian Archbishop Encourages Trump To Go To Ukraine	By Kate Quiñones A Ukrainian archbishop says he has encouraged President-elect Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to help 'build a policy for the future.' During a Friday interview with 'EWTN News In Depth' anchor Catherine Hadro, Archbishop Borys Gudziak of the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia said that he spoke briefly with Trump before the election at the Oct. 17 Al Smith dinner, where he encouraged Trump to visit Ukraine. Gudziak has subsequently written a letter to the president-elect to the same effect. 'I think if he went now, before the inauguration, for example, with a group of religious leaders on a humanitarian mission, he would see for himself what is happening on the ground,' Gudziak explained. 'Everybody that has gone to Ukraine — cardinals, political leaders, humanitarian workers, people who were skeptical, people that knew a lot — all came out knowing much, much more and understanding more deeply what’s happening.' 'So I would encourage President Trump to go to Ukraine,' Gudziak said, as 'a base on which to build a policy for the future.' Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. Ukraine on Tuesday used U.S. missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory, following President Joe Biden’s authorization of such use. Russian forces shot down five of six of the missiles that were fired at a military facility. Gudziak said of the somber milestone: 'It is a time of mourning.' 'There’s great pain and great wounds in our people, in our Church,' Gudziak noted. 'At the same time, there’s great gratitude. Most observers internationally, and particularly Putin, thought Ukraine would fall in a matter of three days or three weeks. And now, three years later, the people still stand, keep standing, defending their God-given dignity, their freedom, their democracy.' Devastating toll Hundreds of thousands have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion, with more than 14 million people forced to leave their homes. The archbishop noted that 4,000 schools and 2,000 hospitals have been destroyed. 'There’s great suffering, great trauma which will be lasting,' Gudziak said. 'But there is also the sense of courage and gratitude for God’s graces that Russia has not occupied all of Ukraine and that the country is still free.' When asked what it’s like for Catholics in Ukraine, Gudziak said that 'the public life of the Catholic Church has been virtually extinguished' in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia has occupied parts of three regions. 'There [are] no Ukrainian Catholic priests functioning there now, and a couple of priests who were abducted and tortured for 18 months, who were freed in the summer — they show the scars of what Russian captivity is like,' the archbishop said. 'For Catholics, it should be clear that Russian occupation means [the] extinguishing of our normal church life,' he continued. But Gudziak noted that Catholic charities have come together to support Ukrainians, including Caritas Ukraine, a Catholic charity in Ukraine. 'Bishops and priests are in place, serving the people, celebrating the sacraments, announcing the good news, but also very much engaged in humanitarian work, helping those that have lost their homes, their possessions, distributing clothing, food, fostering medical care,' he said. 'Very importantly, the Church reminds people of their God-given dignity, the fact that the Lord is with them, that every hair on their head is counted' and that the country has lived through 'even more harrowing experiences,' he said. 'During World War II, between the Nazis and the Soviets, 6 [million] to 7 million residents of Ukraine were killed and the whole country was devastated,' Gudziak continued. 'Ukrainians know they’ve lived through the crucifixion and have resurrected in the past. So the Church announces this paschal Kerygma: We carry our cross and God will give us life.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EM7O1tblkgm4	2024-11-23T16:04:07-08:00	
Why Muslims OK Abrogated Verses In The Qur’an – OpEd	Muslims believe Allah sent tens of thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers who like Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah prior to the Qur'an, notably the Scrolls of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that the messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Also many Qur'an verses have been abrogated by other verses. Not all Muslims believe that the Quran abrogates itself and would reject these traditions. Yet, many Muslims do believe that the Quran abrogates itself. According to some scholars the Qur'an abrogates only the Qur'an. They base their view on verses 2:106 and 16:101. According to them the Qur'an does not abrogate the sunna (law) nor does the sunna abrogate the Qur'an. This is the view held by Shafi'i. Others claim that the Qur'an may abrogate the Qur'an as well as the sunnah (law). They base their view on Sura 53:3-4 The Muslim scholar Ahmad Von Denffer said regarding the conflicting views held by Muslim scholars over the precise nature of abrogation: 'The number of verses that are considered to have been abrogated increased dramatically between the eighth and eleventh centuries (al-Zuhri mentions 42 abrogated verses, al-Nahhas 138, and Ibn Salama, 238), at which point an upper limit seems to have been reached (Ibn 'Ata'iqi identifies 231 abrogated verses, and al-Farsi, 248). Yet 'al-Suyuti (died 1505 CE) recognized only twenty instances of true abrogation, and Shah Wali Allah (died 1762 CE) reduced that number to five. Here is a good example from: SAHIH BUKHARI Volume 6, Book 60, Number 13: Narrated Al-Bara: The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he (really) wished that his Qibla would be the Ka'ba (at Mecca). (So Allah revealed verse (2:144) and he Prophet Muhammad) offered 'Asr prayers (in his Mosque facing Ka'ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. 'A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, 'I testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.' Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka'ba while they were still bowing. 'Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka'ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:-- 'Allah would never make your faith (prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem are holy). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.' (2.143) The many dozens of Prophets in the Hebrew Bible make only a few references to the religious texts of prior religions. The New Testament is an add on to the Hebrew Bible; which quotes the Hebrew Bible 302+ times, and claims to be the Old Tenement's fulfillment. The Qur'an is a stand alone text which mentions both Torah and Injil together 12 times, mentions Injil three times, and Torah six times by themselves; and quotes the Zabur only once (Psalm 37:9,11,29) in Qur'an 21:105. The term suhuf (scrolls Qur'an 20:133, 21:48, 87:19) is used for texts of Prophets Abraham, Aaron and Moses which were written separately, and later added in as part of the Oral Torah written down by the rabbis in the second century. (Qur'an 6:91) This was the original meaning of Tahrif. At first it would seem that Tahrif (Arabic: تحريف, 'distortion, alteration') an Arabic term used by Muslims for the alterations which Islamic tradition claims Jews and Christians have made to their revealed books, specifically the Tawrat (Torah), Zabur (Psalms) and Injil (Gospels); is the direct opposite of Midrash. In the Zabur of Prophet David it is written: 'One thing God has spoken; two things have I heard' (Psalms 62:12). The rabbis in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 34a) asserted that this means there are multiple interpretations of each verse of Scripture that can be correct, and the word of God, even if they contradict one another. The Hebrew term for this concept of pluralistic interpretation of sacred scriptures is Midrash. Midrash (מדרשׁ) is an interpretive activity of seeking answers to religious questions (both practical and spiritual) by plumbing the meaning of every word in the Torah. In the Bible, the root d-r-sh [דרשׁ] means inquiring into any matter, including seeking out God's word. Midrash responds to contemporary problems and crafts new narratives, making connections between new Jewish realities and the ancient unchanging Hebrew text. Midrash falls into two categories.When the subject is law and religious practice (halacha ), it is called Midrash halacha. Midrash aggadah, on the other hand, interprets biblical poetry, prophecy and narrative, exploring questions of ethics or theology, and creating lessons, new insights and different views all based on the ancient text. In some ways Midrash is like Islamic Tafsir, meaning 'to discover'. Tafsir is the explanation or interpretation of something 'exposing its secrets. Written by rabbis steeped in the Bible and absorbed by the many different questions that arise over the centuries, midrash occupies the meeting ground between reverence and love for the word of the fixed text of the Torah, and religious creativity in meeting new developments in society and culture. Midrash thus yields religious insights that have made Torah directly applicable to the later realities of Jewish life. The best-known rabbinic midrash is the legend of Prophet Abraham, who as a young child in Mesopotamia smashed his father's idols. Not just a simple morality tale about a national hero, the text in Midrash Rabbah for Genesis suggests that Abraham's selection by God did not come out of nowhere, as Genesis 12 literally reads. Rather, Abraham had independently come to a point where he would be receptive to the voice of the one God. This midrash lays out Prophet Abraham's relationship to his family and to the people and culture around him, and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. It is not only a depiction of this patriarch, but also a model of an ideal spiritual personality for Jews, Christians and Muslims in any age and foreign culture. The narrative about Abraham breaking his father's idols is related in the Qur'an once in 19:41-50 and again in 21:51-66 for a total of 24 verses. In the written Torah this event is not mentioned at all; but it is the center of several oral Torah Midrash accounts. This would be called Tahrif by Muslims; and is called Midrash by Jews, but if you ask most Jews today, especially well educated Jews who are less educated in Judaism, where the Abraham breaking his father's idols event is related; they will respond it is written in the Book of Genesis in the Torah. So the Qur'an states: 'And there is a party among them who twist their tongues while reciting the [Torah] Book to make you think that it [their Midrash/Tafsir] is part of the Book, when in fact it is not. They say: 'It is from Allah', when in fact it is not from Allah. They falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.' (3:78) As a Reform Rabbi I agree with the above ayah. The party the Qur'an criticizes are those Orthodox Rabbis, who when the subject was law and religious practice (Midrash halacha) kept expanding the number of dietary laws, the strictness of Sabbath restrictions, and female purity laws. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, 'Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So do not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.' (Bukhari Vol. 1, Book 2, # 38) Reform Rabbis regard the increasingly restrictive developments in the laws of kosher diet, especially for Passover, as a counterproductive, overburdening of the Jewish people by extra-pious Orthodox rabbis. The expansion of restrictions on Shabbat activities is also seen by Reform Rabbis as a counterproductive, overburdening of the joy of Shabbat. The Qur'an wisely differentiates between extremism and striving to be near perfect (no one is perfect) which involves a rejection of extremism. Just trying to do well will be rewarded. Religion should not be hard. Making religion easier does not mean making religion soft or impious. This is a very important Hadith because all religions have believers that think that more is always better, and that much harder is still better.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EDxQzcghq1AP	2024-11-23T16:02:17-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Challenges Of Financial Realignmen...	In a Visual Capitalist report of September 17th, 2024, it was noted that the US Dollar dominates the world reserve currencies at 59%. It is followed by the Euro at 20%, the Japanese Yen at 6% and the British Pound at 5%. All other currencies followed with smaller shares, indicating that despite the great fanfare of BRICS Plus, most reserves are still held in the West’s major currencies. The above four currencies control some 90% of world currency reserves. The Chinese Renminbi held only 2% while all the others together held some 8% of the US$ 11.5 trillion of global reserves. The US Dollar’s share came down from 70% in 2000 but nevertheless remains the main currency of reserves in the world. It is expected to continue in this leading position in the decades to come, although there is a growing usage of non-traditional reserves, such as the Chinese Renminbi. The BRICS Plus countries are the biggest holders of most non-traditional currencies and mostly the Chinese Renminbi, which contributed some 25% of the shift away from the US Dollar. We will attempt to address in this article the impact of the shifting away from the US Dollar or the impact of the BRICS Plus on the Horn of Africa States region. The region is one of the poorest in the world and when it comes to volumes, nothing much will happen to the issue of reserves. Indeed, the region has no impact on what happens on the world’s reserves at present. Ethiopia has the largest reserves in the region with only a minuscule US$ 3 billion including gold, as of 2020, as reported by the World Bank earlier in this month of November 2024. However, when it comes to politicking and the challenges of the region, there appears to be reasons to watch. Ethiopia earlier this year embarked on challenging Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty as a nation by signing an illegal MoU with one of the regions of country without going through the Federal authorities of the country. Somalia’s reaction was severe and quickly and forcefully defended its territorial integrity through all the diplomatic channels available to it. This included among other seeking help from other countries like Türkiye and Egypt to defend the country’s lands and waters from the blatant invasion, expelled Ethiopia’s ambassador and refused to include Ethiopia in the AUSOM force of the African Union to be deployed in the country after the mandate of the ATMIS force ends on December 31st, 2024. The world held its breath during the whole year and scrambled to avoid a physical war between the two countries. The irony is that two new members of the BRICS Plus countries include Egypt and Ethiopia, which have their own difficulties on the issue of the Blue Nile and the GERD built by Ethiopia on the river. Ethiopia has not so far moved into the realization of the illegal MoU and since then, there was a change of governance in the Somali region, which was forced to sign the MoU by the Ethiopian administration. Somalia has not yet taken other steps which could include suspension of Ethiopian Airlines flights to the country or overflights in Somalia’s airspace, which is vast or other more serious actions that may adversely affect Ethiopia without firing a shot of its own. Ethiopia is currently undergoing one of the most serious not only financial difficulties but also existential threats. The IMF and the World Bank have recently organized extending some conditioned financial assistance for the country, but this may not help in the ethnic-based conflicts in the country. The war in the Amhara State, the OLA war, the Tigray war shimmering under the ashes, the Afar Somali states continuing war, the attempts of the Oromia state to move on to the Somali State and the antagonistic relations the country has developed with all the neighboring countries, all point to a country barely surviving and trying to export its woes to others. Somalia, another fragile country in the region, appears to have been its main target and hence the illegal MoU. Negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia was organized by the international community and Türkiye played the central role in this respect, but these negotiations have brought any good results fruits, so far, with Ethiopia still insisting on proceeding with the materialization of the MoU. It is not clear whether the new administration of the Somali region, which changed hands recently through a well-organized election process, will follow the policies of the old administration or not. However, there is reason to believe that it would not and would change priorities to meet the needs of its population. This may lead to a more stable region, which will step back from the brink of war. It is most unfortunate that the Ethiopian regime has underestimated the Somali resolve to defend their territories at all costs, including the large Somali population within Ethiopia who number anywhere between twenty-five to thirty million people, although the fake statistics given by the Ethiopian government does not report this. How does one read the Ethiopian BRICS adventure and the region? In this respect, one must note that the West where the Bretton Woods multilateral financial organizations of the World Bank and the IMF are rooted, would vehemently oppose this ill-thought of move on the part of Ethiopia. This is a direct assault on these institutions, which are economically and financially competing with the Chinese BRI project and other financial institutions. It is not clear what the intentions of the arrangements of the two organizations with Ethiopia are or represent. The move of Ethiopia to the BRICS may, however, lead Somalia to move closer to the West. Note the region overlooks a major shipping route connecting Asia, Africa and Europe. It is also reported to own vast natural resources including oil and gas, which seems to have been identified most recently by the Turkish Exploration ship Oruc Reis. If one has already arrangements with the country that owns the longest coast in the region, would there be a need to create new and unpredictable processes such as the Ethiopian forced MoU with one of the regions of Somalia imply? It is clear that Ethiopia is being used by outsider forces. The United Arab Emirates, which has substantial interests in the region is generally reported to be behind the adventure story of Ethiopia as financiers and political backers. Ethiopia, a poor nation grappling with its multitude of problems would not venture into such a major project, some say. The UAE is already in Berbera, a major port of Somalia in the north but does not trust the owners of the port, Somalis and it is why it is pushing, some say, Ethiopia to launch the search for a port in Somali waters and take over Somali territories. Both the UAE and Ethiopia and eventually the BRICS seem to be underestimating the Somali despite the weaknesses in Somali governance. What they do not know is that Somalis are generally better Somalis when foreigners invade their country, and as families, they all congregate to defend the home. The oil and gas potential recently discovered in the country and its seas would generally provide the financial needs of the country and money is what counts in the world of today. Somalia is already improving and rebuilding its land, air and naval forces and its relations with the West is expected to be a wall against the adventures of BRICS Plus and its ally, Ethiopia, an economically small country with not much to contribute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EOFb4avN7oh8	2024-11-23T16:00:52-08:00	
Facing Armageddon And Yajuj-Majuj With Hope And Faith -OpEd	More than seven percent of all deaths in 10 of India's biggest cities are linked to air pollution. Smog-filled Indian cities like Delhi suffer from some of the world's worst air pollution, with 12,000 annual deaths linked to air pollution. An international study involving 52 researchers from around the world found that one in every five species of reptiles on earth is facing extinction. Out of 10,196 reptile species covered by the research, close to 2,000 species are in danger of dying out, said the authors of the study, the first of its kind to address the issue on such a large scope. The word Armageddon does not appear in the Hebrew Bible, and appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16 which makes no mention of armies being predicted to one day gather on or near Mount Megiddo; but instead seems to predict only that 'they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon'. We know now that oil, gas and coal are the kings of global warming. The book of Revelation text does seem to imply, based on the text from an earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the 'place called Armageddon' is 'for the war of the great day of God Almighty' which is now seen as the ongoing battle against Global Warming. The Madhi himself may already have been born. Yajuj and Majuj are mentioned both in Qur'an and hadith. In Islam their appearance will be one of the signs of the end times. These events will transpire after the arrival of Dajjal, Mahdi and Prophet Jesus. Gog and Magog ('Gog u-Magog' in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) are names that appear in the Hebrew Bible, and in the Qur'an. They are sometimes personified as individuals, and sometimes identified as nations or as geographic regions: but all references in Bible, Qur'an and Hadith (oral and then written tradition) clearly indicate that they are very numerous in number, and will appear from the north toward the end of times, before the Day of Judgement: 'They said, 'O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make a barrier between us and them?' (Qur'an 18:94) —[Dhul-Qarnayn] said, 'This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever true is the promise of my Lord. And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [when] the Horn will be blown, We will assemble them in [one] assembly.' (18:98-99) A Hadith transmitted by both Imam Al- Bukhari and Imam Muslim, on the authority of Zainab Bint Jahsh relates that Prophet Muhammad once came to her in a state of fear and said: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe unto the Arabs from a danger that has come near. An opening has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this,' making a circle with his thumb and index finger. Zainab Bint Jahsh said: 'O Allah's Messenger! Shall we be destroyed even though there are pious persons among us?' He said: 'Yes, when evil persons will increase.' In 2011 the 'Arab Spring' filled most of the world with great hopes. Now, 13 years later, the near east is filled with increasing conflict, anxiety, fear, and despair. According to a worldwide poll for Reuters (May 2, 2012) 'nearly 15 percent of people worldwide believe the world will end during their lifetime'. That number is surely much higher by now. 'Whether they think it [the world] will come to an end through the hands of God, or a natural disaster or political events, whatever the reason, one in seven thinks the end of the world is coming,' said Keren Gottfried, research manager at Ipsos Global Public Affairs which conducted the poll for Reuters. Why are so many people so negative and pessimistic about the future of humanity While it is true that human society has changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 200 years than ever before in human history, humanity has already survived several major revolutions and world wars. Doctors today save the lives of millions; while dictators sacrifice the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the 21st century with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? The long tradition of trying to foresee the distant, eventual goal of human history started with the Prophets of Israel over 2.700 years ago. The Biblical vision of a Messianic Age may provide us with guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals that will sweep society as it approaches the next stage. Often, it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized in Christian, Islamic and Jewish post scriptural traditions. I will focus on the positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with the Messianic vision of the Biblical Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived of redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of a transformation of the Jewish people. This will take place in this world at some future time. Is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her own religion, that would itself bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. As the Qur'an states, 'Accountability for mankind is getting closer and closer, yet they are heedless and turn away.' (Al-Anbiya 1 and Al-Qamar 1-8) God of course, is always ready to help us defeat evil, if we are ready to work for the establishment of a just and peaceful local and world society; that is why one or more Messiahs will come. A Messiah is a human agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. This agent of God (with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a person with great leadership qualities; similar to Prophets Moses or Muhammad. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Messianic Age is usually seen as the solution to all of humanity's basic problems. This may be true in the long run, but the vast changes the transition to the Messianic Age entails, will provide challenges to society for many generations to come. For example, the Prophet Isaiah, 2,700 years ago, predicted that someday there would be a radically new world in which Jerusalem would be filled with joy for 'no more shall there be in it an infant that lives only a few days.' (65:20) A century ago, the infant mortality rate in Jerusalem (as in most of the world) was 25-30%. Now, infant mortality is less than 1%. For thousands of years almost every family in the world suffered the loss of at least one or two infants; now it happens to less than one out of a hundred. Truly we are close to Isaiah's prophecy, 'One who dies at 100 years shall be reckoned a youth, and one who fails to reach 100 shall be reckoned accursed.' (65:20). Such radical change will necessitate major changes in the way we think and act when faced with decisions about life and death. Yet who among us would want to return to the high mortality rates and early deaths of previous centuries? The fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy has thus gone unnoticed and uncelebrated. If you had told Soviet Jews a generation ago that the Communist regime would collapse, the Soviet Empire disintegrate, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews would emigrate to Israel, they would have conceived it only as a Messianic dream. In our own generation therefore we have seen the dramatic fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy: 'I will bring your offspring from the (Middle) East and gather you from the (European) West. To the North (Russia) I will say 'give them up' and to the South (Ethiopia) 'do not hold them'. Bring my sons from far away, my daughters from the end of the earth.' (43:5-6) Isn't it amazing how people adjust to living in a radically new world and forget the past. Indeed, the Prophet Isaiah himself said, 'Behold, I create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and former things shall not be remembered.' (65:17) Where does the Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish-Christian-Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: ('Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EJfa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-23T15:54:50-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russian Forces Unleash Massive Barrag...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Biden Administration Eases Restrictions on Use of US-Provided Weapons In a major development, the Biden administration gave Ukraine permissionto use American long-range weaponry, particularly the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike military targets inside Russia. Subsequently, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that France and the United Kingdom had followed suit by allowing Ukraine to use SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles for the same purpose, though the publication revised that reportshortly after its release to indicate that London and Paris were only engaging in 'debates' on the question. Press sources report that Washington may still be limiting Kyiv’s use of American munitions to targets relevant to Ukraine’s Kursk incursion. Regardless, the Biden administration’s decision to remove the restraints came not a moment too soon. The Ukrainian Armed Forces need to target Russia’s strategic depth, particularly critical military basing structures and force groupings in assembly areas. Depending on its warhead configuration and variant, the ATACMS is well-suited for this role. 2. North Korean Heavy Artillery Spotted in Russia Geolocated open-source imagery identified North Korean M1989 Koksan 170mm self-propelled howitzers on Russian railways near Krasnoyarsk last week, indicating that Pyongyang has stepped up its tactical support for the Kremlin. These North Korean systems are formidable, as artillery has traditionally determined the conventional military balance on the Korean Peninsula. Declassified field assessments conclude that Pyongyang possesses dangerous fire-support capabilities, and the United States Defense Intelligence Agencyhas determined that North Korea’s massed artillery and special forces units pose a significant threat to South Korea. Of all its artillery systems, Pyongyang’s 170mm-class self-propelled howitzers and 240mm-class heavy multiple-launch rocket systems are the most powerful. The 170mm Koksan howitzer has an operational range of 37 miles and can unleash an initial burst of four rounds in one minute, followed by one round every three minutes. It is designed to fire from protected areas and relocate for reloading. Pyongyang has hundreds of Koksan guns in its arsenal and can afford to send a significant number to the Kremlin. What remains unknown is whether North Korea is sending its artillery systems to support Russian units or to augment its own 10,000-strong 11th Corps detachments in the Russian region of Kursk. While open-source intelligence is thus far limited, it is distinctly possible that the North Korean 11th Corps is only the vanguard of a larger follow-on force. 3. Boosting Ukraine’s Growing F-16 Fleet In recent weeks the Biden administration has worked to boost the capabilities of Ukraine’s burgeoning F-16 fighter aircraft fleet. The Pentagon has permitted American defense contractors to operate in Ukraine so weapons systems that Washington has transferred to Kyiv can be maintained and repaired in country. This decision will make US-made F-16s and Patriot strategic air and missile defense systems much easier for Ukraine to use. The United States has also provided the Ukrainian Air Force with an intensive F-16 training program in Arizona, further enhancing Ukraine’s air warfare capabilities. Of Ukraine’s European partners, the Netherlands and Denmark have contributed the most to Kyiv’s F-16 deterrent. Belgium and Norway have also pledged to supply Kyiv with the fighter aircraft, so Ukraine will soon possess over 90 F-16s and may be able to operate two squadrons by 2025. Notably, the Dutch F-16s are Viper Midlife Upgrade variants, which means they have additional precision-guided munitions certifications, better cockpit systems, more capable sensors, and software modernizations that are roughly aligned with the Block 50/52 standards for US-made F-16s. This is particularly important for Ukraine because the fighter aircraft derives much of its combat prowess from the weapons systems and external pods it is equipped with. Kyiv’s air deterrent may also be receiving a boost from Greece. Press sources have claimed that Athens, in retaliation for a Russian missile strike on Odesa during Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s visit to the city, had decided to send its decommissioned, older F-16 variants to Ukraine after refurbishing them in the United States. While this has not yet occurred, the Greek and Ukrainian governments have agreed on the provision of training and technical support for Ukraine’s F-16 fleet. Ukraine’s F-16s have had a mixed record in combat roles. They have been used primarily to shoot down Russian drones and cruise missiles. In August 2024 Russian aircraft downed a Ukrainian F-16 and killed its pilot. While some sources have reported that a Ukrainian F-16 downed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber, that incident has never been confirmed. Regardless, protecting Ukrainian airspace will remain a key priority as Kyiv and its partners defend against continued Russian aggression. 4. Battlefield Assessment Last week saw a devastating rise in the number of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine. During the night of November 17, the Russian military unleashed a salvo of 42 loitering munitions and 102 missiles, its largest in many months. The attack targeted Ukraine’s energy network in major cities including Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Russia used one Zircon hypersonic missile and one Kinzhal aeroballistic missile in the barrage. The air component of the strike package involved nuclear-capable Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic bombers and Tu-22M3 tactical bombers, along with other tactical military aviation assets. Ukrainian officials reported civilian casualties across the country in addition to the damage to energy facilities. Despite major political developments, only moderate changes in the battlefield geometry occurred last week. Augmented by North Korean forces, the Russian military pressed to recapture the territory it has lost to Ukrainian forces in Kursk before the Trump administration takes office. In the east, Ukraine’s lines of defense remained overstretched, allowing the Russian campaign to maintain a costly but steady pace. At other flashpoints, including Kurakhove, Pokrovsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, Klishchiivka, and Velyka Novosilka, Russian combat formations gained territory at the tactical level. Ukraine’s drone warfare prowess also continued to influence the conflict. Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian air defense assets increased, a trend worth monitoring. Russia also erected new defensive structures to protect the Kerch Bridge, which connects occupied Crimea to mainland Russia, from Ukrainian naval drones. A previous Hudson studyassessed Kyiv’s military options for striking this tactically and symbolically significant bridge.

Beijing Grows Anxious Over Internationalization Of Cross-Strait R...	By Yi-Chuan Chiu Four days after Taiwan’s National Day on 10 October 2024, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched another large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, dubbed ‘Joint Sword-2024B’. While Taiwanese and US officials condemned these drills as ‘military provocations’, China’s justification included a phrase key to understanding Beijing’s anxiety about recent tensions in the Taiwan Strait— ‘the internationalisation of the Taiwan issue’. The term reflects Beijing and Taipei’s different views of the status quo and how this complicates cross-strait dynamics. ‘Internationalisation’ refers to framing China–Taiwan relations as a state-to-state relationship and an international dispute open to third-party intervention. Though the term originated in the 1950s, it resurfaced in Chinese official discourse when Beijing resisted comparisons between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Such rejections reflect Beijing’s long-standing assertion that Taiwan belongs to China, is an unresolved issue of the Chinese Civil War and that solving the issue in any way is a domestic Chinese matter. Beijing’s disdain for internationalisation has been repeatedly quoted in its justification for launching PLA exercises protesting Taiwanese President Lai Ching-Te’s inauguration speech in May 2024 and National Day address in October. Lai’s speeches sought to frame cross-strait relations as state-to-state, which differed from the cautious approach of his predecessor, Tsai Ing-Wen. Unlike Tsai’s inaugural speeches in 2016 and 2020, Lai did not pledge to manage cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. These documents nominally commit to unification while also portraying cross-strait relations as an area-to-area relationship rather than a typical foreign relationship. Tsai referenced these legal texts to circumvent Beijing’s ‘One China Principle’ while seeking political common ground. She also referred to the governments in Beijing and Taipei as ‘both sides’ instead of using official country names. Lai’s citation of the ROC Constitution aimed to assert that Taiwan is an independent sovereign country and that ‘the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other’. While Lai’s claim partly originated from Tsai’s 2021 National Day address, Beijing has criticised it as a new two-state theory and a disguisedpursuit of Taiwanese independence. Lai’s cross-strait approach indicates a priority for broadening domestic support rather than engaging Beijing. Most Taiwanese prefer a distinct Taiwanese identity without formally declaring independence. Lai intends to unify Taiwanese advocating for Taiwanese independence and those valuing the legacy of the ROC, which originated in mainland China. He has asserted that the 75-year-old People’s Republic of China (PRC) could not be the motherland of the 113-year-old ROC. Lai’s claim was condemned by Beijing as absurd but supported by 57 per cent of Taiwanese. Lai’s sharp rhetoric to carve Taiwan out of China not only reflects his self-defined pragmatismtowards Taiwanese independence, but also shows that Taiwanese politicians are constrained by the status quo preferred by the Taiwanese electorate. Most Taiwanese prefer to maintain de facto independence under the ROC banner and reframing cross-strait relations under an ambiguous One China concept — like the 1992 Consensus — is unpopular. Taiwan’s idea of the status quo differs from Beijing’s. Beijing’s ideal of the status quo stresses that most countries have de-recognised the ROC to formalise relations with the PRC. Therefore, Beijing finds it unacceptable for other countries to show diplomatic support for Taipei, especially when Taipei seeks to resist unification with Beijing. Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation benefits Beijing’s multifaceted campaign to coerce Taipei into unification and keep the Taiwan issue a domestic matter. This includes denying the Taiwan Strait’s status as international waters, increasing Chinese maritime patrols near Taiwanese territory and renewing efforts to reinterpret the United Nations’ resolution 2758. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing refused Tsai’s cross-strait engagement proposal — which lacked a direct mention of the 1992 Consensus — and has been unilaterally pushing for unificationunder the PRC. This has led to a cycle of action and reaction where both sides fear that ambiguity would either formalise continued separation or lead to forced unification. It is a difficult balancing act for Beijing to counter internationalisation while deterring Taiwanese independence with military means. On the one hand, Beijing aims to repel Western accusations of China as a systemic rival or revisionist power. Consequently, Chinese rhetoric has sought to characterise the One China Principle as an international norm integral to the post-World War II global order. On the other hand, massive PLA drills have the countereffect of drawing global attention to Taiwan. Other countries are likely uninterested in the contentious debate over the nuances of cross-strait terminology, but would be concerned about Beijing’s appetite for wielding its military power. The Chinese threat of war has so far deterred Taipei from abandoning the ROC name and establishing a Taiwanese republic. Yet it fails to dim Taiwanese aspirations for international participation and cannot force a Chinese identity on Taiwanese voters. Though cross-strait divergence is deepening, whether another Taiwan Strait crisis will happen depends on US actions. Unable to change Taiwanese public opinion in the short term, Beijing is more concerned about Washington amplifyinginternationalisation. Under President Joe Biden, former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit in August 2022 triggered massive PLA exercises but heightened Taiwan’s international visibility. Washington has also continuously raised international concerns about Taiwan Strait stability with US allies. With US President-elect Donald Trump’s isolationist and transactional style returning to the White House, it is uncertain whether Biden’s Taiwan approach will continue. Symbolic gestures that might trigger another military crisis and Beijing’s requests to change US language regarding Taiwan must be treated cautiously if the second Trump administration intends to keep the fragile cross-strait balance.

Trump 2.0 And The Indo-Pacific: Balancing Economic And Security I...	By Abhishek Sharma and Sayantan Haldar The United States (US) elections have come to a close, with Donald Trump emerging as the winner of the White House race. World-over, speculation is rife about the shifts in global geopolitics that the new Trump administration will likely usher in. Donald Trump’s previous stint in Washington as the 45th President of the United States (between 2017-2021) is helpful for analysts in drawing clues about the priorities and interests of his incoming administration. However, the state of the world has changed dramatically since Trump’s previous term in office and is likely to be reflected in his government’s actions going forward. While it is natural that the incoming administration will change how the US continues to engage with the world, in the Indo-Pacific context, the shifts are likely to be nuanced. On the economic front, the intensification of a contest against China may be on the horizon. In many ways, this will shape Washington’s security outlook in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific legacy of Trump 1.0 In many ways, Donald Trump formalised America’s position on the Indo-Pacific. The previous Trump administration presided over America’s shift from the erstwhile Asia-Pacific towards a broader ‘Indo-Pacific’ focus. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, sought to anchor Washington’s defence, economic, and diplomatic ties with maritime Asia through the ‘Pivot’ strategy, later rechristened the ‘Rebalance to Asia’ strategy. Much after, world leaders began to grapple with the need to unify two important oceans—the Indian and Pacific oceans—into a single strategic theatre. In 2018, the Trump administration renamed the erstwhile Hawaii-based US Pacific Command (USPACOM) to the US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). While much of Trump’s campaign leading up to his previous administration was built on the need to check US spending on its allies and partners, the previous Trump administration had done well in gathering momentum towards building partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. This partly resulted from the imminent threat of China’s rise and the need to contain Beijing’s unilateral actions, which posed significant risks to American strategic interests in the region. Importantly, it was under the Trump administration, in 2017, that the Foreign Ministers of the four Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) countries—Australia, India, Japan and the US—held talks for the first time, which paved the way for the group to emerge as a formidable platform for governance in key domains of the Indo-Pacific. However, the strategic realities of the Indo-Pacific have undergone significant shifts in the last few years. This has also propelled new American partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from the Quad, three key partnerships guiding Washington’s outlook towards the Indo-Pacific are: The trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan; Squad comprising US, Japan, Australia, and Philippines; and AUKUS comprising Australia, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US. While the US-Japan-South Korea trilateral seeks to address security challenges posed by North Korea, the Squad took shape recently in response to continued Chinese belligerence in the South China Sea, which often led to physical confrontations between various maritime services of China and the Philippines. Meanwhile, AUKUS emerged as a trilateral to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to Australia to deter potential conflict in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific. Given the shifting regional geopolitical landscape, the question of how the new Trump administration recalibrates its security and foreign policy is likely to be tied to the way Washington views the utility of its labyrinth partnerships in its pursuit of national interests. Strategic competition to strategic contestation The incoming Trump administration will inherit a robust security 'latticework' established by the Joe Biden administration in the Indo-Pacific. It is uncertain if the initiatives seeded and nurtured by Biden's ‘Diplomacy First’ approach will be continued with the same diplomatic rigour in the Trump administration. The answer to this will likely shape the trajectory of the US’s Indo-Pacific approach. The future of minilateral partnerships is likely to remain subject to the merits of Trump’s transactional diplomacy. It is quite evident that US foreign policy will be dominated by Trump’s priorities and interests. However, based on the Trump 2.0 cabinet appointments, a trade war with China appears certain. This will spill over into Washington’s approach towards the Indo-Pacific and the way US alliances and partnerships are sustained, which might play out adversely for the US-led security architecture. Due to the Trump administration’s great emphasis on economic issues related to China, security considerations will likely take a back seat. The ensuing economic sentiment in Washington is a factor that will heavily influence Trump 2.0 diplomacy. The trade war against China that started during his first tenure will likely resume and sharpen. In this context, the US’s traditional allies in the Indo-Pacific will need to recalibrate their strategies to ensure their security interests remain unhindered. Drawing from their experiences with the previous Trump administration, the election results seem to have spurred concerns about the future of a US-led security architecture in the Indo-Pacific, especially with regards to Washington’s allies’ place in the new American outlook towards the region. Consequently, whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will remain the focal point of US Indo-Pacific Strategy is still unclear. Moreover, the incoming of the new Trump administration might lead to the proliferation of more minilaterals in the Indo-Pacific, especially if Washington neglects or discontinues security cooperation, allowing emerging and middle powers to step up and cooperate. For instance, during Trump 1.0, Japan under Shinzo Abe took the initiative to continue engaging and reassuring regional stakeholders like the Southeast Asian countries, keeping initiatives like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) alive, while also managing China’s economic profile in the Indo-Pacific. Conclusion The incoming Trump administration is expected to be more hawkish towards China than Trump 1.0, shifting from Biden’s approach of managed competition to more open confrontation. This will lead to an intensified contest between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific, which, going forward, will also shape its Indo-Pacific policy and relations with regional stakeholders. Nonetheless, what remains to be seen is whether the US approach towards China will remain the dominant factor shaping its relations with regional allies in the Indo-Pacific, or whether earlier friction points of the Trump 1.0 era will re-emerge in the US foreign policy agenda. Either of the two scenarios will significantly alter the Indo-Pacific regional security and economic architecture. For instance, the US is expected to revert to its earlier mercantilist position on the economic front, so we will likely see the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) becoming dormant, giving more space to Beijing. However, on the security front, it is expected that Trump will continue to invest in minilateral security groupings like AUKUS and Quad. In the Indo-Pacific, a major concern will be whether the US will continue to seek a leadership role as it did during the Biden administration through a ‘relentless diplomacy’ approach, or whether it will be content with pursuing its ‘America First’ agenda in the Indo-Pacific.

Elderly Care Service Industry In China’s Silver Economy Has Enorm...	By Qian Xiaozhi In recent years, the Chinese authorities have been looking into the issue of health consumption in public health and livelihoods. The introduction and implementation of a series of policies, such as the Healthy China 2030 (HC 2030), have become powerful tools for promoting nationwide health. Such policies focus on the future development goals for the country's health industry, with particular attention to the market size and positioning of the 'big health' industry. The 'big health' industry is an extension of the health concept. It covers a wide range of human activities related to food, clothing, housing, transportation, aging, illness, and death. It spans the entire lifecycle, from disease prevention and diagnosis to treatment, care, and health management. According to the HC 2030, it is expected that by the year 2030, the market size of China's 'big health' industry will reach RMB 16 trillion where the sector has seen rapid growth since 2018. According to data from Intelligent Research Group, in 2023, the market size of China's big health industry grew to RMB 77.127 trillion; among which the health and elderly care sector accounted for RMB 31.357 trillion, making up more than 40% of the total. This indicates that with the increasing aging population, elderly care in China has become an important component of the big health industry. Furthermore, based on the forecasts of HC 2030 and the current estimates of the industry's scale, it is expected that in the next 6 to 7 years, the market size of China's big health industry will double. The rapid increase in market size is primarily due to the booming demand from current societal factors. A report from the World Bank highlights that chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases, have become China's top health threats, with the proportion of deaths from these diseases exceeding 80%, and the share of the national disease burden reaching 68.6%. Chronic diseases have now replaced infectious diseases as the primary health concern of the Chinese population. According to relevant data, the prevalence rate of chronic diseases among China's total population is 169.8 per 1,000, while among the elderly population is 540.3 per 1,000, which is 3.2 times the national average. As the elderly care sector expands, the related service industry plays an increasingly important role. Based on daily observations by researchers at ANBOUND, there are several areas within the Chinese elderly care service industry that may hold potential for further development.: 1. Specialized Medical Food: Dr. Wei Junmin, a chief physician at Beijing Hospital, noted that based on a nationwide survey, over 40% of individuals aged 60 and above face nutritional risks or malnutrition. In hospitals, more than half of elderly inpatients are at nutritional risk, and about 30% are malnourished. With substantial market potential, specialized medical food is expected to experience rapid growth. According to a report on market trends of medical food for 2023-2024 by iiMedia Research, the global market for specialized medical food grew from RMB 58.3 billion in 2014 to RMB 89.64 billion in 2022, and it is projected to exceed RMB 100 billion by 2027, reaching RMB 111.06 billion. The market size of China's specialized medical food industry grew from RMB 2.59 billion in 2016 to RMB 11.93 billion in 2022. iiMedia analysts believe that only 1.6% of malnourished patients in China consume specialized medical food, which is significantly lower than the 65% rate in the U.S. With factors such as population aging, increasing downstream demand, and the development of hospital nutrition departments, the specialized medical food sector is expected to see further growth due to its crucial role in clinical nutritional support. 2. Elderly care travels: In the criteria set by the China Silver Industry Association (CSIA), travel-based elderly care is defined as a lifestyle where elderly individuals travel and reside in towns outside their usual place of residence for more than 15 days, during which they enjoy various age-friendly services and continue their elderly care. According to a June 2023 report by the China Tourism Academy, it is estimated that by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), the number of younger, healthier elderly individuals who travel frequently and have higher tourism consumption will exceed 100 million. Tourism revenue from elderly people in China is expected to reach RMB 1.14 trillion. The report indicates that the supply and demand in the elderly tourism industry in China are currently mismatched. It mentions that in 2019, the total expenditure of elderly tourists aged 65 and above in the country was RMB 319.78 billion, accounting for 5.6% of the total domestic tourism revenue of RMB 5.73 trillion. However, from the perspective of consumption structure, there is still significant potential for growth in the elderly tourism industry. Elderly tourists aged 65 and above in urban areas spent an average of RMB 1,209.20 per trip, which is only 74.3% of the average spending of RMB 1,626.50 of urban tourists. Meanwhile, elderly tourists in rural areas spent only RMB 847.50 per trip. The relatively low spending in elderly tourism can be attributed to the fact that the current tourism industry still primarily targets the middle-aged and young populations, with few products that cater to the needs of the elderly. There is insufficient integration of elderly tourism with industries in elements like culture, sports, and healthcare services. The silver communities often feel that the available travel products are not suitable for them, and the products they need are unavailable. However, behind this vast market is a pension service sector that is still in need of further development. 3. Rehabilitation Assistive Devices: According to data released by the World Health Organization, more than one billion people worldwide require some form of rehabilitation assistive devices, with the majority of these individuals being elderly or disabled. In China, the number of people in need of rehabilitation medical services has already exceeded 100 million. As the aging population issue intensifies and the likelihood of elderly people suffering from various health conditions gradually increases, this number is expected to continue rising. Data from Zhiyanzhan Industry Research Institute reveals that in 2019, the sales revenue from rehabilitation assistive device rental services in the Chinese market was RMB 20 million, and it is predicted that by 2030, this figure will rise to RMB 1.432 billion. As the aging population continues to increase in China, the imbalance between supply and demand in the rehabilitation assistive devices market is becoming particularly pronounced. According to relevant data, the proportion of people who have access to assistive device services has not yet surpassed 10% of the total population's demand. One reason for this is that China's elderly care industry started relatively late, and the types of rehabilitation devices are still rather limited. Compared to developed countries, the supply of high-quality rehabilitation assistive devices is clearly lagging behind. Among these factors, the insufficient variety of products is undoubtedly a key factor contributing to the scarcity of high-quality supply resources. Additionally, the technology of China's rehabilitation assistive products is generally low, and product quality varies significantly. In the current market environment, the production of low-cost products far exceeds demand, while the demand for high-quality products remains unmet and is mainly reliant on imports. Part of the reason for this is China's previous neglect of this industry, as well as a severe lack of investment in research and development. Additionally, the production model is relatively outdated. The government has also begun to pay attention to this issue. In 2024, China's State Council issued a policy document on promoting a 'silver economy to improve the well-being of the elderly.' It called for the improvement of the rehabilitation assistive devices industry, upgrading functional compensation devices such as hearing aids, orthotics, canes, and prosthetics, and enhancing life care products such as smart wheelchairs, transfer machines, and rehabilitation nursing beds. Crucially, in areas such as specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices in China, the supporting policies and industrial infrastructure are underdeveloped. As elderly care services increasingly become a vital component of the health and silver sector, these industries present significant opportunities for further development and investment. Final analysis conclusion: As the aging population in China continues to grow, health-oriented elderly care has become a prevailing trend within the broader health industry. Within this context, the importance of elderly care services is becoming increasingly prominent. However, China remains significantly behind in several sectors, including specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices. These industries present considerable potential for further development.

Distress In Commercial Real Estate Bonds Hit All-Time High – Anal...	By Artis Shepherd Commercial real estate continues to suffer despite the Federal Reserve’s attempt at ameliorating the capital markets with a 50-basis point rate cut in September. The pain is especially apparent in the so-called 'CRE-CLO' bond market. CRE-CLO bonds are packaged commercial real estate mortgages comprising short-term floating rate loans. These bridge loans were recently, and most notably, used to facilitate the biggest apartment investment bubble in history, but were also used in financing other commercial real estate sectors including office, retail, hotel, industrial, and self-storage. Most of the current batch of bridge loans originated in the 2020-2022 period—when benchmark rates were near zero and commercial real estate prices were peaking—and carried maturities of three to five years. Benchmark rates are now much higher, prices much lower, and property performance far worse than anticipated. Thus, a wall of maturities is staring borrowers, lenders, and bondholders in the face, all while underlying property performance disappoints. Despite attempts by lenders to extend and pretend—kicking the can down the road in the short term to avoid defaults until the Federal Reserve lowers rates enough to bail them out—their delusions of reprieve may be fading fast. Apartment Investors Play Checkers Instead of Chess At the end of Q3, the distress rate for CRE-CLO loans across all commercial real estate sectors reached 13.1 percent, an all-time high. Distress in this instance is defined as any loan reported 30 days or more delinquent, past the maturity date, in special servicing (typically due to a drop in occupancy or a failure to meet certain performance criteria), or any combination thereof. Figure 1 While roughly one in seven loans meets these criteria, the weakness is concentrated in two or three sectors. Unsurprisingly, office properties have the highest rate of distress, with nearly one in five CRE-CLO office loans experiencing current distress. This is to be expected after the covid panic of 2020, subsequent to which various 'work-from-home' directives essentially made the office market obsolete. For similar reasons, distress is also high in the retail segment, as all but the most well-heeled retailers were forced under by the maniacal and criminal government edicts of the time. However, the real story here is in the apartment, or multifamily, sector. Seen in Figure 1, the distress rate for apartments touched 16.4 percent in August. An astonishing number, indicating that one in six apartment bridge loans were distressed. The improvement to 13.7 percent shown for September is seasonal, as renters settle in at the start of the school year. While this picture is bad enough, the reality under the surface is far worse. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, using Q2 data from MSCI, the batch of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise roughly $14 billion in total loans, but there exists an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans. MSCI categorizes loans as 'potentially distressed' if they have seen delinquent payments, forbearance (when the lender lets interest payments accrue rather than taking a default action), or where key performance metrics like occupancy and net operating income are dangerously low. Figure 2 The arithmetically-aware will note that if the $14 billion of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise a roughly 14 percent distress rate at the end of Q2 (as shown in Figure 1) and there are an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans not yet categorized as 'currently distressed' (as shown in Figure 2), then MSCI data implies that 95 percent of all apartment bridge loans are either currently distressed or in imminent danger of distress. While astounding, this level of distress will come as no surprise to veterans of the apartment market. In the 2020-22 period, bridge loans of this variety were ubiquitous above a certain minimum loan size. And, because of the extreme and reckless nature of money printing undertaken by the Federal Reserve during this time—when interest rates were effectively zero—lenders underwrote property acquisitions with a 1.0x debt service coverage ratio ('DSCR'), meaning the initial net operating income of the property was projected to just cover interest payments, with nothing left over. Bridge loan interest rates floated at a spread (typically around 350 basis points, or 3.5 percent) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), which was essentially 0 percent until mid-2022. Because of the 1.0x DSCR standard, a property acquired during this period that had net operating income of $1 million would have also had interest payments of $1 million at the then-prevailing interest rate of 3.5 percent. SOFR is now 4.9 percent, indicating a total interest rate of 8.4 percent (SOFR + 3.5 percent spread). This same property now has interest payments of $2.4 million while net operating income is unlikely to have increased to any significant extent, if at all. Insurance and property tax increases in particular have damaged apartment profitability while rent increases have been difficult to execute in the face of stagnating real wages. By the same token, absurdly optimistic renovation plans have been impossible in the face of cash flows increasingly shunted towards paying interest. The Amazing Disappearing Rate Cut The high amount of potential distress in CRE-CLO bonds, and the loans that underlie them, indicate an expectation on the part of lenders that help is coming in the form of lower interest rates. After all, capital markets have become used to being bailed out by the Federal Reserve, all but demanding that the taxpayer—not they—be held responsible for their poor decisions. Nevertheless, the Fed’s recent rate cut is proving not to be the magic bullet on which lenders relied. By August of this year, futures markets had fully priced in a 25-50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, and were expecting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December. This expectation for the Fed Funds Rate carried over into Treasury yields, a key benchmark for the commercial real estate industry. Particularly important in the case of distressed bridge loans since any hopes of refinancing are placed not on more bridge loans—which are now much less pervasive—but on the fixed-rate agency market comprising Fannie- and Freddie-backed apartment loans, which prices loans off a spread to treasuries. At the beginning of August, as markets priced in 75-100 bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end, 10-year Treasury yields reacted accordingly, dropping from 4.30 percent in late July (they had been 4.70 percent in April) to 3.65 percent in the middle of September. As of early November, most of that move had been erased—with yields back near 4.30 percent—roughly where they were prior to market pricing in this year’s Fed rate cuts. Fear and Trembling Undeniably, participants in the commercial real estate market—apartment bridge lenders in particular—are relying on loose monetary policy for their immediate salvation. They may get their wish. While Treasury rates have moved stubbornly higher, market forces only mean so much if the Fed decides to supplement rate cuts with purchases of treasuries, driving yields lower—another round of quantitative easing. Nevertheless, to the extent they’re allowed to be heard, market signals are unmistakable. A regime that can’t stop spending and continues to appropriate the property of its citizens through inflation will provide upward pressure on Treasury yields, all else equal. In a free market context, the rent-seekers that comprise the commercial real estate market will have to work out their own salvation.

The Counter-Insurgency Is ‘On’ – Against Trump’s ‘Storm’ – OpEd	The Deep State whispered to Trump: ‘You cannot withstand the storm’. Trump whispered back: 'I am the storm'. The war is on. The Deep State has launched a war of disruption to disable Trump’s ‘storm’. This week’s ATACM strike was but one part to an inter-agency counter-insurgency – a political strike directed at Trump; so too are all the inter-agency false narratives attributed to the Trump camp; and so too, the escalating provocations directed at Iran. Be assured the Five Eyes are full participants in the counter-insurgency. Macron and Starmer openly conspired together in Paris ahead of the U.S. announcement to promote the ATACMS strike. The inter-agency grandees clearly are very fearful. They must worry that Trump may expose the ‘Russia Hoax’ (that Trump in 2016 was a Russian ‘asset’) and put them in jeopardy. But Trump understands what’s afoot: 'We need peace without delay … The foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict. The greatest threat to Western civilization today is not Russia. It’s probably more than anything else ourselves… There must be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire Globalist Neo-con establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad while they turn us into a Third World country and a Third World dictatorship right here at home. The State Department, the Defense bureaucracy, the intelligence services and all of the rest need to be completely overhauled and reconstituted. To fire the Deep Staters and put America first – we have to put America First'. Whilst the long-range ATACM launch on ‘deep Russian pre-2014 territory’ is no game-changer – it will not change the course of the war (ATACMS regularly are – at 90% – downed by Russian Air Defences); the salience of this act however, is not strategic; rather, it lies with the crossing into the realm of direct NATO attacks on Russia. Colonel Doug MacGregor reports that two sources are telling him that 'Russian nuclear rocket forces are on full alert. They are at the highest level of readiness ever achieved. It suggests that Russia has taken this crossing of the line very seriously'. Yes, it was a provocation, and President Putin will respond appropriately. He has to – but not necessarily through nuclear escalation. Why? Because the war in Ukraine is moving rapidly in his direction, with Russian forces closing-in on the Dnieper east bank. Effectively, facts on the ground will be the outcome determinant, leaving little point to external mediation. But more than just a dangerous provocation aimed at Russia, the ATACM and Storm Shadow attacks represent an attempt to turn foreign policy – literally – on its head. Instead of policy being aimed directly at a rising foreign adversary threatening U.S. hegemony, it is being transformed into a loaded weapon locked onto America’s domestic war. It is aimed specifically at Trump – to ‘hog tie’ him in, and to divert his attention to wars that he does not want. Logic suggests that Trump would want to keep clear of Netanyahu’s scheming for a war against Iran. But the ‘Israel Firsters’ and the Lobby (as Professor Jeffrey Sachs argues) long have had effective control over Congress and the U.S. military – more than does the President. Explains Sachs: 'Because the Zionist Lobby is so powerful, Netanyahu basically has had control over the Pentagon to fight wars on behalf of Israeli extremism. The war in Iraq in 2003 was a Netanyahu War. The attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the overthrow of Moamar Gaddafi – All were ‘Netanyahu Wars’'. The important point is that Netanyahu can ‘do what he does’ because it was always planned this way – a plan that has been 50 years in execution. The ‘Israel First’ strategy was fully embraced by Scoop Jackson (a two-times Presidential candidate). And just so the policy could not be rolled back, Scoop insisted on Zionists staffing the State Department, and that neo-cons and Zionists hold the reins at the NSC. That same pattern continues until today. At bottom lies the ultimate boondoggle by which the political class of both U.S. parties become wealthy and afford the campaign costs of remaining legislators: 'It’s quite a dandy deal that the Israel Lobby or the Zionist Lobby puts in, say, a hundred million dollars into campaigns and it gets trillions out –trillions, not billions, trillions out [in government] expenditures. And so, when Netanyahu speaks, it’s bizarre to me, but it is not Trump who is appointing or naming [those ‘Israel Firsters’ who are part of his Team, but Netanyahu]', Sachs says. When Netanyahu describes Trump’s ‘Israel First’ nominations as his ‘dream U.S. team’, the explanation is not difficult to see. On the one hand, Trump has a ‘Revolution’ to conduct in America and wants his nominations to office approved. And, on the other, Netanyahu has a further war he wants the U.S. to fight for him. 'The ‘Big Ugly’ was always a description of the battle that few understood',another commentator notes: 'The Senate is factually the core of republican opposition to MAGA and President Trump. The visible battle … consumes the most attention. However, it is the less-visible battle against the entrenched ideological Republicans that proves to be the hardest'. 'The Republicans in the upper chamber will not relinquish power easily. They have a multitude of weapons to use against the (Trump) insurgency … We are seeing this play out now in the alignment of Republican Senators who stand in opposition to Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, [as] this recent report[explains]'. 'The basic outline is that the senate leadership will reluctantly support Matt Gaetz for Main Justice, where ‘support’ means they will not directly oppose; in exchange for the nomination of FBI Director Mike Rogers [a co-founder of the ‘Never Trump’ group] to defend inter-agency interests at FBI'. The prospective Republican Senate Leader, John Thune, will play his cards carefully in order to extract maximum damage. He has leverage by trying to connect Trump to Netanyahu’s carnage in the region. Thune, whilst announcing huge quantities of weapons for Israel, said: 'To Our Allies in Israel, and to the Jewish People Around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way. In six weeks, Republicans will reclaim the Senate Majority, and we will make clear that the United States Congress stands squarely In Israel’s Corner'. Trump will need to play his cards carefully, too. Since, for his purposes, the absolute priority are his two domestic wars: First, 'dismantling the entire Globalist Neocon Establishment', and secondly, ending the out-of-control government expenditure that has bloated the Deep State boondoggle and turned the U.S. real economy into a shadow of its former self. Trump needs those radical reform nominations to pass, even if he has to sacrifice one or two to secure Senate approval for the others. The Israel First nominees, needless to add, will be approved seamlessly. Of the two ‘entanglement’ threats to Trump’s reform agenda, Russian escalation is the lesser of the two. The Ukraine war is motoring steadily towards some form of dénoument. One that works for Russia. Putin is in the driving seat, and does not need a major war with NATO. Nor does Putin need Trump’s ‘art of the deal’. A resolution of some sort will occur without him. However, Trump’s role will be important subsequently to define a new border between the security interests of the Atlanticists and those of the Asian heartland (including China and Iran). The other putative war – Iran – is the more dangerous to Trump. Jewish political influence and the Lobby has taken the U.S. into multiple disastrous wars before. And now, Netanyahu desperately needs a war and he is not alone. Much of Israel is clamouring for war that would end ‘all the fronts’ facing it. There is a profound conviction in this prospect as the solution and the ‘Great Victory’ that Netanyahu and Israel so desperately need. The ground has been dug-over, both by propaganda that Iran’s nuclear programme is ‘staggeringly vulnerable’ (which it isn’t), and by the media’s onslaught that replays the meme that to attack Iran now represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, with Hizbullah and Hamas already weakened. War with Iran – totally erroneously – is thus being sold as an ‘easy war’. There is an unshakeable certitude that it must be so. ‘We are strong, and Iran is weak’. Who will roll-back the Israel Firsters? They have the momentum and the fervour. A war against Iran will fare badly for Israel and the U.S. The wide ramifications likely will precipitate precisely the severe financial and market crisis that could derail Trump’s ‘Storm’.

Fencing The Ocean: Australia’s Social Media Safety Bill – OpEd	The Australian government is being run ragged in various quarters. When ragged, such a beast is bound to seek a distraction. And what better than finding a vulnerable group, preferably children, to feel outraged and noble about? The Albanese government, armed such problematic instruments as South Australia’s Children (Social Media Safety) Bill 2024, which will fine social media companies refusing to exclude children under the age of 14 from using their platforms, and a report by former High Court Chief Justice Robert French on the feasibility of such a move, is confident of restricting the use of social media by children across the country by imposing an age limit. On November 21, the government boastfully declared in a media release that it had officially 'introduced world-leading legislation to enforce a minimum age of 16 years for social media.' The proposed legislation, known as the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024, is supposedly going to 'deliver greater protections for young Australians during critical stages of their development.' The proposed legislation made something of an international splash. NBC News, for instance, called the bill 'one of the toughest in the world', failing to note its absence of muscle. To that end, it remains thin on detail. These laws constitute yet another effort to concentrate power and responsibilities best held by the citizenry in the hands of a bureaucratic-political class governed by paranoia and procedure. They are also intended to place the onus on social media platforms to place restrictions upon those under 16 years of age from having accounts. The government openly admits as much, seemingly treating parents as irresponsible and weak (their consent in this is irrelevant), and children as permanently threatened by spoliation. 'The law places the onus on social media platforms – not parents or young people – to take reasonable steps to ensure these protections are in place.' If the platforms do not comply, they risk fines of up to A$49.5 million. As for the contentious matter of privacy, the prime minister and his communications minister are adamant. 'It will contain robust privacy provisions, including requiring the platforms to ringfence and destroy any information collected to safeguard the personal information of all Australians.' The drafters of the bill have also taken liberties on what is deemed appropriate to access. As the media release mentions, Australia’s youth will still 'have continued access to messaging and online gaming, as well as access to services which are health and education related, like Headspace, Kids Helpline, and Google Classroom, and YouTube.' This daft regime is based on the premise it will survive circumvention. Children, through guile and instinctive perseverance, will always find a way to access forbidden fruit. Indeed, as the Digital Industry Group Inc says, this '20th Century response to 21st Century challenges' may well steer children into 'dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet'. In May, documents uncovered under Freedom of Information by Guardian Australia identified that government wonks in the communications department were wondering if such a scheme was even viable. A document casting a sceptical eye over the use of age assurance technology was unequivocal: 'No countries have implemented an age verification mandate without issue.' Legal challenges have been launched in France and Germany against such measures. Circumvention has become a feature in various US states doing the same, using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). While this proposed legislation will prove ineffectual in achieving its intended purpose – here, protecting the prelapsarian state of childhood from ruin at the hands of wicked digital platforms – it will also leave the apparatus of hefty regulation. One can hardly take remarks coming from the absurdly named office of the eSafety Commissioner, currently occupied by the authoritarian-minded Julie Inman Grant, seriously in stating that 'regulators like eSafety have to be nimble.' Restrictions, prohibitions, bans and censorship regimes are, in their implementation, never nimble. For all that, even Inman Grant has reservations about some of the government’s assumptions, notably on the alleged link between social media and mental harm. The evidence for such a claim, she told BBC Radio 5 Live, 'is not settled at all'. Indeed, certain vulnerable groups – she mentions LGBTQ+ and First Nations cohorts in particular – 'feel more themselves online than they do in the real world'. Why not, she suggests, teach children to use online platforms more safely? Children, she analogises, should be taught how to swim, rather than being banned from swimming itself. Instruct the young to swim; don’t ringfence the sea. Rather appositely, Lucas Lane, at 15 something of an entrepreneur selling boys nail polish via the online business Glossy Boys, told the BBC that the proposed ban 'destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen.' Already holed without even getting out of port, this bill will serve another, insidious purpose. While easily dismissed as having a stunted moral conscience, Elon Musk, who owns X Corp, is hard to fault in having certain suspicions about these draft rules. 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians,' he wrote to a post from Albanese. One, unfortunately, among several.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuUH2Ry01l1K7	2024-11-22T16:50:13-08:00	
Surviving The New Trump Era – OpEd	Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was surprising in a number of ways. He won every swing state as well as the popular vote, which a Republican candidate hadn’t done in two decades. He led his party to a congressional sweep, with the Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives and seizing a majority in the Senate. And he benefited from an unexpectedly large shift in votes among Latino and African-American men. In 2016, when Hilary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin but lost the Electoral College, anti-Trump forces could plausibly argue that most of the country opposed the new president. This time around, a very slim plurality of voters had no problem putting back into the White House a convicted felon who supported efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. In 2016, Trump himself was surprised by his own victory, and his team was ill-prepared to take power. In 2024, the Trump team is ready to hit the ground running on day one. It has already made some of the most extreme choices in U.S. history for the top positions in U.S. government: serial rule-breaker Matt Gaetz for attorney general, conspiracy theorist Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, right-wing TV host Pete Hegseth to head up the Pentagon, and extremist Stephen Miller to oversee immigration. This time around, the conservative establishment has a detailed game plan for the administration—Project 2025—that will guide Trump and his team. A new conservative thinktank in Washington, DC, the America First Policy Institute, will also be shaping the administration’s agenda. The Biden administration is scrambling to preserve some of the achievements that the Trump team plans to destroy, particularly around clean energy. Federal employees are fearful that they will lose their jobs in Trump’s promised attacks on the 'deep state.' Prominent anti-Trumpers are worried about the retribution that the former and future president has vowed to pursue. A demoralized Democratic Party is busy trying to figure out why it lost so badly in the elections. The next four years promise to be chaotic, vengeful, and dangerous. U.S. democracy is certainly in peril. The international rule of law will likely sustain numerous challenges, as it has already from Russia and Israel. And the planet itself, thanks to the climate denier returning to the White House, faces the prospect of a big step backward. What can be done to prevent the new Trump administration from doing its worst? At the global level, many countries will step into the vacuum created by U.S. withdrawal—from the Paris agreement, the effort to supply Ukraine, and various global human rights institutions. European powers will likely step up their assistance to Ukraine if the Trump administration ends all military support for the besieged country. Europe, too, will continue to take the lead in terms of a clean energy transition, but China, Brazil, and India are also producing a growing amount of electricity from renewable sources. Europe, however, is divided, with a number of far-right leaders who are thrilled to have a U.S. leader like Trump pushing for change from the outside. And the authoritarian leaders of other countries—Russia, China, Turkey—will happily take the U.S. side in eroding human rights norms and institutions. Inside the United States, the greatest resistance will come from the states. These states controlled by Democrats—California, Washington, Massachusetts—are already preparing to work together to block Trump from executing his extremist agenda. This resistance will likely take the form of filing suits that tangle up the new administration in court. During Trump’s first term, states joining together to stymie Trump succeeded in 94 cases. Unfortunately, thanks to all of Trump’s judicial appointees in his first term, these legal challenges will face longer odds. States also have considerable authority to set policy. For instance, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, a number of states preserved access to abortion services through court rulings, legislative policy, or popular referenda. In the case of Trump’s determination to proceed with mass deportations, some Democratic governors have already said that they will not allow state police to assist federal authorities with the removals. Democrat-led states will do their best to create islands of sanctuary against the overreach of federal authorities. NGOs and social movements will also mount resistance. A women’s march in Washington, DC just after Trump’s inauguration in 2017 demonstrated the depth and breadth of anger at the new president’s attitudes and proposed policies toward women. A comparable march is planned for January 2025. In addition to using the courts to stop or delay Trump policies, the resistance is organizing to push the Democratic Party toward economic populism. Harris lost a lot of working-class voters. As Maurice Mitchell of the Working Families Party puts it, 'Donald Trump has no solutions to address the needs of working-class people in this country. And we know that when he tries to implement his agenda of more tax cuts for billionaires, gutting health care, deporting millions, and supporting war crimes with public dollars, people will rise up.' The goal of these progressives is to highlight the economic costs of Trump’s early moves—mass deportations, tariffs, corporate tax cuts—to build momentum to win the 2016 midterm elections. Resistance will be much easier if the Democrats control at least one chamber of Congress. A number of key movements exploded during Trump’s first term: the Sunrise Movement around climate change began just a couple months after Trump’s inauguration, #MeToo went viral in October 2017, #BlackLivesMatter went global after police killed George Floyd in May 2020. Inevitably, after the despondency of the election fades and the outrage at Trump’s actual policies explodes, new movements will emerge to mobilize public anger. The centrists in the Democratic Party failed in the last election because they refused to embrace the kind of economic populism that the Republicans, traditionally the party of the rich, began to cultivate under Trump. The challenge for the Democrats will be negotiate between the two progressive parts of the party—the cultural left and the economic left. Although these parts often overlap, the party failed to emphasize the latter in the last election, which could have appealed to so many voters who ended up pulling the lever for Trump because of the rising cost of food and rent. In the seven stages of grief, progressives are wallowing right now in the first three stages of shock, denial, and anger. It would be a mistake to get stuck in the seventh and final stage of acceptance. When Trump’s policies begin to bite, the anger will return and, with it, a new determined resistance.

A US Federal Shield Law Is Needed To Protect The Press – OpEd	Like it or not, the Constitution’s First Amendment gives the media special protection in the American republic. That amendment says, 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press.' With one of the recent presidential candidates unconstitutionally threatening to shut down media outlets or take away their (non-existent) licenses when they say or do something he doesn’t like, it is not hard to imagine him in office trying to ferret out government whistleblowers by applying legal coercion to force members of the press to cough up their sources. In fact, this candidate, when he was president previously, did precisely that, as did his predecessor from the opposite party to an even greater extent. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have laws or state court rulings that shield reporters from such government coercion. Despite the special protection of the media by the Constitution at the national level, no similar federal law exists to provide the same safeguard. Thus, federal Circuit Courts of Appeals rulings have had to give some stopgap protection. Why is a federal shield law for reporters needed? If the government cannot keep its essential information under wraps, then the press should be free to publish it for public inspection. However, the government doesn’t see it that way, and it has plenty of coercive legal power to subpoena reporters of leaked information to divulge their sources so that any government leaker can be prosecuted. And legally, if reporters gather or transmit vaguely defined 'national defense information' from leakers or whistleblowers, the journalists can risk being prosecuted criminally through the Espionage Act of 1917; only tradition has circumscribed the prosecution of reporters under the law. Of course, the general lack of protection for reporters’ sources dissuades such federal whistleblowers from talking to reporters about wrongdoing or corruption in government. Even in a republic, the public should be aware that plenty of corruption and skullduggery exist in government. A proposed federal reporters’ shield law, the PRESS (Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying) Act, is going through Congress and passed by the House of Representatives unanimously twice (an unusual feat of consensus in today’s polarized political world). However, the bill has been opposed in the Senate by a small group of members because it would encourage leaks of national security and law enforcement information. Yet, the bill has exceptions to force reporters to divulge sources to prevent any acts of terrorism or imminent violence and does not provide immunity to reporters who commit illegal acts to obtain information (such as hacking, etc.). Also, it is widely acknowledged that much overclassification exists in information classified by the feds for 'national security' reasons and that classification can be flagrantly abused to hide information that is embarrassing to the government. Finally, the few senators objecting to the bill claim to be constitutional textualists and originalists. Yet, the First Amendment’s prohibition on abridging the freedom of the press mentions no exception for 'national security.' Besides, the government has so much coercive power that it can often find leakers and prosecute them without intimidating reporters to divulge their sources. With any federal shield law, it may seem that reporters have been designated as a special class of citizens, but the First Amendment already realizes that keeping a vibrant republic demands special protections to maintain a free press. (In the internet era, however, any conception of journalists may need to be widened to include new forms of the profession.) And those safeguards for the press may be especially needed if a candidate is elected who parrots Joseph Stalin by deeming the press 'an enemy of the people' and regularly threatens media outlets with retribution and coercion.

Democrats Lost By Overly Orchestrating Anti-Trump Efforts – OpEd	Nancy Pelosi got blamed for top-down 'orchestration,' but the Cabal was broader than that The primary reasons voters elected Donald Trump over Kamala Harris and chose a Republican Congress were Joe Biden and the Democrats' miserable handling of the economy, immigration and foreign policy – and their embrace of far-left 'woke' polices, like sex-change operations for prisoners and other 'transgender rights.' However, the Democrat 'strategy' of hitting Trump with multiple indictments, tagging him and his supporters as 'existential threats to democracy,' and scaring women over abortion rights after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision may also have backfired, because these efforts were really designed to deflect attention from the harmful impacts of Biden's bad policies and actions. Topping it off, when he was pushed off the ticket for Vice President Kamala Harris in July, many voters may have smelled a rat. In essence, all of this was masterminded by a few political chieftains, notably former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and probably the Obamas, Clintons and their 'strategists.' Indeed, on MSNBC November 9, former Harris spokesperson and one-time Bernie Sanders operative Symone Sanders-Townsend (no relation to the senator), mouthed off against Pelosi, saying she 'orchestrated the very public demise of the president. And thank God for Joe Biden, that he came out and, yes, endorsed his VP. Pelosi is known for being 'calculated,' she went on to say, but 'where is her calculator now?' The key words here are 'orchestration' and 'calculating.' One could say 'None dare call it conspiracy,' or resurrect then-First Lady Hillary Clinton's 1998 phrase 'vast right-wing conspiracy' that 'has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.' Ms. Clinton was denounced for calling it a 'conspiracy.' In reality, a group of conservative activists and publications did continue an 'opposition research' campaign against President Bill Clinton from the day he was elected in 1992, to persuade Congress and courts to investigate him, impeach him and undermine his presidency. It didn't really work. Like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton was impeached, but he resurrected himself, while Hillary went on to become a US Senator from New York and Secretary of State – and came close to defeating Trump for president in 2016. The vast-left wing orchestration against Trump, however, was much more intricate, extensive and orchestrated than what conservatives used to tarnish Clinton. For example: * Advancing the phony 'Russiagate' scandal, at the highest levels of government * Supporting and glorifying the 'mostly peaceful' 'Resistance' against the Trump presidency * Instigating the 2019 House impeachment * Demanding school and business lockdowns during the Covid pandemic, to hurt the economy and President Trump * Supporting and capitalizing on the George Floyd riots * Perpetuating 'January 6' investigations, hearings, indictments and media coverage * Promoting fear and hysteria following the Dobbs decision and various state limitations on abortion * Pushing challengers out of the 2020 primaries to anoint Joe Biden (South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's 'masterstroke') * Preventing a competitive 2024 primary against Biden * Holding a Biden-Trump debate after primaries had ended, to see how President Biden would perform – and then forcing him off the ticket because he bombed * Coronating Kamala Harris after Biden was ousted Many are convinced that all these schemes were orchestrated by the Cabal of Pelosi, Schumer, the Obamas, the Clintons, and their strategists. Perhaps they wanted Biden to be the 2020 nominee, instead of independent-minded people like Senators Amy Klobuchar or Elizabeth Warren, or outsiders like Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg, because they knew they could manipulate Biden more easily. However, Joe Biden was never a leader in the US Senate; he was a follower. He does little thinking for himself, but makes decisions based on the advice of bureaucrats, political aides and special interests. He largely approved all the big-spending legislation and regulatory initiatives the Democrats and his Obama-holdover aides wanted when they regained control of Congress after 2020. And he opened the nation's borders to salve the bleeding hearts of his policy wonks. 'Joe Biden is nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical socialists,' former Vice President Mike Pence warned in 2020. In the end, that radicalism doomed the Democrats in 2024. In anointing Biden 'The Nominee' during the 2020 primaries, octogenarians Clyburn and Pelosi looked over Biden's eroding cognitive abilities. When he inevitably became a liability to the Democratic cause, they orchestrated his departure from the ticket for the younger Harris. They also engaged in incessant 'lawfare,' Trump indictments and January-6 investigations. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested the Democrats should have focused 'on one or two' charges against Trump, not four, and the indictments 'will backfire on the Left.' But The Cabal apparently wanted to extend the Trump-tarnishing so that there would be no trial before the GOP nominating process, thereby giving Republicans little opportunity to nominate someone else. Prolonging the 1/6 congressional investigation into the 2022 elections was an effort to tarnish not just Trump, but his supporters. Biden's unforgivable September 2022 speech in Philadelphia, when he attacked 'MAGA Republicans' for being disloyal to America, was part and parcel of this effort The media covered up the Cabal's intrigues. Anyone who watches CNN or MSNBC has seen how Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin, Pelosi, Clyburn and other leading Democrats are treated with kid gloves. The media hated Trump for calling them 'fake news' and colluded with the Democrats nearly every step of the way. It's unlikely that Symone Sanders-Townsend will come clean on all of this, though our nation would benefit greatly from the disinfecting sunshine she could provide. Regardless, it seems highly unlikely that the Democrats can change their stripes, because their base and big donors have gone Loony-Left. The Cabal probably thought throwing all those indictments and civil penalties at Trump would make him crack and cop a plea with the prosecutors. But Trump had the money and backbone to slug it out. He also had excellent lawyers, who mucked up the lawfare wheels. Essentially, he ran the clock out on the Democrats. There's a lesson here about being 'overzealous' in politics. Jerome Lawrence coauthored the 1955 play (and 1960 film) 'Inherit the Wind,' which examined extremism in 'the Scopes monkey trial,' as a metaphor for the McCarthy investigations. Lawrence wrote: 'Is it possible to be overzealous, to destroy that which you hope to save – so that nothing is left but emptiness?' With Trump wining a near landslide despite the criminal cases – and taking the Congress – it seems all the Democrat orchestrations left them nothing but emptiness.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuXBLrZUSNRzZ	2024-11-22T16:34:40-08:00	
Saudi Arabia: Public Investment Fund Linked To Abuses, Says HRW	Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has facilitated and benefited from human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said in a report. The 95-page report, 'The Man Who Bought the World: Rights Abuses Linked to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Its Chairman, Mohammad bin Salman,' found that Saudi Arabia’s vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is effectively controlled by one person, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Human Rights Watch found that the crown prince wields this enormous economic power in a largely arbitrary and highly personalized manner rather than for the Saudi people’s benefit and that the PIF is used to whitewash the Saudi government’s abuses. 'Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has unchecked control over the country’s nearly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund,' said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'The crown prince has used the Saudi sovereign wealth fund’s economic power to commit serious human rights violations and whitewash the reputational harm from these abuses.' Sovereign wealth funds are funds accumulated by a government, often consisting of government revenue, trade surpluses, and reserves, and are invested domestically and abroad. Many have been built on oil wealth. The report is based on a review of government statements, Saudi court documents; Saudi laws and government decrees; documents released during court proceedings in Canada and the United States; company records and reports; investigations and analyses by journalists financial experts, and academics; as well as interviews with Saudi activists and dissidents, journalists, experts, and lawyers with long experience in Saudi Arabia. The PIF has benefited directly from serious human rights abuses linked to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS. This includes the crown prince’s 2017 'anti-corruption' crackdown that consisted of arbitrary detentions, abusive treatment of detainees, and the extortion of property from Saudi Arabia’s elite. The PIF has facilitated serious human rights violations linked to MBS through companies it owns and controls, such as the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the anti-corruption crackdown. Sky Prime Aviation, one of the companies transferred to the PIF during the crackdown, owned the two planes used in 2018 by Saudi agents to travel to Istanbul, where they murdered Khashoggi. MBS overhauled the PIF’s governance framework and concentrated an immense degree of control and oversight of the fund into his own hands, enabling him to unilaterally direct enormous sums of state wealth to megaprojects that do little to realize economic, social, or cultural rights in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s most marginalized people—migrant workers, rural communities, and poor and working-class residents—have borne the brunt of abuses stemming from the fund’s projects. Capital from the PIF has been used for projects that have forcibly evicted residents, razed neighborhoods, subjected migrant workers to serious abuses, and silenced communities. Human Rights Watch also found violations linked to some of the PIF’s most high-profile megaprojects, including the NEOM region, an economic zone and new city on the Red Sea that is being erected from scratch, as well as the Jeddah Central Project, an urban development project in Jeddah. Saudi authorities forcibly evicted members of the Huwaitat tribe, who have for centuries inhabited the Tabuk province, in the planned NEOM area, arrested those who protested their evictions, and killed one protesting resident. Two residents received sentences of 50 years in prison, and three received death sentences for resisting the forced evictions. The wholly-PIF-owned Jeddah Central Development Company, which is carrying out the Jeddah Central Project, forcibly evicted large numbers of middle and lower-class Saudis, foreigners, and migrant workers from their homes in Jeddah’s previously vibrant working-class neighborhoods to transform the area into a luxury shopping and tourism district. Under internationally recognized human rights norms, the Saudi government should progressively realize economic, social, and cultural rights to the maximum of available resources, including those the PIF controls. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Saudi Arabia has the highest poverty headcount rate for nationals in the GCC at 13.6 percent, meaning that poverty affects nearly 'one in seven nationals in Saudi Arabia.' This figure does not include all Saudi residents, particularly migrant workers who make up approximately 42 percent of the population. The PIF under MBS operates with little transparency and accountability, raising concerns over whether these funds are ultimately invested and managed in a way that satisfies these international norms. The existence of a centrally controlled stream of revenue, such as oil revenue, can exacerbate an undemocratic ruler or governing elite’s abuses and misrule by providing the financial wherewithal to entrench and enrich itself without any corresponding accountability. These problems are clearly present in Saudi Arabia and raise significant risk that MBS is using the PIF to entrench his de facto rule by providing him with direct access and control to nearly a trillion dollars of Saudi Arabia’s wealth, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch did not find evidence that PIF-funded projects advanced the government’s obligations to fulfill economic, social, and cultural rights of its people. The Saudi government does not define or disclose basic data on poverty, or set a poverty line, making it likely that the poverty rate is much higher than the UN figure, especially affecting groups that are economically marginalized and vulnerable to systematic labor abuses. PIF investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in the world have been used as a tool of Saudi soft power and influence. These investments include sports such as the LIV golf tour, the FIFA 2034 World Cup, and Premier League football club Newcastle United, in the UK, are a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s influence operations abroad. These investments which seek to garner uncritical foreign support for MBS’s agenda, spread disinformation about the country’s rights record, neutralize scrutiny, silence critics, and undermine institutions seeking transparency and accountability, Human Rights Watch found. As a state entity, the PIF has an obligation to uphold Saudi Arabia’s international human rights commitments. Businesses have a responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to human rights harm. In line with these responsibilities, businesses should conduct thorough and independent human rights due diligence prior to any engagement with the PIF and should refrain from activities that would bolster the reputation of government entities or officials recently and credibly accused of serious abuses. When serious adverse human rights impacts stemming from engagement with the PIF are unavoidable, businesses should suspend their engagement with the PIF. 'Businesses with ties to the Saudi Public Investment Fund have a responsibility to end their engagement with it if serious human rights violations connected with the PIF are unavoidable,' Shea said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-22T16:31:12-08:00	
US House Of Representatives Approves Legislation Threatening Nonp...	On Thursday, the United States House of Representatives approved legislation that would threaten nonprofit organizations’ exercise of free speech rights. The legislation would accomplish this goal by empowering the US government to selectively clamp down on nonprofits to an extent that targeted organizations may cease to exist. This is all being done in the name of countering terrorism, a trusty standby excuse for the US government exercising authoritarian powers. The House approved the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act (HR 9495) by a vote of 219 to 184. The 'yes' votes came mainly from Republican members, and all the 'no' votes were from Democrats plus Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, an Advisory Board member for the Ron Paul Institute. J.D. Tuccille provided an informative critique of HR 9495 in a Friday Reason article. The bill, explained Tuccille, 'allows for the ‘termination of tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations.’' Continuing, Tuccille wrote: The designation of organizations as such is left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, based on that official’s judgment that a non-profit group has, in the last three years, provided ‘material support or resources’ to what the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization. The language provides for a 90-day window during which time supposed ‘terrorist supporting organizations’ can appeal the designation, but the burden is on them to prove that they’re not guilty. This turns due process on its head. The threat from this new bureaucratic power is extreme for targeted organizations. As Tuccille puts it in his article, the loss of 'tax -exempt status' is essentially a death penalty for most non-profit organizations.' What a censorship power this legislation hands over to the executive branch bureaucracy. Nonprofit organizations whose activities challenge the ambitions of the US government and connected individuals, businesses, and organizations, can be snuffed out. Meanwhile, other organizations will have a big incentive to limit their own speech to avoid being similarly targeted for destruction. During the House floor debate on HR 9495, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) presented a brief, persuasive speech against the bill. Here is the text of his speech: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 9495. As Members of Congress, it is our duty to stand against terrorism and stand up for our common values, but this bill does neither.What does it do?What it does is grant sweeping draconian powers to the executive branch to essentially shut down any nonprofit.On what basis would future administrations, Democratic or Republican, be able to exercise such power?On a mere accusation.I repeat, an accusation.All nonprofits could be under scrutiny. These are decent people who are advocating on issues from religious freedom to animal welfare.Mr. Speaker, why would conservatives, the very same people who gnashed their teeth at executive overreach, support such a measure?Why would they suddenly about-face and sacrifice the values they claim to stand for?It is because this is a gift to the President-elect, Mr. Trump, wrapped up in a bow right before the holidays.On the campaign trail, he has made no secret of who he would seek to go after. This is bigger than the President-elect because now every President who would be king would be free to seek vengeance on their political opponents for every perceived slight.I caution my colleagues to consider how far-reaching the consequences of this bill would be. This bill would apply to all future Presidents.At a time when we should be strengthening our checks and balances and shoring up our guardrails, this legislation would do the opposite.Mr. Speaker, in the strongest possible terms, I urge my colleagues to vote against this executive branch power grab. This legislative threat to nonprofit organizations and their free speech can be expected to be rejected by the Democratic controlled Senate and President Joe Biden. But, it will likely be back for another go-round under more amenable conditions come January when the House, Senate, and presidency are all in Republican control.

Putin’s Order To Promote Patriotism Repeats Stalin’s ‘Almost Word...	Vladimir Putin’s May 2024 directive to use history lessons in the schools to boost patriotism and a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for Russia repeats Stalin’s May 1934 order to do the same thing in the Soviet Union 'almost word for word,' according to Boris Kerzhentsev. The historian and commentator traces the evolution of Kremlin policy toward history and its use as a propaganda tool in the first decades of Soviet power and then says that the changes Putin has introduced are virtually the same (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/16/istoriya-v-zakone-kak-gosudarstvo-ispolzuet-proshloe-dlya-podgotovki-pushechnogo-myasa-a147872). 'Like Stalin, Putin’s ‘ideological front’ is rapidly turning into a real military front, on which people fooled by propaganda are dying senselessly. To be sure, foreign agents are not yet mentioned in the text of Putin’s ‘Foundations,’ but this is most likely a matter of time,' Kerzhentsev says. Indeed, he continues, 'some propagandists are already close to, as before, demanding from a high rostrum that ‘rootless cosmopolitans’ be shot ‘like mad dogs,’' as Stalin’s notorious prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky did. And thus one must conclude that despite everything, 'for almost a century, nothing has changed in Russia.' 'Using its unlimited resources of violence, control and coercion, the government constantly steals the country's truth about the past, composes its own alternative version of history, and declares it the only true one. And it does so not for the love of writing, but purely for the sake of ensuring the self-preservation of the regime,' Kerzhentsev concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-22T16:26:43-08:00	
What Kennedy Must Do To Defeat Regulatory Capture – OpEd	President-Elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is cause for celebration for anyone who cares about the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over regulatory agencies, and the deleterious effect it has had on the health of Americans. It is nearly impossible to express just how remarkable and potentially world-changing this is. Only a few years ago, it would have been beyond the imagination of any serious political commentator. Those of us who believe in the freedom of medical choice – and especially those who have been personally harmed by the industry – have every reason to be ecstatic. But even if Kennedy is confirmed, and even if he manages to implement his ideas, will they be enough to bring about real, lasting, change? One of Kennedy’s primary targets will be the regulatory capture that practically defines the pharmaceutical industry and the agencies tasked with overseeing it. He has spent decades tirelessly battling this particular beast, and has recently articulated a number of specific policy ideas aimed at rooting out the 'corruption' that characterizes the regulatory agencies as well as the world of medical research. But is that even possible? In order to answer this question, we need to examine the nature of the regulatory state itself. The Regulatory State There is nothing new about private commercial interests seeking to use government force to subvert the free market to their advantage – and to the disadvantage of everyone else. The medical and pharmaceutical industries are hardly unique in this regard. Generally, interest groups, or individual corporations, do this by convincing politicians to erect barriers – in the form of laws and regulations – to those who would compete with them. Much has been written about the extent to which the regulation of business sprang, not from a desire to protect consumers, but rather from the desire on the part of a few businesses to secure for themselves an environment in which they are insulated from competition. In their 1993 paper, 'The Protectionist Roots of Antitrust,' for example, Don Boudreaux and Tom DiLorenzo look at some specific examples of business interests lobbying government to enact antitrust legislation that would stifle their competition. They write: '(F)or over a century the antitrust laws have routinely been used to thwart competition by providing a vehicle for uncompetitive businesses to sue their competitors for cutting prices, innovating new products and processes, and expanding output. This paper has argued that, moreover, antitrust was a protectionist institution from the very beginning; there never was a ‘golden age of antitrust’ besieged by rampant cartelization, as the standard account of the origins of antitrust attests.' The world of health care as we know it today in America is the result of similar efforts by some practitioners and professional associations to defeat their competitors, not by outperforming them in the marketplace, but by enacting laws to limit their ability to practice. Most notorious among these efforts was the 1910 Flexner Report. Commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation, the Report recommended closing down the vast majority of medical schools; streamlining medical education to exclude non-allopathic modalities (and mostly eliminating medical schools for women and African Americans); giving state governments the power to approve medical schools; and dramatically tightening medical licensing restrictions. In fact, the Flexner Report was, for the most part, an unpublished 1906 reportwritten by the American Medical Association (AMA). At the time, the AMA made no secret about its motives in seeking the reforms to which Abraham Flexner lent his name. It sought to reduce the supply of physicians in order to further enrich its own members. In 1847, the Association’s committee on educational standards reported that: 'The very large number of physicians in the United States…has frequently been the subject of remark. To relieve the diseases of something more than twenty millions of people, we have an army of Doctors amounting by a recent computation to forty thousand, which allows one to about every five hundred inhabitants…No wonder, then, that the profession of medicine has measurably ceased to occupy the elevated position which once it did; no wonder that the merest pittance in the way of remuneration is scantily doled out even to the most industrious in our ranks…' The very history of the regulatory state informs us that it was not implemented for the purpose of protecting consumers from powerful corporate interests, but to protect the interests of certain powerful corporations and groups of professionals. It is important to remember this when we hear critics bemoan the 'corruption' in the regulatory agencies, and insist that this can be remedied if we just put the right people in charge of them. No. 'Corruption' is the primordial swamp from which these agencies emerged. It is in their DNA. It is, in fact, their very reason for being. There is no 'reforming' that which is operating precisely as it was designed to operate. Moreover, even if these agencies had been designed with the interests of the public in mind (and never mind that 'the public' is not a single entity with uniform interests to begin with), the reality remains that there is no mechanism by which they can be made accountable to us. Accountability between two parties can only come when each party has choice regarding whether or not they interact with the other. This is not the case with regulatory agencies. These are imposed upon us. We are forced to use their 'services' whether we are happy with them or not; whether they do a good job or not; whether they make our lives more dangerous than they otherwise would be or not. No matter how badly regulatory agencies perform, we are not free to take our business elsewhere. The FDA What this means is that – just as with all other political actors – the leaders of these agencies are removed from the consequences that their actions have on others. In the case of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this has led to decades of malfeasance and error that have cost many, many, lives. Perhaps the most infamous example in recent times is the FDA’s complete failure to protect the public from the painkiller Vioxx. The agency approved the drug in 1999, following which it is believed to have killed as many as 55,000 Americans before being withdrawn in 2004. Significantly, the FDA did not withdraw Vioxx from the market, Merck did that itself. In fact, it appears that the regulatory agency worked to suppress information about the known risks of the drug: 'A Merck memo uncovered in November showed that Merck scientists were aware in 1996 that the drug might contribute to heart problems. Then in 2000, a Merck study found that patients taking Vioxx were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks as patients taking older painkillers. Meanwhile, mid-level FDA officials who warned of these dangers were shunned by the agency. In FDA parlance, those with a 'point of view' on Vioxx were unwelcome in certain meetings concerning the drug.'' To believe that the Vioxx scandal was an isolated event would be a mistake. Indeed, the history of the agency is littered with similar stories. Worse, it also uses its power to prevent people from having access to treatments that may help them, but that would not be very profitable, or which might otherwise go against the interests of the agency’s industry benefactors. We witnessed this in the extreme during the past few years, when the FDA and the rest of the regulatory establishment waged a war on Covid-19 treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, and even Vitamins C and D. The FDA does not fail to protect the public because it happens to have bad people in its leadership, or because they are 'incompetent.' It fails to protect us because it has no incentive to do so. We are captive 'customers.' We cannot take our money elsewhere. The leadership at the FDA has no tangible reason to care about our interests. And there is no amount of 'draining the swamp' that can change this. What Can Be Done? The only hope, within this kind of system, is to defy the odds – and not insignificantly, to defy the vast sums of industry lobbying money – and get someone into a position of power over the regulatory agencies who has the will to force them to act contrary to their own incentives within the system. That person right now is undoubtedly Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and, should he be confirmed as Secretary of HHS, he will undoubtedly do some good things. But what happens after he is gone? The system itself will not have been changed. The incentives that are in place now will still be in place then. What happens when there is no longer a good person, with good intentions, in a position of some power over these agencies? Should our right to informed consent, for example, rely on our being fortunate enough to have 'good people' in charge of fundamentally unaccountable agencies? Agencies that have the power to withhold potentially life-saving products from the marketplace, while at the same time providing a false sense of security about the dangerous ones they allow? One of the proposals Kennedy has put forward is to reform the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. He writes: 'Pharmaceutical companies pay a fee every time they apply for a new drug approval, and this money makes up about 75% of the budget of the Food and Drug Administration’s drug division. That creates a barrier to entry to smaller firms and puts bureaucrats’ purse strings in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry.' Reforming, or better yet, eliminating, this fee would be a step in the right direction. But it would not change the fundamental nature of the FDA. It would not magically make that agency accountable to the public, nor would it remove the ability of those in the pharmaceutical industry to make other forms of payments to the agency. Even now, the industry has other ways of exerting its influence, including the infamous 'revolving door,' whereby agency officials who do well by a particular drug company while working for the FDA are later rewarded with lucrative positions in that company. And according to an investigative report by Science, post-approval payments in varying forms are also common. Science examined payment records between 2013-2016, and found that: 'Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.' Critics of this kind of industry capture have long called for 'getting money out' of the regulatory structure. But it remains unclear how this might be achieved. Certainly, specific payment channels, such as the Prescription Drug User Fees, can be eliminated or banned. But to imagine that those in the industry would not contrive of other ways to buy influence is not realistic. Just as critically though, even if pharmaceutical companies were somehow prevented from being able to pay off the agencies that regulate them, this would still not render those agencies accountable to the public, or to anyone other than themselves. The only way to 'get money out' of the regulatory state is to stop giving that state favors to sell. It is to eliminate the state’s power to restrict market entry and market participation. These are the political favors that powerful industry interests bid for. If we want to stop that from happening, we need to eliminate those favors. But We Need the Regulatory State to Keep Us Safe! Astonishingly, even after the past four years, there are still a great many people who believe that the regulatory state exists to keep us safe. That it withheld potentially life-saving therapeutics from us, not out of malice or the interests of its corporate cronies, but for our protection. That it worked hard to censor information about these therapeutics, and about the dangers of the experimental product it was promoting, for the same reason. That maybe some mistakes were made during this time, but that really, truly, these agencies are designed to protect us and if we just get the right people in charge, and maybe do a little tinkering with the machinery, they will work as they are supposed to. Again, no. They are working precisely as they are supposed to. But for those who remain unconvinced, for anyone who still believes that existing laws against fraud, malpractice, and other torts are not enough, that we need some sort of government oversight over the medical industry, let’s look a little closer. Economist Milton Friedman famously recommended abolishing both medical licensing and the FDA. He wrote: 'The FDA has done enormous harm to the health of the American public by greatly increasing the costs of pharmaceutical research, thereby reducing the supply of new and effective drugs, and by delaying the approval of such drugs as survive the tortuous FDA process.' Others who have examined the agency’s track record concur that the agency does more harm than good. Nobel laureate George Hitchings, for instance, estimated that the FDA’s five-year delay in introducing the antibiotic Septra to the market resulted in 80,000 deaths in the US. Drug regulation expert Dale Gieringer says that the death toll resulting from the FDA forcibly keeping new medications from the market far outweighs any benefits it may have produced. He writes: 'The benefits of FDA regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5,000 casualties per decade or 10,000 per decade for worst-case scenarios. In comparison…the cost of FDA delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 lives per decade.' Economist Daniel Klein notes that, prior to the FDA’s powers being expanded in 1962, existing tort law did a good job of protecting consumers: 'The FDA was much less powerful before 1962. The historical record—decades of a relatively free market up to 1962—shows that free-market institutions and the tort system succeeded in keeping unsafe drugs to a minimum. The Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy (107 killed) was the worst in those decades. (Thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States.) The economists Sam Peltzman and Dale Gieringer have made the grisly comparison: the victims of Sulfanilamide and other small tragedies prior to 1962 are insignificant compared to the death toll of the post-1962 FDA.' He goes on to compare medical regulation to safety regulation in other industries: 'How is safety assured in other industries? In electronics, manufacturers submit products to Underwriters’ Laboratories, a private organization that grants its safety mark to products that pass its inspection. The process is voluntary: manufacturers may sell without the UL mark. But retailers and distributors usually prefer the products with it. 'Suppose someone proposed a new government agency that forbade manufacturers from making any electronic product until approved by the agency. We would think the proposal to be totalitarian and crazy. But that is the system we have in drugs…' Conclusion As long as regulatory powers exist that allow state entities to restrict entry into markets, and to dictate how producers may participate in those markets, there will always be those who are incentivized to gain access to the levers of that power and use it to further their own ends. Those who have the means to pay for this power will always find ways to do so. What many call 'corruption' is rather the predictable and inevitable outcome of institutions that are, by their very nature, unaccountable to those they purport to serve. The solution is not to get 'better people' in charge of these institutions, nor is it to engage in a never-ending battle to stop participants from following the incentives the system has created for them. The solution is to remove those incentives. The solution is to remove the powers of the regulatory state itself. If Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is confirmed as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he will undoubtedly strike some blows against regulatory capture. Whatever he does in this position can only be an improvement over what we have now, and it is possible that some of his reforms may even endure beyond his own tenure. But he has the chance to do much more. The regulatory state is a Gordian knot, and it is not enough to work at untangling its various components. It needs to be sliced through once and for all. The way to do this is simple: Abolish the FDA, abolish the NIH, abolish the CDC. End all medical licensing and accreditation. Get the government out of health care everywhere. Perhaps this sounds like a political impossibility. And perhaps it is. But until very recently, RFK, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services was a political impossibility. I submit that we do not know what is possible and what is not. Kennedy has an unprecedented opportunity to strike at the root of what makes our healthcare system so dysfunctional: to dismantle the institutions that stifle the production of medicine, distort information about its safety, and suppress alternatives. He has an opportunity to make a profound difference not only for the next four years but for generations to come. We should all hope that he does not waste it.

The Operational And Strategic Genius Of The Kursk Offensive – Ana...	By Dan Cox (FPRI) -- Current analysis of the recent offensive conducted by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of Russia is incomplete at best and misguided at worst. Most of the pundits are focused on speculating whether the recent offensive will anger American politicians, lead to an eventual victory, or halt the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Dealing with the anger of American politicians first, it is unlikely that Ukraine conducted this counteroffensive in a vacuum. American politicians were likely aware of the operation. Dealing with the next question, speculating on whether one operation will 'tip the scales' fits into the American culture of viewing events, wars, and almost everything as a black-and-white or win-lose dichotomy. Finally, the attack on Russia was not intended to halt the main Russian offensive in Pokrovsk. At most, this attack was aimed at drawing troops from the Russian attack on Kharkiv, which, being one of the largest population centers in Ukraine, would represent a major loss for Ukraine, should it fall into Russian hands. Instead of entering this American cultural quagmire, this essay examines the situation by looking at the Kursk campaign holistically and through the intersection of military operations and strategy. This intersection is often referred to as the area where operational art occurs. By examining the Kursk offensive holistically, this approach does not fall into the rut of determining winners and losers. Instead, myriad potential opportunities and pitfalls can be examined simultaneously. The evidence shows a great deal of cleverness and foresight in developing the Kursk battle plan. The West should support this new propensity in the system as it puts Vladimir Putin and his military planning staff on the horns of multiple dilemmas. A Brief Analysis of the Kursk Campaign So Far One of the best analyses of the Kursk campaign comes from Foreign Policy Magazine. However, the debate is emblematic of the narrowness and black-and-white construct of argumentation over the Ukrainian military campaign. This debate between two Foreign Policy Magazine columnists produces some curious insights into the Kursk offensive. Emma Ashford took the con side of the debate, arguing that it was unlikely that Ukrainian forces could hold what they had taken. She painted the operation as producing, at best, a short-term narrative shift in Zelensky’s favor. She concluded that the offensive is not likely to produce lasting positive results; although, she admits later in the debate that Putin has at least temporarily lost the claim of freezing the conflict and easily controlling what they have already taken in Ukraine. Matt Kroenig countered by noting that the offensive accomplished several key strategic aims, such as taking the war home to Russia (hundreds of thousands of Russians had to be evacuated), challenging Putin as a wartime leader, buoying Ukrainian morale, and shocking the West. The narrative of 'shocking the West' is common in analyzing the Kursk offensive and is dubious. It is doubtful that NATO military planners had no idea of this offensive. Whether or not Ukraine directly informed the US and other Western policymakers, the level of coordination between Ukrainian and Western military planners makes it likely that Ukraine’s partners were able to infer an impending operation. This assertion may prove untrue in the future, but that would only point to deeper strategic problems between the West and Ukraine. It is not the case that any of the assertions are necessarily wrong. The main complaint is that they are incomplete and largely reside in narrow strategic and political arguments and assertions. Other standard refrains in the analysis so far are that this operation was a gamble for Ukraine and the offensive was ineffective at stopping the Russians’ forward progression in eastern Ukraine. Few military operations are a true gamble despite current assertions to the contrary. Military planning revolves around assumptions and risk. The main risk in this mission is that the assumptions are wrong. I would posit that the most likely assumptions that preceded this operation have, so far, proven to be correct. Likely Assumptions and Risks in the Kursk Campaign The first set of assumptions had to be that Putin’s military had no strategic reserve and was so desperately trying to win in Ukraine that Russia had devoted little or no attention to defending the Russo–Ukrainian border from the Russian-controlled Donbas Region to the border of Belarus. The ease with which fifteen thousand soldiers were able to take land in Kursk supports such assumptions on the ground. A little over a few divisions’ worth of Ukrainian forces expanded past the initial incursion of a few hundred square kilometers to more than double that area in just a few weeks. The Ukrainian planners also likely assumed that they could make it far enough into Russian territory to threaten logistical lines and necessary electrical and gas hubs supplying troops in Ukraine. Since Ukrainian forces have been able to destroy several critical Russian bridges that resupply its troops and an oil depot, this assumption has borne fruit as well. The planners must have also assumed it was better to use fifteen thousand troops to advance into Russia and build defensive positions than to hold positions that would likely be overrun. Therefore, fifteen thousand Ukrainians could potentially hold out against a force five times that size or larger in Russia depending on whether the force sent to dislodge is ill-trained and ill-equipped conscripts. Putin ordered thirty thousand soldiers from eastern Ukraine to march to the Kursk region to defend it, and he has also apparently thrown some eight thousand against the Ukrainian incursion. This represents a significant expansion of war and a de facto admission of Russia’s limited ability to generate labor. Eventually, the Russian offensive in Donetsk might be put at risk because of the Kursk campaign, even though this was not the main point of invading Russia. Finally, the Ukrainian military and political leaders assessed that an invasion of Kursk would change the narrative in their favor. Further, this would place Putin at a strategic disadvantage and expose fundamental weaknesses in Russia continuing the war. The discussion below points to these assumptions also being true. Placing Putin on the Horns of Multiple Dilemmas The Kursk offensive exposed many deficiencies and vulnerabilities in the Russian offensive as the war approached the third-year mark. Unfortunately, some pundits and news outlets prefer to view the Kursk offensive as a gamble or even a failure. France 24 recently reported that Russia is making gains in eastern Ukraine despite the Kursk action. The news outlet also reported that Ukrainian planners had hoped to draw Russian troops away from this offensive, but it did not happen. This is factually incorrect and an overly narrow view of the Kursk offensive. It is factually incorrect to assert there was no effect on the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia redeployed thirty thousand troops to stop the advancement of the Ukrainian forces into Russia. Whether this puts the Russian offensive at risk remains to be seen, but it does not matter as much as some think. The move illustrates to the world that Putin has no strategic reserve to put into the fight and is likely desperate. Further, arguing that delaying the Russian offensive was the only operational objective is short-sighted. The fact that Russia is pressing on with its offensive may counterintuitively be good for the Ukrainian war effort. Russia continues to take unsustainable losses, and the Kursk offensive has accelerated that trend. They have already taken an additional 6,600 casualties and lost 70 tanks because the Ukrainian military infiltrated Russia. Putin panicked and made yet another strategic mistake by telling his own people that the Ukrainian forces would be dislodged from Kursk by October 1 of this year. By early November, Putin had finally garnered a force to attack the Kursk oblast. However, the ground retaken is negligible and the losses the Russians are suffering are great. Putin is desperate. Every day beyond October 1 that the Ukrainian forces remain in Russia, Putin is losing political credibility. Further, this is the second summer in a row that Putin has faced a major credibility challenge. Last summer, the leader of the Wagner Group private military organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, mounted an insurgency that briefly marched toward Moscow. This summer, Ukrainian forces successfully invaded Russia in the historic Kursk region. To add insult to injury, the Ukrainian success in Russia came mere months after Putin gave a speech commemorating the Russian sacrifices during World War II in Kursk. The Kursk offensive has also increased the Ukrainian military’s operational reach. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed some key supply bridges supporting Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have also been able to destroy fuel depots, particularly oil, deeper into Russia, threatening both the Russian economy and the ability of Russia to continue to supply its mechanized units. Ukraine has also been able to hit an oil refinery and a power station deeper into Russia. The loss of the refinery could seriously damage oil exports, which are already lagging due to economic sanctions imposed by the West. Putin is also suffering from a foreign policy and narrative perspective. Several pundits have noted that Putin seems to be losing allied support as Ukraine demonstrates its ability to compete with Russia in Ukraine and, shockingly, take Russian territory. Putin cannot carpet-bomb Ukrainian positions now that they are on Russian soil. Further, even though Putin diverted thirty thousand troops in an attempt to repel the Kursk incursion, their move will likely be insufficient for the task. The recent addition of some ten to twelve thousand North Korean troops to the Russian counter-offensive may tilt the odds a bit in Russia’s favor, but also telegraphs Russia’s lack of a strategic reserve and was the catalyst for Western countries to allow Ukraine to use their weapons to strike inside Russia. Now, Putin is facing a dilemma that he may have to throw poorly trained conscripts at the situation. He promised he would not do this; many of these conscripts are ethnically Russian, so their deaths carry more negative political weight for Putin, who cannot afford a collapse in support for his war among ethnic Russians. All of these negative strategic dilemmas are now on Putin’s shoulders. Further, he now has to consider that a long border between the Donbas region, which Russia controls, and Belarus is now at risk. He can hardly respond to the Kursk incursion. Another incursion at a different point along the border would be devastating. Pundits reporting that the Kursk offensive has failed because Putin continues a costly advance at a snail’s pace in eastern Ukraine are short-sighted. Recent polls show that trust in Putin has fallen precipitously in the wake of the Kursk offensive. Putin might find himself in political trouble because the planners of the Ukrainian offensive successfully linked operations to strategic ends, placing Putin on the horns of multiple dilemmas.

Putin Warns Of More Combat Tests For New Missile After Ukraine St...	(RFE/RL) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, a nuclear-capable weapon, will continue to be tested, including in combat conditions, as Moscow struck several Ukrainian regions with other, less powerful weapons. 'We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and the nature of the security threats that are created for Russia,' Putin said on November 22 at a meeting with Defense Ministry officials and military-industrial complex officials. The Kremlin leader also called for serial production of the large missile to begin. Russia launched the so-called Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine on November 21 in a strike targeting the city of Dnipro. Putin said at the time it was part of Moscow's response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil with U.S.-supplied ATACMS and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The use of the Oreshnik 'is first and foremost a messaging and saber rattling kind of weapon. This is the sort of delivery system that's not cheap. It's not a battlefield sort of weapon,' Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told RFE/RL. Putin added on November 22 that the Oreshnik is new and not an upgrade of previous Soviet-designed weaponry. The United States said the new missile is 'experimental' and based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ukraine initially accused Russia of having used an ICBM in the Dnipro attack. An ICBM has never been used in a war. Strategic Weapons Russia has been striking Ukraine with Iskanders, ground-launched, short-range ballistic missiles, and Kinzhals, air-launched, intermediate-range ballistic missiles, as well as various cruise missiles. Russia probably only has several units of the Oreshnik in stock, a U.S. official told media following the November 21 strike. Ukraine's military intelligence put the figure at up to 10 units.If Russia were to move forward with serial production of the Oreshnik, it would be for its nuclear force posture and not for use in a conventional war like the one with Ukraine, Karako said. 'This is not an alternative to a cruise missile. It's probably designed for strategic weapons,' he said. Zelenskiy's Response In his November 21 address to the nation announcing the use of the Oreshnik, Putin said that the missile traveled at a speed of Mach 10, or 2.5-3 kilometers per second, claiming that 'there are currently no ways of counteracting this weapon.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on November 22 that Ukraine was working on developing new types of air defenses to counter 'new risks,' a reference to missiles like the Oreshnik. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said testing a new weapon for the purposes of terror in another country was an 'international crime' and called for a worldwide 'serious response' to keep Russia from expanding the war. 'When someone starts using other countries not only for terror, but also for testing their new missiles through acts of terror, then this is clearly an international crime.' A lack of air defenses has been one of Ukraine's major weak spots in the 33-month war with Ukraine. Zelenskiy has called on the West to deliver more air defense systems since the first days of the invasion. He had also called on the West to ease restrictions preventing Ukraine from striking inside Russia with powerful long-range weapons. Zelenskiy said the deep strikes were necessary to target airfields critical for Russia's daily aerial attacks. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly lifted the restrictions on November 17 with Ukraine using their long-range weapons -- ATACMS and Storm Shadow respectively -- to hit targets in Russia's regions of Belgorod and Kursk. Putin launched the Oreshnik into Ukraine to warn the West against arming Ukraine. Parliament Session Canceled Russia did not use the Oreshnik to strike Ukraine during another deadly air attack on November 22. Two people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian strikes on Sumy, Artem Kobzar, the mayor of the northeastern Ukrainian city, reported in a video statement on Telegram. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russian drone attacks were under way in four regions -- Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Zhytomyr. In the capital, which has been on edge for several days amid intense Russian attacks on Ukraine, lawmakers were advised to avoid the government district on November 22 and parliament canceled a scheduled session due to warnings of a potential missile strike. 'We were informed about the risk of a missile strike on the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv in the coming days. Putin has significantly raised the stakes. Tomorrow's parliamentary session is canceled,' lawmaker Taras Batenko said. Oleksiy Honcharenko, another lawmaker, said on Telegram that the next session was now planned for December, although parliament leaders have not officially commented on the warnings. Zelenskiy's office assured the public that the presidential administration would continue operating 'as usual' on November 22.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuU3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-22T15:42:37-08:00	
Myanmar: Rebels Capture Town On Main Road To Chinese-Built Port	Insurgents in western Myanmar have captured a town on a road junction leading to a Chinese-funded deep sea port, which is bound to raise new concern about the fate of an extensive development that includes energy pipelines running from the coast to southern China. The Myanmar junta that seized power in a 2021 coup has in recent weeks been reinforcing its defenses at the Kyaukpyu economic zone on the coast of Rakhine state, where China is building a port and energy facilities, including its cross-country natural gas and oil pipelines. Insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), which is fighting for self-determination in Rakhine state, have made significant advances against the military over the past year, leaving junta forces confined to ever smaller pockets of territory, including Kyaukpyu. On Wednesday, AA fighters captured the town of Toungup, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Kyaukpyu on the main road links to central and southern parts of the country, after nearly a month of fighting. 'The AA has captured Toungup town and surrounding battalion bases,' a resident of the town, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals, told Radio Free Asia. 'In the city, the soldiers deserted and the AA is evacuating residents,' said the resident. Junta forces were attacking Toungup with aircraft and artillery and some houses were ablaze, residents said. Residents had no information about casualties. RFA tried to contact both the junta’s spokesperson in Rakhine state, Hla Thein, and the AA spokesperson, Khaing Thukha, to ask about the situation but neither responded by the time of publication. The AA has dealt the military some of the most devastating setbacks since the 2021 coup, seizing over half of state’s townships, naval and military bases and stretches of coast, including foreign development projects. The AA had been fighting for control over Toungup township since Nov. 4. The town was home to the military’s last operational command headquarters in Rakhine state, as well as the headquarters of several battalions, including an engineers battalion. The capture of the town represents the removal of a major obstacle for the AA if it decides to try to capture Kyaukpyu, a hub in China’s Belt and Road network of energy and infrastructure projects. The military has recently been sending reinforcements to Kyaukpyu, insurgent sources and residents said. The AA is also attacking the military in its last important bases in Rakhine state’s Ann and Gwa towns. Of Rakhine state’s 17 townships, the AA has captured 10, in addition to one in neighboring Chin state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuaIpL6WnoxJF	2024-11-22T15:41:04-08:00	
US Weapons Delays Costly For Ukraine Yet Again – Analysis	By Luke Coffey US President Joe Biden last week finally allowed Ukraine to use American-made long-range missiles against targets inside the Russian Federation. In addition, the administration disclosed that, for the first time, the US would provide Kyiv with antipersonnel landmines — something Biden had been reluctant to do because of pressure from within his own party. Make no mistake: both these measures will have a positive impact on the battlefield, especially in the area surrounding Kursk Oblast. But the White House’s delay is concerning. For more than 100 days, Ukrainian soldiers have controlled a piece of Russian territory in this region. Ukraine’s decision to launch operations in Kursk back in August made perfect sense. By holding Russian territory, Ukrainian forces have forced Moscow to divert resources from other sections of the front line to Kursk and created bargaining power for any future negotiations. Furthermore, Ukraine’s success in this operation reminded the world that success is possible when the right weapons and support are provided. The capture of Russian territory also gave a much-needed morale boost to Ukrainians, who have endured slow but steady Russian advances along other parts of the front line. Yet, from the moment Ukraine launched its operation in Kursk, it had been asking for permission to use American-made missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukrainian officials knew that Russian forces were preparing a major counterattack. This threat became even more pressing with the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to help Russia retake the territory Ukraine had captured. Throughout Russia’s buildup in the region, Ukraine was able to pinpoint where troops were staging and where supply points were located. Frustratingly, these targets were out of range for Ukraine’s existing weapons. Until this week, the US was unwilling to approve the use of its systems, fearing such actions might be viewed as escalatory by Moscow. This week’s decision to allow these weapons’ use, along with Washington’s agreement to supply antipersonnel mines to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, highlights a recurring theme: the US delivering aid to Ukraine too little, too late. This pattern has plagued America’s support for Ukraine since the early days of the war in 2022. To give credit where it is due, Biden rushed crucial aid to Ukraine in the early weeks of the conflict, enabling the successful defense of Kyiv and later counteroffensives. But for much of the war, Ukraine’s requests for critical weapons systems have gone unanswered — or have remained unfulfilled until the need became urgent. For example, from the start of the conflict, Ukraine requested the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, which proved to be highly effective. However, it was not until after Mariupol fell to Russian forces in May 2022 that the first HIMARS arrived. That summer, Ukraine repeatedly sought Patriot air defense systems to protect its skies. The US did not approve their transfer until Russia escalated airstrikes in October and November of that year. Even then, it took months to train Ukrainian forces to operate them, leaving the country vulnerable throughout the winter. Other delays affected the provision of cluster munitions, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and the long-range ATACMS missiles. While the US eventually authorized all these systems, its indecision cost Ukraine dearly, forcing it to respond reactively instead of proactively. So, how does Biden’s recent announcement affect Ukraine’s prospects in the war? Had these weapons been approved sooner, they could have disrupted some of Russia’s progress along the front lines. Now, their impact will likely be limited to the ongoing fighting around Kursk Oblast. Some critics argue that the timing is irresponsible, considering Biden is now a lame-duck president who will hand over power to Donald Trump in January. On the contrary, Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets actually strengthens Trump’s position in potential peace talks. These weapons give Trump an additional bargaining chip to pressure Moscow — a tool he would not otherwise have had. The White House’s delays in providing key military equipment is one reason why many Ukrainians are open to the idea of a Trump presidency. Few deny that Trump sincerely wants to end the war, though many are unsure how he intends to accomplish this. Ukrainians have grown increasingly frustrated with the current administration’s approach: providing just enough support to give the appearance of action, but not enough to ensure success. The delay in allowing Ukrainians to strike inside Russia is only the latest example of this hesitancy. This frustration has led some Ukrainians to consider gambling on Trump. Speculation even suggests that Trump, during his recent meeting with Biden, influenced the timing of this policy shift. While unconfirmed, it seems unlikely that the two leaders met without discussing Ukraine, one of the most pressing foreign policy challenges facing the US. If Trump is serious about bringing all sides to the negotiating table, his top priority should be getting Ukraine into a position of strength. Allowing Ukraine to target Russian command and control centers while disrupting supply chains is a critical first step. These actions could tilt the balance of power, paving the way for meaningful negotiations. The US’ reluctance to act decisively has undoubtedly prolonged the war and increased its costs. While the latest decision comes late, it still holds the potential to shape the outcome of the current battle in Kursk in a positive way. The lesson from this war is clear: timely aid can mean the difference between stalemate and success. The latest announcement, though overdue, underscores the importance of providing Ukraine with the tools it needs in a timely manner and not months after the fact.

Brazil: Bolsonaro Indicted By Federal Police For Coup Attempt	By Alex Rodrigues Brazil’s Federal Police have concluded their investigation into a criminal organization allegedly working to prevent President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin from assuming office in 2022, following the defeat of then-President Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential elections. In a statement released on Thursday (Nov. 21), the Federal Police confirmed that the final investigation report had been sent to the Supreme Court. Among the 37 individuals indicted for crimes including violent abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law, coup d'état, and criminal organization are former President Jair Bolsonaro; ex-Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; federal representative Alexandre Ramagem (Liberal Party) and former director of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin); former Justice Minister Anderson Torres; ex-Institutional Security Cabinet Minister Augusto Heleno; Army Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide; Liberal Party president Valdemar Costa Neto; and former President’s Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Walter Souza Braga Netto. According to the Federal Police, the evidence against the individuals indicted was gathered over nearly two years through a range of investigative measures. These included telematics, telephone, banking, and tax record analysis, plea bargains, search and seizure operations, and other actions authorized by the Judiciary. The investigations revealed that the individuals involved were organized into distinct groups, each with specific responsibilities, including the Disinformation and Electoral System Attack Cell; the Military Incitement Cell; the Legal Cell; the Operational Cell Supporting Coup Activities; the Parallel Intelligence Cell; and the Operational Cell for Executing Coercive Measures. 'With the submission of the report [to the Supreme Court], the Federal Police are concluding their investigation into the attempted coup d'état and the violent overthrow of Democratic Rule of Law,' stated the police.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuudBdUR0M3bl9	2024-11-22T15:36:27-08:00	
Russia: Pentecostal Pastor, Buddhist In Pre-Trial Detention For A...	By Victoria Arnold A Pentecostal pastor has become the first person to be accused of publicly calling for actions 'against state security' for speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine from a religious perspective. Nikolay Romanyuk, senior presbyter of Holy Trinity Church in the Moscow Region town of Balashikha, gave a sermon in September 2022 in which he explicitly stated that believers should not go to fight in Ukraine 'on the basis of Holy Scripture'. If convicted, Pastor Romanyuk could face up to 6 years' imprisonment or a fine of up to 1 million Roubles (7 months' average Moscow wage) (see below). Investigators arrested Pastor Romanyuk after early-morning armed raids on his home and those of several other church members on 18 October 2024. Two days later, a court ruled that he should be detained for two months. He is currently being held in Investigation Prison No. 11 in Noginsk, 50 kms (30 miles) east of Moscow (see below). Because the sermon was livestreamed and then uploaded to the church's YouTube channel, Pastor Romanyuk is under investigation under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V – 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet' (see below). It remains unclear which investigative agencies carried out the raids on church members' home and initiated the criminal case against Pastor Romanyuk. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the Federal Security Service (FSB). Forum 18 asked in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 has received no response (see below). While Pastor Romanyuk is the first religious figure to be charged under Criminal Code Article 280.4, small numbers of Russians who oppose the war on religious grounds continue to face prosecution under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'), Criminal Code Article 280.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] maintain international peace and security'), and Criminal Code Article 207.3 (dissemination of 'false information' about the Armed Forces). Ilya Vasilyev, founder and director of the Moscow Zen Centre, is due to go on trial soon on charges of spreading 'knowingly false information' about the Russian Armed Forces 'on grounds of hatred or enmity' (Criminal Code Article 207.3, Part 2, Paragraph D). He is being prosecuted for an English-language Facebook post about Russian rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities. He made the post – and others for which he was previously prosecuted under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 – 'solely out of religious conviction', his lawyer told Forum 18. If convicted, Vasilyev could be imprisoned for 5 to 10 years or be fined 3 million to 5 million Roubles (see below). Vasilyev has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina Investigation Prison (see below). At a court hearing on 19 November 2024, where the judge extended Vasilyev's period in custody by six months, Vasilyev noted the difficulties of carrying out Buddhist rituals in the detention centre, but said in a message to supporters that he continues to meditate twice a week (see below). On 12 November, a court in Moscow fined Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 5 days' average Moscow wage under Article 20.3.3 for accusing President Vladimir Putin and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill of murdering civilians in Ukraine. During his conversation with his church's pro-war priest, Sevastyanenko stated: 'Thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house' (see below). Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 received no response (see below). Charges and punishments President Vladimir Putin signed Criminal Code Article 280.4 into law on 14 July 2022. This was one of several new criminal offences designed to discourage and punish criticism of the authorities in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Part 1 punishes 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation' with the following possible penalties:– a fine of 100,000 to 500,000 Roubles;– 2 to 4 years' imprisonment, with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years. Part 2 covers the same offence when committed 'a) by a group of persons by prior conspiracy; b) by a person using their official position; v) using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet; g) for selfish motives or for hire; or d) motivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or motivated by hatred or enmity towards any social group', and carries the following punishments: – a fine of 300,000 to 1 million Roubles; – 3 to 6 years' imprisonment with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to 5 years and with or without restriction of freedom for a period of 6 months to 2 years; On 4 March 2022, specific Criminal Code and Administrative Code penalties for 'discrediting' the Russian Armed Forces came into force, alongside criminal penalties for spreading 'false information' about the Armed Forces' actions (Criminal Code Article 207.3). Some of the punishments were increased on 28 March 2023. Although the government introduced Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 and the associated Criminal Code Article 280.3 on 4 March 2022 in order to punish 'discreditation' of the Armed Forces, amendments to the law on 25 March 2022 expanded the definition of this offence to include 'discreditation' of 'the execution by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers for the specified purposes', ie. protecting Russian interests and 'maintaining international peace and security'. The government has used a range of tactics to pressure religious leaders into supporting the renewed invasion of Ukraine. These tactics include warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. Similar warnings and prosecutions have been used against many Russians who express opposition to the war for any reason. Since February 2022, courts have on criminal charges jailed two and fined three for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine on religious grounds. Another, independent Christian preacher from the Urals Eduard Charov, is under restrictions at home awaiting criminal trial on charges of repeatedly 'discrediting' the Russian armed forces and state bodies. Investigators have also opened three criminal cases against people who have left Russia. Many others have received administrative fines. The government has blocked websites that oppose the war on religious grounds, and those that report on the impact of the war on people and places of worship in Ukraine. It has also blocked websites of Ukrainian religious organisations. Romanyuk: 'Activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation' On 25 September 2022, at the first Sunday service after President Vladimir Putin announced the 'partial mobilisation' of Russian army reservists, Pastor Nikolay Nikolayevich Romanyuk (born 15 August 1962) gave a sermon at the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church in Balashikha, calling on fellow believers not to take part in the war in Ukraine. Like other worship services at the church, the event was livestreamed on the church's YouTube channel and the recording was subsequently made available on YouTube and the Russian social network VKontakte. In October 2024, investigators (it is unclear from which state agency) opened a case against Romanyuk under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V ('Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet'). Investigators arrested Romanyuk – who studied at a Pentecostal seminary in Kyiv after the collapse of the USSR – on 18 October 2024 after searches of his home and those of other church members. At a closed hearing on 20 October, a judge at Balashikha City Court ordered that he should be kept in custody until 16 December (Romanyuk appealed unsuccessfully against the detention order on 12 November). It is unknown whether Romanyuk has yet been formally charged or when his case is likely to come to trial. The Memorial Human Rights Centre named him a political prisoner on 31 October 2024. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the FSB security service, asking in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Holy Trinity Church, which is a registered religious organisation, has several sister communities located in the outskirts of Moscow and Moscow Region. No other criminal cases appear to have been opened against any other clergy or church members so far. Romanyuk: Simultaneous armed raids Roman Zhukov, another pastor at Holy Trinity Church, described the early morning house raids on his Telegram channel on 24 October 2024. 'The conversation was softer with some, harsher with others,' he noted. He wrote that 'special forces soldiers' arrived at about 6.20 am on 18 October at his family's home, the Romanyuks', and the home of the Repins, another family from the church. Officials also conducted searches at the church itself and 'in Volokolamsk' (the church owns land in Volokolamsk District, where it runs children's camps). At the home of Ilya and Sergey Romanyuk (who are among Nikolay Romanyuk's adult sons), the armed men did not carry out a search but 'broke in and put the guys on the floor, where they lay for 12 hours, one and a half of which they spent in light indoor clothes and barefoot on the ground outside. At gunpoint'. At the other addresses, the troops 'entered with armoured shields, in some cases breaking the door frames; they made the men lie on the floor with their hands behind their heads; [and] seized digital devices and documents, Maksim Repin's bank cards, his mother's pension card, and foreign-travel passports'. Investigators asked Nikolay Romanyuk 'to make some statements on camera', which he refused to do. Investigators then took him away for questioning at about 6pm. 'The entire family has gone through great psychological trauma today, but such searches and arrests in modern Russia are predictable and expected – to our great regret', Ukrainian pastor Vladimir Franchuk, an acquaintance of the Romanyuk family, wrote in a blog post on 20 October 2024. 'One of the main accusations against Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk is that he expressed his disagreement with the bandit-like and cruel war that the Russian Federation is waging on the territory of Ukraine', Franchuk noted. 'Honourable and just people in Russia (believers and non-believers) suffer - and will suffer! - for their position as an honest person, which is deeply and consistently based on Biblical truth and the Christian worldview.' Romanyuk: 'Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate.. This is not our war' The video of Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk's sermon has disappeared from the church's YouTube channel, but several other YouTube channels uploaded copies after the prosecution of Romanyuk became known. (Among these is the channel of Pastor Vyacheslav Boynetsky of the Slavic Christian Church in Salem, Oregon, who posted the sermon under the title 'For this sermon they arrested a pastor'.) Much of the 41-minute video is taken up by Pastor Romanyuk's sermon, during which he says: 'When you are offered a hit, when you are offered a bottle of alcohol or you are given a summons to send you to combat – this is the same sin, and the same drug, and the same Satan.. Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate. And it does not matter which tsar calls for this – [whether] the Ukrainian tsar, the American tsar, or our tsar calls for this. I would like this to be a vaccination, at least in some way. This is not our war.' 'It was written in our doctrine that we are pacifists and cannot participate in this', Romanyuk continues. 'It is our right to profess this on the basis of Holy Scripture. We do not bless those who go there [to war]. [Those] who are taken by force, we do not bless them, but we pray that they are rescued from there. There are different legal ways to do this.' Nikolay Romanyuk is the brother of Vasily Romanyuk, who was pastor of the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church when the Moscow city authorities bulldozed its building as an 'unlawful structure' in 2012, forcing the congregation to split across different locations. Vasily Romanyuk died in 2015. The church managed to find a new site and construct a new building in 2016. Pastor Romanyuk's address in detention is: 142412, g. Noginskul. 1-ya Revsobraniy 17FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 11 UFSIN Rossii po Moskovskoy oblasti Vasilyev: Criminal trial of Buddhist leader The trial of computer programmer and Zen Buddhist Ilya Vladimirovich Vasilyev (born 9 December 1973) on charges of spreading 'false information' about the Russian Armed Forces is due to begin in Moscow on 3 December 2024. It had earlier been twice postponed. He has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Before his prosecution, Vasilyev had been on the point of taking his vows as a monk of the Soto Zen school. He has been director of the Moscow Zen Centre since 2010, and held regular meditation sessions at his home. Investigators opened the case against Vasilyev on 20 June 2024 under Criminal Code Article 207.3 ('Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens [and] maintain international peace and security, or about the exercise by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for those purposes, as well as [knowingly false information] on the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation'), Part 2, Paragraph D ('for reasons of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or for reasons of hatred or enmity against any social group'). Criminal Code Article 207.3 Part 2 carries the following possible punishments: a fine of 3 million to 5 million Roubles; or up to 5 years' assigned work 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'; or 5 to 10 years' imprisonment 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'. According to the Investigative Committee charging decision of 16 October 2024, seen by Forum 18, the case is based on an English-language Facebook post of 25 December 2022: 'Putin rejected Christmas armistice. His rockets are right now shelling peaceful Ukrainian cities and towns. Only yesterday 16 people died in Kherson, where my father's family lives. Or lived? Millions of Ukrainians are now without electricity and water supply'. The Paragraph D charge derives from Vasilyev's alleged motivation of 'political hatred' for 'the current organs of executive and legislative power of the Russian Federation'. Vasilyev made the post, and others on VKontakte which led to an earlier administrative conviction, 'solely out of religious conviction', he told Forum 18 through his lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan on 20 November. He added that he is 'not a politician and is engaged only in religion'. In a message to supporters, posted on the 'Ilya Vasilyev – support group' channel on Telegram on 20 November, Vasilyev wrote: 'It is unacceptable to be persecuted for posting on the internet, but this is happening under the new laws of the Russian Federation. One day the world will be a better place!' Vasilyev added: 'On a brighter note, I am in Moscow. I continue to meditate on Monday and Wednesday evenings. One way to support me – meditate with me on Wednesdays from 18.00 to 18.30 Moscow time. Unite in person and via video link and our practice will help to manifest the good that already exists, both in us and in the world!' Preobrazhensky District Court in Moscow scheduled the first hearing in Vasilyev's case for the 5 November, then for 19 November, but on both occasions Judge Valentina Lebedeva postponed it (in the latter case because Vasilyev was improperly notified of the hearing details). It is now due to take place on 3 December 2024. At the 19 November hearing, the judge extended Vasilyev's period of detention by six months to 24 April 2025 – he has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Vasilyev and his lawyer had requested that he be placed under house arrest instead. They noted that 8 December is the day of Buddha's enlightenment, which Vasilyev had wanted to mark at home. Vasilyev: Earlier fine Ilya Vasilyev appears to have first come to investigative agencies' attention in early 2023, either because of his religious activities or because he had 'ended up on some list of unreliable Russians', as he commented to human rights group OVD-Info on 1 October 2024. The FSB security service examined his profile on the VKontakte social network on 4 February 2023, finding a number of anti-war comments. Police searched Vasilyev's flat on 11 May 2023, seized his phone, tablet computer, and laptop, and took him to a police station. There they charged him under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court fined him 40,000 Roubles (1 week's average Moscow wage) the same day. According to the written protocol detailing the charges, police based this case on three statements in Russian from Vasilyev's VKontakte page (which he used under the name 'Arvi Hacker' ('Arvi Kheker')): 'No to war with Ukraine. Shame on Putin's thugs'; '#notowar'; and 'Russian army – out of Ukraine. Putin – out of the Kremlin! Russia did not choose you as president.' According to OVD-Info's 1 October 2024 account of his prosecution, after the administrative hearing, an investigator tried to question Vasilyev there and then in the court corridor about his activities on Facebook and Twitter. In response, Vasilyev cited Article 51 of the Constitution (according to which nobody is obliged to testify against themselves), then went home and deleted his social media accounts. Investigators had already found, however, two Facebook posts which formed the basis of the case they eventually opened on 20 June 2024 (only one of which they later cited in the indictment). They searched Vasilyev's home and arrested him the same day. Investigators sent the Facebook posts for psychological and linguistic examination by the 'Independent Expert' centre, whose 'expert analyses' have been used by the security services in similar cases against people who have spoken out against the war or otherwise opposed the authorities, including in the conviction of former Yekaterinburg mayor Yevgeny Roizman for 'repeat discreditation' of the Armed Forces. According to OVD-Info, Danila Mikheyev, the founder and sole employee of the 'Independent Expert' centre, was apparently fighting in the Russian army in Ukraine when he supplied the 'expert analysis' of the materials in Vasilyev's case. (Russia's Justice Ministry has conceded that Mikheyev does not have the necessary qualifications for linguistic expert analysis. In July 2024, the Federal Tax Service removed the Independent Expert centre from the Unified Register of Legal Entities as inactive.) Vasilyev's address in detention is: 107076 g. Moskvaul. Matrosskaya Tishina 18FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 1 UFSIN Rossii po g. Moskve Moscow: Another 'discreditation' case On 12 November 2024, Moscow's Basmanny District Court fined 54-year-old Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 30,000 Roubles (5 days' average Moscow wage) under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). His appeal was registered by the lower court on 18 November, but has not yet reached Moscow City Court. According to the written verdict, seen by Forum 18, on 10 November in the grounds of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Life-giving Trinity in Khokhly, Sevastyanenko 'spoke out against the SVO [special military operation] and accused the President of the Russian Federation and the Patriarch of murdering the civilian population in Ukraine .. in this way, [he] committed public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the purposes of defending the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] supporting international peace and security'. Sevastyanenko 'adheres to an anti-war position', his lawyer commented to the 'Ostorozhno, Moskva' Telegram channel on 19 November. 'That day, in the courtyard of the church, he raised this issue in the context of religious commandments'. According to Radio Liberty's Russian Service, he told the church's rector, Fr Andrey Tkachyov, that that support for the war in Ukraine goes against the commandments 'Thou shalt not kill' and 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house'. Sevastyanenko believes a fellow parishioner or a member of church staff then called the police, who detained him for several hours before releasing him with a summons to appear the next day for charging. On 11 November, police lodged a case against him under Article 20.3.3, Part 1 at Basmanny District Court. Judge Anna Rasskazova sent it back the same day, however, as officers had not produced proof of the defendant's identity and had cited the wrong Administrative Code Article on a document in the case materials, according to court documents seen by Forum 18. Police resubmitted the case on 12 November, when the same judge found Sevastyanenko guilty. Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry on 18 November in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Fr Andrey Tkachyov is known for his support of Russia's war in Ukraine. The Moscow Patriarchate sacked and defrocked his predecessor at the Trinity Church, Fr Aleksey Uminsky, in January 2024 over his criticism of its pro-war stance and his refusal to read the 'Prayer for Holy Rus' (Patriarch Kirill added this prayer to the liturgy after the invasion of Ukraine, to be read after the Gospel). The Ecumenical Patriarchate later restored Fr Aleksey's priestly status and he is now serving at a Russian church in Paris (not affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58Auualy6t3vn-8Y	2024-11-22T15:34:23-08:00	
Myanmar’s NUG: A Test Of Ethics And Gender Equality – Analysis	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min The recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen within Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG) highlights critical issues of gender equity, accountability, and ethical governance in the struggle for democracy. Key Takeaways: The NUG’s commitment to gender equality is under scrutiny following sexual harassment allegations against a key representative, revealing gaps in its internal accountability mechanisms. Myanmar’s patriarchal culture and the NUG’s position in an ongoing conflict complicate efforts to address gender-based violence effectively within its ranks. The international community’s support for the NUG should be conditioned on its demonstrated progress in implementing gender equity reforms and accountability measures. Since Myanmar’s 2021 coup, the National Unity Government (NUG) has emerged as a beacon of hope in the struggle for democratic governance, opposing the military junta’s oppression. Tasked with protecting human rights and restoring democratic values, the NUG faces public expectations to uphold high ethical standards, especially as it seeks international recognition as Myanmar’s legitimate government. However, a recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen, the NUG’s representative in India, has cast a shadow over this mission. This incident tests the NUG’s dedication to the principles of gender equity and accountability, questioning its ability to protect vulnerable populations within its ranks. This analysis dives into the context, implications, and necessary steps for reform within the NUG. Background: Gender Inequality in Myanmar Myanmar’s deeply rooted gender inequality is exacerbated by long-standing military rule, where women are often marginalized in both public and private sectors. Despite limited gains, like increased female representation to 16% in the 2020 elections, patriarchal norms still impede women’s involvement in decision making. Furthermore, women in conflict zones face widespread abuse from military personnel, as these areas often see the worst violations against female citizens. The lack of legislative protection against gender-based violence has perpetuated a climate of impunity, deepening the challenges women face in Myanmar. The NUG’s Position on Gender Equity Positioning itself as a progressive force for change, the NUG has touted its commitment to inclusivity and gender equality. With 24% of senior NUG roles held by women and the establishment of the Ministry of Women, Youth, and Children Affairs (MOWCYA), it has demonstrated a historic commitment to women’s representation. However, Khen’s alleged misconduct raises critical questions about whether the NUG’s policies on gender equity are implemented effectively or exist merely as symbolic gestures. The Case of Salai Isaac Khen Salai Isaac Khen, a former advocate for gender equality, allegedly harassed a female secretary who worked at the NUG's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in India. According to reports, the harassment began shortly after her employment started in April 2023, escalating as her requests to resign were initially dismissed. Beyond sexual advances, Khen allegedly assigned personal tasks unrelated to her role, which created a toxic and exploitative work environment. An internal investigation led the NUG’s Policy Central Committee to conclude that Khen’s actions were inappropriate, resulting in his dismissal on August 1st, 2024. The allegations of sexual harassment against Issac Khen cast a stark shadow of hypocrisy, especially given his public image as a prominent advocate for gender rights, human rights, and women’s empowerment. Known for his research and publications on gender-based violence and equality, Khen’s actions sharply contradict his own purported values. However, on October 8, Khen publiclydenied the allegations, claiming that the investigation was flawed and that he was not afforded a fair process. In his public denial, Khen asserted that he was not involved in any actions violating PSHEA’s (Protection from Sexual Harassment, Exploitation, and Abuses) sexual harassment policy. He contended that the investigation team never questioned him about specific allegations, such as inappropriate comments or advances. Khen further claimed that some witnesses gave false testimony, aiming to damage his reputation through social media and false statements. Despite the PSHEA policy permitting an appeal, Khen stated that he was denied this right after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs completed its inquiry, a move that he argues violated procedural fairness. Impact on NUG’s Credibility The allegations against Khen come at a critical juncture for the NUG, which seeks domestic and international legitimacy. This incident risks alienating the NUG’s core supporters, including women and civil society organizations integral to Myanmar’s resistance movements. Also, this erosion of trust underscores the necessity for the NUG to implement robust accountability mechanisms that align with its commitment to human rights. Broader Context of Gender-Based Violence in Myanmar’s Conflict Myanmar’s military has long employed sexual violence as a weapon against women, particularly in ethnic conflict areas. Women’s rights groups report routine abuses by military personnel, with many survivors reluctant to come forward due to cultural stigma and fear of reprisal. Unfortunately, gender-based violence is not limited to the military; some resistance groups have also been implicated in abuses, further challenging the NUG’s moral authority. Resistance forces have also been implicated in cases of abuse, as highlighted by incidents of rape and murder by NUG-linked defense groups. For example, in May 2023, NUG pursued legal action against Aung Min, an NLD official, for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in a Mae Sot safe house for Myanmar dissidents. After the child’s mother, a former teacher involved in Myanmar's Civil Disobedience Movement reported the assault to NUG officials, the NUG collaborated with Thai authorities for the arrest. He was arrested swiftly by the Ministry of Home Affairs, reportedly escaped detention, and has not been found since. While the victim and her mother have been relocated for safety, public frustration over delayed action has escalated, with advocates urging NUG accountability and justice for the victim. Another disturbing incident in Chaung-U Township, Sagaing Region, highlights the urgent need for the NUG to address sexual violence within its forces. In August 2022, NUG-linked resistance fighters executed seven civilians, including three underage girls who were raped before being killed. While the NUG has acknowledged the unlawful killings, it has failed to address the horrific sexual violence perpetrated by its own forces. And other abuse cases have also emerged, such as a Rohingya woman who fled to Bangladesh and was raped by Arakan Army (AA) soldiers, while they killed her husband. Such cases illustrate a disturbing normalization of violence, where even revolutionary factions adopt brutal tactics historically associated with the junta. Cultural and Social Barriers In Myanmar, patriarchal traditions often pressure women to endure harassment silently, discouraging them from reporting abuses due to societal stigma. Women face severe criticism and victim-blaming, especially in cases of sexual violence, with expectations of obedience to cultural norms that view them as protectors of family honor. This cultural backdrop further complicates the NUG’s challenge in implementing gender-equitable policies, as deep-rooted biases continue to discourage victims from speaking out. Policy Gaps and the Need for Reform While the NUG has taken some initial steps to address gender-based violence through the PSHEA policy, Khen’s case reveals severe gaps in enforcement. Women’s organizations have called for independent investigative bodies to handle harassment cases within the NUG transparently and effectively. Establishing credible processes for reporting, investigating, and addressing abuse allegations will demonstrate the NUG’s commitment to a gender-responsive government structure, restoring public confidence in its ethical integrity. Moving Forward To rebuild its credibility and affirm its commitment to gender equality, Myanmar’s NUG should implement critical reforms. First, precise reporting mechanisms should be established, enabling victims to report harassment confidentially without fear of retaliation. Next, enforce accountability through strict disciplinary actions against offenders at all levels, demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy toward gender-based violence. Additionally, mandatory gender sensitivity training should be introduced to promote respectful workplace conduct and prevent future incidents. Finally, collaborate with women’s rights organizations to create safe environments for women and include their perspectives in policy-making, ensuring their voices are genuinely represented. Role of the International Community Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar have led to a rise in gender-based violence, especially affecting displaced women and girls. While Ukraine's developed infrastructure and international support allow for comprehensive support systems for victims, including crisis hotlines, shelters, and counseling services, Myanmar's NUG faces limitations in providing adequate care. NUG should learn from Ukraine's approach and strengthen international collaborations to improve its response. The international community, including governments and NGOs that support the NUG, can play a vital role in promoting these reforms. International humanitarian agencies should condition financial aid and diplomacy on the NUG’s demonstrated progress toward gender equity, reinforcing the importance of human rights within the government-in-exile. Such conditions would compel the NUG to take meaningful action, ensuring its policies are not merely rhetorical. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for the NUG’s Commitment to Gender Equity The sexual harassment case within the NUG is a pivotal moment in Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, demanding transparency, accountability, and tangible reforms from the NUG. Addressing this incident decisively would signal to both Myanmar’s citizens and the international community that the NUG stands firmly against abuse, embodying the ethical standards it claims to uphold. The NUG Human Rights Ministry should establish a digital reporting system for sexual abuse cases to facilitate victim reporting. Collaborating with the Women's Ministry can also enhance collective efforts to address this issue. By embracing these reforms, the NUG can reinforce its image as a genuine advocate for human rights and equality, advancing Myanmar’s path toward a democratic society that values all voices. This case underscores the urgency of addressing systemic gender-based violence, ensuring that the NUG remains a trusted symbol of ethical governance in a country that desperately needs it.

Beyond Guns And Ships: India’s ‘Soft Power’ Strategy In Maritime ...	While cultural elements like yoga, Bollywood, cuisine, and spirituality have historically shaped India's international image, a modern dimension has emerged within its strategic framework, leveraging maritime soft power. In recent years, the Indian Navy has assumed a central role in India's humanitarian outreach and maritime diplomacy through Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This shift emphasises India's ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family) and enhances its reputation on the global stage by projecting security, resilience, and regional solidarity. Under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) initiative, maritime diplomacy is now a cornerstone of Indian foreign policy, positioning the Indian Navy as a vehicle for goodwill and cooperative engagement. Here is how the Indian Navy fortifies India's global influence through a balanced soft and hard power approach and advances its interests across the IOR. Pioneering HADR Operations: India's capacity for HADR operations was first spotlighted during the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, where the Indian Navy's rapid response exemplified its commitment to regional solidarity. The deployment of 40 ships, 42 helicopters, and 35 aircraft to various disaster-affected locations in India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Indonesia marked the beginning of India's role as a regional 'first responder.' Since then, operations like Madad, Rainbow, and Castor have demonstrated India's dedication to swift and effective humanitarian relief. In 2008, the Navy's response to Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar strengthened India's humanitarian identity. Later missions like Operation Neer in the Maldives (2014) highlighted India's adaptability in addressing diverse regional crises. These efforts have cemented India's reputation for HADR capabilities and extended its influence across the IOR. India as a 'First Responder' in the IOR: The Navy's consistent humanitarian support to neighbouring countries highlights its role as a first responder. Noteworthy missions include aid to Sri Lanka during Cyclone Roanu (2016) and to Mozambique in 2019, demonstrating a commitment to timely disaster relief. These actions display logistical capacity and reinforce India's dedication to the welfare of neighbouring nations, a core component of its soft power strategy. Expanding Capacity for HADR: To enhance its HADR capabilities, the Indian Navy has upgraded medical facilities, invested in technology, and expanded its fleet's adaptability for disaster response. Technological advancements like satellite communications and UAVs have strengthened situational awareness, allowing quicker and more coordinated interventions. This comprehensive approach positions India as both a capable and compassionate regional leader. Strategic Foundations: SAGAR and Neighbourhood First: Launched in 2015, India's SAGAR initiative articulates a vision for regional stability and shared growth, with the Indian Navy playing a vital role in safeguarding the IOR. SAGAR exemplifies India's commitment to a secure and prosperous regional environment through regular patrols, capacity-building initiatives, and resource-sharing. Neighbourhood First and Act East Policies: Aligned with SAGAR, India's 'Neighbourhood First' and 'Act East' policies emphasise security cooperation and friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Through naval resource sharing, humanitarian aid, and training programs, India has cultivated strong ties with Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and other IOR nations. These collaborative efforts demonstrate India's vision of a stable Indian Ocean, where regional partners benefit from Indian expertise and resources. Capacity and Capability Building: India as a Preferred Security Partner Training and Resource Sharing: A critical component of India's maritime soft power is its investment in training regional navies. Each year, the Indian Navy trains approximately 1,000 personnel from smaller neighbouring forces, fostering security knowledge and regional camaraderie. This cooperation strengthens the capacities of IOR nations to manage their maritime challenges while reinforcing India's image as a partner in regional security. Asset Transfers and Long-Term Support: India's provision of naval assets to regional partners further solidifies its role as a security partner. In recent years, India has been transferring offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) and other assets to countries like Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and the Maldives. Adhering to a 'Womb to Tomb' principle, India provides maintenance and operational support for these assets, fostering trust and ensuring long-term collaboration in maritime security. Showcasing India's Maritime Diplomacy Through Major Initiatives High-Level Maritime Engagements and Exercises: High-profile engagements, such as the 2016 International Fleet Review and the biannual Milan exercises, reflect India's commitment to maritime collaboration. The Milan exercises, for instance, involve over 40 countries and promote the themes of 'Camaraderie, Cohesion, Collaboration.' By fostering these multilateral engagements, India reinforces its position as a trusted and collaborative regional partner. The Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): Since 2018, the IFC-IOR in Gurugram has facilitated real-time maritime information sharing among 25 nations, enhancing maritime domain awareness and supporting efforts against piracy, illegal fishing, and smuggling. Hosting liaison officers from multiple countries, IFC-IOR embodies India's commitment to a secure and open Indo-Pacific, strengthening its leadership in maritime diplomacy. The Role of Technological Advances in Expanding India's Soft Power Integration of Advanced Systems: India's adoption of strategic technology has significantly bolstered its HADR, NEO, and SAR capabilities. Satellite-based communication, UAVs for surveillance, and advanced maritime radars improve crisis response and showcase India as a technologically capable humanitarian force. High-Impact Operations as a Technological Showcase: India's technological capabilities have been demonstrated in critical operations, such as the 2017 rescue of the merchant vessel MSC Daniela off Sri Lanka and anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden. These operations, backed by advanced technology, project India's competence and reliability as a maritime power. Leveraging Maritime Diplomacy to Reinforce India's Image as a Global Leader Building Trust Through Crisis Response: Operations like Samudra Setu, which repatriated citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent efforts to supply critical medical materials under Samudra Setu II highlight India's commitment to global humanitarianism. Additionally, evacuations from conflict zones such as Sudan in 2023 underline India's dedication to the welfare of its citizens and its capacity to respond effectively in crises. Strengthening Diplomatic Ties Through Non-Partisan Humanitarian Efforts: India's impartial humanitarian missions, including rescuing Pakistani sailors from Somali pirates, underline its commitment to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. By offering aid regardless of geopolitical divides, India fosters regional goodwill and strengthens diplomatic ties. Future Supervisions and Strategic Implications Enhancing HADR Capabilities for Greater Reach: To broaden its humanitarian reach, the Indian Navy is exploring ways to enhance its HADR resources. Potential expansions include developing specialised HADR ships, increasing relief storage, and augmenting water purification and medical facilities on ships. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining India's role as a first responder in the IOR. Strategic Implications of India's Soft Power in the IOR: India's robust HADR, SAR, and NEO operations continue strengthening its influence within the IOR. As a stabilising force, India's growing presence supports the Free and Open Indo-Pacific agenda, positioning it as a counterbalance to other major maritime powers while reinforcing its image as a compassionate and stabilising force. The Indian Navy's soft power initiatives, from disaster relief to strategic capacity-building, have established India as a benevolent regional leader committed to security, humanitarianism, and cooperation. By blending hard and soft power, India embodies the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam philosophy, fostering stability in the IOR and enhancing its global standing as a responsible, stabilising force. This strategy promotes regional harmony and significantly positions India to shape a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjYjwOP08pqdw	2024-11-22T08:36:17-08:00	
What’s Driving Decreasing Gasoline Consumption In China? – Analys...	(EIA) -- Gasoline consumption in China has begun to fall in recent months amid increased sales of electric vehicles, slow economic growth, and population decline. We estimate gasoline consumption in China averaged 3.2 million barrels per day (b/d) in August 2024, 14% less than in August 2023. The trend continued in September and October, which were down from the same months in 2023. From January through July of this year, more gasoline was consumed in China than the year before. These trends led us to reduce our forecast growth in consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels in China in 2024 and 2025 in our Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). China’s growth of 0.1 million b/d in 2024 and 0.3 million b/d in 2025 will mostly be driven by petrochemical feedstocks instead of transportation fuels, reflecting increased petrochemical manufacturing in the country. Combined sales of hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEV) were more than half of total passenger vehicle sales in China in October 2024, according to Bloomberg data. This share of sales is up from 40% in October 2023. Credit: EIA Although increased BEV and plug-in hybrid sales are only one factor moderating recent gasoline consumption in China, continued market penetration of these vehicles could weigh on the future of gasoline consumption. In China, typically between 20 million and 25 million passenger vehicles are sold every year. In the future, depending on future sales trends and the number of internal combustion engines decommissioned, BEVs and hybrids could make up a large portion of the total vehicle fleet in China. Although we do not forecast consumption for individual petroleum products such as gasoline or diesel in countries other than the United States in our STEO, we factor in fundamental shifts that affect petroleum product consumption in our forecasts. In China, increased sales of BEV and hybrid vehicles, a declining population, and slower economic growth have limited growth in gasoline consumption. Based on the latest forecast from Oxford Economics, China’s GDP is expected to grow by 4.1% in 2025, which is slower than the 6.7% GDP growth rate average from 2015 to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil consumption correlates with economic activity, and slower GDP growth could also be limiting gasoline consumption. In addition, China’s population has begun to decline, which may reduce total miles driven and gasoline consumption. China’s National Bureau of Statistics and General Administration of Customs publish monthly data on crude oil refinery processing, refined petroleum product output, crude oil and petroleum product imports, and crude oil and petroleum product exports. The agencies do not publish inventory levels or stock changes. Because of this exclusion, we calculate China’s apparent demand of gasoline as refinery production of gasoline plus imports minus exports. This calculation is different from product supplied, our proxy for consumption in the United States, which accounts for stock changes. Despite lacking inventory data, China’s monthly petroleum statistics can serve as a useful guide for general trends in the country’s petroleum market.

The Influence Of Baloch Student Unions In Promoting Separatism An...	Baluchistan, one of Pakistan’s most resource-rich yet underdeveloped provinces, has been plagued by unrest for decades. While genuine grievances of the Baloch people warrant attention, the activities of certain Baloch student unions have raised significant concerns. Groups like the Baloch Student Organization-Azad (BSO-A), Baloch Student Council (BSC), and Baloch Student Action Committee (BSAC) have allegedly become breeding grounds for extremism and separatism under the guise of advocating for nationalism and student rights. Their influence not only fosters divisiveness but also disrupts the academic and social development of Baloch youth. Student unions have historically played a vital role in advocating for rights and fostering political awareness. However, some factions of Baloch student unions have deviated from these ideals. Organizations like BSO-A and BSAC have reportedly been linked to militant outfits like the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA). These unions often use university campuses as recruitment grounds, targeting impressionable students with narratives of victimization and nationalism. Instead of promoting peaceful dialogue, these groups perpetuate the notion that violence and separatism are the only solutions to Baluchistan’s challenges. Under the banner of Baloch nationalism, these student unions propagate anti-state sentiments, portraying Pakistan as an oppressor. While nationalism in itself is not inherently negative, these groups manipulate it to justify their extremist agendas. They pollute the minds of young Baloch students, instilling hatred for other ethnicities and discouraging harmonious coexistence. This not only undermines national unity but also jeopardizes the educational and professional prospects of these students. Baloch student unions frequently disrupt the peaceful environment of universities, particularly in Baluchistan. They organize protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations, often forcing students to participate under threat or coercion. This culture of intimidation extends to female students, who are pressured to join these activities as a symbolic 'soft face' to garner public sympathy. Such actions not only hinder academic progress but also create an atmosphere of fear and instability on campuses. Education is a powerful tool for empowerment, but the disruptive activities of Baloch student unions undermine its potential in Baluchistan. There have been reports of these unions interfering with classes, examinations, and academic schedules. By keeping students away from education, these groups deprive them of opportunities to improve their socio-economic conditions and contribute positively to society. This deliberate strategy ensures a steady supply of disillusioned youth for their separatist agenda. The psychological manipulation of young, impressionable students is a key tactic employed by these unions. A recent case highlights this disturbing trend. Talat Aziz, a third-semester political science student at Punjab University, revealed that he was coerced into joining a BLA training camp after being recruited at a Baloch Youth Council (BYC) protest. He admitted that a girl he met at the protest played a significant role in convincing him, and peer pressure from his fellow students further fueled his decision. Such cases underscore how Baloch student unions exploit vulnerabilities to recruit individuals for extremist activities. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that balances enforcement with socio-economic development. Below are some recommendations to mitigate the influence of these unions: University administrations and law enforcement agencies should collaborate to monitor and counter the disruptive activities of extremist student unions. Strict action must be taken against individuals or groups found inciting violence or promoting separatist ideologies. The government and educational institutions should encourage the formation of inclusive student organizations that focus on academic, cultural, and extracurricular activities. These platforms can provide students with constructive outlets for their energy and ambitions. The grievances of Baloch youth often stem from genuine socio-economic disparities. Addressing these issues through targeted development programs, scholarships, and job opportunities can reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies. The government and civil society should launch awareness campaigns to educate students about the dangers of extremist ideologies. Highlighting success stories of Baloch individuals who have excelled in education and professional fields can inspire others to follow suit. Many students targeted by these unions suffer from psychological manipulation and peer pressure. Providing counseling services in educational institutions can help vulnerable students resist coercion and make informed decisions. While enforcement measures are necessary, a long-term solution requires dialogue and reconciliation. Engaging with moderate voices within the Baloch community and addressing their legitimate concerns can help build trust and reduce support for extremist groups. The activities of Baloch student unions like BSO-A, BSC, and BSAC pose a serious threat to the peace and progress of Baluchistan and Pakistan as a whole. By exploiting young minds, these groups perpetuate a cycle of hatred, violence, and underdevelopment. It is imperative for the government, civil society, and educational institutions to work together to counter this menace. Through a combination of strict enforcement, socio-economic development, and awareness campaigns, Baloch youth can be empowered to reject extremism and contribute positively to their communities and the nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjY83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-22T08:31:17-08:00	
Attock Cement Takeaways From Analyst Briefing – OpEd	Attock Cement Pakistan (ACPL) held its corporate briefing to discuss its FY24 and 1QFY25 financial results and future outlook. Following are the key highlights: Company posted topline of PKR28.5 billion for FY24 as compared to PKR25.4 billion for FY23, up 12%YoY, mainly due to higher offtakes. Company’s earnings were reported at PKR3.6 billion (EPS: PKR25.9) for FY24 as against PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.0) for FY23. The said increase was largely attributed to divestment gains of PKR4.3 billion (pre-tax) from the sale of its subsidiary, ‘Saqr Al Keetan Cement production company in Iraq for US$23.4 million. Earnings for 1QFY25 were recorded at PKR62 million (EPS: PKR0.45) as compared to PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.23) for the same period last year, down 96%YoY. Cement industry's total dispatches increased by 1%YoY to 45.3 million tons, though overall utilization levels fell to 55% in FY24 as compared to 60% in FY23. ACPL’s local dispatches were recorded at 1.2 million tons, down by 9%YoY. Meanwhile, export dispatches increased by 57%YoY to 1.0 million tons, on the back of 77%YoY higher clinker exports. Subsequently, total dispatches increased by 14%YoY to 2.3 million tons. Moreover, offtakes rose by 1%YoY in 1QFY25, with local dispatches dropping by 21%Yoy but exports increasing by 42%YoY. Management stated that company primarily rely on imported coal, constituting 85-90% of their coal mix. While, local coal component is limited to 10-15% due to its higher sulfur content. Company’s retention prices in FY24 averaged PKR14,700/ton, up from PKR13,400/ton in FY23. Meanwhile, export retention prices decreased to PKR9.400/ton from PKR10.400/ton. Consequently, weighted average retention prices for FY24 declined to PKR12.200/ton from PKR12.400/ton for the same period last year, given a higher export mix. Production cost increased to PKR10.000/ton in FY24, from PKR9.600/ton in FY23. Wherein, fuel cost reduced to PKR5,000/ton from PKR5,200/ton in FY23, due to efficient coal mix and higher efficiency of Line-4. However, power cost increased due to a 39%YoY increase in power tariff. Current clinker exports price hovered at US$30/ton, whereas cement export prices were US$40/ton. Meanwhile, MRP in the local market was PKR1,350/bag or PKR27,000/ton. Company power mix comprises 38% coal-fired boilers, 30% Waste Heat Recovery (WHR), 13-15% solar, and the remainder from grid tariff. Company's current capacity stands at 4.3 million ton following the addition of Line-4 in FY24. Management stated that the company is setting up a 4.8MW wind power plant, which is expected to be commissioned by 3QFY25. Management expects local cement demand to improve in the coming months. Additionally, the company is striving to secure orders with positive contribution margins despite the prevailing lower export prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjby51QE7HLhO	2024-11-22T08:27:09-08:00	
Body Image Of Women: Changing Concept And Updates – OpEd	For women, body image is a complex and deeply personal issue that is influenced by multiple factors, including cultural ideals, media portrayals, family, peers, and individual psychological factors. The key points about body image in women include: a. Cultural and Societal Influences: Societal standards of beauty often emphasize certain body types, skin tones, and features as ideal, which can lead women to feel pressured to conform. Historically, these standards have shifted – from the fuller-figured ideals of the Renaissance, to the thinness celebrated in the 90s, to the 'fit' and 'curvy' ideals promoted today. Advertising, movies, and social media often showcase a narrow standard of beauty that may not reflect the diversity of real women’s bodies. This has contributed to an unrealistic and often unattainable image of what women 'should' look like. b. Media and Social Media Impact: Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok can have a mixed impact on body image. They provide a platform for self-expression but also intensify body image concerns by exposing women to edited images, filters, and an endless stream of idealized bodies. This can lead to comparison, self-doubt, and negative self-esteem. Influencers and celebrities play a role in promoting certain body standards, although there has been a growing trend toward body positivity and inclusivity in recent years. c. Body Positivity and Body Neutrality Movements: The body positivity movement encourages acceptance and celebration of all body types, aiming to reduce stigma around larger bodies and to challenge societal beauty standards. Body neutrality goes a step further by promoting the idea that bodies don’t have to be loved or celebrated; instead, it emphasizes viewing the body as functional and focusing less on appearance. d. The Role of Family and Peers: Family and friends often influence body image. Comments, even if well-intentioned, can shape how women see their bodies. Positive reinforcement of diverse body types can improve body image, while critical comments can lead to negative self-perception. Peer pressure, especially among younger women and teenagers, can also be strong, with comparisons and insecurities fuelled by trends in fashion and beauty. Body image is a dynamic, multifaceted issue that affects women differently based on their personal experiences and societal context. Conversations about body image are moving toward promoting self-acceptance, inclusivity, and a focus on health and well-being rather than solely appearance. Development of the concept The concept of body image has evolved over time, shaped by changes in cultural standards, psychological research, and shifts in media representation. An overview of the concept include: a. Early Views: The term 'body image' was first introduced by neurologist Paul Schilder in the 1930s. He described body image as the mental representation one has of their physical self. Schilder explored how this image is influenced by social interactions and emotions, laying the groundwork for understanding body image as a psychological construct. b. 1980s–1990s: Body Image and Eating Disorders: In the 1980s and 1990s, studies highlighted a strong link between body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Researchers started to recognize the harmful effects of media portrayals on women’s self-esteem and mental health. c. 2000s: Body Positivity and Critical Media Literacy: With the rise of the internet and social media in the early 2000s, body image issues became more visible and widely discussed. Online communities started promoting body positivity, which encourages people to accept and celebrate diverse body shapes and sizes. Researchers and activists promoted critical media literacy, encouraging individuals to question and resist unrealistic portrayals of beauty in the media. This included a shift towards valuing the functionality of the body, moving beyond appearance-based assessments. d. 2020s: Inclusivity and the Shift Towards Holistic Well-being: Recently, body image discussions have broadened to include diverse body types, skin tones, abilities, and gender identities. Brands and media outlets are increasingly featuring a wider range of bodies, challenging traditional beauty ideals. The concept of body neutrality has gained traction as an alternative to body positivity. While body positivity focuses on loving one’s body, body neutrality emphasizes reducing the focus on physical appearance altogether, valuing the body as a functional entity and shifting focus to well-being. e. Psychological and Social Impact of Evolving Body Image Concepts: Over time, research has revealed the deep connection between body image and mental health, especially among women. Negative body image is linked with issues like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, whereas a positive body image is associated with better psychological resilience and satisfaction. The growing emphasis on holistic well-being encourages individuals to prioritize health and mental peace over conforming to physical ideals, reflecting a more inclusive and balanced approach to body image. In summary, body image as a concept has evolved from simple self-perception to a complex, socially influenced idea intertwined with cultural values, psychological health, and media representations. Challenges of body image The concept of body image presents a number of challenges, especially as it intersects with societal pressures, mental health, and personal self-worth. Some of the most significant challenges related to body image include: a. Unrealistic Beauty Standards: Media Influence: Media and advertising often promote narrow and unrealistic standards of beauty, portraying idealized images that are difficult, if not impossible, for most people to achieve. This creates a constant pressure to conform to these standards. Changing Trends: Beauty standards are constantly shifting (e.g., thinness in the 90s vs. a more curvy ideal today), making it challenging for individuals to maintain a stable or positive self-image. b. Impact of Social Media and Filters: Social Comparison:Social media encourages comparison, as people are frequently exposed to images of others who may present their most polished or edited selves. This comparison can lead to body dissatisfaction, particularly among young users. c. Limited Representation and Diversity: Lack of Inclusive Images:Although representation is improving, traditional media has historically presented a narrow view of beauty that excludes many body types, skin tones, ages, and abilities. This lack of representation reinforces stereotypes about what constitutes an 'acceptable' or 'desirable' body. d. Intersection with Gender and Societal Expectations: Gendered Body Standards:While women often face pressures around thinness, youth, and curviness, men also experience pressures around muscularity, strength, and height. These gendered expectations create unique challenges for different groups. e. Economic and Social Pressures: Commercialization of Body Image: Industries capitalize on body image insecurities by marketing products that claim to improve appearance, from weight-loss programs to cosmetic enhancements. This commercialization can intensify dissatisfaction by constantly reminding people of their perceived 'flaws. Addressing these challenges requires a societal shift toward inclusivity, education, and a focus on health and well-being that values each person as more than their appearance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjTXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-22T08:22:20-08:00

Across-The-Board Accountability: The Cornerstone Of Pakistan’s Su...	Pakistan has long grappled with deep-rooted socio-economic and socio-political challenges along with elite capture that continue to stymie its progress. The nation faces persistent issues such as widespread poverty, high unemployment rates, and inadequate access to essential services like quality education and sustainable healthcare. The economic difficulties create a cycle of dependence and underdevelopment. Compounding these challenges, the political landscape remains fraught with instability. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has announced large-scale nationwide protests on November 24, 2024, with an indefinite sit-in at D-Chowk termed as 'Final Call'. The demonstrations are expected to intensify political tensions, with PTI leaders describing the event as pivotal in shaping the country’s future. This political strife occurs amidst accusations of state interference and opposition crackdowns, contributing to an uncertain governance environment. Simultaneously, Pakistan is witnessing a resurgence in terrorism. Recent attacks, such as the gun assault in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kurram District that killed at least 42 civilians, underscore escalating security concerns. These incidents highlight vulnerabilities in border management and counterterrorism strategies, particularly in regions impacted by militant insurgencies. ​The interplay of economic hardship, political discord, social polarization, and rising insecurity exacerbates Pakistan’s challenges, hampering its prospects for survival. On the socio-political front, a legacy of political instability, inconsistent policy frameworks, and an entrenched culture of patronage and corruption further impede reforms. This complex web of socio-political woes undermines the country’s ability to build resilient institutions and maintain public trust, as efforts to enforce accountability often clash with vested interests and power structures resistant to change. Addressing these intertwined challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, where across-the-board accountability emerges as the linchpin of any sustainable solution. Corruption, weak institutions, and lack of accountability have long been one of the most significant impediments to Pakistan’s growth. It bleeds public funds, which could otherwise be directed toward essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The siphoning off of these critical resources exacerbates social inequality and erodes trust in public institutions. When corruption runs rampant, faith in the very systems meant to uphold justice and fairness is shattered. The result is a population that feels disenfranchised, fostering an environment where the rule of law holds little weight. Efforts like the establishment of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) have been undertaken to combat corruption, aiming to investigate and prosecute cases of financial malpractice. However, the outcomes have been mixed, with critics pointing out issues of selective accountability and political influence. To truly succeed, Pakistan must implement stringent anti-corruption measures and enforce transparent processes for government spending and policymaking. Strong institutions are the backbone of a sustainable society. In Pakistan, the strength of these institutions has often been compromised by undue influence and a lack of accountability. A clear example of this is the failure of police reform initiatives aimed at reducing political interference in law enforcement. Despite multiple attempts to create an independent and professional police force, reforms have often faltered due to a lack of sustained political will and accountability measures. The rule of law must prevail, and no individual regardless of rank should be above it. Ensuring that checks and balances exist across all branches of government is essential. It is only through such measures that public confidence in governance can be restored. Reforms in the judiciary and electoral systems must promote impartiality and transparency, reinforcing the idea that institutions are designed to serve the public interest, not individual power brokers. Economic stability is another critical aspect of national sustainability that thrives on accountability. Investor confidence is closely linked to a nation’s adherence to the rule of law and fairness. When businesses and investors are assured that regulations are consistently applied, and there is recourse for addressing grievances, they are more likely to commit to long-term investments. This inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) can bolster economic growth and create jobs, laying the groundwork for a more resilient economy. Conversely, when accountability is absent, the economy becomes susceptible to mismanagement and corruption. For instance, Pakistan’s external debt reached a staggering $130.4 billion in March 2024, debt-to-GDP ratio stood at approximately 65.7% as of September 2024, contributing to economic pressures that further exacerbated inflation and unemployment. Financial instability stemming from unchecked corruption and poor governance has repeatedly led to debt crises that hinder progress. Similarly, public trust and social cohesion are critical for the unity and collective growth of a country. Trust between the government and its citizens is built when people believe their leaders are accountable and that governance operates transparently. When this trust is established, it creates a social contract that encourages citizens to actively participate in nation-building and respect the laws that govern them. On the other hand, when leaders evade responsibility and misuse their power, the social fabric begins to unravel. Accountability mechanisms such as public access to information, citizen participation in policymaking, and open channels for dialogue empower people to play a role in governance. These measures foster a sense of shared responsibility that strengthens the country from within. Equally important is the effectiveness of public policies, which can only be achieved when there is proper oversight. Policies crafted and executed without mechanisms for accountability are prone to failure, inefficiency, and corruption. A notable example is the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), which, despite its aim to provide financial aid to the underprivileged, has faced issues of mismanagement and misuse of funds due to lack of stringent oversight. Today, Pakistan finds itself teetering on the edge of economic collapse, grappling with severe political turmoil, widespread lawlessness, and escalating social unrest. The nation’s systems are deeply mired in corruption and inefficiency, hindering effective governance and progress. To move forward, several steps need to be taken to embed accountability at every level of society. Legislative reforms must be introduced to mandate transparency in public services, ensuring that leaders are held accountable for their actions. Independent oversight bodies should be strengthened and granted the autonomy necessary to function without fear of political reprisal. Civic education must be prioritized so that citizens are aware of their rights and responsibilities and understand the importance of holding their leaders accountable. Additionally, leveraging technology to create digital platforms for transparency – where government actions, contracts, and expenditures are published – can significantly enhance public scrutiny and involvement. Across-the-board accountability, therefore, is not just a lofty ideal but an actionable necessity for Pakistan’s future. It ensures that resources are managed prudently, public trust is fortified, and sustainable development becomes a reality. For Pakistan, embedding accountability at every level from local councils to the highest offices of power – is the only path forward. By doing so, the nation can cultivate stability, prosperity, and progress that can endure for generations to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjSM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-22T08:17:21-08:00	
Trump, AUKUS And Australia’s Dim Servitors – OpEd	There is something enormously satisfying about seeing those in the war racket worry that their assumptions on conflict have been upended. There they were, happily funding, planning and preparing to battle against threats imagined or otherwise, and there comes Donald Trump, malice and petulance combined, to pull the rug from under them again. What is fascinating about the return of Trump to the White House is that critics think his next round of potentially rowdy occupancy is going to encourage, rather than discourage war. Conflict may be the inadvertent consequence of any number of unilateral policies Trump might pursue, but they do not tally with his anti-war platform. Whatever can be said about his adolescent demagogic tendencies, a love of war is curiously absent from the complement. A tendency to predictable unpredictability, however, is. The whole assessment also utterly misunderstands the premise that the foolishly menacing trilateral alliance of AUKUS is, by its nature, a pact for the making of war. This agreement between Australia, the UK and the US can hardly be dignified as some peaceful, unprovocative enterprise fashioned to preserve security. To that end, President Joe Biden should shoulder a considerable amount of the blame for destabilising the region. But instead, we are getting some rather streaky commentary from the security wonks in Australia. Trump spells, in the pessimistic words of Nick Bisley from La Trobe University, 'uncertainty about just what direction the US will go'. His policies might, for instance, 'badly destabilise Asia' and imperil the AUKUS, specifically on the provision of nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy. On the last point, we can only hope. The Australians, being willing and unquestioning satellites of US power, have tried to pretend that a change of the guard in the White House will not doom the pact. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong expressed a 'great deal of confidence' that things would not change under the new administration, seeing as AUKUS enjoyed bipartisan support. Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, is also of the view that AUKUS will survive into the Trump administration as it 'strengthens all three countries’ ability to deter threats, and it grows the defence industrial base and creates jobs in all three countries'. Another former ambassador to Washington, Arthur Sinodinos, who also occupies the role of AUKUS forum co-chair, has pitched the viability of the trilateral pact in such a way as to make it more appealing to Trump. Without any trace of humour, he suggests that tech oligarch Elon Musk oversee matters if needed. 'If Musk can deliver AUKUS, we should put Musk in charge of AUKUS, and I’m not joking, if new thinking is needed to get this done,' advises the deluded Sinodinos. The reasoning offered on this is, to put it mildly, peculiar. As co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, it is hoped, will apply 'business principles' and 'new thinking'. If the Pentagon can 'reform supply chains, logistics, procurement rules, in a way that means there’s speed to market, we get minimum viable capability sooner, rather than later'. These doltish assessments from Sinodinos are blatantly ignorant of the fact the defence industry is never efficient. Nor do they detract from the key premise of the arrangements. Certainly, if an anti-China focus is what you are focusing on – and AUKUS, centrally and evidently, is an anti-China agreement pure and simple – there would be little reason for Trump to tinker with its central tenets. For one, he is hankering for an even deeper trade war with Beijing. Why not also harry the Chinese with a provocative instrument, daft as it is, that entails militarising Australia and garrisoning it for any future conflict that might arise? Whatever the case, AUKUS has always been contingent on the interests of one power. Congress has long signalled that US defence interests come first, including whether Australia should receive any Virginian class submarines to begin with. Trump would hardly disagree here. 'Trump’s decisions at each phase of AUKUS cooperation will be shaped by zero-sum balance sheets of US interest,' suggests Alice Nason of the University of Sydney’s US Studies Centre rather tritely. If Trump be so transactional, he has an excellent example of a country utterly willing to give everything to US security, thereby improving the deal from the side of Washington’s military-industrial complex. If there was one lingering, pathological complaint he had about Washington’s NATO allies, it was always that they were not doing enough to ease the burdens of US defence. They stalled on defence budgets; they quibbled on various targets on recruitment. This can hardly be said of Canberra. Australia’s government has abandoned all pretence of resistance, measure or judgment, outrageously willing to underwrite the US imperium in any of its needs in countering China, raiding the treasury of taxpayer funds to the tune of a figure that will, eventually, exceed A$368 billion. Rudd openly acknowledges that Australian money is directly 'investing into the US submarine industrial base to expand the capacity of their shipyards.' It would be silly to prevent this continuing windfall. It may well be that aspect that ends up convincing Trump that AUKUS is worth keeping. Why get rid of willing servitors of such dim tendency when they are so willing to please you with cash and compliments?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV8oUOrk3WyH_	2024-11-21T18:20:57-08:00	
Central Asian Countries Sending Migrant Workers To Asia Over Russ...	Since the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack in Moscow in March 2024, hostility among Russians toward Central Asian immigrants has increased dramatically (see EDM, March 26, 28). Despite the Kremlin’s need for such workers to compensate for Russia’s demographic decline, Russian officials have adopted increasingly harsh policies toward immigrants, expelling some, leading others to leave on their own, and causing many Central Asians to consider going home or at least working somewhere other than Russia (Window on Eurasia, July 18, 2022; see EDM, May 9, 15,October 22). Moscow’s decision to try to force migrant workers into its invasion force in Ukraine has further exacerbated these feelings (see EDM November 8, 2023, October 31). The Kremlin has tried to hide the extent of this exodus by ending the publication of interior ministry data on departures and publishing only data on arrivals, figures that distort how many have left. This has even led some commentators to claim that there has been no population decline in the Central Asian migrant community in Russia and blame the West for the situation (Federalcity.ru, October 25; Ritmeurasia.ru, November 16). Reports from across Russia show, however, that such claims are baseless (e.g., Infopro54.ru, November 20; Novosibirsk MK.ru, November 21; Tvernews.ru, November 25). This mass emigration has led to two policy shifts, one in Moscow and one in Central Asian capitals. In Moscow, the Russian government has sought to find replacements for the departed Central Asian migrant workers from elsewhere, turning to Zimbabwe and India, as well as to smaller countries in East Asia (Novopossiya, May 31; Versia.ru, October 10; see EDM, February 23, September 16, October 16; Tsargrad.tv, November 16). Appeals to these countries for migrant workers began even before the Crocus City Hall attack, but the recent intensification of Moscow’s efforts both highlights the significance of Central Asians’ departure and is fraught with danger for Russia (see EDM, February 6). On the one hand, migrant workers from these countries are far less likely to know Russian or be familiar with Russian norms than Central Asians whom the Soviet Union colonized and only in the past thirty years gained their independence with Russia continuing to influence their politics. The new migrant workers’ lack of cultural and linguistic knowledge seems certain to exacerbate ethnic tensions within the Russian Federation, even more radically in places where Central Asian workers’ absence of Russian language knowledge and sensitivity to Russian cultural norms have been significant causes of the current anti-migrant campaign. Turning away from the use of Central Asians as migrant workers will simultaneously undercut Moscow’s efforts to promote the revival and spread of the Russian language throughout Central Asia and is already reducing Moscow’s influence across the region. Policy changes in Central Asian countries point to this development, which may ultimately have even more profound consequences. Until recently, Central Asian governments welcomed the role that their migrant workers in the Russian Federation play in helping the economies of their countries stay afloat. Transfer payments from the migrant workers have played a key role in that regard, especially in Tajikistan, and in other countries as well. These governments view sending such people to Russia as a kind of safety valve because even if radicalized by their experiences in Russia, they will not come home soon and threaten the regimes (see EDM, October 5, 2023). Consequently, when it became apparent that more migrant workers were returning from the Russian Federation, these governments focused on expanding the list of other countries where their nationals could go instead, which would help stabilize their homelands and prevent them from coming back and sparking unrest. More than any other country in the region, Uzbekistan has been concerned about ensuring the continuation of sending its migrant workers abroad and is urged by experts to diversify the countries it sends people to (Window on Eurasia, June 24, 2021). Several years ago, under the rubric of promoting a balanced foreign policy, Tashkent sought to promote migration to countries other than Russia, including most prominently South Korea, where 100,000 of its citizens now work, becoming the largest diaspora community in that country (Gazeta.uz, February 5; MK.ru, July 17). At the end of October, taking its lead from Uzbekistan and fearing the consequences of losing remittances and the possible instability with migrant workers returning from Russia to Tajikistan, the poorest country in the region, Dushanbe signed an agreement with Seoul. This agreement paved the way for Tajiks to go to South Korea to learn Korean and work in Korean factories beginning in January 2025 (Ritmeurasia.ru, November 11; For background on the decision, see Window on Eurasia, April 3). The initial numbers may be small, as in the case of the Uzbeks, but will grow rapidly as it seems virtually certain that more Tajiks will return from Russia. This pattern will be repeated by other Central Asian countries as well, which, similarly to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, will seek to arrange for their nationals to go to other Pacific Rim countries. Moscow commentators now say that such a maneuver will cost Russia dearly, and China, Russia’s ally, will not save Russia in Central Asia. Instead, Beijing is likely to exploit this new set of Russian losses. Beijing itself, however, will also find itself in competition with South Korea and other Pacific Rim countries because, unlike them, it is unlikely to be able to arrange for the dispatch of Central Asian workers to China. Consequently, Versia analyst Ruslan Gorevoy says anti-Central Asian immigrant actions and moves may mean that Moscow has now 'lost' that region in much the way it has lost other regions of the former Soviet space (Versia.ru, April 15). Central Asian governments not only are denouncing Moscow for its anti-immigrant moves but are also supporting Ukraine and refusing to take part in many Russian-led activities—despite Moscow’s propagandistic efforts to claim the contrary (Krym.Realii, April 15; Kakaz-uzel.ru, April 12; Eurasia Today, April 16). Moscow officials have only themselves to blame, Gorevoy concludes, due to their approach toward the Crocus City Hall terrorist act. Moscow played to the nationalist, even racist, attitudes of many Russians rather than pursuing Russia’s national interests, which include using Central Asian workers and expanding Moscow’s influence over their homelands. Reversing course now will be difficult if not impossible, he suggests and notes that this is just one more way in which the mishandling of a manageable ethnic issue leads to geopolitical catastrophe (For a useful discussion of how Moscow is now struggling with this, see Russian Council on International Affairs, November 20).

Who Is Bo Guagua And Why Do China Watchers Care About His Wedding...	He has not been heard from for over 10 years, but the news of his engagement this month has made a splash from Taipei to (probably) Tiananmen. Bo Guagua, a once high-profile son of the Chinese political elite whose notorious family drama both shocked and shaped the country’s politics today, touched down in Taiwan last week to make a pilgrimage familiar to many young people: to visit his future in-laws. Yet the public attention on what should have been a normal rite of passage reveals just how much interest there is in this Communist Party scion once tipped for power. Taiwanese media quoted a nurse who laid eyes on him ('he is handsome!'), while the office of the former Taiwanese president declared that he had not been invited to the wedding, which is due to take place on Nov. 23. So who is Bo Guagua – and why is there interest in his marriage? A princeling ‘hongsandai’ Bo Kuangyi, better known as 'Guagua,' is the son of Bo Xilai, once one of the most powerful politicians in China, and his businesswoman wife, Gu Kailai. His grandfather, Bo Yibo, was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Guagua was one of a generation of high-profile princelings whose family wealth – gained owing to a connection to the ruling party amid China’s rapid economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s – made them known as the 'hongsandai' or 'third generation reds.' From that privileged position, he led a visibly gilded lifestyle that included prime seats at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, a private education at Harrow, the English boarding school, and an enviable network of contacts collected from stints at Oxford and Harvard Universities. Unlike peers of similar backgrounds – top leader Xi Jinping’s daughter, for example, also attended Harvard but under a pseudonym – Guagua was not shy. He became known as a playboy, hosting parties with guests like Jackie Chan and allegedly driving a Ferrari to pick up the daughter of a diplomat (a story he later denied). All this came to a sudden, stunning end when the Bo family became the subjects of one of the most consequential scandals in modern Chinese politics— one that has shaped the contours of power in the country today. Who is Bo Xilai and why was he important? Before his dramatic downfall, Bo Xilai, Guagua’s father, held some of the most important positions in the CCP, putting him on a collision course with President Xi Jinping, who rose to the position in 2012, the year of Bo Xilai’s ousting. At the time, the elder Bo had been the CCP party secretary of Chongqing, the capital of Sichuan province. In that capacity, Bo amassed enormous influence as well as personal wealth. As secretary, he developed a political system that came to be known as the 'Chongqing model,' which featured sweeping crackdowns and an emphasis on promoting Maoist, 'red' culture. In early 2012, Bo and his wife Gu Kailai were implicated in a corruption scandal and, shockingly, the death of a British businessman and family friend, Neil Heywood, who Gu was later convicted of murdering. Bo and Gu are now both serving life sentences in prison in China. What happened to Bo Guagua after his parents went to jail? When his parents were facing criminal allegations in China, Bo Guagua was in graduate school at Harvard. He was reported to have been smuggled into hiding by U.S. officials in April 2012 as it was unknown whether he would also be swept up by authorities. Months later, in September, he posted a social media post defending his father shortly after the elder Bo was accused of major offenses, including bribery and shared responsibility for the Haywood murder. The elder Bo was found guilty of corruption in 2013 and stripped of his party membership the following year. His son then kept a low profile in the U.S., his whereabouts largely unknown except that he attended Columbia Law School after he finished at Harvard. Only last week did he re-emerge in public, when he arrived in Taiwan. Who is Bo Guagua’s fiancée? The bride-to-be has been named as Hsu Hui Yu, a Taiwanese woman who Guagua is said to have known for years after meeting as students. One of the details of what has caught the attention of China watchers is the political ties of the bride’s family. Hsu’s grandfather was a prominent political donor and member of the Kuomintang (KMT), while her uncle most recently ran as a party candidate for the legislature in 1992, before turning to run the family real estate and healthcare business. The family were close to the ex-KMT president Ma Yinjeou, whose government was once accused of helping them improperly secure business contracts. What does interest in the nuptials tell us? What might seem like a baroque scandal about a Chinese political insider is still capable of igniting the public imagination.. Slews of news stories have been written about the marriage already, with everything from commentary on whether the marriage of a CCP heir into Taiwan is a good thing to how the Mainland Affairs Council, the Taiwan agency that deals with China, is handling the situation. It also speaks to the mystery that surrounds the children of senior Chinese leaders, many of whom went abroad, have access to unknown deposits of wealth and influence, and will shape important relationships in the future. As for the couple, they have not publicly commented. They are expected to make their residence in Canada, where, according to a LinkedIn profile, Bo Guagua is now based. The wedding this weekend itself is supposed to be 'low key.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV7na3sLS5IiZ	2024-11-21T17:47:28-08:00	
Ukraine’s ‘IT Army’ Has Lessons For Taiwan – Analysis	Today Ukraine stands at the forefront of the world’s struggle for democracy and freedom, but tomorrow the front could be Taiwan. Preparations for war with China are currently underway, and Taiwan has been purchasing and stockpiling cutting-edge weaponry from the West to better resist a full-scale invasion. Taipei has also been watching Ukraine carefully and learning from its experience fighting a war against Russia. One oft-overlooked teachable moment has been Ukraine’s ability to mount an effective cyber defense, conducted by a distributed group of backers nicknamed the 'IT Army.' Taiwan should look to implement a similar framework and develop its own IT Army for if and when China invades. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine unleashed the first all-out cyber war between two nation-states. Early on, many feared that Ukraine would suffer a 'Digital Pearl Harbor' when faced with a full Russian onslaught, but that moment never came. Russian cyber-attacks fizzled out and Ukraine, with help from both public and private partnerships from the West, withstood Russia’s cyber offensive. In parallel, Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation spearheaded the effort to bootstrap an IT Army to ensure maximum resistance. Given the clear benefits of the strategy in Ukraine’s case, the lesson for Taiwan becomes clear: don’t wait until being attacked to bolster IT capacity; rather, take preemptive measures to build the force up during peacetime. The IT Army of Ukraine has contributed extensively to Ukraine’s cyber offensive against Russia, executing a diverse and effective range of attacks. These include leaking documents from Russia’s central bank, disrupting Internet services in territories occupied by Russia, incapacitating one of Moscow’s major Internet providers, and targetingprivate corporations to hinder economic activities. Such tactics would be helpful in supporting Taiwan’s efforts to defend itself from China. At its peak, the group boasted a membership of several hundred thousand. Yet a singular focus on followers can be misleading because the IT Army’s attacks have bene growing in effect and scale despite declining subscriber counts on associated Telegram channels. The primary tactic of the IT Army revolves around Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The approach is simple yet effective, involving the coordination of a large number of computers to launch a concerted attack on a specific network or website. By flooding the target with an overwhelming volume of requests, the system is overloaded and eventually crashes. According to its own assessments, the IT Army has inflicted economic losses on Russia estimated between $1 and $2 billion. Consequently, the cyber warfare conducted by the group represents a novel and innovative form of sanctions against their adversaries. Ted (which is a callsign), the spokesperson for the IT Army of Ukraine, shared that, 'economic exhaustion plays a decisive role in the outcome of conflicts, and cyber operations, including DDoS attacks and hacker interventions, are powerful tools in achieving this objective.' Such tactics, namely the infliction of ‘economic exhaustion,’ would be relevant in the context of Taiwan as well. The IT Army’s campaign against Russian Internet providers led to a disruption of 40% of their resources at one point, leading to extensive disruptions in service. The Russian news site Kommersant wrote that 'the number of DDoS attacks on Russian companies doubled year on year in the first quarter. Mostly companies from critical industries… Roskomnadzor speaks of repelling almost three times more attacks in the first quarter alone than in the entire 2023.' Furthermore, while Russia has invested billions of dollars in its building out its own satellite internet network, Ukraine’s IT Army launched an attack in April 2024, that took out 'two of the largest providers, Astra and Allegrosky' for several days. Building Up Taiwan’s IT Army Assembling a volunteer IT Army presents a significant challenge due to its inherently decentralized nature, where members rely more on their own skills than formal training. Fortunately, however, these skills have been developed by our increasingly digital world, opening the door to normal citizens participating in cyber warfare. In Ukraine’s case, the government has also stepped in to draft legislation that would establish a more-formal legal structure to the IT Army. Taiwan too, should consider moving forward with similar legislation to build a legal structure in preparation for future contingencies. For example, the Ukrainian legislation would open the door to foreign volunteers and potentially afford them legal protections for participating in hacking on Ukraine’s behalf. Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, an Associate Professor in Cybercrime and Cybersecurity at the University of Portsmouth believes that if the IT Army were incorporated into Ukraine’s cyber reserves, it could help offer legal protections for civilians participating in cyber war by offering 'legal protection as combatants, potentially shielding them from prosecution for their actions during the war.' Taiwan will also need to consider the legal framework for creation of its own cyber-warfare capabilities, both for its own citizens and for the worldwide volunteers who come to Taiwan’s defense. Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu has previously stated that the country is preparing for a potential war with China, which could come as early as 2027. If this timeframe is even remotely possible, Taiwan should immediately mobilize all available resources to prepare for this future conflict, as the importance of cyber warfare can only be expected to increase in the interim. China’s deep integration and reliance on technology will also make it more vulnerable to attacks from a volunteer IT army. In fact, successful cyber operations carried out by Taiwan could have the potential to inflict substantial economic and operational losses on China, thereby limiting some of China’s military power projection. Taiwan should actively apply the major lessons learned from Ukraine’s IT Army. For example, as Ukraine has developed a strategic blueprint to quickly mobilize its IT Army in times of war, Taiwan too should create a detailed plan for swiftly assembling its own digital defense force. Similarly, inspired by how Ukraine established secure communication channels to efficiently manage its cyber operations, Taiwan should also implement secure systems to coordinate its cyber army and target enemy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging the benefits of international collaboration, as seen in Ukraine’s IT Army, Taiwan should explore strategies for recruiting foreign volunteers, thus enhancing the global reach and capabilities of its own cyber forces. To facilitate the effort, Taiwan should preemptively draft legislation—mirroring Ukraine’s efforts to legally integrate its cyber volunteers—providing a formal structure that offers legal protections and defines the roles of participants within Taiwan’s cyber reserves. Taiwanese intelligence will also need to identify vulnerabilities, prepare botnets, and establish gateways well in advance to penetrate China’s digital systems quickly. This preparatory work is essential to ensure that, in the event of a conflict, Taiwan can quickly and efficiently target critical Chinese infrastructure and systems. Therefore, to ensure operations can be scaled to wage large-scale DDoS attacks and other cyberwarfare offensives, the Taiwanese government will need to reach as many people as possible who are willing to join the fight. This strategy will likely need to include creating educational materials that can be widely shared on social media to recruit younger individuals who are willing to educate themselves and partake in DDoS efforts. However, not all preparations will be technical. One limitation that Ukraine’s IT Army has faced is engaging with non-technical audiences. To scale the work of effective botnets and DDoS attacks, more people are needed to join the attacks. But the average civilian citizen does not consider themselves capable of conducting cyberattacks. The reality is that anyone can follow simple instructions to download a tool and allow their computer’s processing power and Internet access to be added to the botnet and help flood an enemy’s networks to bring them down in times of war. Ukraine’s IT Army has proved to be an effective fighting force against Russia in the cyber realm. As Taiwan prepares for a potential conflict with China, it must take all necessary steps to prepare itself not only for the physical battlefield but the digital one as well.

Indonesia: Prabowo Announces $600B Economic Growth Plan Despite E...	By Ami Afriatni Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is betting big on downstream industries to fuel his country’s economic future. Prabowo, who took office a month ago, has announced a bold target: $600 billion in investment to transform the country’s natural resources into high-value products. He calls it a cornerstone of his vision for 'Golden Indonesia 2045,' marking the country’s centennial. 'We invite foreign investors to come and participate,' Prabowo said during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 14. He outlined plans to develop 26 key commodities, spanning renewable energy, fisheries and mining, as part of Indonesia’s downstream industrialization strategy, known locally as hilirisasi. But as Prabowo courts international backers, analysts have raised concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts, regulatory consistency and challenges in sustaining local benefits. For Indonesia, downstreaming has become a buzzword for economic transformation in Southeast Asia’s largest country. By processing raw materials domestically – whether it’s refining nickel into ferronickel (an alloy of iron and nickel used to make stainless steel), or producing cosmetics using palm oil – the government hopes to reduce its reliance on commodity exports and strengthen its industrial base. The concept isn’t new. Under former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Indonesia banned raw nickel exports in favor of smelting and refining, a move that increased revenues from U.S. $800 million in 2015 to over $4 billion by mid-2023, according to government data. Prabowo’s administration aims to replicate this success across other sectors. 'This level of investment is reasonable over five years,' Wijayanto Samirin, an economist at Paramadina University in Jakarta, told BenarNews, referring to Prabowo’s target. Still, Wijayanto urged the Prabowo administration to avoid repeating the missteps of its predecessor, which he said had resorted to 'excessive tax incentives.' 'To make downstreaming work, several aspects must be improved to ensure that it not only adds economic value, but also upholds environmental, social and governance principles,' Wijayanto said. He identified key areas for reform, including labor and environmental regulations, infrastructure and institutional frameworks. 'The habit of giving away too many tax breaks needs to stop,' Wijayanto said. 'We must ensure that the government receives a fair share of revenue from foreign and domestic investors.' Prabowo’s proposal comes with promises to improve Indonesia’s business climate, including legal reforms, favorable tax incentives and economic stability. 'I think private business wants a certainty of the legal system, private business wants a favorable economic climate, political climate, stability, security, and good conditions, favorable incentives, and these we are addressing,' Prabowo said at the APEC summit. 'We have liberalized our laws, we open the health sector for foreign health companies, we are opening our education sector, we invite foreign universities to open campuses, we are inviting foreign hospitals to open their branches in Indonesia. Indonesia, he declared, was 'open for more business.' 'I’m determined to protect all investments, to give favorable economic conditions, and to be involved in the major economic organizations of the world, and to work together with all of you to create mutual prosperity,' Prabowo said. Criticism But his perceived reliance on foreign capital has drawn criticism. 'Foreign investors often stop at producing intermediate goods,' said Tauhid Ahmad, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF). 'To go further – toward finished products – we need stronger participation from local investors.' One example of this tension lies in Indonesia’s nickel industry. While the push for downstreaming has boosted exports, the focus remains on semi-finished products including ferronickel, which limit broader economic benefits. Tauhid argued that sectors such as agriculture and fisheries, with high local potential, should take precedence in future downstream efforts. Environmental and sustainability challenges Critics also point to environmental concerns. Despite Indonesia’s pledge to embrace renewable energy, much of its industrialization effort continues to rely on coal-fired power plants. 'Downstreaming powered by coal undermines its own goals,' said Nailul Huda, an economist at the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS). 'If implemented with clean energy, downstreaming could boost economic growth by 1.5 times. But under the current model, it exacerbates environmental damage.' Environmentalists warn that overextraction of natural resources could deplete reserves, turning Indonesia into an importer of raw materials in the future. 'Downstreaming must align with resource sustainability,' said Mahawan Karuniasa, an environmental scientist at the University of Indonesia. 'Otherwise, we risk running out of resources while leaving environmental devastation behind.' Prabowo’s efforts to attract international support have seen some success. During visits to China and the United States after he took office on Oct. 20, Prabowo secured over $10 billion in investment commitments for renewable energy and mining projects. China, Indonesia’s second-largest foreign investor, has funneled $34.19 billion into the country since 2019, while American companies have expressed interest in geothermal energy and carbon capture technology. The stakes are high. Prabowo’s vision for Golden Indonesia 2045 aims for 8% annual economic growth, a figure that economists call ambitious. 'Even 5.5% to 6% growth would be commendable if it’s sustainable,' Wijayanto said. 'What matters is the quality of growth.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVyEdbDNTlv_q	2024-11-21T17:39:03-08:00	
Russian Orthodox Church Viewed As Tool To Spread Kremlin Influenc...	The Russian Orthodox Church is quietly winning allegiance from priests and parishes from the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Egypt with offers of humanitarian aid, vaccines, infrastructure, schools, hospitals and spiritual patronage. Experts say this is a geopolitical strategy meant to help the Kremlin spreads its influence on the continent amid an ongoing battle within the Orthodox Church over the war in Ukraine. 'Most analysts of Russia’s presence in Africa would miss this development,' Bob Wekesa, director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI). 'Because it is not the most publicized of Russia’s strategy in Africa.' Located in the Egyptian port city, the Patriarchate of Alexandria looks after the continent’s estimated 1 million Eastern Orthodox Christians. The Russian Orthodox Church has for centuries been one of the most powerful bodies in orthodoxy and commands power beyond most religious denominations. It is closely linked to the Russian state and functions as a de facto arm of the government. J. Peter Pham, an ordained Episcopal priest with a doctorate in theology and a postgraduate degree in canon law, recently visited African churches and spoke with clergy from diverse denominations. 'Whenever I traveled in these areas where I’d heard it was happening, I started looking into it. And it turns out it wasn’t just one or two isolated cases,' Pham, who has served as the United States special envoy for the Great Lakes Region and was the first-ever Sahel envoy, told Foreign Policy magazine. 'It was a large number of African Orthodox clergy who had been part of the Patriarchate in Alexandria and had been recruited by the Moscow Patriarchate,' Pham added. 'It was very systematic.' Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has said that his clerics have been paid $200 each for joining the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2021, Russia established the Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa in response to requests from African Orthodox clergy after the Patriarch of Alexandria sided with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. The Russian Orthodox Church also opened more than 200 parishes in 25 African countries between December 2021 and July 2023, according to a report from the Russian news agency Interfax. The Russian church’s expansion 'is becoming a key component of the Kremlin’s exercise of soft power in Africa, promoting many conservative and anti-Western positions,' Charles A. Ray, wrote for the FPRI. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow claims that the Patriarchy of Alexandria will lead the body of believers into the Western sphere of influence, according to a Politics Today report, while his agenda reinforces Russia’s ambitions in Africa and asserts that African nations can protect themselves from external pressures. Theodore II shuns any efforts to politicize the Orthodox faith. In 2023, he warned the Orthodox world of the danger of Moscow’s political ambitions in Africa. In an Orthodox Times report, he said Orthodox Africans are being 'spiritually poisoned by the Patriarchate of Moscow.' Ray argued in the FPRI report that the Russian Orthodox Church’s expansion in Africa cannot be looked at without considering its relationship to Russian state interests. The church is financially supported by Kremlin-backed entities. 'Its expansion, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aims to challenge the existing Orthodox churches in Africa and to promote conservative, anti-Western alliances,' Ray wrote. 'It appears to be more about enhancing the Russian image and expanding state influence than religious conversion.' Wekesa said the Russian church faces an uphill task if it wants to convert Africans. 'I deduce that the Russian Orthodox (Church) will aim to capture a small elite tied to the top echelons of governments in pursuit of opaque Russian interests rather than winning large congregations,' he told the FPRI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV-6NLuv7Kb5m	2024-11-21T17:36:53-08:00	
Hermes 2 Construction Permits Approved By US Nuclear Regulatory C...	The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has voted to issue construction permits to Kairos Power for the Hermes 2 Demonstration Plant. The permits will authorise Kairos to build a facility with two 35 MWt molten salt-cooled reactors that would also include a shared power generation system. Kairos' Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor became the first US Gen IV reactor to receive a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) construction permit in December 2023, and now Hermes 2 becomes the first electricity-producing Gen IV plant to be approved for construction in the USA, Kairos said. Hermes 2 is intended to provide operational data to support the development of a larger version for commercial electricity production. Kairos submitted its application to build Hermes 2 in July 2023, and the NRC issued its final safety evaluation for the permits in July this year, and the final environmental assessment for site in August. 'While keeping safety at the forefront, the permitting process was quite efficient, and we issued these permits in less than 18 months,' said NRC Chair Christopher Hanson 'This shows we can rapidly apply relevant conclusions from earlier reviews to promptly reach decisions on new reactors.' Following a new, streamlined mandatory hearing process conducted via written documents, the NRC said it has authorised the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to issue the permits, having found the review by NRC staff of the Hermes 2 application 'adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings'. The permits are expected to be issued in the near future. 'The Commission's approval of the Hermes 2 construction permits marks an important step toward delivering clean electricity from advanced reactors to support decarbonisation,' Kairos CEO and co-founder Mike Laufer said. 'We are proud to lead the industry in advanced reactor licensing and look forward to continued collaboration with the NRC as we chart a path forward with future applications.' Hermes 2 plant will be built on land adjacent to the Hermes reactor, which is currently under construction. Kairos Power must apply for and obtain an operating licence from the NRC before the plant can start up.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1JB1Dgb_-Yx	2024-11-21T17:35:20-08:00	
Wealth And Income Inequality Are Essential For Social Cooperation...	By Michael Njoku It is popularly deemed a sign of moral superiority and a mark of the 'progressive' mind to heavily criticize the existence of inequalities of wealth and income within the social order of the division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. However, the sober mind, careful of being unduly biased by errant ideological presuppositions, is often found to hold views that run contrary to the prevalent lines of reasoning advanced by these critics. This includes the validity of the teachings of economics, not on the basis of blind belief, but as an outcome of scrutinizing the logical chains of reasoning advanced and the necessity of certain conclusions, including the reality of the existence (and even benefit) of inequalities in a free-market, capitalist society. This article affirms an economic ground for differentials in wealth and income of individuals under a capitalist system of production. Additionally, it offers a defense of these differentials, as logically necessary outcomes of socio-biological inequalities among acting men within the social order of division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. Social Division of Labor As Means To Ends Classical economics recognizes that greater productivity is to be derived from the social division of labor relative to autarkic self-sufficiency. It also recognizes that labor—the human factor of production—is essentially defined by its variability and differences in capacities possessed by various individuals in society. In regard to this last fact, all that the economist can say is that inequality exists among individuals and that it is causally relevant to the emergence of subsequent differences in outcomes among acting men within a market economy. Mises puts it very clearly in Human Action as follows: Economists must never disregard in their reasoning the fact that the innate and acquired inequality of men differentiates their adjustment to the conditions of their environment. Thus, individuals with varying skills, personalities, and mental dispositions integrate themselves into the social division of labor in order to satisfy their most urgent wants better than they would under autarkic conditions. The Ricardian Law of Association explains the tendency of these individuals to intensify their voluntary cooperation in the social division of labor given the prospect of better want satisfaction. Origin of Differentials of Individual Wealth and Income in a Capitalist Society Each individual, in choosing his career or line of work, goes where the expected marginal value productivity of his labor is higher. This is achieved by means of the price system. For specific economic categories, such as the entrepreneur and capitalist, this is a risky venture implying the possibility of losses, since all actions aimed toward the future are necessarily uncertain. Furthermore, each participant in a given productive venture has claims to definite quantities of output by virtue of titles to definite quantities of input factors in the production process. Also, to the contributions of each participant is imputed a premium, which is graduated according to the height of value attached by the consumers to this contribution in the final product. The interplay of these facts explains the origin of inequalities of wealth and income in a market society. Thus, we can essentially boil down the origin of inequality of wealth and income in a capitalist system to the following factors: a) differentials in the physiological constitution and geography of acting men as evidenced in their various skills, competencies, and intelligence; b) better foresight and correct anticipation of the future state of the market by certain individuals relative to others; c) marginal value productivity of various input factors—implying that only the final consumers, by their evaluations, can judge whether one’s contribution to the final product is worthy of high remuneration or not. Consequent upon the above demonstrations, the Marxists’ claim that the entire output of production belongs to labor, as an economic category distinct from entrepreneurs, capitalists, and landowners, becomes grossly unfounded on the following grounds: First, labor is not the only input factor in the production process; it combines its powers with the natural powers stored up in the capital goods and resources previously accumulated by the capitalists and landowners, respectively. Second, the central entrepreneurial task of directing these factors of production to those lines that aim at satisfying the most urgent of the not-yet-satisfied needs of consumers, and the subsequent success of this task as evidenced by profits, would not have been made without the purposeful actions of the entrepreneur. Comparative Criteria of Justice Under Capitalism and Socialism Every socio-economic system implies a logically-prior ethical framework by which the actions of individuals are evaluated. With the prior sanction of this ethical system, it becomes established how future actions of men in society would be evaluated. Here, we shall look at the comparative criteria of justice under capitalism and socialism, respectively. The distributive justice of a capitalist system is tied to its peculiar ethic of private property. All property in a capitalist society—including inputs to productive ventures and proceeds from them—are clearly defined and can be traced to specific owners. Ownership title to property is gained through original appropriation of previously-unowned resources and contractual transfer of existing property titles from a previous owner to a new owner. Every man cooperating in the social division of labor is entitled to the products of his efforts in the production process. There is no room for arbitrariness under this distributive criterion. Only by not participating in production or by means of aggression and violence by the state can a man be denied his entitlements. The socialist distributive criteria, on the other hand, disconnect productivity from reward insofar as property relations between individuals and input factors are less defined, and given that all the input factors are 'collectively owned' by the socialist community with control of its allocations being vested in the hands of a designated caretaker. Under this state of affairs, income is assigned and calibrated according to the arbitrary value judgments of the planner as against the evaluations of the final consumer under capitalism. This includes the decision to enforce quantitatively-equal distribution of proceeds of production among participants in the social division of labor of the socialist community—regardless of differentials in skill and level of complexity of task. From the above, it follows that justice in a capitalist system is evaluated differently from justice in a socialist commonwealth. More particularly, the socialist conception of justice aims at the violent enforcement of egalitarianism and subjection of the able and competent producers in complete servitude of the less able and less competent. Misapplying the criteria of distribution of socialism to a capitalist system would have the effect of destroying the incentive structure that impels action under a capitalist system of production. When individuals can no longer tie the level of productivity to reward due to violent intervention, they become disincentivized to produce as they would in the absence of violent intervention. Thus, the ultimate outcome of this would be a fall in productivity. There is a critical error in discussions about wealth and income distribution and, consequently, justice under a capitalist system. This leads to a tendency to transfer the arbitrary distribution criteria of a centrally-planned economy to the private property criterion of a free-market economy. When people criticize the distributive justice of a capitalist system, all they merely imply is a substitution of the socialist distribution criteria for the existing state of affairs.

Khamenei’s Legacy For Iran: Poverty, Repression, And A Failing Ec...	Over the past half-century, Iran has experienced a devastating economy that has destroyed the homes and livelihoods of many of its people. Amid this, the crisis-inducing and perpetuating policies of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, as the successor to regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, have been the primary drivers of the most destructive economic crises in the country. Suppression of progressive forces domestically and the export of terrorism and fundamentalism abroad have led to a horrifying spiral that has eradicated Iranians’ living conditions, productivity, and welfare. Despite the weakening of religious fascism in recent years, the resulting crises persist. Today, the Iranian people must either endure polluted air filled with heavy fuel oil and substandard gasoline, resigning themselves to a slow death, or suffer through exhausting blackouts. To afford a simple meal, such as an omelet, one must buy tomatoes priced at 700,000 rials per kilogram. Even state media have admitted the policy failures of the past fifty years. These policies have led to widespread poverty, technological decline, low-quality production, capital flight, rising unemployment, and inflation. On November 16, Jahan-e Sanat news website reported, 'There is serious contention within Iran’s ruling political institutions over which political ideology, faction, or economic approach has played the primary role in creating the storm-tossed economy… The reality is that various governments collectively cooked up the stew that is Iran’s economy, and there’s no escaping this narrative. Broadly speaking, one could argue that the heavy, enduring shadow of politics—especially Iran’s foreign policy—has been the main factor behind the current economic situation.' Seventeen Years of Investment Stagnation Recent studies by the Majlis Research Center reveal that since 2007, investment in Iran’s industrial sector has been declining, plunging the sector into a phase of investment stagnation. On November 5, the state-run Etemad newspaper wrote, 'Apart from negative events such as economic sanctions and the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, an unfavorable business environment, inconsistent and unstable economic policies, increased government interference in industries, and similar factors have caused a 17-year recession in Iran’s industrial sector' (Etemad newspaper, November 5, 2024). The Cost of Denial, Concealment, and Refusal to Face Reality Investment stagnation is just one example, while the energy imbalance crisis, now widely discussed, has been denied for years. Policies of denial and concealing shortcomings inevitably lead to failure. On November 12, the state-run Setareh Sobh newspaper wrote,' If there had been room for open media and free criticism, labeled as ‘blackening,’ we wouldn’t be here. Escalating crises in many environmental areas, sinkholes and land subsidence, exaggerated claims of self-sufficiency in food products, and disregarding expert opinions… have brought us to a point we wish we had never reached.' The Crossroad of Misery or Warmongering Recently, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Abdolnaser Hemmati, said that the average economic growth over the past thirty years has not exceeded 3%, with much of this illusory growth dependent on the sale of the country’s oil resources, imposing high inflation on Iran’s impoverished population. On November 5, Basirat news website wrote, 'All expert assessments predict continued low economic growth and high inflation in our country this year and next. From the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which in their latest reports forecast 3% to 3.5% growth and 29% to 32% inflation for the current and upcoming years, to the Majlis Research Center, which predicts 2.5% to 2.8% growth and 34% to 31% inflation for the years 2024 and 2025.' The news of capital flight (approximately $16 billion in the past two to three years), smuggling (about $31 billion), and corruption (ranking 149th out of 180 countries) is repetitive. On November 5, the state-run Shargh newspaper wrote, 'We are now in an extremely critical situation where risky decisions not only lead to the failure of economic policies and development goals but also painfully impact the frail and weakened body of a society in which one-third lives below the absolute poverty line, and the middle class is evaporating. Capital flights are horrifying. And… a fundamental question arises: Are the first and foremost duties of governance to provide welfare and comfort for the people and advance the country’s development, or not? The choice lies between reducing poverty and increasing social wealth or adhering to specific ideological ideas and aspirations.' It is evident that the regime’s response is nothing but increased poverty, misery, and repression of millions of people, along with the plundering of the nation’s resources and assets for warmongering and exporting terrorism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxXImImev-nK	2024-11-21T17:29:20-08:00	
Pentagon Confirms Russia Launched New IRBM Missile At Dnipro, US ...	By C. Todd Lopez The Russians launched Thursday a new kind of missile at Ukraine, what the Defense Department is calling an 'intermediate-range ballistic missile,' or IRBM, said the deputy Pentagon press secretary. 'I can confirm that Russia did launch an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile,' said Sabrina Singh during a briefing today at the Pentagon. 'This IRBM was based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile model. In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was prenotified, briefly, before the launch, through nuclear risk reduction channels.' The IRBM missile was launched at the city of Dnipro. While Singh said the missile carried a conventional warhead, she also said it's possible the missile could be fitted with other warheads as well. 'It could be refitted to certainly carry different types of ... conventional or nuclear warheads,' she said. The Defense Department has characterized the IRBM as 'experimental' in that it's the first time a weapon of its kind has been used on the battlefield in Ukraine, Singh said. 'This was a new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield,' she said. 'That's certainly [of] concern to us ... I don't have an assessment of its impacts right now, but it's something that, of course, we're concerned by.' Singh also said an IRBM and an intercontinental ballistic missile have similar flight paths, high trajectories and can carry large payloads. 'But the main difference lies in the range and the strategic purpose,' she said. Also, this week, the Defense Department confirmed that the United States would provide to Ukraine antipersonnel landmines. Yesterday in Laos, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III explained why the U.S. would provide antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine and how what the U.S. would provide is different than the landmines the Ukrainians are currently producing for themselves. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting they've kind of changed their tactics a bit and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore,' Austin said. 'They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close in and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces.' In the face of that changing tactic, Austin said, the Ukrainians have been manufacturing their own landmines to slow down Russian advances. 'They're fabricating their own antipersonnel landmines right now,' he said. 'The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent. You know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate. And that makes it, you know, far more safe eventually than the things that they are creating on their own.' Singh told reporters that the Ukrainians have assured the U.S. that the landmines, when they arrive, will be used only inside Ukrainian space. 'Absolutely they have committed that they're going to use these mines in their own territory,' she said. 'I should have added that they're not going to use them in populated areas.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVx-Jwg1rdqYt	2024-11-21T17:27:27-08:00	
US Court Indictment Of Indian Billionaire Adani And Impact On Ind...	Gautam Adani had allegedly used US investors' money for bribing Indian officials to get big contracts in the solar energy sector Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who rules over a multinational business empire worth tens of billions of dollars, is now facing an arrest warrant from a New York court. According to Reuters, prosecutors are planning to hand the arrest warrants to foreign law enforcement. If executed, the warrant will leave an indelible black mark on his reputation as India's top-most businessman with the greatest influence on India's powerful Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Wednesday, a grand jury in New York indicted Gautam Adani and seven others on charges of bribing Indian officials to the tune of US$ 265 million to get US$ 2 billion worth of contracts in the booming Indian solar energy sector. The bribe money had been collected and paid by perpetrating a fraud on US investors, the indictment alleges. Lisa H Miller, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division, accused Adani of conspiring to obtain lucrative supply contracts 'through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors'. US Court Charges A federal court in Brooklyn saw a five-count criminal indictment, charging Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain, executives of Adani Green Energy (AGE) with conspiracies to commit substantive securities fraud. They played key roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from US investors and global financial institutions by giving false and misleading statements. The indictment also charges Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of a renewable-energy company with securities that had traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2023 and also Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal and Deepak Malhotra, former employees of a Canadian institutional investor, with conspiracy to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with Adani's bribery scheme. Indian Officials Bribed The indictment alleged that Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain lied about their 'bribery scheme' as they sought to raise capital from US and international investors. The indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice. 'The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute corrupt, deceptive, and obstructive conduct that violates US law, no matter where in the world it occurs,' the filing said. Getting Solar Contract Between 2020 and 2024, the defendants agreed to pay more than US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to obtain lucrative solar energy supply contracts which were projected to generate more than US$ 2 billion in profits after tax over an approximately 20-year period. On several occasion, Gautam S. Adani personally met with an Indian government official to advance the 'bribery scheme' and the defendants held in-person meetings with each other to discuss aspects of its execution, court filings said. The defendants frequently discussed their efforts in furtherance of the bribery scheme, including through an electronic messaging application. The defendants extensively documented their corrupt efforts. Sagar R. Adani used his cellular phone to track specific details of the bribes offered and promised to government officials. Vneet S. Jaain used his cellular phone to photograph a document summarizing various bribe amounts the US partner owed the Indian Energy Company for its respective portion of the bribes. And Rupesh Agarwal prepared and distributed to other defendants multiple analyses using PowerPoint and Excel that summarized various options for paying and concealing bribe payments and deleting incriminating messages. There are documents allegedly showing conversations and other material records that show money raised from US investors was allegedly used to bribe government officials in India. Power Pacts Signed According to the court filings, following the promise of bribes to Indian government officials, between July 2021 and February 2022, electricity distribution boards in the States or Union Territories of Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a federal Indian government owned enterprise. Andhra Pradesh's electricity distribution companies entered into a PSA with SECI on or about December 1, 2021, pursuant to which the state agreed to purchase approximately seven gigawatts of solar power- by far the largest amount of any Indian state or region. The allegation is that a large chunk of the bribe was directed at officials in Andhra Pradesh. Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, who were working for Azure Power (an Indian company which was also listed in the New York Stock Exchange between 2016 and 2023) joined Adani's bribery scheme, to convince state power distribution organizations to buy power from SECI. Why Is US Concerned? It is alleged that Azure Power and the Adanis concealed the bribery scheme from US banks and investors from whom they raised billions for the solar energy project. 'Adani Green Energy tried to raise money from US and international investors with a 2021 bond offering on the basis of false and misleading statements about the firm's anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts,' The New York Times reported. The non-disclosure and bribing, serious charges, lie at the heart of the US federal probe and indictment. NYT reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 'filed a parallel civil case saying that Adani Green Energy raised more than 175 million USD from US investors'. The report adds that one of Adani's associates was charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). That law makes bribing foreign officials a crime for companies operating in the US. The FCPA, established in 1977 after a series of corporate scandals, makes it illegal to offer, pay, or promise anything of value to foreign officials to gain business advantage. Therefore, even though the allegations of bribery might have taken place in Indian states, American authorities started investigations because the case involved American entities and investors. In Adani's case, following the indictment, the trial will likely move to the 'arraignment' stage. The judge will communicate the charges and decide whether to grant bail to the accused persons. The accused can decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty in response to the charges. If they plead not guilty, the case will proceed to a 'jury' trial. Impact on India and Indo-US Relations The Adani group has trashed the allegations as baseless and added that it will take to all legal means to prove it. But the Congress party which has been accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being in cahoots with Adani for mutual benefit, has called for Adani's immediate arrest. While Modi and the government itself are silent, BJP leader Sambit Patra said that the law could take its course. Experts say that the case will definitely harm the reputation of the Adani group in the Indian and international market especially among foreign investors who will take a dim view of corporate governance in India. Shares of Adani Group companies tanked up to 20% on the Bombay Stock Exchange in Thursday's intra-day trade after Gautam Adani, was charged by US prosecutors. The Adani company, Adani Green, has called off the issue of US dollar denominated bonds worth US$ 600 million. If the case proceeds badly for Adani, it will further damage his position in India. But as Wilson Centre South Asia expert Michael Kugelman says. it will be difficult for Indian business and State institutions to disentangle themselves from Adani as he is heavily present in the infrastructure and energy sectors, which also happen to be Prime Minister Modi's favourite sectors. As for India-US relations, Kugelman points out that US President-elect Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have a symbiotic relationship and some of Trump's key appointees are pro-India, like Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), Michael Waltz (National Security Advisor) and Tulsi Gabbard (National Intelligence Chief). They are China hawks too. And for any US administration, India is key to resisting China's ambitions in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Pro-Modi elements in India say that the US Administration under Trump might cover up the damage caused by the Adani affair and get on with the job of maintaining cordial political, economic and defence ties, keeping the looming threat from China in mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5ksEsZ2uwv0	2024-11-21T17:15:38-08:00	
Trump’s Opportunity To Reset US-Iran Relations – Analysis	Donald Trump is back and so is the 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran to 'drastically throttle' Iran's oil sales to kill Tehran’s nuclear program and its ability to fund regional proxies. But Trump aide Brian Hook who ran the anti-Iran campaign in Trump’s first term claimed Trump has 'no interest in regime change.' That may be true but Iran, and everyone else, probably doesn’t believe it. The Trump 47 officials may soon learn that 2025 is not 2018 and, while Iran was on the ropes as Trump’s first term ended, things are different now. To start, open-handed American support for Israel’s campaigns against the Palestinian and Lebanese people has eroded support for U.S. moves by Middle East governments that might normally favor limits on Iran’s behavior. Saudi Arab’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), declared Israel was committing 'genocide' in Gaza. By using the G-word, MbS has made it hard for his government to walk back his remarks or reverse course absent a cease fire and implementation of something like the Arab Peace Initiative (which has been gathering dust since 2002 and may need a reboot). MbS also warned Israel against attacking Iran. Arab-Sunni Saudi Arabia and Persian-Shia Iran have been drawing closer since 2023 they agreed to resume ties after seven years of tensions. That the deal was brokered by China is a sign the regional powers had little confidence in a U.S. role, possibly suspecting it is in Washington’s (and Jerusalem’s) interest to keep the countries of the region divided. The countries’ military chiefs recently held defense talks, and planned a joint military exercisein the Red Sea (that probably won’t be interrupted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.) In the civil realm, the countries are moving toward increased economic ties. The presidents of the United Arab Emirates and Iran held their first face-to-face talks in October, and UAE – Iran trade is on the upswing, and the Saudi crown prince (and de facto ruler) recently spoke to Iran’s new president. Qatar (which shares a natural gas field with Iran) and Iran are trying to broaden their economic ties that are largely based on hydrocarbons, and Iran supported Qatar during the Saudi-led 2017-2021 attempt to isolate Doha for allegedly supporting terrorism, though criticism of Riyadh by Doha-based Al Jazeera and friendship with Iran are the likely reasons. After a recent exchange of fire by Israel and Iran, Iran warned its neighbors not to attack Iran or to help the Israelis, and the Gulf Cooperation Council promptly declared, 'Our focus has been on de-escalation.' The Gulf states are dubious about 'maximum pressure' and are concerned it will upend warming relations with Iran and increase regional tensions. Middle Eastern governments are sensitive to public anger over American support for Israel’s killing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon, so will avoid any display of support for a U.S. campaign that may target Arab or Muslim peoples. The countries that signed up for the Abraham Accords may soon look pretty foolish, so when MbS accused Israel of 'genocide' in Gaza he was demonstrating Saudi Arabia's distaste for the U.S. line, unlike the UAE which has increased daily airline flights to Israel. Also wary of a renewed U.S.-Israeli campaign against Iran and the Central Asian republics. The republics are growing their trade ties to Iran, a market of 90 million people, and the host of seaports at Bandar Abbas and Chabahar, essential for Central Asia trade with Asia and Africa. Iran also hosts the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer multi-modal transport corridor that connects India to Europe, and is Plan B if a transport route through Afghanistan and Pakistan is not reliable. Iran has been actively working to strengthen its relations with Central Asian countries as part of its Look East strategy which has seen increased relations with China, Russia, and to offset the effect of Western sanctions. Iran's Foreign Minister has engaged in discussions with his counterparts in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the other republics and the newly-elected president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, has met the presidents of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In Central Asia. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan have all increased trade links with Iran, in Tajikistan’s case to include a defense pact. The republics don’t want to sacrifice the opportunity in Iran, a country with a consumer market projected to grow 11% by 2030. Iran's focus on Central Asia includes improving trade ties, developing infrastructure projects, and increasing connectivity through transportation networks. For example, Iran has proposed linking the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project to its own network, which would provide Central Asian countries with access to the Persian Gulf and beyond. And the oil market has changed since 2018. According to Argus Media, Iran’s oil exports, which were below 500,000 b/d through the second half of 2019 and 2020 due to Trump-era sanctions, began increasing in 2021 and have increased every year since: 'Exports averaged around 1.6mn b/d in January-October [in 2024].' If the U.S. again sanctions Iran, it may find it hard going as the remaining buyers may be 'those who do not necessarily fear sanctions.' Iran has built out its network to bypass sanctions, and has expanded its tanker fleet, though the clandestine effort is not without substantial costs, such as Chinese customers demanding a substantial discount, and the cost of rebranding the oil to disguise its origin. Iran has an oil export terminal on the Gulf of Oman, which was inaugurated in July 2021, and can export 1 million barrels per day of oil. The facility cannot replace Iran’s main export terminal at Kharg, which can handle 8 million barrels per day, but it allows Iran to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic chokepoint and will require the Americans to try to cover two terminals instead of just the main facility at Kharg if Washington decides to attack Iran The U.S. may try to interdict Iran’s oil exports to China, but what will China’s response be if it considers the interdiction an act of piracy? Beijing may decide to provide a naval escort for the oil shipments or may reflag the vessels as Chinese, upping the ante for the Americans. If the Peoples’ Liberation Army Navy, the world’s largest navy with newer vessels than the U.S. Navy, deploys to escort the tankers it will refine its 'blue water' operating skills. The increased operating tempo will also stress the U.S. fleet which for the second time in a year has no aircraft carrier in the Middle East. A recent U.S. Navy report noted on the material readiness of Navy ships: 'several functional areas and subsystems remained degraded or showed declining trends' since 2017, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted in 2021 the Navy needed to improve its limited capacity for battle damage repair, in the event the U.S. and any foe come to blows. And if the U.S. seizes a China-bound cargo, then what? The ship will have to be anchored somewhere, the cargo will possibly be offloaded and stored, the crew will need to be housed and fed, consular support will need to be provided, and someone will have to guard the vessel. China is the biggest trading partner for every country between the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea, so the U.S. may be unable to find volunteers for these low-return chores. The U.S. ignored the warning of former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski who said the U.S. should avoid actions that would create 'a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an 'antihegemonic' coalition.' The U.S. has masterfully created that coalition by expanding NATO, ignoring the One China Policy, and sponsoring the 1953 coup in Iran that has freighted the Iranian people with more and more authoritarian rulers. But the ascension of new presidents in Tehran and Washington may be an opportunity to start rebuilding relations. After his election in July 2024, President Masoud Pezeshkian announced his program in 'My Message to the New World' and declared his intent to strengthen relations with Iran’s neighbors, specifically mentioning Iraq, Türkiye, and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. He emphasized the need for a 'strong region,' said he hoped for 'constructive dialogue' with Europe, criticized the U.S. for exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and urged Washington 'come to terms with reality.' In October, President-elect Trump declared, 'I would like to see Iran be very successful. The only thing is, they can't have a nuclear weapon.' In 2023, then-Senator JD Vance said that Republican senators who wanted at attack Iran were 'living in the past.' In 2024, Republican Vice-President candidate JD Vance said, 'And our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran. It would be a huge distraction of resources. It would be massively expensive to our country,' Those are hopeful signs of a desire to reach a negotiated solution, but can the U.S. abide by any deal once the ink is dry? Neither Russia, China, nor Iran believe the U.S. will abide by the spirit and letter of any agreement as it has a record of bailing out of any commitments when it is convenient, to wit, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty NATO expansion ('not one inch eastward') Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Paris Agreement (Paris Climate Accord) Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Minsk agreements Open Skies Treaty Algiers Accord One China Policy U.S. intervention in Iran started with the 1953 coup. The U.S. then supported Iraq during 1980-1988 war after the U.S. and Iran agreed on the Algiers Accords (January 1981) where the U.S. pledged, 'it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran's internal affairs,' but this did not stop the U.S. from backing Iraq when the war starting to go in Iran’s favor in 1982. The U.S. killed General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq when he was carrying a message to Saudi Arabia in an effort to defuse tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. Many Iranians and Saudis probably think Soleimani was killed because he was working to reduce tensions in the region, which they think only benefits the U.S. and Israel. Then there is the killing of civilian Iranian scientists involved in nuclear power research. No one has taken the credit, but the Iranians no doubt believe it was the Americans or the Israelis with American connivance. Last is the STUXNET virus, a joint U.S.-Israel effort to attack break Iranian nuclear centrifuge equipment which 'leaked' and infected computers worldwide. The Chair of the NATO Military Committee recently admitted the only reason NATO troops are not is Ukraine fighting Russian troops is because Russia has nuclear weapons, which no doubt confirmed the views of Iranians who think the country should have nuclear weapons. Then there is the cautionary tale of Libya’s surrender of its nuclear program, and the mystery of why North Korea, one of the poorest and most isolated countries in the world, has not been attacked by the U.S. Iran’s relations with Russia and China have strengthened which adds to the country’s resilience. China and Iran signed a 25-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement in March 2021. This agreement aims to enhance bilateral relations and includes significant investments from China in Iran's economy. China plans to invest $400 billion in Iran's oil, gas, petrochemicals, transportation, and manufacturing sectors. In return, China will receive a steady and heavily-discounted supply of Iranian oil. The agreement allows China to deploy security personnel to protect its projects in Iran. The investments will also go towards upgrading Iran's infrastructure, and the agreement supports China's One Belt One Road Initiative, by enhancing connectivity and trade routes. Russia has supplied Iran with Su-35 fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters, Yak-130 pilot training aircraft; Iran has sent Russia drones, and ballistic missiles. Non-military trade is also increasing. The Moscow Times reports, 'Russian exports to Iran rose 27% last year, and Russian imports from Iran increased 10%. Both sides have agreed to scale up trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while Russia has pledged to invest an unprecedented $40 billion in Iran’s oil and gas sector.' The Times also notes, 'Perhaps the most important changes, however, have been in transport networks. As a result of the fighting in Ukraine, and in a bid to bypass Western sanctions, Russia has begun shifting trade routes southward. This is why Iran and Russia have ramped up work to develop the much-touted and ambitious International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which will stretch from the Persian Gulf to the Baltic Sea.' Despite its economic problems, Iran has increased its military budget, no doubt anticipating attacks by America or Israel. At the same time Iran has signaled it is willing to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but not 'under pressure.' Iran’s foreign ministerAbbas Araqchi clarified that when he told state television, ''There is still an opportunity for diplomacy, although this opportunity is not much. It is a limited opportunity.' A recent IAEA report notes Iran has begun implementing measures 'aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile [of near bomb-grade uranium]' though the IAEA also noted that Iran increased its inventory of 60% enriched uranium by 60% since the last report in August 2024. Iran's President Pezeshkian has indicated he is open to U.S. engagement: ''Whether we like it or not, we will face the United States in regional and international arenas, and it's better that we manage this arena ourselves.' And opinion leaders in Iran are saying their government should engage with Trump, with Shargh, the reformist daily newspaper editorializing that President Pezeshkian, must 'avoid past mistakes and assume a pragmatic and multidimensional policy,' though others are skeptical anything will change under Trump. Even the Quds Force commander, General Qassem Soleimani, once mused: 'maybe it’s time to rethink our relationship with the Americans,' though in the end it didn’t do him much good. All that said, 'maximum pressure' is a slogan, not a strategy. If Iran says 'Yes,' will Washington finally produce a coherent, executable strategy for its future dealings with Iran? Up to now its only strategy has been 'more sanctions,' hoping some liberals will miraculously appear and (democratically) seize power when in fact the Revolutionary Guard may take over and finally dispense with Vilayat-e Faqih. Whatever strategy Washington produces will be overshadowed by the disastrous retreat from Afghanistan in 2021, so the U.S. should favor a policy that increases regional connectivity and economic growth rather than carrying water for Israel or satisfying its desire to avenge the humiliation of 1979. Iran won’t surrender its hard-won nuclear expertise and has increased cooperation with the IAEA, but will it ever dash to the bomb? Israel claims it destroyed key Iranian nuclear fabrication facilities but the head of the IAEA said of the attack, 'as far as the IAEA is concerned, we do not see this as a nuclear facility.' Trump will not want to start a war with Iran over its nuclear program as he will be sensitive to the impact on the U.S. economy, so sanctions (and the occasional Israeli attack) will be all he has left. If that is the case, and Iran’s economy and oil export scheme is resilient enough, and Russia and China remain constant, we may be looking at years of low-level 'endless wars' to the joy of the Iran hawks in Washington. And there is a deadline of sorts for negotiations with Iran: 18 October 2025 sees the end of the JCPOA snapback mechanism, the last opportunity for world powers to initiate the snapback mechanism, returning all the sanctions that were lifted in the JCPOA agreement…' If the U.S. rejoins any sort of nuclear deal, it will have to be a new deal as Iran blew past the JCPOA 1.0 conditions after the U.S. abandoned the agreement. If the Americans want to expand a 2.0 deal to include ballistic missiles or Iran’s foreign policy, Iran may suggest similar limits on other countries in the region, and then demand that 2.0 be a treaty to bound future U.S. action, and to exploit differences in the U.S. on what is a 'good deal' that will be all too evident once the Senate takes up the treaty for ratification. So far, each side has demonstrated a lack of empathy for the other, the result of years of successful propagandizing, leaving each feeling more sinned against than sinning. And the hard-liners in each capital believe in the other’s perfidy, see conflict as key to their continued influence, and reap economic rewards from the status quo. On the U.S. side, Washington has never explained to American citizens its role in the 1953 coup that stifled Iran’s economic and political development, though Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitted the U.S. role in overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 and called the coup 'a setback for Iran’s political development.' To many Americans, the 1979 revolution and the hostage crisis appeared out of thin air. The U.S. needs to think long-term. Iran’s mullahs won’t rule forever and Americas association with economic hardship and violence won’t benefit it in the future. The U.S. should adopt a parallel effort to President Pezeshkian’s 'strong region' plan to emphasize trade and connectivity which will help the region make up the gains sacrificed in the 'lost decades' of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Despite all the talk about what Trump might do, Biden is still the U.S. president until 11:59 on 20 January 2025. If both sides stick to what is feasible, keep their emotions and hard-liners in check, and Iran offers Trump a deal that he feels only he could have made, we may see stability and more economic opportunity for the region’s youth and the start of the banishment of the legacies of 1953 and 1979.

Bulgaria’s Pro-Russian Parties Display Increasingly Open Ties Wit...	By Krassen Nikolov (EurActiv) -- After the radical Vazrazhdane party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (PES) has become the second pro-Russian formation in the Bulgarian parliament to openly display its contacts with the Kremlin, with both parties having a total of 57 seats in Bulgaria’s 240-seat parliament. BSP-United Left MP Ivan Petkov travelled to Sochi on 17 November to participate in the first forum dedicated to 'building a relationship between BRICS countries and European countries'. The Bulgarian MP also met with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who regularly threatens the US and EU countries with Russian nuclear strikes over their support for Ukraine. 'All the representatives from Europe had a separate meeting with the former president and prime minister of Russia, who is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev. At the meeting, the problems that European countries have were discussed, as well as the opportunities for cooperation in the near future, both with Russia and with the BRICS countries,' the MP added. He claims that the meeting with Medvedev at the Sirius Olympic Village near Sochi was attended by 'a large number of representatives from the parliaments of Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Serbia, Greece, the Czech Republic, France, England, as well as many members of the European Parliament'. Euractiv asked the Bulgarian Socialist Party for information about Petkov's visit to Russia, but it did not receive a response. 'The forum provided an opportunity not only for a general discussion but also for private conversations between the delegations of the individual countries. I am the only participant from Bulgaria,' said Petkov. The forum in Sochi was dedicated to the topics 'BRICS and Europe in the context of large-scale geopolitical restructuring' and 'The role of BRICS and European countries in building a fairer and mutually beneficial world economic order'. A few days before the Sochi visit, Petkov also organised a public meeting with Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova at a BSP club in Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv. 'No matter how hard our current international partners try, they will not be able to destroy our centuries-old traditions, and the Bulgarian people will continue to support the Russian Federation as their brother,' said Petkov during the meeting in Plovdiv. The BSP is one of the parties in the Bulgarian parliament with which the centre-right GERB party of former prime minister Boyko Borissov (EPP) held a meeting to explore the possibility of forming a governing majority. Earlier this week, the Bulgarian counter-intelligence service (SANS) received a tip-off that the closed Russian consulate in Varna was illegally operating out of the city's BSP centre. The Bulgarian Socialists are the second parliamentary formation to establish relations with the Kremlin this year. In August, the pro-Russian radical party Vazrazhdane sent its delegation to a BRICS forum in Moscow, personally led by party leader Kostadin Kostadinov. Before the European elections, a delegation from Vazrazhdane attended a conference of Putin's United Russia party. After the visit, it was announced that the party would become part of the far-right ID group in the European Parliament. With the ID group splintering into several groups in the new European Parliament, Vazrazhdane decided to join the AfD-led Sovereignists group.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-21T17:09:46-08:00	
Biden Leaves Office But Risks War With Russia – OpEd	Democrats are in a collective state of panic because Donald Trump is returning to the presidency. But Joe Biden is escalating conflict in the Ukraine proxy war against Russia and endangering the whole world in the process. If Trump is a fascist, then surely Biden is as well. While every Donald Trump utterance is given great attention and dissected for proof of nefarious intent, dangerous actions taken by Joe Biden are minimized or go unreported altogether. The corporate media have never investigated the likelihood that Biden and his foreign policy team sabotaged the NordStream pipelines in 2022 in order to cut European allies’ connection to the Russian gas they depended upon. Two years went by before the New York Times reported that Turkiye hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine which might have ended the proxy war before thousands of lives were lost. Even as the Times reported that talks had taken place, the 'paper of record' neglected to mention that the Biden administration and the former prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson , scuttled the talks and kept a dangerous conflict in place. It is important to remember these and other failures to adequately report Biden administration actions which have very serious consequences. Biden will be president of the United States only until January 20, 2025. Yet with less than nine weeks remaining in his presidency, he has chosen to escalate tensions with Russia in an effort to continue his failed policies and also to prevent Trump from changing them. On November 17, 2024, the corporate media began to report a serious change in policy which the Biden administration suddenly instructed them to cover. Biden decided to give Ukraine permission to use the U.S. Army Tactical Mission System (ATACMS) and send missiles into Russian territory. ATACMS requires U.S. staffing and technical expertise, which puts the U.S. and all NATO nations in direct conflict with the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin already said that such an action crosses a 'red line' and is an act of war. In response to Biden’s decision, Putin changed the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The new doctrine states, 'Aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the involvement or backing of a nuclear state, will be considered a joint attack on Russia.' While the not-yet-president Trump is routinely labeled as deranged and a danger to the nation and to the world, the current president is behaving very irresponsibly and risking conflict with another nuclear power. It is not just anti-imperialists and peace activists who oppose this rash act. The Department of Defense, the Pentagon, opposed the administration's neo-conservatives who recommended allowing Ukraine to attack inside Russia. On September 13, 2024, the prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, met with Biden at the urging of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is the administration leader in advocating for escalation. Starmer wanted to use British-made Storm Shadow missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden didn’t make the call at that moment but obviously, the subject was not far from his mind. While the Pentagon gave a thumbs down to the plan, others in the administration never gave up hope that they could carry out an escalation that was unlikely to change the course of the war. They added a dose of war propaganda to their misguided efforts in order to make the case for endangering the rest of the world. Suddenly reports appeared claiming that up to 10,000 troops from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea, are stationed in Russia and are assisting in the war effort. While there are countless images of the war in Ukraine, no one has managed to produce a photograph or any video footage of thousands of Koreans. It strains credulity that such a presence could be kept secret or would not be documented in one of the most documented conflicts in modern history. In the end, it is the neocons who usually win in this and other administrations. It is unlikely they had to do very much convincing to Biden, who as Barack Obama’s vice president was in charge of the policy which used Ukraine to counter Russia. The 2014 coup against Ukraine’s elected president and the subsequent sabotaging of the Minsk I and Minsk II agreements all led to the current moment. In 2022 Ukraine baited the Russians by attacking the Donbas and daring them to leave that region unprotected after years of provocations and many civilian deaths. Donald Trump has indicated that he would change U.S. policy towards Ukraine, although he also led the republicans to approve $61 billion in funding for this war effort in April of this year. Biden is tenacious in his maniacal determination and remains obsessed with his Ukraine project and with Vladimir Putin. He leaves office with a last gasp, a throw of the dice to force Trump’s hand and give him a war that he would be unlikely to end. No members of the Senate or House of Representatives have raised their voices to sound the alarm about Biden’s disregard for their prerogatives and for the safety of the nation. The corporate media continue to act like scribes and refuse to provide the analysis that is needed to adequately cover this important story. While liberals stay in a constant state of panic about Trump’s appointments and about what he might do as president, the current president has brought the nation to the brink because of what will ultimately be a futile effort to crush Russia’s sovereignty. As we enter a new phase of Trump derangement syndrome, it is important to know that he should not be treated as some sort of exception in the pantheon of presidents. The doctrine of Full Spectrum Dominance prevails no matter who is president of the United States. Bill Clinton bombed Yugoslavia, George W. Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama destroyed Libya, Donald Trump attempted regime change in Venezuela and Iran, and Joe Biden is determined to continue a bloody proxy war in Ukraine, even as he commits himself to genocide in a gruesome partnership with Israel. The U.S. has entered a new and very dangerous phase of its attempt to dominate the world because of Joe Biden’s unhinged determination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV4E55-lr2y1y	2024-11-21T17:08:17-08:00	
Russia’s Use Of Advanced Missile Sends Signal To West – Analysis	By Myroslava Gongadze Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's use of a fast, powerful new missile to attack the city of Dnipro on Thursday, calling it a 'nuclear adventure' and a stark escalation in the war. The attack has ignited fears of a dangerous new phase in the war. In a nationwide address, Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed the use of a medium-range ballistic missile in the strike. Zelenskyy pointed to the strike as a sign of Moscow’s broader strategy, stating, 'It is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground for weapons that threaten the world.' His remarks underscored the growing alarm in Kyiv over the deployment of advanced Russian missile systems against civilian targets. In his address, Putin framed the use of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile as a routine test within the conflict. 'The Russian Federation tested a medium-range ballistic missile, known as Oreshnik, during its operation in Ukraine,' he said. While he offered few technical details, analysts said the use of the missile and Putin’s acknowledgment appears intended to showcase Russia’s military capabilities to NATO and the United States. Putin’s announcement marks the first time Russia has openly acknowledged using such a missile during the war. In Washington, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the missile used was based on Russia's RS 26 rubes intercontinental ballistic missile model.' In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre notified briefly before the launch through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels,' she said. Strategic escalation Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s former ambassador to the U.S., described the attack as a 'new stage' in Russia’s aggression. Speaking to VOA, he emphasized that the strike was not just a challenge to Ukraine but also to its Western allies. 'This isn’t just about Ukraine,' Chaly said. 'It’s a challenge to the European security system and the United States. Moscow is signaling its readiness to escalate dramatically to influence the West.' He said that the response to the attack 'must be clear, united, and decisive — anything less risks emboldening Russia and jeopardizing global security.' Western leaders quickly condemned the strike. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled it 'reckless and dangerous,' while EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano described it as a 'qualitative escalation' in Russia’s tactics. Dnipro attack The missile targeted industrial facilities in Dnipro, injuring two people and causing significant damage. Ukrainian officials initially suggested the use of an ICBM, or intercontinental ballistic missile, citing the weapon’s speed and trajectory. Some analysts, including those in the U.S., believed it was more likely a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile, consistent with Putin’s confirmation. Dnipro residents, accustomed to regular air-raid sirens and missile attacks, reported that this strike felt uniquely different. Oleksiy Poltorazky, a local resident, recounted: 'We’ve learned to recognize the sounds of different missile types. This one was different — it hit almost immediately after the siren. Many here believe it was a ballistic missile because there was no usual warning sound.' The speed and power of the strike left many shaken. Poltorazky, however, remained resolute. 'There’s no panic, no apocalypse as everyone says. We have to live through this, raise our kids, protect our families and work. We have to fight and do everything possible for our country,' he told VOA. George Barros, an expert on the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, told VOA that Ukrainians should try not to overreact to the attack. 'It seems that the Russians targeted the city with an R-26 IRBM,' Barros said, referring to a Soviet-era intermediate-range missile. 'The main thing is to not panic. There's no reason to think that Putin’s likelihood to use a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction is any higher than at other points in the war. 'This is not the first time that Russia has used nuclear-capable weapon systems against Ukraine,' he said. 'Russia regularly uses Iskander nuclear-capable weapons, and this appears to be a signaling effort designed to deter further Western support for Ukraine.' Strategic ambiguity While Putin confirmed the missile test, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova provided limited details about the strike. Zakharova was reportedly instructed not to address the attack at all during a Thursday press conference. The calculated reticence deepens global unease, as Moscow oscillates between overt warnings and veiled threats, said some analysts, suggesting the ambiguity is part of a broader strategy to keep Western nations uncertain about Russia’s next moves.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV_f6SFsl4cye	2024-11-21T17:02:32-08:00	
Fallacies And Frames: The Theoretical Roots Of Logical Fallacies ...	The Frankfurt School, a prominent intellectual movement originating from the Institute for Social Research in Germany, offers profound insights into power, domination, and emancipation that continue to resonate in the study of International Relations (IR). Rooted in Marxist critique and critical theory, this school of thought challenges traditional paradigms, emphasizing the intersection of ideology, culture, and power in understanding global politics. Thinkers such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, and Jürgen Habermas significantly contributed to shaping this intellectual tradition, which has profoundly influenced critical IR theory. At its core, the Frankfurt School sought to critique and transcend the limitations of orthodox Marxism. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment underscored how Enlightenment rationality, once a tool of liberation, had morphed into an instrument of domination under modern capitalism. This critique finds parallels in IR, particularly in the analysis of global structures that perpetuate inequality and hegemony. By challenging the neutrality of power structures, the Frankfurt School paved the way for examining how international institutions, economic systems, and cultural hegemonies sustain domination on a global scale. Herbert Marcuse, another leading figure, extended this critique by exploring the role of technological rationality in reinforcing domination. His work, particularly One-Dimensional Man, critiques the ways in which advanced industrial societies stifle dissent and perpetuate conformity. In IR, this perspective sheds light on how technological advancements and global institutions are co-opted to maintain existing power hierarchies. Marcuse's emphasis on the potential for resistance and alternative futures aligns with the critical theory's emancipatory aspirations, inspiring scholars to envision a more just international order. Walter Benjamin, though less directly associated with IR, offers valuable insights through his analysis of history and culture. In his Theses on the Philosophy of History, Benjamin critiques the triumphalist narratives of progress, emphasizing the need to recover marginalized voices and histories. This perspective has profound implications for IR, particularly in postcolonial studies and critiques of Eurocentrism. By interrogating the dominant narratives that underpin international relations, Benjamin's ideas encourage a reevaluation of the global order through the lens of historical justice and cultural plurality. Jürgen Habermas, a second-generation Frankfurt School thinker, bridges the critical theory of his predecessors with contemporary debates in IR. His theory of communicative action emphasizes the role of dialogue and consensus in overcoming domination. In IR, Habermas's ideas have influenced deliberative democracy and global governance theories, advocating for inclusive and participatory frameworks in international institutions. His work highlights the potential for rational discourse to mediate conflicts and foster cooperation, offering a normative vision for global politics. The Frankfurt School's critique of ideology is particularly relevant to IR. Antonio Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony, though not directly part of the Frankfurt School, aligns with its emphasis on the role of culture in sustaining power structures. Critical theorists in IR have drawn on these ideas to analyze how dominant ideologies shape international norms, policies, and institutions. For example, the neoliberal economic order, often presented as natural and inevitable, can be deconstructed through the lens of critical theory to reveal its ideological underpinnings and inequitable consequences. The school's emphasis on emancipation also resonates in IR. Critical theorists such as Robert W. Cox have explicitly linked the Frankfurt School's insights to the study of global politics. Cox's distinction between problem-solving and critical theories underscores the need to question the underlying power structures that shape international relations. By challenging the status quo, critical theory opens possibilities for transformative change, advocating for an IR that prioritizes human emancipation over state-centric power politics. Moreover, the Frankfurt School's focus on the interconnection of economy and culture provides a robust framework for analyzing globalization. Globalization, often celebrated as a force for economic integration and cultural exchange, can also perpetuate exploitation and homogenization. Critical theory interrogates the capitalist logic underpinning globalization, exposing its role in exacerbating inequality and eroding local cultures. This critique extends to the international financial institutions, trade regimes, and transnational corporations that shape the global economic order, offering a counter-narrative to neoliberal triumphalism. The environmental crisis presents another arena where the Frankfurt School's ideas are increasingly relevant. Marcuse's critique of technological rationality anticipates many of the challenges posed by environmental degradation. His call for a more harmonious relationship between humanity and nature aligns with contemporary ecological movements that challenge the exploitative logic of global capitalism. In IR, critical theorists have built on these insights to advocate for sustainable and equitable approaches to global environmental governance, highlighting the intersection of ecological and social justice. The Frankfurt School's legacy in IR is also evident in its engagement with identity and resistance. Adorno's concept of the negative dialectic emphasizes the importance of resisting totalizing frameworks and embracing difference. This perspective has influenced critical approaches to identity politics in IR, particularly in feminist and postcolonial studies. By foregrounding the voices of marginalized groups, these approaches challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate exclusion and inequality in the global arena. In contemporary IR, the Frankfurt School's influence is evident in the rise of critical theory as a distinct paradigm. Scholars such as Andrew Linklater and Richard Ashley have drawn on its insights to challenge mainstream IR theories, advocating for a more inclusive and normative approach to global politics. Linklater's work, for example, explores the potential for cosmopolitan ethics and global citizenship to transcend the limitations of state-centric paradigms. Similarly, Ashley's critique of realism and neoliberalism highlights the role of critical theory in exposing the ideological assumptions underlying dominant IR frameworks. Despite its contributions, the Frankfurt School's relevance to IR has been critiqued on several grounds. Its abstract and often pessimistic tone has led some to question its applicability to concrete policy issues. Moreover, its Eurocentric focus has been criticized for overlooking the diversity of perspectives in the global South. Nevertheless, the Frankfurt School's emphasis on power, ideology, and emancipation continues to inspire critical scholarship in IR, encouraging a more reflective and inclusive approach to global politics. The Frankfurt School's critical theory offers a powerful lens for understanding and challenging the complexities of international relations. Through the works of thinkers like Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Benjamin, and Habermas, it provides a framework for interrogating the ideological, cultural, and structural dimensions of global politics. By emphasizing emancipation and resistance, it encourages scholars and practitioners to envision alternative futures that prioritize justice and equity. As the global order faces unprecedented challenges, from environmental crises to rising authoritarianism, the Frankfurt School's insights remain as relevant as ever, offering a beacon for transformative change in international relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1pYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-21T16:59:35-08:00	
ICC Issues Warrants For Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant, Hamas Milita...	(RFE/RL) -- The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Muhammad Deif, a military commander in the Iran-backed group Hamas, alleging they committed crimes against humanity in the ongoing Gaza war. All three are accused of committing war crimes connected to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, an EU- and U.S-designated terrorist organization that is part of Tehran's network of proxies in the Middle East, and Israel's subsequent military intervention in the Gaza Strip. Iran's backing of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-supported militant group and political party that controls much of the southern part of Israel's neighbor, Lebanon, has sparked fears that the war in the Gaza Strip will engulf the Middle East. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the European Union blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament. The court said the warrants had been classified as 'secret' to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of the investigations.Israel, which claims it killed Deif in July, blasted the move as 'a dark moment for the ICC.' Hamas, which has never officially acknowledged Deif's death, called the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant an 'important step toward justice.' The ICC said it had issued the arrest warrant for Deif as the prosecutor had not been able to determine whether he was dead. His warrant shows charges of mass killings during the October 7 attack on Israel that left some 1,200 dead, as well as charges of rape and the taking of around 240 hostages in the attack. 'The Chamber considered that there are reasonable grounds to believe that both [Israeli] individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,' the ICC said in a statement. 'This finding is based on the role of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,' it said.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the move against Netanyahu and Gallant 'absurd' in a post on X, saying it was an attack of Israel's right to self-defense.'A dark moment for the ICC in The Hague, in which it lost all legitimacy for its existence and activity,' Sa'ar said. Tehran has yet to comment publicly on the warrants. Neither the United States nor Israel have recognized the ICC's jurisdiction. A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the issuance of the arrest warrants and 'the troubling process errors that led to this decision. Meanwhile, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a post on X that ICC decisions 'are binding on all states party to the Rome Statute, which includes all EU Member States.' The court said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. However, the court itself has no law enforcement levers to enforce warrants and relies on cooperation from its member states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5p-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-21T16:57:49-08:00	
Hezbollah Causing The Destruction Of Itself And Lebanon – OpEd	By Khaled Abou Zahr It is undeniable that Hezbollah is being hit and destroyed like never before. It hit Israel with extreme violence at the beginning of the Gaza war to try and extract gains. This message of violence has been answered by Israel in multiples and it is now inflicting a total reckoning on Hezbollah. This has also come at the price of the destruction of Lebanon and Lebanese lives. Hezbollah, through its actions, has brought chaos to Lebanon, just like in 2006. Yet, this time, while Israel refuses any mediation (and why would Tel Aviv accept it?), opposition groups in Lebanon have become much more vocal than in the past. They are now clearly and openly accusing Hezbollah of being responsible for this destruction. It has, through another reckless and unilateral decision of war, brought even more despair to Lebanon. It is clear now that Hezbollah, despite its declarations, is unable to cope with Israel’s superior capabilities. The question of the timing of the exploding pager operation —which, we must remember, even injured the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon — has now been answered. Yet, the main question is what Hezbollah will do in the face of this mounting external and internal pressure. The answer is the same as in the past: violence against the Lebanese. Whenever Hezbollah or the Syrian regime — its predecessor as occupier of Lebanon — were pressured externally, they chose to assassinate Lebanese. We are now back to the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 scenario of extreme pressure, which led to the waves of assassinations we all remember. And so, because it is weakened and unable to match Israel militarily, Hezbollah will go after the Lebanese voices of freedom. On top of the horrors of death of the current war due to this group’s unilateral decision, it will also add the death of its critics and opponents. The momentum for these actions has already been set in the same way as in the past. A clear indicator is an increase in the number of accusations of treason against journalists and truly free voices, mainly through social media for now. Once again, lists are circulating. While in the past they were spread via rumors and taxi drivers, now these lists circulate openly on social media and WhatsApp. This season of threats has even added video clips of the filthiest kind, created by artificial intelligence, to dehumanize its critics. It is the signature of this group and a sign of its level of despair. The pressure of potential defeat has not only contributed to the destruction of Hezbollah’s infrastructure, but also its image of might and strength. Despite the destruction the Lebanese are enduring, they are still seeing hope and a potential end to this never-ending cycle of violence. They are now clearly articulating the way out, which is by openly requesting for Hezbollah to surrender its weapons to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In response, the group is accusing the Lebanese opposition of seeking to use the Israelis to strengthen their position against it. This increase in blaming Hezbollah for the situation and the growing defiance, along with the demand to an end of its special status, is something the armed militia will look to quell with brutal force. It will look to do so before the end of the war, despite what its internet influencers are stating. Hezbollah knows, just like the Syrian regime did in the past, that its violence against the Lebanese will kill two birds with one stone. The first is to reestablish deterrence, not toward Tel Aviv but the voices of freedom in Lebanon, and the second is to add pressure to the international mediation efforts to stop the war. Unsurprisingly, these are the methods of an occupying force. And we also need to remind people that, in October 2023, the only occupying force was Hezbollah. I am indeed rehashing myself when I state that Israel was no longer occupying Lebanon following its unilateral withdrawal in 2000. There was hence no reason for Lebanon’s involvement. Everyone is heartbroken and despairing when seeing the destruction taking place today. Yet, the Lebanese pundits that do not condemn, first and foremost, the action that led to this expected Israeli reaction are and will always be accomplices in the violence that Hezbollah inflicted yesterday and will inflict tomorrow and every day on the free Lebanese. They are accomplices in the violence against journalists we have already witnessed, which is nothing but a trial balloon for what is to come. We are now in Hezbollah’s intimidation phase. Despite the war, it must be denounced and vehemently opposed to stop the next phase of possible assassinations. Moreover, if people do not stand up for Lebanon now, they will live under the rubble and foreign domination in this never-ending cycle. We are also noticing a tentative effort by Hezbollah to break the opposition by accusing some of treason and threatening them, while praising others for standing with the refugees from the south. These are futile methods that everyone should be aware of and reject. Hezbollah is now demonizing its critics in the worst possible way. The same methodology was used before assassinating former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Gebran Tueni, Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Pierre Gemayel, Walid Eido, Antoine Ghanem, Francois Al-Hajj, Mohammed Chatah and Lokman Slim. The same volatile situation and pressure on Hezbollah exist today as during the waves of assassination of the past. Hezbollah has caused, just like in 2006 and for absolutely no reason, the destruction of Lebanon. As it faces a close to existential threat of annihilation and is unable to answer the Israelis, it will fight the Lebanese who are honorable and courageous enough to demand the surrender of its military arsenal. This time, the voices of freedom need to win. Khaled Abou Zahr is the founder of SpaceQuest Ventures, a space-focused investment platform. He is CEO of EurabiaMedia and editor of Al-Watan Al-Arabi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV6L4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-21T16:55:02-08:00	
NASA: Mystery Of Life’s Handedness Deepens	The mystery of why life uses molecules with specific orientations has deepened with a NASA-funded discovery that RNA — a key molecule thought to have potentially held the instructions for life before DNA emerged — can favor making the building blocks of proteins in either the left-hand or the right-hand orientation. Resolving this mystery could provide clues to the origin of life. The findings appear in research recently published in Nature Communications. Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life, used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes (catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions). Just as the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in limitless combinations to make words, life uses 20 different amino acid building blocks in a huge variety of arrangements to make millions of different proteins. Some amino acid molecules can be built in two ways, such that mirror-image versions exist, like your hands, and life uses the left-handed variety of these amino acids. Although life based on right-handed amino acids would presumably work fine, the two mirror images are rarely mixed in biology, a characteristic of life called homochirality. It is a mystery to scientists why life chose the left-handed variety over the right-handed one. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that holds the instructions for building and running a living organism. However, DNA is complex and specialized; it 'subcontracts' the work of reading the instructions to RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules and building proteins to ribosome molecules. DNA’s specialization and complexity lead scientists to think that something simpler should have preceded it billions of years ago during the early evolution of life. A leading candidate for this is RNA, which can both store genetic information and build proteins. The hypothesis that RNA may have preceded DNA is called the 'RNA world' hypothesis. If the RNA world proposition is correct, then perhaps something about RNA caused it to favor building left-handed proteins over right-handed ones. However, the new work did not support this idea, deepening the mystery of why life went with left-handed proteins. The experiment tested RNA molecules that act like enzymes to build proteins, called ribozymes. 'The experiment demonstrated that ribozymes can favor either left- or right-handed amino acids, indicating that RNA worlds, in general, would not necessarily have a strong bias for the form of amino acids we observe in biology now,' said Irene Chen, of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Samueli School of Engineering, corresponding author of the Nature Communications paper. In the experiment, the researchers simulated what could have been early-Earth conditions of the RNA world. They incubated a solution containing ribozymes and amino acid precursors to see the relative percentages of the right-handed and left-handed amino acid, phenylalanine, that it would help produce. They tested 15 different ribozyme combinations and found that ribozymes can favor either left-handed or right-handed amino acids. This suggested that RNA did not initially have a predisposed chemical bias for one form of amino acids. This lack of preference challenges the notion that early life was predisposed to select left-handed-amino acids, which dominate in modern proteins. 'The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures,' said co-author Alberto Vázquez-Salazar, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar and member of Chen’s research group. Earth’s prebiotic history lies beyond the oldest part of the fossil record, which has been erased by plate tectonics, the slow churning of Earth’s crust. During that time, the planet was likely bombarded by asteroids, which may have delivered some of life’s building blocks, such as amino acids. In parallel to chemical experiments, other origin-of-life researchers have been looking at molecular evidence from meteorites and asteroids. 'Understanding the chemical properties of life helps us know what to look for in our search for life across the solar system,' said co-author Jason Dworkin, senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and director of Goddard’s Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory. Dworkin is the project scientist on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which extracted samples from the asteroid Bennu and delivered them to Earth last year for further study. 'We are analyzing OSIRIS-REx samples for the chirality (handedness) of individual amino acids, and in the future, samples from Mars will also be tested in laboratories for evidence of life including ribozymes and proteins,' said Dworkin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lTFYJ05qC5UZ	2024-11-21T15:20:08-08:00	
What Are The Effects Of Historic Lithium Mining On Water Quality?	Lithium ore and mining waste from a historic lithium mine located west of Charlotte, North Carolina, are unlikely to contaminate surrounding waters with common pollutants such as arsenic and lead, according to a new study. However, high levels of other metals — namely, lithium, rubidium and cesium — do occur in waters associated with the mine. The new findings, from Avner Vengosh, distinguished professor of environmental quality at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, shed light on potential water quality impacts of legacy, or historic, lithium mining. They also provide baseline data for future studies exploring how reopening lithium mines in the N.C. piedmont will likely affect the water quality of drinking water resources nearby. 'The world is increasingly relying on lithium for the green-energy transition, but previous studies on the environmental effects of hard-rock lithium mining show mixed results,' Vengosh said. 'This study provides new, important data to clarify the possible environmental impacts. The area where the Kings Mountain Mine is located was once the largest lithium-producing region in the world. Situated in wooded, rural terrain of the piedmont, the mine opened in the 1950s and was abandoned in the 1980s, when more accessible lithium deposits drew prospectors to South America. The lithium at Kings Mountain primarily exists in granite-like rock called pegmatite, bound to a green-tinged mineral called spodumene. For their study, the researchers collected samples of pegmatite and waste rocks from in and around the mine, as well as samples of tailings — crushed rocks left over from historic spodumene extraction. They also sampled groundwater from the mine and surface water from Kings Creek, which flows from the mine. Samples from various piedmont streams provided baseline data on water quality. The researchers pulverized rock samples and mixed them in a solution designed to test how various contaminants might enter the surrounding environment. These laboratory experiments simulate how contaminants in the rocks would leach out under natural conditions. The researchers then analyzed the solutions, as well as the surface water and groundwater samples, for a wide range of metals commonly used to evaluate water quality. The study was published online in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Leaching experiments and water samples analyzed in the study showed common regulated contaminants — including arsenic, lead, copper and nickel — at levels below drinking water and ecological standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'The fact that we don’t see these toxic contaminants was, in some way, a relief, because it suggests that future lithium exploration in North Carolina would not cause major negative water quality effects with respect to these elements,' Vengosh said. However, the team found high levels of other metals in the mine site relative to their concentrations in the piedmont water resources. 'We detected elevated concentrations of lithium, which was expected, but also found rubidium and cesium at levels you normally don’t see in natural waters, and that are not federally regulated,' said first author Gordon Williams, a Ph.D. student in Vengosh’s lab and the Division of Earth and Climate Sciences. 'An outstanding question, then, is how these elements affect human and environmental health.' Leaching experiments and evidence from water samples also indicated that the legacy lithium mine does not contribute to environmentally harmful acidic runoff commonly associated with other mining operations, like coal mining. Rather, interactions between the ore and waste rock samples and water led to temporary alkaline, or basic, conditions. The study did not address the effects of active lithium mining and processing on water quality, the authors emphasized. 'Excavating and crushing ore is just one aspect of lithium mining. Processing — which requires a chemical treatment to separate lithium from spodumene — may include additional chemicals that could potentially affect water quality,' Williams said. 'When lithium mining ramps up again in this area, processing could have impacts on local water resources that we didn’t measure,' he cautioned. The researchers are now extending their study by assessing drinking water quality across a band of lithium-rich geological terrain in the piedmont. By sampling private wells and surface water, they can better understand the potential impacts of lithium mining on water quality in North Carolina. The study was funded by the Duke University Climate Research Innovation Seed Program (CRISP) and the Albemarle Corporation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lUNufprwgocM	2024-11-21T15:18:04-08:00	
Fewer Than 7% Of Global Hotspots For Whale-Ship Collisions Have P...	According to the fossil record, cetaceans — whales, dolphins and their relatives — evolved from four-legged land mammals that returned to the oceans beginning some 50 million years ago. Today, their descendants are threatened by a different land-based mammal that has also returned to the sea: humans. Thousands of whales are injured or killed each year after being struck by ships, particularly the large container vessels that ferry 80% of the world’s traded goods across the oceans. Collisions are the leading cause of death worldwide for large whale species. Yet global data on ship strikes of whales are hard to come by — impeding efforts to protect vulnerable whale species. A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales. In the paper, published online in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges. 'This translates to ships traveling thousands of times the distance to the moon and back within these species’ ranges each and every year, and this problem is only projected to increase as global trade grows in the coming decades,' said senior author Briana Abrahms, a UW assistant professor of biology and researcher with the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Whale-ship collisions have typically only been studied at a local or regional level — like off the east and west coasts of the continental U.S., and patterns of risk remain unknown for large areas,' said lead author Anna Nisi, a UW postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Our study is an attempt to fill those knowledge gaps and understand the risk of ship strikes on a global level. It’s important to understand where these collisions are likely to occur because there are some really simple interventions that can substantially reduce collision risk.' The team found that only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas. 'As much as we found cause for concern, we also found some big silver linings,' said Abrahms. 'For example, implementing management measures across only an additional 2.6% of the ocean’s surface would protect all of the highest-risk collision hotspots we identified.' 'Trade-offs between industrial and conservation outcomes are not usually this optimal,' said co-author Heather Welch, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of California, Santa Cruz. 'Oftentimes industrial activities must be greatly limited to achieve conservation goals, or vice versa. In this case, there is a potentially large conservation benefit to whales for not much cost to the shipping industry.' Those highest-risk areas for the four while species included in the study lie largely along coastal areas in the Mediterranean, portions of the Americas, southern Africa and parts of Asia. The international team behind the study, which includes researchers across five continents, looked at the waters where these four whale species live, feed and migrate by pooling data from disparate sources — including government surveys, sightings by members of the public, tagging studies and even whaling records. The team collected some 435,000 unique whale sightings. They then combined this novel database with information on the courses of 176,000 cargo vessels from 2017 to 2022 — tracked by each ship’s automatic identification system and processed using an algorithm from Global Fishing Watch — to identify where whales and ships are most likely to meet. The study uncovered regions already known to be high-risk areas for ship strikes: North America’s Pacific coast, Panama, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. But it also identified understudied regions at high risk for whale-ship collisions, including southern Africa; South America along the coasts of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Ecuador; the Azores; and East Asia off the coasts of China, Japan and South Korea. The team found that mandatory measures to reduce whale-ship collisions were very rare, overlapping just 0.54% of blue whale hotspots and 0.27% of humpback hotspots, and not overlapping any fin or sperm whale hotspots. Though many collision hotspots fell within marine protected areas, these preserves often lack speed limits for vessels, as they were largely established to curb fishing and industrial pollution. For all four species the vast majority of hotpots for whale-ship strikes — more than 95% — hugged coastlines, falling within a nation’s exclusive economic zone. That means that each country could implement its own protection measures in coordination with the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization. 'From the standpoint of conservation, the fact that most high-risk areas lie within exclusive economic zones is actually encouraging,' said Nisi. 'It means individual countries have the ability to protect the riskiest areas.' Of the limited measures now in place, most are along the Pacific coast of North America and in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to speed reduction, other options to reduce whale-ship strikes include changing vessel routings away from where whales are located, or creating alert systems to notify authorities and mariners when whales are nearby. 'Lowering vessel speed in hotspots also carries additional benefits, such as reducing underwater noise pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting air pollution, which helps people living in coastal areas,' said Nisi. The authors hope their global study could spur local or regional research to map out the hotspot zones in finer detail, inform advocacy efforts and consider the impact of climate change, which will change both whale and ship distributions as sea ice melts and ecosystems shift. 'Protecting whales from the impact of ship strikes is a huge global challenge. We’ve seen the benefits of slowing ships down at local scales through programs like ‘Blue Whales Blue Skies’ in California. Scaling up such programs will require a concerted effort by conservation organizations, governments and shipping companies,' said co-author Jono Wilson, director of ocean science at the California Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, which helped identify the need for this study and secured its funding. 'Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems. Through this study we have measurable insights into ship-collision hotspots and risk and where we need to focus to make the most impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lQcUS7HS2lRa	2024-11-21T15:15:31-08:00	
Bye-Bye Microplastics: New Plastic Is Recyclable And Fully Ocean-...	Researchers led by Takuzo Aida at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) have developed a new durable plastic that won’t pollute our oceans. The new material is as strong as conventional plastics and biodegradable, but what makes it special is that it breaks down in seawater. The new plastic is therefore expected to help reduce harmful microplastic pollution that accumulates in oceans and soil and eventually enters the food chain. The experimental findings were published in Science. Scientists have been trying to develop safe and sustainable materials that can replace traditional plastics, which are non-sustainable and harm the environment. While some recyclable and biodegradable plastics exist, one big problem remains. Current biodegradable plastics like PLA often find their way into the ocean where they cannot be degraded because they are water insoluble. As a result, microplastics—plastic bits smaller than 5 mm—are harming aquatic life and finding their way into the food chain, including our own bodies. In their new study, Aida and his team focused on solving this problem with supramolecular plastics—polymers with structures held together by reversible interactions. The new plastics were made by combining two ionic monomers that form cross-linked salt bridges, which provide strength and flexibility. In the initial tests, one of the monomers was a common food additive called sodium hexametaphosphate and the other was any of several guanidinium ion-based monomers. Both monomers can be metabolized by bacteria, ensuring biodegradability once the plastic is dissolved into its components. 'While the reversable nature of the bonds in supramolecular plastics have been thought to make them weak and unstable,' says Aida, 'our new materials are just the opposite.' In the new material, the salt bridges structure is irreversible unless exposed to electrolytes like those found in seawater. The key discovery was how to create these selectively irreversible cross links. As with oil with water, after mixing the two monomers together in water, the researchers observed two separated liquids. One was thick and viscous and contained the important structural cross linked salt bridges, while the other was watery and contained salt ions. For example, when sodium hexametaphosphate and alkyl diguanidinium sulfate were used, sodium sulphate salt was expelled into the watery layer. The final plastic, alkyl SP₂, was made by drying what remained in the thick viscous liquid layer. The 'desalting' turned out to be the critical step; without it, the resulting dried material was a brittle crystal, unfit for use. Resalting the plastic by placing it in salt water caused the interactions to reverse and the plastic’s structure destabilized in a matter of hours. Thus, having created a strong and durable plastic that can still be dissolved under certain conditions, the researchers next tested the plastic’s quality. The new plastics are non-toxic and non-flammable—meaning no CO2 emissions—and can be reshaped at temperatures above 120°C like other thermoplastics. By testing different types of guanidinium sulfates, the team was able to generate plastics that had varying hardnesses and tensile strengths, all comparable or better than conventional plastics. This means that the new type of plastic can be customized for need; hard scratch resistant plastics, rubber silicone-like plastics, strong weight-bearing plastics, or low tensile flexible plastics are all possible. The researchers also created ocean-degradable plastics using polysaccharides that form cross-linked salt bridges with guanidinium monomers. Plastics like these can be used in 3D printing as well as medical or health-related applications. Lastly, the researchers investigated the new plastic’s recyclability and biodegradability. After dissolving the initial new plastic in salt water, they were able to recover 91% of the hexametaphosphate and 82% of the guanidinium as powders, indicating that recycling is easy and efficient. In soil, sheets of the new plastic degraded completely over the course of 10 days, supplying the soil with phosphorous and nitrogen similar to a fertilizer. 'With this new material, we have created a new family of plastics that are strong, stable, recyclable, can serve multiple functions, and importantly, do not generate microplastics,' says Aida.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MmdfIEfsRign	2024-11-21T15:13:35-08:00	
Quantum-Inspired Design Boosts Efficiency Of Heat-To-Electricity ...	Researchers at Rice University have found a new way to improve a key element of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, which convert heat into electricity via light. Using an unconventional approach inspired by quantum physics, Rice engineer Gururaj Naik and his team designed a thermal emitter that can deliver high efficiencies within practical design parameters.The research could inform the development of thermal-energy electrical storage, which holds promise as an affordable, grid-scale alternative to batteries. More broadly, efficient TPV technologies could facilitate renewable energy growth ⎯ an essential component of the transition to a net-zero world. Another major benefit of better TPV systems is recouping waste heat from industrial processes, making them more sustainable. To put this in context, up to 20-50% of the heat used to transform raw materials into consumer goods ends up being wasted, costing the United States economy over $200 billion annually.TPV systems involve two main components ⎯ photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert light into electricity and thermal emitters that turn heat into light. Both of these components have to work well in order for the system to be efficient, but efforts to optimize them have focused more on the PV cell. 'Using conventional design approaches limits thermal emitters’ design space, and what you end up with is one of two scenarios: practical, low-performance devices or high-performance emitters that are hard to integrate in real-world applications,' said Naik, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. In a new study published in npj Nanophotonics, Naik and his former Ph.D. student Ciril Samuel Prasad ⎯ who has since earned a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering from Rice and has taken on a role as a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ⎯ demonstrated a new thermal emitter that promises efficiencies of over 60% despite being application-ready. 'We essentially showed how to achieve the best possible performance for the emitter given realistic, practical design constraints,' said Prasad, who is the first author on the study.The emitter is composed of a tungsten metal sheet, a thin layer of a spacer material and a network of silicon nanocylinders. When heated, the base layers accumulate thermal radiation, which can be thought of as a bath of photons. The tiny resonators sitting on top 'talk' to each other in a way that allows them to 'pluck photon by photon' from this bath, controlling the brightness and bandwidth of the light sent to the PV cell.'Instead of focusing on the performance of single-resonator systems, we instead took into account the way these resonators interact, which opened up new possibilities,' Naik explained. 'This gave us control over how the photons are stored and released.' This selective emission, achieved through insights from quantum physics, maximizes energy conversion and allows for higher efficiencies than previously possible, operating at the limit of the materials’ properties. To improve on the newly achieved 60% efficiency, new materials with better properties would need to be developed or discovered.These gains could make TPV a competitive alternative to other energy storage and conversion technologies like lithium-ion batteries, particularly in scenarios where long-term energy storage is needed. Naik noted that this innovation has significant implications for industries that generate large amounts of waste heat such as nuclear power plants and manufacturing facilities.'I feel confident that what we have demonstrated here, coupled with a very efficient low bandgap PV cell, has very promising potential,' Naik said. 'Based on my own experience working with NASA and launching a startup in the renewable energy space, I think that energy conversion technologies are very much in need today.'The team’s technology could also be used in space applications such as powering rovers on Mars.'If our approach could lead to an increase in efficiency from 2% to 5% in such systems, that would represent a significant boost for missions that rely on efficient power generation in extreme environments,' Naik said.The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1935446) and the U.S. Army Research Office.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-21T15:11:27-08:00	
Exploring The Impact Of Offshore Wind On Whale Deaths	In the winter of 2022-2023, nearly a dozen whales died off the coast of New Jersey, near the sites of several proposed wind farms. Their deaths prompted concern that related survey work being conducted in the area somehow contributed to their deaths. In pursuit of clean energy goals and to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions, developers are increasingly exploring building wind turbines in the waters off the East Coast of the United States. Three offshore wind farms are already in operation, with several more planned or underway. These wind farms stand to generate a significant amount of carbon-free electricity, which can help coastal states meet their decarbonization goals. The increased presence of these turbines in coastal waters, along with the noise from construction and surveys, has led to concerns of their impact on marine life. In particular, cetaceans such as whales and dolphins are likely to be sensitive to the noises and increased marine traffic brought by these turbines. However, the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal oversight agency, states there is no evidence linking the whales that died in the New Jersey region in the winter of 2022-2023 to wind energy development. According to necropsies performed on recovered whales, many of them died from collisions with ships. The Marine Mammal Commission notes that this is not a particularly unusual occurrence, nor is the number of whale deaths in this period higher than average. A rise in ship strikes over the last decade is mostly due to a simple combination of more whales plus more ships. 'In the case of a lot of whales, population recoveries since the cessation of commercial whaling are coincident with increasing shipping traffic and increasing fishing efforts,' said Stocker. 'This is resulting in increased interactions between whales and the industrialization of the ocean.' Stocker, however, is concerned that the increased presence of survey ships in and around New Jersey waters may have exacerbated this issue. 'Were the ship strikes just a coincidence?' asked Stocker. 'Or were they a product of compromised whale vigilance due to aggregated stress factors?' Survey ships are employed by wind farm developers to map the seafloor in preparation for construction. These ships use underwater acoustic devices in their efforts, which can stress marine mammals such as whales. While one survey ship likely has little effect, Stocker highlights that 11 different surveys were operating in the region from December 2022 to March 2023, and that the cumulative impact of these surveys has not been properly evaluated. Stocker hopes his session will spark a discussion among attendees with the goal of identifying approaches to minimize whale deaths in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeEK_t_OqF2dsQ36glFESvq	2024-11-21T15:09:31-08:00	
Astronomers Take The First Close-Up Picture Of A Star Outside Our...	For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way,' says Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Located a staggering 160 000 light-years from us, the star WOH G64 was imaged thanks to the impressive sharpness offered by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (ESO’s VLTI). The new observations reveal a star puffing out gas and dust, in the last stages before it becomes a supernova. 'We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star,' says Ohnaka, the lead author of a study reporting the observations published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 'We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion.' While astronomers have taken about two dozen zoomed-in images of stars in our galaxy, unveiling their properties, countless other stars dwell within other galaxies, so far away that observing even one of them in detail has been extremely challenging. Up until now. The newly imaged star, WOH G64, lies within the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the small galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Astronomers have known about this star for decades and have appropriately dubbed it the ‘behemoth star’. With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 is classified as a red supergiant. Ohnaka’s team had long been interested in this behemoth star. Back in 2005 and 2007, they used ESO’s VLTI in Chile’s Atacama Desert to learn more about the star’s features, and carried on studying it in the years since. But an actual image of the star had remained elusive. For the desired picture, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI’s second-generation instruments, GRAVITY. After comparing their new results with other previous observations of WOH G64, they were surprised to find that the star had become dimmer over the past decade. 'We have found that the star has been experiencing a significant change in the last 10 years, providing us with a rare opportunity to witness a star’s life in real time,' says Gerd Weigelt, an astronomy professor at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany and a co-author of the study. In their final life stages, red supergiants like WOH G64 shed their outer layers of gas and dust in a process that can last thousands of years. 'This star is one of the most extreme of its kind, and any drastic change may bring it closer to an explosive end,' adds co-author Jacco van Loon, Keele Observatory Director at Keele University, UK, who has been observing WOH G64 since the 1990s. The team thinks that these shed materials may also be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the dust cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched-out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models. The team believes that the cocoon’s egg-like shape could be explained by either the star’s shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star. As the star becomes fainter, taking other close-up pictures of it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for the VLTI. Nonetheless, planned updates to the telescope’s instrumentation, such as the future GRAVITY+, promise to change this soon. 'Similar follow-up observations with ESO instruments will be important for understanding what is going on in the star,' concludes Ohnaka.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXKJpqYMBg15l	2024-11-21T15:07:18-08:00	
Research Highlights The Pressures Human Activities Place On Tropi...	The tropical coastlines of Southeast Asia are home to some of the most important and biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet. However, they are also among its most vulnerable, with areas of coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass beds under increasing threat from a wide range of human activities. To try and better understand those potential threats, a study by an international team of researchers has provided the first detailed assessment of activities taking place within coastal and marine habitats and the impact they have on those ecosystems. The research focused on case study sites in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, including marine protected areas in UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserves as well as a Marine Park. Of the 26 activities that were examined, it found that particular fishing techniques – and tourism and recreation – posed the greatest threat to the ecosystems. The fishing practices, including trawling and the use of gill and seine nets, were shown to cause physical pressures such as abrasion, smothering, siltation and total habitat loss. Meanwhile tourism activities resulted in different pressures such as organic enrichment, litter and pollution, in particular affecting coral reef habitats. With fishing and tourism being critical to the region’s economy, the researchers hope that highlighting their potential to impact specific locations could help ensure they can be conducted in a more sustainable manner in the future. The study, published in the British Ecological Society’s Journal of Applied Ecology, was led by researchers from the University of Plymouth together and involved colleagues from across Southeast Asia. It was carried out as part of Blue Communities, a £6.7million programme funded through the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) in partnership with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Dr Fiona Culhane, who carried out the research as part of a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Plymouth, and is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Marine Institute in Ireland, is the study’s lead author. She said: 'These sites are globally significant for their high marine biodiversity, but are at high risk of pressures from human activities. This work, carried out in collaboration with local communities and in-country researchers, has demonstrated that different locations experience different risks, according to the level of human activities in the sea. By better understanding how human activities are impacting various marine habitats, and the ecosystem services they provide, we can provide local stakeholders and marine managers with clearer evidence that they can use to inform future action.' Professor Melanie Austen, Professor of Ocean and Society at the University of Plymouth and lead of the Blue Communities programme, added: 'This study is a powerful example of strong collaboration between researchers from the Global South and Global North. Its aim, and that of the entire programme, has been to provide much needed analysis and information to help coastal communities live within the environmental limits of the natural marine resources.' In addition to forms of fishing and tourism, the research explored the importance and impact of activities including waste disposal, sand mining, aquaculture, coastal infrastructure development, and antique exploration. It then mapped whether, and to what extent, each activity caused forms of disruption including light, noise and water pollution, as well as physical damage to the coastline and seabed and the habitats they contained. Across the different countries, there was variation in the activities posing the greatest pressures with, for example, high risk coming from seine nets in Vietnam, fish farming in Malaysia and pots, traps and barricades in the Philippines. There were also differences across the main habitat types, with trawling and blast finishing among the activities posing the greatest risk to coral reefs, while shrimp farming placed the greatest pressure on mangroves, and trawling and tourism introduced the highest risk to seagrass. Dr Amy Y. Then, Associate Professor in the Institute of Biological Sciences at the Universiti Malaya in Malaysia, said: 'Findings from this paper challenge the way we think about spatially managing multiple economic activities and their impacts on vital coastal ecosystems. By identifying interactions between these activities and the habitats where they take place, we are able to make better marine spatial management decisions to ensure sustainability and resilience of these socio-ecological systems and their functioning.' Dr Radisti Praptiwi, researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, added 'This is an important study, especially in the context of data poor regions such as Indonesia. Research on understanding the impact chains linking activities and pressures to the marine environment can not only help identify the types of activities and habitats to be prioritised for management purposes, but also highlights areas for further research required for evidence-based policymaking.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXLwW2N6rpCd5	2024-11-21T15:04:50-08:00	
North Korea’s Troop Deployment To Russia: A Threat To Global Secu...	The deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to support Russia in its conflict with Ukraine poses significant threats to international security and geopolitical stability. This manoeuvre not only escalates the ongoing conflict but also further aligns authoritarian states against democratic nations, thereby challenging established international norms and the fragile global balance of power. Immediate and coordinated action from the international community is essential to avert catastrophic consequences. North Korea's involvement would intensify hostilities, embolden other authoritarian regimes to act with impunity, and potentially incite widespread instability throughout Eastern Europe and beyond. This analysis posits that such an intervention constitutes a profound threat to international security and order, necessitating urgent diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and mitigate the risks of escalation. North Korea's potential troop deployment is particularly concerning because it would directly violate United Nations sanctions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's militaristic ambitions and destabilising activities. This action would undermine the credibility of the United Nations and challenge the broader framework of international law that prohibits the external militarisation of conflicts. Furthermore, it would legitimise the use of proxy forces by authoritarian regimes to influence regional conflicts, thereby undermining the principle of state sovereignty.Russia's acceptance of North Korean troops reflects its desperation to bolster its military efforts amid increasing resistance from Ukrainian forces supported by Western allies. The involvement of North Korean troops could significantly alter the dynamics of the conflict, compelling Ukraine to adapt to a more formidable military challenge while complicating logistical and strategic considerations for its Western supporters.North Korea's motivations for this deployment appear rooted in strategic calculations. First, the North seeks to reinforce its alliance with Russia, a critical supporter during its period of international isolation and economic sanctions. In return, Russia may offer North Korea advanced weapons technology, energy resources, or diplomatic protection at the United Nations, thereby strengthening a burgeoning alliance of authoritarian states opposing Western dominance. Second, North Korea likely views this as an opportunity to showcase its military capabilities and attain a more influential position in global geopolitics. By actively participating in a significant international conflict, Pyongyang may aim to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States and other powers concerning its nuclear programme and the sanctions imposed on it. Third, North Korea may perceive this engagement as a chance to evaluate its military in real combat scenarios, potentially bolstering its domestic image among its populace and military elites. The implications of such a deployment extend significantly beyond the battlefield. Regionally, it would heighten tensions in East Asia, where nations such as South Korea and Japan are already apprehensive regarding North Korea's aggressive posture and military threats. The potential involvement of North Korean troops in Ukraine might prompt these countries to enhance their military preparedness, potentially triggering an arms race in the region. Additionally, China, North Korea’s traditional ally, would encounter a complex dilemma. While Beijing may prefer a stronger Russia to counterbalance U.S. influence, it could also express concern regarding the destabilising effects of Pyongyang’s actions and the risk of increasing international scrutiny on its role in global geopolitics. Globally, North Korea’s intervention would establish a precedent that emboldens other states to disregard international norms. Authoritarian regimes may feel more empowered to engage in military actions, whether to support allied governments or suppress opposition movements abroad. This erosion of international law could usher in an era of heightened conflict and instability, undermining decades of efforts to establish a rules-based global order. For Western powers, North Korea’s involvement creates a strategic dilemma, compelling nations such as the United States, the European Union, and NATO to determine the extent to which they are willing to counter not only Russia but also its external supporters. A miscalculation in this context could escalate the conflict into a broader war involving multiple major powers. To address this crisis, the international community must take prompt steps to prevent North Korea from deploying troops and to mitigate broader escalation risks. Diplomacy should serve as the primary tool. Direct engagement with North Korea may prove challenging; however, neutral countries could act as intermediaries to convey the consequences of such a move. Offering Pyongyang economic incentives or security assurances in exchange for refraining from intervention might represent a viable pathway. Concurrently, the United Nations must reassert its authority by convening an emergency session to address potential sanctions violations and to issue a strong condemnation against any external military involvement in the Ukraine conflict.Furthermore, the West should enhance its support for Ukraine by increasing the supply of advanced weaponry and intelligence to equip Kyiv to counter any escalation. Simultaneously, efforts should be directed toward economically and diplomatically pressuring Russia. Strengthening sanctions on Russian entities and individuals involved in facilitating troop deployments, combined with intensified efforts to isolate Moscow on the global stage, could deter further reliance on foreign military support. Establishing multilateral dialogue platforms involving nations from East Asia and Europe could also facilitate addressing the broader implications of North Korea’s actions and create mechanisms for de-escalation. In conclusion, the potential deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in Ukraine signifies a critical juncture in global politics, carrying extensive implications for international security and order. This situation underscores the increasing alignment of authoritarian regimes that are prepared to challenge established norms through overt militarism. The international community must respond with decisiveness to mitigate this development, employing a strategic blend of diplomatic engagement, economic pressure, and military preparedness. While the immediate focus should be on deterring North Korea’s involvement, long-term strategies must prioritise the reinforcement of international law principles and the promotion of cooperation to address the root causes of such conflicts. A unified multilateral approach is imperative to maintain global stability and uphold the values of peace and sovereignty that underpin the international system.

The Puzzle Of Meaning: Wittgenstein’s Revolution And His Philosop...	Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His groundbreaking works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) and Philosophical Investigations (1953), laid the foundation for two distinct phases of his thought—commonly referred to as the 'early Wittgenstein' and the 'later Wittgenstein.' His ideas profoundly shaped several domains of philosophy, including logic, language, epistemology, and metaphysics, influencing a wide range of philosophers and intellectual movements. This article explores Wittgenstein's core ideas and his impact on philosophy, shedding light on the intellectuals and movements he influenced. The Core Ideas of Wittgenstein 1. The Early Wittgenstein: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein's Tractatus addresses the relationship between language, thought, and reality. It is built on the premise that the world is composed of facts, not objects, and that language represents these facts through logical propositions. Key Ideas Picture Theory of Language Wittgenstein argues that language functions as a 'picture' of reality. A proposition mirrors a possible state of affairs, meaning that language and the world share a logical structure. For instance, the sentence 'The cat is on the mat' corresponds to the fact that a cat is indeed on the mat. Logical Atomism Influenced by Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein proposed that the world consists of atomic facts—basic, indivisible components—and language's purpose is to map these facts. Limits of Language Wittgenstein famously concluded the Tractatus with the aphorism: 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.' He suggests that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic questions lie beyond the bounds of meaningful language. This work influenced the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists, who sought to ground philosophy in logical analysis and empirical verification. 2. The Later Wittgenstein: Philosophical Investigations In his later work, Wittgenstein shifted focus, critiquing his earlier views and emphasizing the social and practical aspects of language. Key Ideas Language Games Wittgenstein argued that the meaning of words arises from their use in various 'language games'—contexts of activity governed by rules. Language is not a fixed system but a fluid, social phenomenon where meaning depends on context. Rule-Following and Practices He explored how individuals understand and follow rules, emphasizing shared practices rather than abstract logic as the foundation of communication. Family Resemblance Instead of fixed definitions, Wittgenstein introduced the idea that concepts often share overlapping similarities, like members of a family, without having a single, unifying essence. Critique of Private Language Wittgenstein rejected the idea of a purely private language, arguing that language inherently requires public criteria for meaning. This phase of Wittgenstein's thought influenced ordinary language philosophy and broader philosophical debates on meaning and understanding. Philosophers Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) Although Russell influenced Wittgenstein during the latter's early years, Wittgenstein's Tractatus left a deep impression on Russell. He adopted and later critiqued Wittgenstein's logical atomism in his own works. Russell struggled with Wittgenstein's assertion that certain topics, such as ethics, are inexpressible. 2. The Vienna Circle Wittgenstein's early ideas strongly influenced the Vienna Circle, a group of logical positivists including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath. They embraced his notion of the limits of language and sought to construct a philosophy based on scientific principles. Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) Carnap applied Wittgenstein's ideas to his project of logical syntax, although he diverged on metaphysical issues, adopting a more empiricist stance. 3. Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976) Ryle, a prominent figure in ordinary language philosophy, engaged with Wittgenstein's later works. His Concept of Mind reflected Wittgenstein's critique of dualism and the private language argument. 4. J.L. Austin (1911–1960) Austin's speech act theory owes much to Wittgenstein's focus on the practical use of language. Austin examined how utterances perform actions, aligning with Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games. 5. Peter Strawson (1919–2006) Strawson's descriptive metaphysics was influenced by Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the emphasis on ordinary language as a guide to philosophical inquiry. 6. Saul Kripke (1940–2022) Kripke's Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language is one of the most significant interpretations of Wittgenstein's later work. Kripke presented a skeptical reading, questioning how rules are followed and understood, sparking debates in epistemology and the philosophy of language. 7. Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001) A student of Wittgenstein, Anscombe translated the Tractatus into English and engaged deeply with his ideas. Her works on intention and ethics reflect Wittgensteinian insights into human action and meaning. 8. Norman Malcolm (1911–1990) Malcolm, another student of Wittgenstein, contributed to the understanding of the later Wittgenstein, particularly his views on memory and the mind. 9. Stanley Cavell (1926–2018) Cavell explored Wittgenstein's later philosophy in relation to skepticism and ordinary language. His works, such as The Claim of Reason, extended Wittgensteinian ideas into aesthetics and ethics. 10. John Searle (1932–2022) Searle's philosophy of language and mind, particularly his theory of speech acts, draws on Wittgenstein's analysis of language use. 11. Richard Rorty (1931–2007) Rorty integrated Wittgenstein's later philosophy into his critique of traditional epistemology, advocating for a pragmatic approach that aligns with Wittgenstein's anti-essentialism. 12. Michel Foucault (1926–1984) Although not directly linked, Foucault's concept of discourse reflects Wittgenstein's emphasis on the social and contextual dimensions of language. 13. Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) Derrida's deconstruction shares affinities with Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the focus on meaning as contextual and contingent. 14. Hilary Putnam (1926–2016) Putnam engaged with Wittgenstein's ideas in his critique of metaphysical realism and his exploration of the philosophy of mind and language. 15. D.Z. Phillips (1934–2006) Phillips applied Wittgenstein's ideas to philosophy of religion, rejecting metaphysical approaches and focusing on the use of religious language. Movements Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Logical Positivism Wittgenstein's early work shaped the agenda of logical positivism, although he later distanced himself from their strict empiricism. 2. Ordinary Language Philosophy The later Wittgenstein inspired philosophers like Austin and Ryle, emphasizing the analysis of everyday language. 3. Postmodernism Wittgenstein's critique of grand theories and focus on contextual meaning resonated with postmodernist thinkers. 4. Philosophy of Mind His ideas on rule-following, private language, and mental states influenced debates in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Critiques and Counterpoints While Wittgenstein's ideas were transformative, they also faced criticism. Karl Popper critiqued Wittgenstein's view of philosophy as merely descriptive, arguing for a more critical and problem-solving approach. Noam Chomsky rejected Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games, advocating for a universal grammar rooted in cognitive structures. Conclusion Ludwig Wittgenstein's legacy lies in his dual contributions to philosophy- the logical precision of the Tractatus and the dynamic, contextual approach of the Philosophical Investigations. His influence extends across multiple fields, from analytic philosophy to postmodernism, and his ideas continue to inspire and challenge philosophers. By reimagining the boundaries of language and thought, Wittgenstein reshaped the philosophical landscape, leaving an enduring mark on intellectual history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgG3YrJqnlYH9	2024-11-21T09:28:18-08:00	
Ukraine Accuses Russia Of Firing Intercontinental Ballistic Missi...	(RFE/RL) -- Russia launched a massive missile attack early on November 21 on Ukraine that caused damage in at least two regions, Ukraine's air force and regional leaders reported, as the whole country was under an air-raid alert for several hours. The Russian attack, which Kyiv said included the use of an intercontinental ballistic missile, comes just days after reports that Ukraine used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS systems to strike military targets deeper inside Russia following the long-sought approval by President Joe Biden. 'On the morning of November 21, 2024...Russian troops attacked the city of Dnipro (facilities and critical infrastructure) with missiles of various types. In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation,' the Ukrainian Air Force said in its statement on Telegram. The Kremlin has refused to comment on the alleged firing of the ICBM, which, if proved, would be the first use of such a weapon in war. ICBMs are designed to deliver long-distance nuclear strikes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram, 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is. And how afraid he is.' 'All characteristics -- speed, altitude -- [point to an] intercontinental ballistic missile,' Zelenskiy said. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry walked back the air force's definitive statement, saying Kyiv is still determining what type of missile struck in Dnipro. 'If it is confirmed that specifically an intercontinental ballistic missile was used, then we believe it can be said that Putin's Russia has degraded to the status of North Korea,' ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said. Military analysts, however, were cautious about labeling the missile as an ICBM, noting such missiles can also be classified as intermediate-range missiles when their payloads are increased and ranges decreased. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said that, if confirmed, the use of an ICBM would be 'extremely serious.' The Pentagon did not immediately return a request for comment. The main target of the Russian attack was the southeastern region of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine's most important industrial region, and its capital, the city of Dnipro. Ukraine's air force said that besides the ICBM, Russian aircraft also launched a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile and seven subsonic Kh-101 cruise missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 missiles, the air force reported. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said his region bore the brunt of the Russian attack. 'Since early in the morning, the aggressor massively attacked our region,' Lysak reported on Telegram, adding that preliminary information showed that an industrial facility was damaged in the regional capital, Dnipro, where two fires were started by the attack. Explosions were also reported in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region. Moscow's use of a large number of sophisticated missiles as opposed to the usual drone attacks appears to be in response to Ukraine's gaining approval to use some Western-donated long-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia. On November 20, Russian military bloggers and a source cited by Reuters reported that Ukraine had fired up to 12 Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles into Russia's Kursk region, part of which has been under Ukrainian control following a surprise incursion by Ukrainian troops in August. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to confirm whether the missiles had been used. Previously, London had given permission to use the Storm Shadows, which have a 250-kilometer range, within Ukraine's territory. Earlier this week, Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike a military facility in Russia's Bryansk region after Biden was reported as giving his OK. The White House has not officially confirmed the approval and Ukraine hasn't directly acknowledged the use of ATACMS on Russian targets. Russia has long warned that Ukraine's use Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside its territory would mark a serious escalation of the conflict. On November 21, Moscow said a new U.S. missile defence base in the Polish town of Redzikowo near the Baltic coast, which was opened on November 13 as part of a broader NATO missile shield, will lead to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger. 'This is another frankly provocative step in a series of deeply destabilising actions by the Americans and their allies in the North Atlantic alliance in the strategic sphere,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 'This leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger,' Zakharova said. Poland rejected the claim, saying there were no nuclear missiles at the base. 'It is a base that serves the purpose of defense, not attack,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said on November 21.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgHAEKF7rf7CP	2024-11-21T09:26:49-08:00	
The Mainstream Media’s Big Lie Never Stops – OpEd	Eduardo Porter joined the chorus of people telling us that the inequality of the last four decades was just the result of the free market in his Washington Post column. As Porter puts it: 'A paper last year by economists from Princeton and Columbia argues that Democrats started losing the working class back in the 1970s, when they bought into the notion that the government should let market forces rip, dropping the New Deal approach of improving workers’ lot via strong unions, job guarantees, minimum wages and protectionism — and instead assisting the economy’s losers via taxes and transfers.' He then argues that this is the source of the rise in working class support for authoritarianism. The problem with this line is that we did not let market forces rip. Government-granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the market. They are hugely important in the economy, likely shifting more than $1 trillion a year ($8,000 a family) from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from these monopoles. Higher drug prices are the most visible transfer, but these monopolies also add hugely to the price of a wide range of other items like computers, software, smartphones. Then we also have government support for the financial industry. This was most visible during the financial crisis when the government directly saved many of the largest financial corporations in the country from bankruptcy. There are many other supports for the financial industry, such as deposit insurance, which are less visible. This sector is the source of many of the largest fortunes in the economy. We also have rules of corporate governance that allow CEOs and other top executives to rip off the companies they work for. This allows hugely bloated pay at the top which comes at the expense of ordinary workers. These rules are not 'letting the market rip.' They are written by politicians who get campaign contributions from top executives. Also 'free trade' has never meant free trade in highly paid professions like physicians’ and dentists’ services. If these highly paid professionals were subject to the same sort of competition as autoworkers and textiles workers their pay would be considerably lower, and healthcare would be cheaper for the rest of us. I go into these issues in more detail in my book Rigged (it’s free), but the basic point should be clear. There is a widely repeated lie that inequality was driven by the natural workings of the market. The reality is that politicians of both parties worked to structure the market to bring about more unequal outcomes. The media and most of the academic establishment actively push this lie at every opportunity. And people are pissed. To be clear, I’m sure that almost none of them know anything about patent policy or the rules of corporate governance. They just know that the rules are structured against them, and they are absolutely right. And elite outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Atlantic won’t let anyone make this obvious point in the spaces they control.

The World Monetary Order: From Currency Globalization To Currency...	The world economic order began to undergo a profound shift after Russia launched its war against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response. Not only is the architecture of the global economy changing, but also the global monetary system. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-led unipolar world order was fueling the process of hyper-globalization. For its part, hyper-globalization has largely contributed to the maintenance of that unipolar world order, which primarily stems from the interconnectedness of globalization and world order. The unipolar world order and hyper-globalization played a central role in determining the global monetary system, with the US dollar commanding leadership in world trade as the primary reserve currency. By 2000, over 70% of all foreign-exchange reserves were held in US dollars, and its dominance in international trade led exporters and importers to increasingly rely on dollar-denominated borrowing. Based on this, the US dollar, as the world’s main reserve currency, was employed to advance US interests. Hyper-globalization, in turn, strengthened the position of the US dollar in the global economy. In this context, the clear dominance of the US dollar in both international trade and global foreign-exchange reserves can be characterized as currency globalization. The economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia have affected the global dominance of the US dollar. At the start of the war in Ukraine, one-fifth of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves were in dollar assets, much of which were in Germany, France, Britain and Japan, which, along with other Western countries, are now working together to isolate Moscow from the global financial system. In the context of the US dollar’s weakening position as the dominant global currency, the West’s seizure of nearly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held by the US and its allies, and the use of the proceeds to defend and rebuild Ukraine, has taken on particular significance. It is important to acknowledge that over the past half-century, the dominance of the US dollar has experienced fluctuations. For instance, while the dollar’s share of world currency reserves was 80% in 1970, by 1980 it had dropped to 58%, and by 1990 to 47%. However, by 2000, it had rebounded to 70%. Since then, the share of the US dollar in world currency reserves has declined again, by 2020 reaching 59%. Notably, this decline was not accompanied by significant gains for traditional reserve currencies like the euro, yen and pound sterling. Instead, the shift has been towards non-traditional reserve currencies, such as the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singapore dollar and the currencies of the Nordic countries. With the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the process of globalization entered the stage of confrontational globalization, seeing the countries of the world divided into three groups: those supporting Western sanctions, those supporting Russia, and neutral countries. As a result, the unipolar world order began to transform into a multipolar world order. This could not help but influence the world monetary order that developed under hyper-globalization, when the geopolitical factor stood in the way of monetary globalization. Currency geopolitics, where geopolitical factors increasingly determine both the currencies in international trade and the formation of foreign exchange reserves, is not a new phenomenon. After the First World War, geopolitical motives played an important role in selecting international currencies for foreign exchange reserves. While the geopolitical factor remains in the era of currency globalization, it does not dominate the system. From this, it follows that currency globalization and currency geopolitics do not exclude each other at all, but rather complement each other. At the same time,in certain historical periods, as a rule, one of them prevails: either currency globalization or currency geopolitics. It is also important to highlight that the dollar’s status as a global reserve currency is declining not only due to geopolitical factors, but also due to US fiscal policy, which has resulted in central and commercial banks in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates having less and less need for US dollars. The geopolitically driven shift away from the US dollar in trade transactions will reduce its role as a reserve currency, although this role cannot in principle be reduced to zero. In the context of the significant uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the modern geopolitical landscape, and the geopolitical fragmentation of risks resulting from the Western sanctions on Russia, there has been a noteworthy accumulation of gold as an alternative reserve asset, and increase in the use of various currencies in international trade. The euro, while it is the second-largest reserve currency by scale of global distribution, cannot completely replace the US dollar in the global economy. Despite accounting for 21% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves as of 2023, the euro is not reliable as a universal reserve asset. Structural and political problems in the EU, particularly the lack of a coordinated fiscal policy among its member states, undermine its stability and appeal as an alternative to the US dollar. In 2023, both Western-sanctioned Russia and China called for the creation of a multipolar global monetary system. However, the prospect of a near-term transition from US dollar-dominance to an alternative global reserve currency appears unrealistic. BRICS+ (which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates) is seeking to play a significant role in challenging the dominance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. A key aspect of this strategy is the shift towards conducting oil and gas trade in national currencies, as a result of which prices for them would not be set in US dollars. As a result, these countries have managed to increase the share of trade carried out between them to 65%. The petrodollar system, which emerged in the 1970s to evaluate oil in dollars, significantly reinforced the position of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. However, due to the factors noted above, such as the Western economic sanctions against Russia, many countries have started to seek alternatives to the petrodollar. The growing energy ties between Saudi Arabia and China have contributed to the replacement of the petrodollar with the petro-yuan, with long-term oil trading contracts denominated in yuan. It should be noted that many developing countries had expressed a desire for an alternative to the US dollar long before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This desire grew even stronger after the West imposed sanctions on Russia, including by cutting off many of its banks from SWIFT and freezing its $300 billion in international assets. Although China is increasingly using the renminbi in cross-border payments, its financial system still remains dependent not only on the US dollar, but also on the US financial system, which is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. China’s growing role in global trade has contributed to the yuan’s rise as a global currency, although there are objective reasons (notably strict government controls on capital flows, lack of transparency in financial markets, and centralization of one-party political power) that make many countries reluctant to use it as a reserve currency. The BRICS countries intend to create a new reserve currency backed by a basket of their own national currencies, with the potential for gold-backing in addition. This initiative is expected to accelerate the de-dollarization process, reducing global dependence on the dollar. That said, due to the unresolved nature of many institutional, organizational and technical issues, BRICS is still far from resolving the issue of introducing a new reserve currency. The push for de-dollarization will have serious consequences for both the US and the global economy. In particular, inflationary pressures could increase for the US economy, the US position in international financial institutions may weaken, while developing countries could reduce their dollar debt and gain greater financial autonomy. Although the US dollar is likely to continue its global dominance and retain its role as the world’s main reserve currency in the short and medium term, it is fundamentally unacceptable to overlook the gradual strengthening of the currency geopolitics factor. It should be emphasized that the relationship between cryptocurrencies and geopolitics warrants independent study, as do the geopolitical aspects of central bank digital currencies. In conclusion, we can say that the new world monetary order is being formed as a combination of monetary globalization and monetary geopolitics, in which the latter plays a predominant role.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYAYd36wrCSz	2024-11-21T09:22:44-08:00	
Ukraine’s Choice: NATO Membership Or Going Nuclear – OpEd	Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17, surprised many especially Ukrainians, that in the war for its existence, Ukraine now has a choice between NATO membership or manufacturing nuclear weapons. NATO and most governments know well that Ukraine not only has extensive civil nuclear facilities and supplies, but it also has considerable expertise in nuclear weapons manufacturing. Ukraine’s Nuclear History and Capability At the time of Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, estimated at 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A senior Ukrainian official quoted by Bild was reported to have said earlier this year that: 'We have the material; we have the knowledge. If there is an order, we will only need a few weeks to produce the first bomb.' As Russian forces continue advancing on the battlefield, reports from the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, Ukraine has the capability to assemble a nuclear weapon within months. The report highlights that Ukraine could rapidly create a bomb using plutonium derived from spent fuel rods. With about seven tons of reactor plutonium available, experts claim the material is sufficient to produce hundreds of warheads with tactical yields. President Zelensky possibly has made these calculative statements as he well knows Firstly that US led NATO is not inclined to induct Ukraine as a NATO member and Secondly Russian President Putin keeps threatening to escalate this war into a nuclear strike if the US sanctions firing of the long-range US made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles into Russia. Ukraine may already have in its possession some kind of a nuclear bomb or even procured one discreetly or clandestinely going by President Zelensky’s statement. President Biden on his way out did sanction firing of the long-range US made ATACMS missiles into Russia. Ukraine firedUS made ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time on November 19. Will President Putin respond with a nuclear strike now lowering the thresh hold of a nuclear strike? Not likely! The strike in Bryansk marks an intensification of the conflict amid broader uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House who has repeatedly stated that he will end the war. So, all the stake holders of the Ukraine-Russia War are taking actions most suited to them before the just months before unpredictable President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office and heralds a potential majorshift in course. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that five out of the six missiles, fired at a target in the country’s Bryansk region, were shot down and that the sixth was damaged, dismissing the attack as largely ineffective. But Ukrainian officials said the strike caused a conflagration at a weapons depot in the city of Karachev, just over 70 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. If this be the Russian capability to destroy the ATACMS missiles then why should Russia react with a nuclear weapon head strike? Now the Russian Army must be planning to neutralize the ATACMS missile sites. US Vetoes UN Security Council Gaza Ceasefire The US on 20 Nov 2024 vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, drawing harsh criticism from most of the UN members. The draft was put forward by the council's 10 non-permanent members, demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The 15-member council voted 14-1 in favor of the resolution, and the US used its veto as a permanent council member to block it. North Korean Soldiers deployed in Kursk, Russia Tensions have heightened with reports that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been stationed in Kursk, Russia. If North Korean forces engage in combat, it would further escalate the situation. The open-source intelligence is limited about the strength of North Korean troops in support of the Russian forces. Initial reports were that there are Korean troops to operate their launcher systems for KN-23 missiles having a range of about 300km. Ukrainian sources claim that the Koreans are equipped with the weapons required for front line combat. Wonder the Korean troops have been sent for direct combat with the Ukrainian forces with the potential for escalation. Zelensky Warns NATO Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17 has indirectly warned NATO that his country may pursue nuclear weapons if it is not granted NATO membership. A press conference was also held alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who refrained from making any statement. However, later that day, Zelensky said that Ukraine has no intention to pursue nuclear weapons. Ukraine’s foreign ministry also confirmed the country’s commitment to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Zelensky’s rhetoric or Putin’s credible threat or desperate bluffs have finally had the effect on the West post Ukraine fired six long-range US ATACMS missiles at targets inside Russia and President Putin lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons: NATO countries are asking their citizens to be prepared for a war. Have started issuing pamphlets to their citizens, advising them on how to prepare for World War III. Denmark has already sent emails to its citizens to stock up on dry rations, water and medicines so that they could manage for three days of emergency, including a nuclear attack. Finland, too, updated its online brochure on 'preparing for incidents and crises' amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine war. The US and some other Western embassies (The Italian, Greek and Spanish) in Kyiv remained closed on November 20, having received a warning of a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital. 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of US long range missiles into Russia. The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' — Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024. And now the US vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Is it to put Trump and his team into a difficult position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East as during his campaign, Trump has vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if he regains the presidency. He previously has called President Zelensky 'the greatest salesman on Earth.' Zelensky’s rhetorics or Putin’s credible threats or desperate Nuclear bluffs are not likely as Putin is also keen to end the war and expects Trump to mediate a negotiation between the two warring nations to fulfill his promise and also prove that he is a world leader. Russia’s war against Ukraine presently is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. How Team Trump plays their cards differently than Biden’s administration is to be seen in beginning 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYs8972QQGta	2024-11-21T09:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine War: UN Peace Forces As Part Of A Comprehensive Peace Dea...	By Jonathan Power To its credit the Soviet Union and its successor state, Russia, has long supported UN peacekeeping, a practice that originated in 1960 in the time of UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, who evolved the concept during the great Congolese civil war when it was in danger of becoming a Cold War flashpoint. But what Russia has never contemplated is UN troops in its own backyard. 'Summoning the UN deep into Russia’s historical space is a serious step', Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, told The Economist. There does seem to be a shift in Moscow’s thinking on this highly sensitive issue. In 2017 President Vladimir Putin put forward a plan for the deployment of UN troops in south-eastern Ukraine. Not that he imagined their use along the Russian/Ukrainian border—that would be too much—but he wanted them to divide the fighting forces inside Ukraine. An objection is that this would formalise the internal division in Ukraine. But even so it was a bold move as it would mean UN soldiers getting in the way of the secessionist, Russian-orientated, militia in south-eastern Ukraine. They wouldn’t be able to expand the territory they already control without overrunning UN troops. The idea of a UN peacekeeping operation in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, was first discussed over a decade and a half ago by a small group of independent Russian and American experts on the Finnish island of Boisto. Their proposals were rejected by both the Ukrainian government and Moscow. Moreover, the cease-fire negotiated at Minsk by Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine in February 2015 was regularly violated and some of the heavy weapons that were pulled back from the demarcation line returned. The Minsk 11 agreement also lost its initial momentum. Moscow justifiably blames Kiev for not implementing the agreement. Critical promises were not followed through, such as changing the country’s constitution, passing a law to establish the special status of the Donetsk and Lugansk enclaves in Donbas, underlining their Russian-language rights, holding elections and declaring an amnesty. A divided government led by Petro Poroshenko, partly under the influence of right-wing movements whose pedigree stretches back to Nazi times, was incapable of moving on these vital issues. Putin still seems to think he can go on hoodwinking the world about Russia’s early role. He maintains that the 'soldiers are men following the call of their hearts to fulfil their duty or are voluntarily taking part in hostilities, including in south-east Ukraine'. Russia appeared to believe that without these local militias the Poroshenko government would have just walked in. Both in Washington and Moscow some macho policy makers and in particular Putin himself, have talked about the necessity of preparations for a limited nuclear war (although, in all probability, there never could be a limited one—recall the joint Ronald Reagan/Mikhail Gorbachev statement that a nuclear war 'could never be won and must never be fought'. This is why some of us think Putin’s talk of a UN role is a big step forward. Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the influential Global Affairs, and who has the ear of the Russian Foreign Ministry, argues that Putin should expand his UN ideas. According to Alexei Arbatov, head of Russia’s Centre for International Security, a UN force must be strong enough to ensure a 100% cease-fire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. The mission would look less like the failure in Kosovo in 1999 and more like the success in Cyprus that began in 1974, separating the Greek-speaking half of the island from the Turkish-speaking. UN forces have been deployed along the dividing line for over 50 years and are still there. They have held back what many Greeks have long believed is the danger of a renewed threat of ethnic cleansing of the kind that the Turks tried to carry out in 1974. At first the UN troops had to fight their way in. In the Ukraine case, peace between the two sides in Donbas would not be just a dividing line between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, it would probably in time bring peace on the Russian-Ukraine border. Putin’s now old idea must be explored. With Ukraine’s army losing out is a good time to explore it as part of an all-encompassing peace deal. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnUVSH0qoyici	2024-11-21T09:15:09-08:00	
A Mahdi, Messiahs, And Wonderful Non-Jewish Leaders – OpEd	Muslims say: 'There is no god but Allah' and people should worship only him, rejecting idolatry and polytheism. Jews agree. Muslims believe Allah created the world in six days and so do Jews and Christians. Allah sent thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, who brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can also agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah, notably the Pages of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that these messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scriptures before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Unlike the biblical Yahweh (often misread as Jehovah), Allah has no personal name, and his traditional 99 names are really epithets. Muslims claim to totally reject anthropomorphic descriptions of Allah, yet the Qur'an sometimes describes Allah as speaking, sitting on a throne, and having a face, eyes and hands. Allah is also the Master of the Day of Judgment, when the good, especially believers, will be sent to their heavenly reward, and the wicked, especially unbelievers, will be dispatched to hellfire. Jews and Christians also have traditions about end of days judgments, Armageddon, Gog —Magog and redemptive Messiahs. Judaism and, Christianity and Islam all teach their followers to take care of the earth. They also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardship and khalifah) for the planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. Recent Jewish and Christian history enables us to understand in a new way Isaiah's famous passage (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) about God's servant whose tragic suffering can be redemptive to those who once reviled and belittled him. In Jewish thought the Prophet Isaiah himself provides the strongest evidence for the claim that God's servant is Israel, the Jewish People. Four verses in prior chapters of Isaiah specifically state that Israel/Jacob is God's servant. 'You Israel are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen' (41:8), 'Hear me now, Jacob my servant; hear me, Israel my chosen' (44:1), 'Have no fear, Jacob my servant: Jeshurun whom I have chosen' (44:2), 'Remember all this, Jacob, remember Israel, for you are my servant' (44:21). These verses make it clear that Israel/Jacob is God's chosen servant. The national community is spoken of in terms of an individual, as is often the case in the Bible (see Jeremiah 30:10). However, many rabbis did identify Isaiah's messianic figure as a person, usually as a Messiah, a descendant of David, from the tribe of Judah. Other Rabbis had other interpretations. Rabbi Sa'adyah Ga'on glosses the figure as referring to the Prophet Jeremiah. Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel rejects that and thinks the suffering servant is Josiah, King of Israel. I think this individual is a messianic figure called by the rabbis: Messiah, son of Joseph, i.e. from one of the northern tribes, who precedes David's son, and is killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. If we keep in mind both the Josephson messiah as well as the role of Israel/Jacob as God's chosen servant, we will better understand Isaiah's suffering servant prophecy. The belief that there would be two different messiahs, one a moral political leader from the house of David (Davidson) and the other, a religious reformer from the house of Aaron (Aronson), as well as a special 'end of days' prophet such as Elijah or Jeremiah (Matthew 16:14) is found in inter- testament literature. A Dead Sea scroll states that the Qumran community must continue to live according to the original discipline 'until there shall come a prophet (Elijah) and the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel' (Manual of Discipline 9:11). There is also a rabbinic belief in a messianic figure from the northern tribes called a Josephson messiah who is killed by Israel's enemies. This idea may be modeled on the example of Saul who reigned before David and was killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. Thus there could be as many as four individual messianic figures as well as the people of Israel who act as God's agents in bringing about the Messianic Age. Gentile rulers also play a role, first as destructive oppressors of the Jewish people, and second when their successors later acknowledge their error and are ultimately included in helping bring about the Messianic Age's worldwide blessings. The Persian King Cyrus was such a messiah (Isaiah 45:1) All of this makes for a complicated future scenario that might take generations, or even centuries to develop. When people are persecuted, afflicted and oppressed as a community, and despised and rejected as individuals, they need hope for a much quicker and simpler process of redemption. This is why there is an overwhelming focus on the final stage Davidson messiah by most teachers, preachers, commentators and expositors. This is also the reason that those who believe in the imminent coming of the Davidson messiah always think it will occur soon within their lifetime (John 14:19, 21:22). Islam adds to all these Messiahs the figure of a Mahdi (Arabic: ٱلْمَهْدِيّ al-Mahdī). A messianic figure in Islamic eschatology who will appear at the end of times to rid the world of evil and injustice. Said to be a descendant of Muhammad, and thus a descendant of Prophet Abraham, he will appear shortly before Prophet ʿĪsā (Jesus) and defeat the evil forces of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear metaphorically in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, nations, catastrophes of nature; and in our own days as racist nationalist states and political movements. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazi racists, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (Qur'an 18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, Nazi racists, and the Communists, as well as widespread human pollution of Mother Earth, that near the time of the end of days will penetrate every part of the world like the persistently high levels of ozone pollution in Asia that are costing China, Japan and South Korea an estimated $63 billion annually in lost rice, wheat and maize crops. The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (Qur'an 21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 1/2 centuries later as the State of Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for many generations. Though the Mahdi is not mentioned in the Quran, and is absent from the two most-revered Sunni hadith collections: Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim – he is mentioned in other Hadith literature; and Islamic end-time images of pre Judgement Days natural catastrophes are similar to Christian and Jewish imagery of nature's potential disruptiveness (plagues, famine, draught, earthquakes etc.). Also, since humans have free will, the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we do. Repentance produces changes in the future of both individuals and nations. Repentance enables some individuals and communities to escape the consequences of prior evil. On the other hand, God's promise is that evil powers will never succeed in destroying Israel or in overcoming worldwide justice in the long run. Thus even without full repentance, God will act if the Divine promise of a Messianic Age is threatened. As Isaiah states a few verses prior to the suffering servant passage, 'The Lord says: you were sold but no price was paid, and without payment you shall be redeemed.' (52:3) i.e. all your suffering in exile was not merited and your redemption from exile will not be fully earned. Both are part of God's outline for human destiny and will occur sooner (through repentance) or later (in God's own time). Finally, if one believes that God inspired prophets are able to describe scenarios of various developments in the distant future then one has to accept that the understanding of these passages should change and improve as we come closer and closer to the times they describe. As an example, Jeremiah describes a radical future in which women surround men, 'The Lord will create a new thing on earth-a woman will surround a man' (31:22). The great commentator Rashi understands 'surround' to mean encircle. The most radical thing Rashi can think of (and in 11th century France it was radical) is that women will propose marriage (a wedding ring, or encircling the groom at the wedding ceremony) to men. In today's feminist generation we can see women surrounding men in many fields once almost exclusively male such as law, medical and theological schools. This means that a few generations from now we might have even better understandings of some predictive passages in the prophets, so humility should always be with us. Now let us try to understand the suffering servant passage in light of 20th century Jewish history. Isaiah proclaims the good news of peace and salvation (52:7) when God returns to Zion (8) and comforts his people (9) so all the Gentiles see his salvation (10). The Jewish people will depart the exile not in flight but under God's protection (11&12). Israel/Jacob, God's servant, whose appearance (14) was disfigured, marred and appalling (during the holocaust) will prosper (13) and be lifted up (in subsequent generations). A marvel for many nations, whose rulers will shut their (anti-Semitic) mouths because of this, since they will see what they had not been taught and will understand what they never heard of (15). For centuries the Church taught that the Jews were being punished for rejecting Christ and couldn't be redeemed without believing Jesus was the Son of God. Now some Gentile rulers see that this teaching is not really correct doctrine. The biblical message of God's commitment to redeem Israel without explicitly believing in Jesus wasn't believed (53:1) but now there is a growing minority who affirm a two covenant theology. Many Gentile rulers (kings, governments, business and religious leaders) now admit what their anti-Semitism did to the people of Israel. The Jews were like a tender shoot in dry ground, unattractive and undesirable, despised and rejected, sorrowful and familiar (intimate) with suffering (52:2&3). We (the Gentile rulers) scapegoated them and they carried our projected infirmities, but we rationalized that the Jews were stricken and afflicted by God, not by us. Israel was pierced and crushed due to our transgressions (anti-Semitism) for we sought our peace by blaming Jews for all kinds of evils (54:4&5). This anti-Semitism led to: Crusaders slaughtering Jews in France and Germany, blaming Jews for the Bubonic Plague in central Europe, torture by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, many expulsions and pogroms at various times throughout Europe, and the deaths of tens of thousands of Jewish civilians massacred during wars in Poland (1648-9) and the Ukraine (1919-21). All this set the stage for the worst martyrdom of all, the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust (plus five million non-Jews). Each evil regime turned its own kind of iniquity (religious, political, economic and social) on its Jews (54:6). Again and again Jews were passively taken away to exile, or like sheep to the slaughter cut off from the land of the living, though they had done no violence (54:7-9). Yet faithful Jews accepted all this as God's will and refused to abandon their religion or their people. Survivors of the concentration camps, who had lost their entire family, had the courage and faith to marry, and lived to see their offspring (Jewish children and grandchildren) grow up (54:10). Many, whose days were prolonged (54:10) and are now in their 70's and 80's, have lived long enough to see the most amazing outcomes of the Holocaust. The return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the rebuilding of its cities and countryside are the subject of many passages in Isaiah both preceding chapter 53 and following it. The realization of these prophecies did not require a Holocaust. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the mass departure of more than one million Soviet Jews to the land of Israel also are not directly linked to the Holocaust.But the redemptive aspect of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust for Gentile rulers and nations is emphasized in this suffering servant passage. Of course, the Turkish government still denies responsibility for the death of over one million Armenians; the Japanese deny slaughtering 300,000 residents of Nanking during WW2, and only a few French leaders admit to the complicity of the Vichy government in rounding up Jews for the Nazi death camps. Even the UN has not officially admitted its dereliction of duty in the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda. Yet the few steps of public confession and atonement that have been taken by some political and religious leaders are truly remarkable when you consider that nothing like this has ever happened in previous human history. If the Holocaust stimulated a willingness of religious and political leaders to accept responsibility for past examples of persecution and iniquity done by their institutions and governments continues to expand, society will improve greatly. If other governments and institutions admit responsibility for the sins of their predecessors it reduces the likelihood of repetition. Then the numbering of God's innocent servant- Israel/Jacob with transgressors will, when the lessons are finally learned, justify not just those directly involved in the atonement process but also many others. Israel's pouring out of life (six million deaths) will not have been in vain, and the revivified Jewish people will see the light of life and be satisfied (54:11-12). The ability of Christians and Jews to understand that both religions' interpretation of Isaiah's Suffering Servant has helped bring us closer to an age of increased human rights will lead to a greater demand for universal peace and security. (Isaiah 2:1-4 and Micah 4:1-8) Christians have always stressed the individual aspects of personal self sacrifice for salvation. By adding national and organizational aspects, Christians can help elevate the moral level of political and organizational behavior. When current political and religious leaders feel the need to publicly acknowledge the sins of their predecessors, itt helps to reduce the level of self righteousness that usually accompanies the corruption of political and religious power. It also warns religious people and their leaders that in the words of Pascal, 'Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.' Jews can now begin to understand how the role of Jesus as the Josephson Messiah, and the example of the passion of Jesus, has motivated many political and religious leaders in our generation to apologize for evils they personally did not do, in order to set the record right. The Davidson messiah will come after all nations, religions and political parties learn to respect and value as a gift from God, each other's right to differ in large as well as small issues. (Micah 4:5) Since this religious reform requires great leadership from all the major religions, each religion will have to produce its own Aronson religious reformer Messianic Mahdi figure. These many messianic mahdi religious reformers are referred to by Prophet Jeremiah positively as 'shepherds' (3:14-18) and their teachings will provide each religion with a reformed and renewed covenant (31:31-34). The advocacy of religious pluralism by the major religious communities will then produce the bases for the ultimate messianic predictions of worldwide peace, justice, prosperity, and salvation that the prophets proclaimed so often. The Davidson Messiah will come last to crown our faith in God's inspiration and deliverance. Until then let us remember that the Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnTu5aiHOBFZ0	2024-11-21T09:10:56-08:00	
Maryam Rajavi’s Conference At European Parliament And The Shamefu...	On Wednesday, November 20, 2024, a major parliamentary conference titled 'A New Policy on Iran: Centred on the People and Resistance' was held at the European Union headquarters in Brussels. The conference featured Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), alongside several Members of the European Parliament. Yet, shockingly, none of the Persian-language media outlets affiliated with European governments covered the event. This omission is not just regrettable and shameful, but catastrophic, as it serves the interests of the Iranian regime by censoring, suppressing, and distorting the Iranian Resistance Movement. In her address, Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that 'Democratic change in Iran is an achievable goal.' She continued, 'Today, I have come to the home of European democracy to declare that the regime’s terrorism and warmongering can be brought to an end. The overthrow and democratic transformation of this regime by the people and resistance of Iran is achievable and within reach.' Mrs. Rajavi then outlined the key components needed to achieve this goal: 1. The People and the Resistance: The Iranian people are deeply discontented, with widespread anger and frustration. This movement is supported by rebellious units (components of the National Liberation Army of Iran) that challenge the regime’s oppressive grip. Women, leading this movement, are at the forefront of Iran's fight for freedom and change. Video clips showcasing 20,000 acts of resistance across Iran were presented at the NCRI’s annual gathering in July 2023. 2. The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK): This organization, with its thousands of experienced cadres, has fought for 60 years against both the Shah’s dictatorship and the current mullahs’ regime. It has sacrificed thousands of martyrs and is considered the regime’s primary adversary. 3. A Democratic Alternative: The NCRI, founded 43 years ago by Massoud Rajavi, consists of 457 members representing diverse political ideologies, making it the longest-standing political coalition in Iranian history. It advocates for freedoms, women’s rights, national autonomy, equality between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the separation of religion from state, the abolition of the death penalty, a non-nuclear Iran, and peace in the Middle East. In 2002, the NCRI exposed the regime’s secret nuclear facilities, at great cost to itself. 4. Widespread Support and Endurance: The Iranian Resistance has organized the largest gatherings of Iranians abroad, demonstrating the broad support base within Iran. Families of 100,000 martyrs and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners over the last 45 years stand behind this movement. A network of Iranian professionals, organized into 320 associations worldwide, plays a crucial role in rebuilding Iran’s future. This resistance operates independently, relying on self-sufficiency for its funding. Its members cover the costs for daily operations, communications, publications, gatherings, and a 24-hour satellite TV channel that broadcasts to Iran. 5. International Support for the NCRI’s 10-Point Plan: The NCRI’s 10-point plan for a free Iran has received widespread endorsement, including statements from 34 parliamentary majorities across Europe and the U.S., as well as some Arab countries. Furthermore, 137 former world leaders and 80 Nobel laureates have supported this initiative, underscoring their belief in establishing a democratic republic in Iran, rejecting both religious and monarchical dictatorships. Censorship and the Right to Information in the European Union The right to the free flow of information is a cornerstone of democracy and human rights in the European Union. This right ensures that citizens and residents have access to information held by governments and public bodies. Articles 10 and 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantee freedom of expression, protecting the right to receive and disseminate information without government interference. However, this fundamental principle is being violated in the case of the Iranian Resistance Movement, particularly by European media and institutions. The EU’s appeasement policies toward the Iranian regime have contributed to the suppression and distortion of the Resistance Movement’s narrative. This censorship is part of a long-standing pattern: The deportation and exile of NCRI supporters to Gabon in the 1980s. Blacklisting the Resistance Movement in the 1990s to appease Iran’s then-President Khatami. The June 17, 2003, raid on the NCRI’s headquarters in France under President Chirac. Illegal obstruction of MEK demonstrations in Berlin and Paris. Illegal Obstruction of MEK Demonstrations in Berlin and France In 2005, the German government obstructed a demonstration by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) in Berlin. However, the court ruled this action illegal, allowing the MEK to hold the demonstration. This event highlighted repeated efforts to restrict the group’s political activities in Europe and the MEK’s legal efforts to challenge these restrictions. Similarly, in 2023, the French government attempted to block a MEK demonstration in Paris at the request of the Iranian regime. However, a court ruled the French government’s actions illegal, permitting the protest to take place. Censorship, by nature, involves restricting or controlling information and suppressing dissenting political views. Typically enforced by authoritarian regimes, its consequences include the erosion of free speech, the stifling of creativity and innovation, diminished public awareness, historical distortion, and the promotion of extremism. While it is not surprising for authoritarian regimes to impose such policies, it is deeply troubling when European-affiliated media adopt these tactics against a legitimate resistance movement. This complicity effectively serves the interests of Iran’s tyrannical and terrorist regime, which fuels extremism, terrorism, and instability in the region and beyond. Iran’s Regime and Terrorism: The 2018 Bombing Plot A prominent example of the Iranian regime’s involvement in terrorism occurred in 2018 when an attempt to bomb a major MEK rally in Paris was thwarted. The plot, orchestrated by the Iranian regime, saw one of its diplomats, Assadollah Assadi, arrested. Assadi, a diplomat stationed at Iran’s embassy in Austria, was convicted of terrorism charges in Belgium. Despite his conviction, he was controversially exchanged by the Belgian government and sent back to Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnT9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-21T09:08:49-08:00	
Prince Igor At The Ankara Opera: The Power Of Art – OpEd	Last night, we had the pleasure of watching Alexander Borodin's timeless masterpiece, Prince Igor, at the Ankara Opera. The production captivated the audience, showcasing not only Borodin's years of dedication but also the stellar performance on stage. The History Behind the Masterpiece Borodin worked on Prince Igor for nearly twenty years but passed away in 1887 before completing it. After his death, his close friends Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov gathered the drafts from Borodin's home and finished the opera. The work premiered in 1890 at the renowned Mariinsky Opera in St. Petersburg. Inspired by The Lay of Igor's Campaign, a significant epic in Russian literature, the opera tells the story of 12th-century Prince Igor Svyatoslavich and his campaign against the Cuman (Polovtsian) tribes. The Performance in Ankara In Ankara, the opera was performed in its original Russian language. The choir and soloists delivered outstanding performances that earned high praise from the audience. Conductor Sunay Muratov expertly led the orchestra, ensuring a flawless musical execution. The Russian origins of director Ilya Ilin added an authentic touch to the staging, enriching the overall experience. The cast featured Çetin Kıranbay as Prince Igor, Burcu Uyar as Yaroslavna, Ayhan Üştük as Vladimir Igorevich, Erdem Baydar as Prens Galçtski, and Can Kocaay as Konçak Han. Each performer brought depth and nuance to their characters, leaving a lasting impression. Polovtsian Dances: The Highlight of the Evening The most striking moment of the opera came during the final scene with the Polovtsian Dances. This mesmerizing blend of opera and ballet showcased an exceptional harmony of music and visuals, taking the audience on a historical journey. The performance was nothing short of breathtaking. A Recommendation for Art Enthusiasts For those who wish to experience the unparalleled magic of art and music, Prince Igor is an absolute must-see. The Ankara Opera artists have brought this masterpiece to life with extraordinary skill, providing an unforgettable evening. A true gem for classical music and opera lovers alike.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-djmfSxqyDz7	2024-11-21T09:06:48-08:00	
Moroccan Media And The Final Phase Of The Sahara Issue: A Call Fo...	As Morocco moves closer to achieving the full international recognition of its territorial integrity, the role of the media in shaping perceptions and bolstering national advocacy is entering a decisive phase. This is no longer about reaffirming sovereignty; it is about strategically consolidating Morocco's historical and legitimate rights on the global stage. For Moroccan journalists, this means rethinking the fundamentals of their approach to the Sahara issue, anticipating new dynamics, and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. This imperative was at the heart of a recent conference organized by the Alliance of Istiqlali Journalists under the theme, 'Moroccan Media and the Cause of the Kingdom's Territorial Integrity: Crossed Perspectives.' The event, held on November 19, featured Professor Hassan Abdelkhalek—a veteran journalist, former editor-in-chief of Al Alam, and Morocco's ambassador to Algeria from 2016 to 2021. His unique expertise, spanning both media and diplomacy, provided critical insights into the evolving landscape of this decades-long dispute. One of the conference's main conclusions was clear: Moroccan media must not only sustain its mobilization for the Sahara but also refine its tools, narratives, and strategies. The current phase is one of pre-resolution—a delicate juncture where misinformation and propaganda continue to distort the realities of the conflict. It is essential for journalists to adapt, using innovative methods and persuasive arguments to counter outdated narratives driven by Algeria's hegemonic ambitions and the Polisario's misinformation campaigns. A particularly pressing issue raised during the event was the need to anticipate the eventual reintegration of thousands of Moroccans held or displaced in the Tindouf camps. These individuals have been subjected to decades of ideological manipulation and propaganda aimed at severing their ties to Morocco. Rehabilitating them will require not only social and logistical efforts but also a robust media strategy to dismantle the falsehoods ingrained over generations. Moroccan media must be ready to support this process, offering narratives of hope, inclusion, and unity that pave the way for their full reintegration into Moroccan society. The international dimension of this advocacy is equally critical. Morocco's position has gained unprecedented momentum in recent years, underscored by the recognition of its sovereignty over the Sahara by key global players. However, maintaining and expanding this support requires sustained media engagement. Moroccan journalists must project a credible and compelling narrative, emphasizing the legitimacy of Morocco's claims and exposing the artificial nature of the conflict, which has been perpetuated by Algeria's geopolitical ambitions. This moment is a turning point. The Moroccan Sahara is no longer just a territorial dispute; it is a national cause that encompasses identity, history, and the future of regional stability. The media's role must extend beyond advocacy to become a force for reconciliation and cohesion in a post-resolution era. By amplifying Morocco's achievements, countering hostile narratives, and preparing for the reintegration of all its citizens, the media can play a transformative role in shaping this new chapter. The Moroccan press stands at a historic crossroads. Success will depend on its ability to adapt to the demands of this decisive phase, balancing professionalism with patriotic duty. The stakes are immense, but so are the opportunities to reaffirm Morocco's rightful place as a model of unity and legitimacy in the face of decades of manufactured conflict. The time for strategic, forward-thinking media advocacy is now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-bNAD49RXSM8	2024-11-21T09:03:20-08:00	
Strengthening Pakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Efforts With Global Su...	The recent terrorist attack in Quetta, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people, has drawn widespread condemnation and support from the international community. From China to Russia, and from the UN to regional neighbors like Iran and Sri Lanka, global leaders have voiced their solidarity with Pakistan in its counter-terrorism efforts. However, beyond expressions of sympathy, there lies a pressing need for tangible support, enhanced collaboration, and coordinated counter-terrorism strategies to bolster Pakistan's efforts. China-Pakistan Collaboration: More Than Just Condemnation China’s response, led by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, reflects an enduring alliance marked by shared interests and significant economic investments, such as CPEC. The injury of two Chinese nationals in Karachi highlights the threat that terrorism poses not only to Pakistanis but also to foreign partners. China’s vocal support for Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operations is essential, but it must be matched with sustained bilateral counter-terrorism initiatives, including security training, intelligence-sharing, and joint task forces to protect CPEC investments and Chinese citizens. Russia’s Firm Stance and Its Implications for Pakistan Russia, under President Putin’s leadership, has consistently voiced its commitment to assist Pakistan in combating terrorism. Putin’s condemnation of the Quetta attack and his call for justice are welcome affirmations of Russia’s support. Pakistan and Russia have a mutual understanding when it comes to countering terrorism; both nations have encountered extremist threats that have shaped their security policies. Moving forward, Pakistan should explore deeper military collaboration with Russia, including joint anti-terrorism drills, intelligence-sharing, and even arms deals aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities. UN and Global Institutions: From Words to Action UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and called for accountability. While these statements are critical for maintaining international awareness, the United Nations and its associated agencies have an opportunity to play a more direct role in Pakistan’s fight against terrorism. Programs that provide counter-terrorism training, funding for security enhancements, and expertise on deradicalization can make a lasting impact. The UN’s endorsement of anti-terrorism efforts in Pakistan also strengthens the case for international donors to invest in Pakistan’s security sector, which remains vital for ensuring sustained stability. Regional Solidarity: Iran, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia The tragedy has drawn powerful responses from regional players, including Iran and Sri Lanka, both of whom are no strangers to terrorism. Iran, whose spokesperson underscored the need to uphold human rights and reject terrorism in all forms, shares a long border with Pakistan, making coordinated border security essential. Sri Lanka, reflecting on its own history of combating separatist terrorism, has also extended support, reiterating the shared regional interest in stability. By leveraging such solidarity, Pakistan can build regional coalitions to tackle cross-border terrorist networks and enhance border security. A Call for Multilateral Action Against Terrorism The responses to Pakistan’s tragedy showcase a rare alignment of global voices against terrorism, but they should serve as more than symbolic gestures. This is an opportunity for the international community to establish or strengthen multilateral frameworks that address terrorism with a particular focus on South Asia. Forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) can play a pivotal role in supporting Pakistan’s efforts, creating shared strategies for intelligence, surveillance, and securing borders. Global action, beyond just statements, will be instrumental in sustaining Pakistan’s efforts to prevent future tragedies. Pakistan’s own determination to root out terrorism within its borders is evident, but it cannot achieve this goal without the continued backing of its international allies. Not only do such partnerships alleviate some of the strain on Pakistan’s resources, but they also reinforce its stance on countering extremism, helping isolate those elements that threaten both regional and global peace. Pakistan has the potential to be a strong pillar in the fight against terrorism, provided it is equipped with the resources and alliances necessary to overcome the challenges it faces. Conclusion: Building a Future Without Terrorism The Quetta tragedy is a reminder of the stakes involved in the fight against terrorism. Pakistan’s resilience, supported by the international community’s tangible assistance, can foster a more secure future for its citizens and allies. As countries rally behind Pakistan, this tragic event serves as a catalyst for deeper cooperation and mutual resolve to eliminate terrorism from the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fwEODyNaIi_	2024-11-21T09:00:54-08:00	
India: Cherishing Classical Status To Asomiya Language – OpEd	A function to commemorate the completion of 53 years by the Directorate of Cultural Affairs (under Assam government in northeast India) turned a serious and fruitful event to cherish the recognition to Asomiya (Assamese) as a classical language and also highlight the future course of actions for the government, concerned organisations, literary personalities and common people using the language both in written and colloquial forms in day-to-day conversations. The courtyard of iconic Rabindra Bhawan in Guwahati was decorated elegantly for the occasion with a colourful podium under Bokul (Spanish Cherry) plants. As evening Sun set to disappear on the mighty river Brahmaputra touching the horizon, the intriguing program commenced with the participation of three outstanding resource persons in front of a decent gathering. The panellists were unanimous in advocating for a comprehensive dictionary with standardised spellings to each and every word. They also emphasized on an internet-savvy apparatus to cross-check the mistakes instantly so that more and more correct words can be pumped into the digital space. Various jargons reflecting the useful modern technology needs to be incorporated possibly with authentic Assamese words and a careful monitoring of the language in the public domain emerge as the need of the hour. Earning the classical recognition as nearly two million people use Asomiya for their primary mode of communication and informal understanding, the language possesses a brighter future, argued the participants amidst rounds of applause from the audience, assembled in the historic cultural premise of northeast India. Director Rahul Ch Das welcomed everyone to the discussion on সুৱদি সুৰীয়া অসমীয়া ভাষা আৰু ধ্ৰুপদী মৰ্যাদা (Delightful & melodious Assamese language and the classical recognition) highlighting the eventful journey of Asomiya for the achievement and also essential future plans for the language, where three resourceful speakers enriched the initiative with refreshing inputs. Dr Namita Devi from Barbhag College (under Gauhati University) narrated the voyage for the attainment, where litterateur, researcher and linguistic expert Dr Upen Rabha Hakacham from GU highlighted the historical inventiveness for assimilation to enhance the Assamese language & culture and Dr Arup Kumar Nath from Tezpur University spoke about the future trail for the language in the session, which was moderated by this writer. Elaborating her views, Namita Devi stated human society and civilisation are shaped through historical evolution that passes through a relentless process of synthesis and antithesis. Humans, as a species known as Homo sapiens, have developed language and culture through the assimilation process as people are migratory in nature and came into contact with different stock of people. The word culture indicates ideas, customs and social behaviours of a particular community and its traits and features reflect a specific character and identity. Same process follows for a language too, added the young and ingenious lady. Assamese language and culture are rooted in ancient Assam from the days of Pragjyotish-Kamrup-Kamata-Koch, where the language was formed by a group of people even though they were divided anthropologically and linguistically. Till today, each group maintains distinctive linguistic and cultural features. Linguistically, Assamese is a composite form of all tribes and stock of people living together and expressing their collective culture through it. Thus, the recognition of Assamese as a classical language has cleared the roots and identity of the culture with a strong foothold. It's time for the new generation to come forward with an effort to preserve, nourish and expand the language and cumulative culture of Assam, she stressed. Dr Nath also threw light on the glorious past of the easternmost Indo-Aryan language, which had its presence in rock different inscriptions, Charyapadas (ancient Buddhist tantric text), Ramayani & other mythology literature since the 4th century. Due to internal and external threats from various sources, Asomiya had to confront many challenges over time. With the classical status on its cap, the language (and its users) can now think of achieving many new heights in the days to come, commented the energetic scholar. He concluded with some valuable advices for the language-users including the need for advanced technological tools (like text to speech and vice versa, advanced machine learning, pdf to word conversion, etc), a solid unicode support, adequate technical terminology in Assamese and so on for the survival and flourishing of the language. Mentionable is that the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 3 October 2024 approved conferring the classical language status to Asomiya along with Marathi, Pali, Prakrit and Bengali/Bangla citing it to serve as a custodian of Bharat's profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community's historical and cultural milestone. Primarily rooted in Sanskrit (even though maintaining some distinct features) Asomiya thus got an entry to the prestigious group of languages comprising Tamil (notified in 2004), Sanskrit (2005), Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013) and Odia (2014). The specific initiative to celebrate the recognition was also augmented by the gracious presence of distinguished personalities like actor Malaya Goswami, singer Manisha Hazarika, author Satyashree Das, former cultural affairs directors including Swapnanil Barua, Barnali Sarma, Bishnu Kamal Borah with a number of students from Luit Konwar Rudra Barua State Music College and many others.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-21T08:59:27-08:00	
Pakistan’s Palestine Conundrum – OpEd	The ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues to evoke profound concern across the world, compelling nations to reassess their responsibilities in upholding justice, human rights, and international law. In this dire context, Pakistan has emerged as a steadfast ally of the Palestinian people, vehemently advocating for their right to self-determination and an end to Israel's illegal occupation. France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot recently highlighted a 'window of opportunity' for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a sentiment Pakistan wholeheartedly echoes. Islamabad sees this as a vital chance to halt violence, protect lives, and foster an environment conducive to dialogue and lasting peace. However, achieving this requires decisive global action, coupled with unwavering support for the Palestinian people. Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause stems from its deeply rooted principles of justice, equality, and respect for sovereignty. Since the inception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Pakistan has consistently condemned the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and the systemic oppression of its people. Successive Pakistani governments have reinforced this stance in international forums, underscoring the importance of a just resolution to the crisis. Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar recently reiterated Pakistan’s solidarity with Palestine, highlighting that the fight for Palestinian sovereignty is not just a regional issue but a universal one tied to fundamental human rights. His government has worked to amplify Palestine’s voice in platforms like the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), emphasizing that justice delayed is justice denied. At the heart of Pakistan’s advocacy is a demand for accountability. Israel's actions, which have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, must not go unchecked. Pakistan urges the international community to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law and its persistent disregard for human rights. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached catastrophic proportions. Blockades have crippled access to essential goods, while relentless airstrikes have reduced infrastructure to rubble. Civilians, particularly women and children, are disproportionately affected, with schools, hospitals, and shelters bearing the brunt of the violence. Pakistan has called for immediate international intervention to address this crisis. A sustainable ceasefire is a pressing need, but it must be accompanied by substantial humanitarian aid. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted to ensure that food, water, medicine, and essential supplies reach those in dire need. The international community must also support the reconstruction of Gaza’s destroyed infrastructure and provide psychological aid to a traumatized population. France’s call for a ceasefire reflects a growing recognition among global leaders of the need to act urgently. However, such calls must be translated into tangible action. Words alone cannot mitigate the immense suffering of the Palestinian people. Pakistan emphasizes the need for sustained international pressure on Israel to halt its military operations and engage in meaningful negotiations. Furthermore, Pakistan calls upon influential organizations such as the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to lead efforts in securing a just resolution to the conflict. Global powers, particularly those with significant influence over Israel, must use their leverage to ensure compliance with international norms and a commitment to peace. As Pakistan joins the chorus of nations calling for immediate de-escalation, it also highlights the broader implications of this crisis. Stability in the Middle East is intrinsically linked to global peace and security. Left unaddressed, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue to fuel extremism, exacerbate humanitarian crises, and undermine efforts toward international stability. The spillover effects of the conflict, including rising tensions in Lebanon and the risk of broader regional instability, necessitate a unified and holistic approach. Pakistan has urged world leaders to recognize these broader ramifications and act decisively to prevent further escalation. Echoing Jean-Noel Barrot’s sentiments, Pakistan believes that the time for global solidarity is now. The world must unite to uphold the principles of justice, human rights, and dignity. Only through collective action can we pave the way for a peaceful and equitable future for the people of Palestine and the region as a whole. The situation in Gaza is not just a Palestinian tragedy but a global failure to protect basic human rights and uphold justice. Pakistan’s call for accountability, dialogue, and humanitarian intervention is a reminder that peace is possible but requires collective effort. The international community must rise to the occasion, bridging differences and taking bold steps to ensure that the Palestinian people can live in dignity, freedom, and security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-dhVaL_UTFh6	2024-11-21T08:58:03-08:00	
ASEAN’s Elusive Code Of Conduct For The South China Sea – Analysi...	By Jaime Naval ASEAN’s involvement in the South China Sea dispute began informally and incrementally. As Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, China and Taiwan firmed up their territorial claims, the dispute raised concerns from with and outside the region. From 1990 to 2002, Indonesia, with funding from Canada, hosted a series of Workshops on managing potential conflict in the South China Sea. Although dubbed a non-official activity to which the participants came in their ‘individual, private capacity’, the workshops, in the words of former ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino, had ‘an ASEAN aura’ to them. ASEAN cannot evade the issue as four of its members are involved in the dispute. The late 1980s witnessed China’s growing assertiveness. Sixty-four Vietnamese sailors died when they clashed with Chinese forces in the Spratly Islands in 1988. In February 1992, China passed its Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which claimed sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. In July 1992, in the face of heightened tension, ASEAN issued its Declaration on the South China Sea — underscoring the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the area. In March 1995, impelled by the discovery of Chinese structures surreptitiously constructed on Mischief Reef — which China argued were intended to provide refuge and support for fishermen operating in the region — ASEAN issued its Statement on Recent Developments in the South China Sea. It again stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the region through peaceful resolution of disputes and adherence to international law, particularly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Over time, it became apparent that China’s actions were part of a broader effort to assert territorial claims over the South China Sea, which eventually led to the construction of military facilities on the reef in the 2010s. In earlier ASEAN–China exchanges, the South China Sea was reputedly treated as an after-dinner topic. But over time, as the dialogues gained traction, it became a central item in open discussions. Guarded optimism swept the region in late 2002 when ASEAN and China signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. It was a watershed document that mediated the dissonant and dangerous dynamics of the claimant states. The declaration was a dramatic departure from the assertiveness of the South China Sea dispute’s protagonists. Despite lingering distrust, it brought to the fore the possibility of cooperation among the claimants and proved ASEAN’s ability to forge a unified position on a complex, region-wide issue of strategic importance. It also demonstrated how China can be persuaded to recalibrate its position. The declaration was expected to pave the way for a successor agreement — the code of conduct, which was meant to preclude further escalation of the dispute. But its long absence has emboldened claimants to carry out expansion, fortification, coercion and even environmental degradation in the area. The overlapping claims are in contest in the South China Sea against the backdrop of a geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. Even as ASEAN and China strive to find common ground to craft a code of conduct, it would be foolhardy to drive out the United States and other extra-regional stakeholders, because they have their own strategic stakes in the South China Sea. The asymmetrical distances that ASEAN members maintain with the major powers translate into variations in their respective positions towards the South China Sea dispute. Strong disagreements on how to respond to China’s actions following the Scarborough Shoal standoff prevented ASEAN from issuing a joint statement in its 2012 ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. Cambodia, then Chair of ASEAN and a close partner of China, sought to exclude the matter from the joint communique, drawing livid reactions from concerned ASEAN members. It is thus not surprising that ASEAN has not issued any official statement referring to the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Even as the Court invalidated China’s expansive nine-dash line claim, the prevailing circumstances deterred the group from coming out with a formal, unified position. After more than two decades, several impediments to the code of conduct remain. Defining the geographical scope of the code is both fundamental and contentious. China wants the scope limited to areas where it does not have complete control, while the Philippines and Vietnam, seek inclusion of all disputed maritime features. As China claims nearly 90 per cent of the South China Sea, it makes sense for the code of conduct to include overlaps. China also seeks a flexible, non-binding code, while ASEAN wants a code that is legally binding. Having clear rules and mechanisms encourages compliance and accountability. Without this, the code of conduct would likely become an impotent document. Prohibiting military activities in the South China Sea is salient to preventing untoward incidents and a central purpose of the code of conduct. Limiting installation of military infrastructure, weapons deployment and military exercises would be expected to reduce the possibility of violent engagements. For the Philippines and perhaps Vietnam, the involvement of external powers, such as the United States, translates into having a necessary counterweight to China. China insists on disallowing external parties to engage in security partnerships or exercises with regional states. ASEAN stresses that freedom of navigation and overflight be preserved in accordance with UNCLOS, which guarantees the right of passage for all states through international waters. China also vows adherence to these rules, but in practice it pushes back on freedom of navigation operations by rival outside powers. Despite their professed commitment to finalising a code of conduct — including their latest 2026 deadline — ASEAN’s and China’s efforts are moving at a slow pace. Renewed or intensified military activity in the South China Sea undermines every avowal to peaceful dispute settlement. China evidently benefits from the status quo as it indurates and stretches its military presence in the area. But ASEAN cannot afford to be oblivious as the disputed waters constantly and ominously change.

BBC’s Ability To Facilitate Debate In Vietnam Hindered By Media C...	By Thanh Giang Nguyen This Perspective argues that Vietnam’s domestic campaign of media control, launched in 2017 has exerted a negative impact on the BBC World Service’s ability to report and engage with the Vietnamese public on social media. The article consists of four parts: The contextual background for the BBC’s engagement with Vietnam in pursuit of its mission of impartiality from 2000 to 2019. The negative impact of media control in Vietnam affecting BBC’s ability to engage with the Vietnamese public on social media between 2017 and 2022. A data analysis of the participation at the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable on YouTube that highlights the decreasing number of interviewees from Vietnam in 161 political episodes between 2014 to 2022. A comparative study with VOA and the implications of restricted access to Vietnam for all Western broadcasters serving Vietnam. The key findings are built around the locations of the people who participated in 161 political episodes of BBC Vietnamese Roundtable discussions about Vietnamese politics, out of all 356 broadcasts that also included discussions about other topics (social issues, health, politics etc.) from 2014 to 2022.[1] The author collected this set of data to determine whether the participants were located in Vietnam or abroad, as the level of intervention by the Vietnamese state influences the ability of interviewees to participate in political discussions. Specifically, individuals in Vietnam may face police actions such as detention or internet restrictions, and this discourages them from joining the Roundtable on social media. The findings are examined against the backdrop of regulatory changes in Vietnam, in order to evaluate how restrictions implemented between 2017 and 2019 impacted the number of individuals in the country willing to engage with the BBC on politically sensitive topics.[2] A short comparative study of 10 similar roundtable discussions on the YouTube channel of VOA Vietnamese in the US from this year (2024) will be conducted to broaden the findings about Vietnamese censorship’s impingement beyond the BBC to include other Western broadcasters for Vietnam in the last few years.[3] THE BBC AND VIETNAM: A STORY OF INCONGRUENT ENGAGEMENT The history of the BBC World Service, founded in 1932 as an international broadcaster of the British Broadcasting Corporation, has been shaped 'by global events and the UK’s changing relationship with the wider world'.[4] Similarly, the BBC Vietnamese programme, established in 1952, was perceived in Hanoi during the Cold War as a voice from the other side of the Iron Curtain. During the Vietnam War (1954-1975) BBC Vietnamese was even seen as 'an enemy radio' (đài địch) by communist propaganda. Such a perception is still being propagated by the military and security forces in Vietnam today.[5] The post-war unified Vietnam imposed a decade-long ban on all BBC reporters and jammed the BBC’s radio on shortwave frequencies for Vietnam, only allowing BBC Vietnamese Service’s Editor Judy Stowe to visit Vietnam in 1984.[6] Compared to China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and even Myanmar, Vietnam’s relationship with the BBC made it an outlier in that the country did not allow the BBC to have a local office. This policy of limiting BBC’s access to Vietnam shows a lack of mutual understanding between the BBC and the Vietnamese government about the role of the media. In other words, the World Service’s mission to provide 'trusted, accurate, impartial and independent news'[7] was not compatible with Vietnam’s definition of media in the Press Law (2016) as a tool to 'propagandise and disseminate the policies of the Communist Party, policies and laws of the State'.[8] The Law requires all publishing outlets to obtain official permits for disseminating news content and authorises the government to screen works prior to publication and stop publication of any content deemed objectionable or harmful to national security.[9] The reforms initiated in the late 1980s brought a change to Vietnam’s media environment. Since 2000, a new media strategy not only opened the country to foreign media, including the BBC, but also envisaged international integration of Vietnam into the world by combining three strategic objectives of 'security, development and influence'. The government media, e.g. Voice of Vietnam (VOV) and Vietnam Television (VTV), began to reach out to the BBC to gain access to modern technology and educational materials while the web blocking of the BBC’s content which is to prevent news stories deemed 'objectionable' from entering Vietnam’s cyberspace, would continue in a two-prong approach, consisting of 'collaboration and the struggle' with foreign powers.[10]0 In 2012, BBC Media Action, a department of the World Service in charge of training and collaboration was able to launch a communications project in Vietnam to help VOV 'better communicate the climate change issue to the community'.[11]1 The opening-up also saw three BBC News correspondents (Owen Bennett-Jones, Claire Arthur and Bill Hayton) being granted a reporting visa between 2000 and 2007 and to be based in Hanoi. The London-based BBC Vietnamese journalists were also permitted to visit their home country for reporting. However, despite this opening-up, the Vietnamese government continued with its cautious stance towards foreign media. Both British and Vietnamese reporters who had access to Vietnamese news sources and enjoyed direct engagement with the Vietnamese public were closely monitored by the Foreign Ministry’s Press Department and interviews with Vietnamese people needed to be pre-approved.[12] Stepping out of line would immediately result in the permit being revoked, as in the case of Bill Hayton who had his reporting visa shortened in 2007 because of a report about Vietnamese dissidents.[13] Since 2011, BBC Vietnam closed the radio programme to continue the news service on a web site, and then began to expand also on social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube). However, BBC’s online presence both in English and Vietnamese, has been blocked from time to time, prompting the corporation to find ways to keep the engagement going not only with government officials but also with the wider public in Vietnam. THE ROUNDTABLE: AN IMPACT THROUGH ENGAGEMENT Intensive efforts by the Vietnamese government to block BBC’s online content in Vietnam in the mid-2010s led to several initiatives by BBC World Service, including collaboration with tech companies, to circumvent the Vietnamese firewall.[14] The most crucial decision was to launch a direct regular broadcast on social media for Vietnam in 2014, produced especially for YouTube live discussions on the online address alongside the normal online news service of bbcvietnamese.com web page which was blocked from time to time.[15] The aim was to maximise accessibility on social platforms to fulfil BBC’s mission to engage with the audience without interference. In the next 6 years (2014-2021), the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable, modelled on BBC HARDtalk, a news-focused, moderated debate on British television, brought together hundreds of opinion makers, politicians, academics, and civil society activists from Vietnam and around the world. The diversity of voices and the live comments from the audience made it a success, bringing 143.8 million views to the BBC and 31.9 million hours of watch time between 2014 and 2021, according to data from YouTube Studio, with the majority being from Vietnam.[16] On many occasions, people with opposing viewpoints have debated and argued about Vietnamese politics, a phenomenon unseen after decades of ideological conflict and division among the Vietnamese. For example, the discussion broadcast on 1 May 2020 between Dr Bui Quynh Hoa, the daughter of Colonel Bui Van Tung who commanded a Northern Vietnamese tank unit that crashed through the gates of the former Republic of South Vietnam’s presidential palace in Saigon on 30 April 1975, and professor Nguyen Manh Hung, a US-based scholar and senior official in the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War, about the need to accept the past for the sake of national reconciliation, received over 1.3m views on YouTube. Of note, a programme such as this by the BBC Vietnamese team was a brave attempt to tackle the longtime issue of the North-South divide, a topic severely censored in Vietnam because Hanoi still sees any symbol of the Republic of South Vietnam which surrendered in 1975 as a form of sedition, and still denies people who had ever served that regime access to state media in Vietnam.[17] The popularity of the Roundtable drew attention from the government, and a number of programmes in 2021 were denounced by the state media for 'distorting the truth about the country', and some of the moderators had to face cyber harassment.[18] But the fact that most participants were Vietnamese citizens, including many academics and government officials without any association to the former South Vietnamese regime, took away the usual argument of Vietnam’s state propaganda that critical voices were 'remnants of the hostile forces who refused to accept the defeat' in the Vietnam War which ended in 1975.[19] The success of the broadcast was made possible by a pluralism in political views, the immediacy of social media networks and its delivery in the neutral balanced language. Nevertheless, it soon became the subject of censorship. This was especially the case during the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam (2020-21) when wide campaigns were undertaken to curtail public discussions in cyberspace, according to rights groups.[20] INTENSIFYING OF CENSORSHIP AND THE END OF PUBLIC DEBATES A quantitative review of 165 guest speakers and the frequency they were participating in 161 political episodes (several people appeared repeatedly in many episodes) together with the information about their locations as announced at the beginning of each broadcast,[21] reveals the following: YearParticipation from VietnamOutside VietnamTotal Episodes2014401201547422820167023242017553324201858292920193014182020402323202127913Table 1 (source: BBC Vietnamese YouTube) While the year 2014 had only one episode in November as the first in the series of political discussions, it is notable that that particularepisode had all 4 participants from Vietnam. Episodes in 2016 had the largest number of participants from Vietnam, with 52.8% representation. The year 2019 was a turning point which saw a significant drop in participants from Vietnam down to 30, with 14 from overseas. This is the time when both the new Press Law (enacted in 2016 to take full effect from 2017), and the Cybersecurity Law (effective from 01 January 2019) began to impact the Vietnamese media landscape. In the following years, media control targeting dissidents worked in tandem with heightened cyberspace restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Throughout 2020 and 2021, the number of participants from Vietnam joining the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable decreased to an unsustainable level. In 2021, only 27 people from Vietnam, the lowest ever, and 9 from overseas (75% vs 25%) joined the 13 episodes of political discussions, with the last recording taking place in July of that year. In terms of audience attraction, a key metric for any media organisation in the world, the YouTube data gathered here (Figure 1) tells a story of decline. Since all recordings remain on YouTube, some of them still generate so-called ‘delayed watch time’ when people revisit a popular programme many months after it was aired. Hence, some of the visits and watch time in hours were recorded from 1 June 2008 well into 19 August 2024, but the YouTube Studio graphic here indicate that the peak of the Roundtable was between 2016 and 2020. The ending of political discussions on the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable in 2021 also meant that the regular inflow of audience to the BBC, built up over six years, stopped. In other words, millions of visits from Vietnam who spent 31.9 million hours to engage with the BBC on the free channel of YouTube ceased, a huge loss in terms of market share and direct audience engagement. Figure 1: Data set: YouTube Studio’s Analytics of BBC Vietnamese Roundtables The heightened intensity of YouTube broadcasts and participatory presence between 2014 and 2018 can be explained by the favourable media environment and a change in official attitude towards the BBC in Vietnam under the government of reform-oriented Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung (2006-2016). A chronological record of heightened BBC’s engagement with Vietnam’s leadership is presented as follows: 2007: Former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet gave an interview to BBC Vietnamese in Ho Chi Minh City and used the BBC platform to call for national unity and political reform.[22] 2008: Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung gave a televised interview to BBC World TV during his visit to London.[23] 2009: Former Deputy President Mrs Nguyen Thi Binh received a BBC Vietnamese reporter in Hanoi and gave a candid interview about the Vietnam War and national reconciliation.[24] 2012 and 2015: Vietnamese officials, including Vice-Minister of Defence Nguyen Chi Vinh gave interviews to BBC Vietnamese reporters in Vietnam and Singapore.[25] July 2019: A BBC Vietnamese reporter successfully conducted an interview with Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung, a member of the Politburo, in London rather than Vietnam. This event signifies the end of the BBC’s favourable period in Vietnam and highlights a remarkable shift in regulatory measures governing foreign media operations in the country.[26] It is noteworthy that the appreciation of the BBC by the government of Vietnam and the interaction with several leaders at that time helped remove the Cold War stigma of 'the BBC as a voice from the opposite side' and facilitated the participation of middle-ranking officials, academics and technocrats from the public sector, most of whom were members of the Communist Party, in the Roundtable. With the resignation of PM Nguyen Tan Dung at the 12th Congress of the CPV in early 2016, Vietnamese politics slowly turned back towards Leninism and state controls. The trend continued into 2021 when the Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong was re-elected to serve a third term, according to observers.[27] International observers noticed an emerging paradigm affecting many areas of social life and economic participation of foreign companies including a stricter visa regime for foreign workers (2020), cuts to the length of tourist visas in 2021, and the introduction of Decree 58 by the government (2022) to scrutinise foreign non-governmental organisations operating in Vietnam. In the field of media control, the new measures to stifle public discussion in Vietnam were developing in two stages with each of them affecting the BBC in unique ways: First, Decree 9, issued in February 2017 by the new government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc prohibited all civil servants and employees of government agencies from speaking to the media without prior authorisation, and forbade Vietnamese journalists from sharing news stories on social media.[28] The effect of the ban on speech in the public sector has been far-reaching and has reduced the number of regular contributors from the public sector in the BBC’s discussions. The latter were, inter alia, former chairman of Vietnam Parliament’s Education Committee Nguyen Minh Thuyet, former Director of the Vietnamese government’s Border Commission Tran Cong Truc (both holding the rank of a minister), former ambassador Dinh Hoang Thang, diplomat Tran Viet Thai, historian Vu Minh Giang and many others who were once regular participants in the Roundtable in the previous period. Then,the Cybersecurity Law (2018) further limited the number of participants from the non-state sector.[29] Worse, many civil society activists and independent journalists were subjected to direct censorship, according to human rights groups.[30] More than 10 of the regular participants of the BBC’s broadcast were among activists and bloggers detained and charged in Vietnam between 2016 and 2022 for 'abusing freedom of speech' or more often, for 'anti-state propaganda' by speaking publicly on social media.[31] Others chose self-imposed exile or kept silent to avoid persecution. In less-known cases, provincial newspapers in Vietnam publicly denounced local activists and bloggers until they stopped using social media to challenge the government on policies or to expose corruption cases. In the court papers against blogger Pham Doan Trang, one of the charges against her was 'the interviews given to BBC Vietnamese and Radio Free Asia'.[32] LIMITATIONS ON POLITICAL DEBATE IN VIETNAM AND THE CONSEQUENCES By 2021, censorship online and offline – often in the form of harsh sentences meted out to online critics – had damaging ramifications for BBC Vietnamese Roundtable output, reducing the number of people from Vietnam brave enough to continue participating to less than 10 people. The latter included two well-known dissidents, Mr Nguyen Huu Vinh and Mr Nguyen Quang A, and two outspoken academics, Pham Quy Tho and Hoang Ngoc Giao. Together with a few retired historians and journalists in Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese journalists, they participated in the last 13 political discussions of the Roundtable in 2021.[33] In response to this new situation – with a lack of speakers able and willing to discuss Vietnamese politics – together with the departure of four staff members experienced in moderating the Roundtable, BBC Vietnamese had to close the Roundtable in 2022 and instead reinvest in a different livestreaming podcast on social and youth-related topics, from its Bangkok bureau. The last BBC Vietnamese interview conducted in Vietnam was in January 2023 and, since then, no team member has been able to gain accreditation to report from the country. Moreover, the public space in Vietnam has been so thoroughly sanitised that a public discussion, if organised to be independent from state intervention, is highly likely to have just voices from outside of Vietnam. The limitation on the ability to organise discussions in Vietnam is also evident in the case of the VOA Vietnamese YouTube debate about Vietnamese politics. A review of 10 episodes between 18 January and 10 August 2024 on the VOA Vietnamese YouTube channel reveals a pattern about the locations of participants or guest speakers similar to that for the BBC Vietnamese discussion in the recent past: DateLocationTotal numberVietnam guest speakersOverseas guests10 Aug 2024All speakers in USA40403 Aug 2024Vietnam, USA, Cambodia41321 May 2024Vietnam, UK, USA41309 May 2024Vietnam, US, Germany41304 April 2024Vietnam, Germany, USA41318 Jan 2024Vietnam, USA422Table 2 (source: VOA Vietnamese YouTube) The data not only indicate that the geographical location of the participants favours overseas voices, often at a ratio of 3 to 1. In addition, their personal profiles, and thus their political viewpoints are less diverse compared to those taking part in the BBC’s YouTube programme during its peak, prior to 2019. In sum, all participants in this VOA Vietnamese discussion programme were political dissidents, with no one representing the view of the Vietnamese government. Moreover, the only regular guest speaker from Vietnam in 4 out of 6 VOA Vietnamese recordings was dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan while several programmes in the same series had the same, returning guest speakers from the US, Germany and the UK.[34] At the time of writing, the issue of Vietnamese citizens being pressurised and prevented from giving interviews to overseas-based media has received international attention. In September 2024, Mary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders raised the case of Mr Nguyen Quang A, a Hanoi-based intellectual dissident who had been interrogated multiple times by the police in Vietnam for 'giving interviews on social media', calling on Vietnam to protect his human rights.[35] It is worth noting that Mr. Quang A was a regular guest on the BBC Roundtable. Since its closure, he has frequently appeared on the Vietnamese programmes of other international broadcasters, including the new YouTube discussion series by VOA mentioned earlier. CONCLUSION An increasingly tight media censorship by Vietnam in the last 5 years both internally and externally has had a far-reaching negative impact on the operation of the BBC Vietnamese language service. The impact on BBC Vietnamese Service is two-fold. Firstly, the continuation of a harsh media regulatory regime and the lack of direct access to Vietnam have, in effect turned it into one of many language services in the BBC World Service 'working in exile', a new phenomenon caused by increasing repression against free media around the world.[36] In this specific context concerning the operation of the BBC, Vietnam’s media restrictions are on a par with Iran, China and Russia. Secondly, to uphold the principle of impartiality, the only option left to these journalists is to use indirect quotes reflecting the views and opinions of the Vietnamese government and top leaders as shown in state media outlets. The Service can now hardly organise an open debate about Vietnamese politics with a variety of views and voices from Vietnam, as envisaged by the BBC Charter. For the public in Vietnam, the pervasive and stringent media censorship has significantly restricted civic space, preventing the expression of diverse viewpoints and limiting the ability to address common concerns in a timely and responsible manner. With Decree 53 (2022) issued specifically to interpret the Cyber Security Law in the light of national defence, and new decrees in 2023 effectively banning livestreaming by individuals in Vietnam except for entertainment, sales and commercial advertising, more state control over public speech is in place.[37] One of the implications of this new stringent regime has been that the vacuum has gradually been filled by anti-government YouTube broadcasts made by overseas influencers attacking top leaders of Vietnam with numerous unsubstantiated corruption accusations and in very defamatory language.[38] Their popularity indicates that the stringent regulations have been counterproductive to their purpose of bringing people to the government’s side. Instead, they have led to further polarization of public opinion in Vietnamese-language media environment. For the government of Vietnam, blocking the BBC and closing space for domestic debate has not only deprived its decision-making agencies of a useful channel for constructive feedback, one needed to rectify their policy-related errors, but also contradicts the joint declaration on the UK-Vietnamese strategic partnership made in 2020 wherein both sides had pledged to 'promote greater access to each other’s media organisations'.[39] Looking forward, one could argue that until both sides reach convergent perspectives on the role of the media, Vietnam’s hindrance to the work of British media, especially the BBC in reporting about Vietnam and engaging with the public in that country, will continue.

On Climate, Will Trump Have It All His Own Way? – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo Donald Trump’s comments during his 2024 campaign trail, together with his actions during his first presidency, suggest doom and gloom for the global climate agenda – and a severe retardation of climate action during his upcoming second term. But new factors determine the global landscape compared to 2016, offering a more nuanced set of possibilities for climate action. Trump announced the United States’ (US) withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017. The official exit came in November 2020, just before the end of his first term. Although President Joe Biden’s administration soon reversed the departure, some damage was done. A second withdrawal could be devastating. Trump also appointed climate change sceptics to key positions within the US administration and beyond. He picked Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency head and nominated David Malpass – famous for denying the scientific consensus on the link between fossil fuels and global warming – as president of the World Bank. The bank is a key body expected to support an international movement to a lower carbon economy. In 2020, the Brookings Institution counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened environmental protection in the US, driven largely by the America First Energy Plan. This was primarily a package to rescue and empower the US fossil fuel value chain. Measures included reopening coal mines, removing oil exploration and drilling restrictions, and reducing climate and environmental regulations. Will Trump’s second presidency – bolstered with a suite of gains he didn’t have before – deliver more of the same? His first gain was winning the popular vote and the electoral college vote. Second, the Presidency, Senate and Congress are all under Republican control. This creates a super-highway for legislation, policy and budget approvals that are not necessarily aligned with global sustainability. In 2020, Brookings counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened US environmental protections The third gain is that preparation for this Republican presidency has been high. In addition to the role of Trump’s team and conservative think tanks, there is also Project 2025, which lists as a priority ‘unleash[ing] American energy production to reduce energy prices.’ Project 2025 policy documents call for ending research funding on climate change, and dismantling or downsizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency. These agencies have become increasingly prominent as the US experiences high levels of climate-related disasters. Damaging possibilities include reversing official policy to decarbonise America, decreasing public investments in climate change research, balkanising or reducing the size of federal and other institutions managing climate impacts, and withdrawing from related multilateral and other commitments. If launched, the US anti-climate juggernaut, driven by its geopolitical influence and economic power, might push the world towards catastrophic climate scenarios. The US will also reduce foreign aid and assistance programmes related to climate change, with Africa as a potential victim. But there are important mitigating factors. First, the domestic dividends associated with the US’ green investments are real. The flagbearer is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its US$370 billion boost for investment in green technology. In the short term, most benefits from the IRA are being accrued to Republicans. Clean energy investments in Republican congressional districts stand at US$268.5 billion, compared to US$77.4 billion in Democrat-controlled districts. Most IRA benefits – with its US$370 billion boost for green tech investments – accrued to Republicans The US Treasury indicated in its March 2024 report that the projected benefit from the IRA would be US$5 trillion by 2050, as a combination of global economic benefits, decreased pollution and an increase in domestic health and productivity. The projected benefit for 2024 alone is estimated at US$137 million. Forbes says that by 2030, the IRA could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. It could create 1.3 million jobs and avoid 4 500 premature deaths annually by 2030. The second mitigating factor is that the US has had a plethora of weather- and climate-related disasters that have been costly in terms of the economy, threats to the social fabric, and loss of life. Official data indicates that since 1980, these disasters have resulted in 16 768 deaths and cost the economy US$2.785 trillion. Third, the weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant. Europe has already pegged its future economic security in the European Green Deal. The US’ biggest economic competitor is China, which has invested extensively in renewable energy and electric vehicles. China’s green growth has been a major boost to its ascendency economically. Both overt and covert carbon-based trade barriers are already being developed at pace. The most prominent is the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2024 states that faster expansion of clean energy is key to reducing fragilities associated with geopolitical risk. The report also points to a 2030 tipping point, when electricity production from low-emission sources will overtake fossil fuels. Then there is the Elon Musk factor. A big Trump supporter and clearly a person of influence around the president-elect, Musk is an electric vehicle pioneer. Tesla is the world’s largest electric car company, with more than 10 times larger market capitalisation than its closest competitor. Musk is also a major global player in battery technology and a strong proponent of low-carbon energy solutions. Could this soften Trump’s position on fossil fuels? The likely scenario is that the beginning of the 47th US administration will see big gestures in line with the America First Energy, pro-fossil fuel doctrine. This may include initiating a second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Early push-back on environmental regulations is almost certain. Equally likely is a subsequent shift to a nuanced narrative highlighting the need for decarbonisation as renewable energy and low-carbon industrialisation become essential in global economic competition – a change that can’t come soon enough.

The History And Impact Of Japan’s Loans To China – Analysis	By Xia Ri 1979 was a critical year for the economic, political, and diplomatic development between China and Japan. During his visit to China, then-Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira explicitly stated that Japan would support China's reform and opening-up efforts. Subsequently, Japan formally began providing government development loans to China, primarily in yen. In December 2007, China and Japan signed the yen loan agreement, and 28 years later, the Japanese government officially announced that it would cease the loans to China starting in 2008. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, and in advancing China's socialist modernization. However, the importance of yen loans is clearly underestimated in China, hence the need for it to be re-examined and recognized. In its entire process, Japan provided loans to China in batches, with the initial scale rapidly increasing, peaking in 2000, then sharply decreasing. Overall, yen loans show the five characteristics of high amounts, large increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. The first three batches of yen loans saw a significant increase in scale. The first batch (1979-1983) amounted to JPY 330.9 billion, with an interest rate of 3% and a 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The second batch (1984-1989) was announced during Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to China in 1984, with a loan of JPY 470 billion, an interest rate ranging from 3% to 5%, and the same 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The third batch (1990-1995), announced during Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru's visit in 1988, involved JPY 810 billion, a 2.5% interest rate, and a 30-year repayment period, also with a 10-year grace period. Secondly, after the fourth batch of yen loans, the scale sharply declined after reaching its peak. The fourth batch of loans was divided into two stages: JPY 580 billion for the 1996-1998 period and JPY 390 billion for the 1999-2000 period, totaling approximately JPY 970 billion. The annual interest rate ranged from 0.75% to 2.3%, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a 10-year grace period. By 2000, yen loans peaked at JPY 2.14299 trillion, which was about three times the amount of the first batch. However, after 2001, the loan amount significantly decreased, reaching its lowest point by 2007 at only JPY 46.302 billion, a reduction of about 78.4% compared to 2000. Finally, there were also industry-specific loans. In 1988 and 1994, the Japanese government provided China with two capital recycling yen loans, amounting to JPY 100 billion and JPY 40 billion, respectively. These loans were mainly used for industries such as textiles, electromechanical, light industry production, and raw materials for export. The development of these sectors supported China's efforts to expand exports and generate foreign exchange. In October 2000, Japan also provided China a special yen loan with a 40-year repayment term, with a 10-year grace period, and an interest rate of only 0.95%, totaling JPY 17.202 billion. These yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, driving the rapid development of the Chinese economy. This impact is reflected in the following three areas: First, they opened the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy. In June 1979, the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law was passed, signaling China's official abandonment of its 1960s policy of rejecting foreign investment. This marked a shift towards encouraging foreign capital. In 1978, China's foreign exchange reserves were only USD 167 million. In 1979, China and Japan signed the first loan agreement, which was the earliest and largest foreign government loan received by China since the reform and opening-up began. Japan was the first country to offer government loans to China, thus opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital to develop its economy. To facilitate this loan, the Japanese government proposed and convinced other Western countries and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to classify China as a 'developing country' and include it in the list of countries eligible for assistance from developed nations. This was very helpful for China in securing funding and development aid from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, thus accelerating China's economic development and integration into the global economic system. Japan was also the largest donor of government development assistance to China, with the total loan agreement amount accounting for over 60% of all foreign government loans to China. Among the 24 countries and regional financial institutions that provided government loans to China, Japan's loans were the largest. China was the third-largest recipient of Japan's foreign aid, following Indonesia and Vietnam. In 2006, Japan's Ambassador to China, Keiji Ide, noted that, in terms of U.S. dollars, Japan's aid to China amounts to USD 144.1 billion, exceeding the total aid from Germany (USD 39.6 billion), France (USD 13.4 billion), and the UK (USD 6.6 billion) combined. Second, the loans promoted China's infrastructure and economic development plans through valuable long-term investment funds, thereby reducing financing costs for construction. The multi-year decision approach to loans aligned with China's five-year economic plans, effectively advancing infrastructure development in areas such as resources, energy, transportation, and communications. According to data from Japan-China Economic Cooperation, the share of yen loans in China's fixed asset investment increased from 1.54% in 1985 to 10.41% in 1992. Through joint efforts between the two countries, a number of large-scale, long-term, technologically advanced, and capital-intensive infrastructure projects were completed across China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. By the end of 1995, the major construction projects included the expansion of the Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway, Qinhuangdao Port expansion, Lianyungang Port expansion, Qingdao Port expansion, the Tianshengqiao hydropower project, the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway construction, Beijing subway construction, Beijing water supply improvement projects, urban gas improvement projects, export base construction projects, Hainan Island development, telephone network expansion in nine provinces and cities, Beijing Capital Airport development, the Xi'an-Ankang railway project, and numerous city infrastructure projects in railways, gas, water supply, electricity, and communications. For instance, between 1991 and 1995, the Tianshengqiao Hydroelectric Project utilized JPY 4.367 billion in loans to build a 1,200 MW dam-style hydroelectric power station, extend 984 kilometers of transmission lines, and support China's eighth Five-Year Plan and the West-to-East Gas Pipeline Project. Furthermore, since Japan launched the transformative economic cooperation plan for China in 2001, yen loans have supported national regional strategies such as the plans for developing the western and central parts of the country. These loans greatly facilitated development in the recipient areas in sectors such as education, healthcare, and the environment, including projects like the Heihe-Beian highway in Heilongjiang, local road development in Gansu, and afforestation plans in Inner Mongolia. Third, it accelerated the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. After the 1980s, the two countries' economic and trade relations evolved from simple import-export trade to comprehensive economic cooperation, which included bilateral trade, the change of Japan's government development aid policy to China, direct investment, and intergovernmental financial cooperation. During this decade, leveraging Japan's government-to-government financial cooperation with China, bilateral trade between the two countries grew from around USD 10 billion in 1981 to USD 20.282 billion in 1991, an increase of over 100%. During this period, trade between the two nations experienced sustained and rapid development overall. Moreover, direct investment from both countries also saw a significant rise, leading to the first surge of private Japanese investment in China. According to data, between 1979 and 1985, the investment amounted to USD 1.23 billion; from 1986 to 1990, total investment reached USD 1.29 billion. Although these investment surges were mainly focused on China's Special Economic Zones and were smaller in scale compared to later investments, they were crucial in opening up direct private investment between the two countries and played a significant role in developing China-Japan economic and trade relations. Later, due to political factors and the Asian financial crisis, China-Japan trade experienced several setbacks. In 1990, bilateral trade declined significantly; from 1994 to 1996, growth slowed notably compared to previous years, and negative growth occurred in 1998. However, overall, China-Japan trade continued to rise, from USD 12.927 billion in 1990 to USD 66.167 billion in 1999. In the 21st century, the development of China-Japan economic and trade relations accelerated rapidly, showing characteristics such as mutual dependence, increasing deepening, a mutually beneficial structure becoming more evident. At the same time, Japan's increasing dependence on China surpassed China's dependence on Japan. This made an important contribution to China's economic development. Meanwhile, Japanese investment in China continued to grow. In 2002, Japanese investment in China remained high, with an agreement amount of USD 5.3 billion and an actual investment of USD 4.19 billion. By the end of 2002, the total agreed investment from Japan to China had reached USD 49.53 billion, with actual investment amounting to USD 36.34 billion. All in all, the 28 years of Japanese loans had a significant impact on China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for it to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, a proper understanding of these loan aids is crucial for China to effectively manage and advance its relations with Japan. Final analysis conclusion: The 28 years of yen loans were characterized by high amounts, significant increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. They played a crucial role in China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, the history and impact of yen loans need to be re-examined.

Will Gavin Newsom Become The New ‘Teflon’ Politician? – OpEd	By William L. Anderson When reality hit the Democratic Party and its ruling-class allies the day after the election, one Democrat must have been relieved: California governor Gavin Newsom. The Kamala Harris loss not only ends her political career—at least at the presidential level—but also clears the way for Newsom to pursue the White House himself. A Harris victory would have delayed Newsom’s quest for eight years, but now he can start laying the groundwork now for a run in 2028. Newsom will spend the next two years in office before becoming a full-time candidate, and, given the constitutional limit on two terms, the Republicans won’t have the advantage (or the weight) of incumbency and will likely present a candidate with less name recognition than Newsom possesses. The New York Times already has jumped in feet-first in its 'Style' section with a hagiographic portrayal of Newsom, hair gel and all. The writer breathlessly wrote: Last year, he debated Ron DeSantis on that network, landing rhetorical jabs like 'You’re nothing but a bully.' The appearances have burnished his reputation as someone who saunters into the conservative lion’s den and comes out with his slicked hair unruffled. His first post-election 'heroic' move was to call for a special session of the California legislature: ...to protect 'California values' in preparation for former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Less than 36 hours after Trump’s resounding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, the California governor — a prominent opponent of the former president during his first term — called to bolster the state’s legal resources with the aim of protecting reproductive healthcare, climate policies and immigrant communities in California. One might think that we are looking at something that is light years away, politically speaking, but in the world of presidential ambition, successful candidates spend years scheming to reach that office. John F. Kennedy’s father was planning the political careers of his sons long before they reached full adulthood, Ronald Reagan coveted the presidency more than 10 years before he was elected in 1980, and Jimmy Carter and his advisers quietly launched their quest long before the Watergate scandal gave him a major opening. In presidential politics, four years is tomorrow and no doubt Newsom and those surrounding him already are at work. However, as Harris has found out, what constitutes success in California politics might prove a liability elsewhere, and that is especially the case regarding the state’s draconian policies on energy and climate change. One imagines that most people believe California to be a weird and exotic place on the nation’s west coast that is an expensive place to live but has little relevance in their own lives. Sure, the state has stringent environmental laws, but the effects are limited to California, or one might think. However, California’s energy and climate policies affect nearly everyone in this country. The election of Donald Trump brings an opponent of California’s policies to the White House, where he is: …expected to try to blow up California’s climate policies, which have set the pace for the rest of the nation and the world. The state is requiring about three-quarters of new trucks sold there after 2035 to be zero emissions. And in a request that is pending, California wants permission from the Biden administration to enact one of the most ambitious climate rules of any nation: a ban on the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in the state after 2035. Both rules are far tougher than federal policy and could have influence beyond the United States, given California’s standing as the world’s fifth-largest economy. China and the European Union have already adopted parts of California’s car and truck tailpipe emissions reduction programs. The Democratic-controlled state legislature has also passed a first-in-the-nation law requiring major companies to disclose their greenhouse emissions. And it has strengthened the authority of local governments to shut down oil and gas projects in their communities. Next month, Californians will be asked to approve a ballot measure to create a $10 billion 'climate bond' to pay for climate and environmental projects. While the New York Times writes approvingly of California’s policies, in reality they will be disastrous for the rest of the country if put into place. In 2023, the California legislature passed a law aimed at outlawing all internal combustion engines in trucks within a decade, a law so draconian that 19 state attorneys general filed suit in federal court to block it. The impact this law would have on the trucking industry would be enormous, especially given how much freight is carried overland on trucks and how inadequate electric vehicles would be to carry it: Electric trucks suffer major disadvantages when compared to diesel trucks. Diesel trucks can travel about 1200 miles after filling the tank in 15 minutes. The range of electric trucks is about 150-330 miles and recharging may take hours, even on a high-speed charger. Electric truck cabs cost two to three times as much as diesel cabs, an incremental cost of as much as $300,000 per truck. Electric cabs also weigh about 10,000 pounds more than comparable diesel versions. This can reduce net freight carried by as much as 20 percent. Part of the problem is that California’s environmental standards often become the precursors to standards for the entire country, but thanks to the Jones Act, California policy has a disproportionate effect upon the lives of others. Because of California’s proximity to Asia (and especially China), it is a natural place for container ships coming from Asia to bring goods imported into the US, and at the present time, about 40 percent of all US imports come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Because of the Jones Act, those foreign-owned ships cannot take goods to any other US port unless they stop at a foreign port that is some distance away. Thus, they cannot take some goods to California and then sail to the US east coast and take goods there. The effect of this law is that a huge amount of imported goods going elsewhere in the US must be transported by truck or rail through California, and given the strict regulations for transfer trucks, carrying goods through that state is very expensive. Given that the laws governing transfer trucks will be even more stringent, that only can raise costs—unless the Jones Act is repealed, which is highly unlikely, given its almost religious support by Democrats and labor unions, despite the hardships it causes. Because Newsom supports the draconian legislation regulating trucks in California, he also is playing a direct role in California being a transportation bottleneck for the rest of the country, a situation that will only become worse in the next four years. To writers from the New York Times, economic crises caused by things like environmental regulations simply don’t happen, or if they do, the fault lies with capitalism. However, if California can proceed with radical restrictions on transporting goods, there can be no spinning the inevitable results. They will mean higher prices, empty shelves, and more hardships for those who are not wealthy. Newsom’s policies will at least be partly to blame, but will voters connect the dots, especially since journalists won’t? Four decades ago, a former governor from California occupied the White House. Because the media and their governmental allies could not pin any scandals on Ronald Reagan, they derisively called him the 'Teflon President.' Given the fawning coverage that Newsom receives in the media, the fact that California has the nation’s highest poverty rates, ruinous environmental laws, and one of the nation’s highest net out-migration rates, one would think that the most prominent political architect of these woes would at least pay something akin to a political price. But think again. If there ever has been a 'Teflon' politician, it is Gavin Newsom. Be prepared to see numerous fawning pieces from mainstream media outlets that present him as a demigod. They are coming. About the author: William L. Anderson is Senior Editor at the Mises Institute and retired professor of economics at Frostburg State University.

Javier Milei’s Blueprint For DOGE: A Chainsaw For Bureaucracy – O...	By Daphne Posadas 'What is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.' That opening line set the tone for Javier Milei’s two-hour interview with Lex Fridman. In it, Argentina’s libertarian president reflected on the first few months of his administration following his historic electoral victory on November 19, 2023. Milei has been called many things, but his methods and philosophy thrive under scrutiny. In a free society, being questioned is both a challenge and an opportunity. What sets Milei apart is his ability to answer tough questions with logic, evidence, and, most importantly, results. His anarchist rhetoric is—as he said—rooted in a libertarianism that has an 'unrestricted respect for the life project of others based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the rights to life, liberty, and property,' a definition championed by Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr., and that follows John Locke’s ideas. A Model Exported Milei’s reforms haven’t gone unnoticed in the U.S., especially after the announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. In the interview, Milei highlighted how Argentina’s Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation, led by Federico Sturzenegger, is systematically dismantling protectionism and privilege by eliminating 1 to 5 economic restrictions daily. This approach is catching attention worldwide, as Musk and Ramaswamy have hinted at adapting this 'chainsaw' strategy. Ramaswamy recently posted on X: 'A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.' A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) November 18, 2024 The Chainsaw Reforms If there’s one image that defined Milei’s 2023 campaign, it’s the chainsaw. He carried a real chainsaw to his rallies, chanting '¡Motosierra! ¡Motosierra!' (Spanish for 'chainsaw') as a symbol of his promise to slash Argentina’s bloated bureaucracy. When Milei took office, Argentina’s inflation was out of control, climbing at almost 1% per day. Fixing the fiscal deficit became his top priority, knowing nothing else would work without a solution on that front. In just a few months, he made drastic changes: cutting over 50,000 government jobs, shutting down more than half of the ministries, slashing regulations, and removing subsidies. The results? Inflation has dropped from 211% year over year in December 2023 to 107.4% in November 2024, according to the latest inflation data from INDEC. According to UFM Reform Watch’s Daniel Fernandez, Javier Milei’s government has now achieved 10 consecutive months of primary fiscal surplus: 'Between January and October 2024, the Argentine government accumulated a primary fiscal surplus equivalent to nearly 1.7% of GDP'—a remarkable turnaround. Milei: A Former Academic As a former economics professor, Milei excels at breaking down complex economic concepts. Early in the interview, he provided a roadmap for those interested in understanding Austrian economics with big references: Human Action by Ludwig von Mises and Principles of Economics by Carl Menger, two starting points for him. He also name-dropped other thinkers, including Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Jesús Huerta de Soto, Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, and Walter Block—a quick guide to both Anglo and Hispanic perspectives on libertarian thought. When Fridman dug deeper and asked about his economic philosophy, Milei replied: 'Ideally, anarcho-capitalist; in reality, minarchist.' This summarizes his pragmatic approach to reducing the state’s size through what he calls 'the largest structural reform in Argentina’s history' while being realistic about what’s possible. Here Milei also addressed criticism from some libertarians, saying they often fall for the 'nirvana fallacy'—expecting perfect solutions in an imperfect world. Key Takeaways There are two main takeaways from Milei’s interview with Fridman. First, Milei knows what he’s talking about. Too many politicians don’t really understand economics, but Milei clearly does. He doesn’t just memorize numbers; he explains the reasoning behind his decisions, and it makes sense. Second, market-driven reforms can deliver results. Contrary to popular belief or experts’ advice, these changes don’t require decades to show their impact. Will these reforms catch on all the way to the White House? Only time will tell. But for now, it’s clear that Milei’s approach is turning heads around the world. I highly recommend watching or listening to the full conversation. It’s an incredibly stimulating discussion, particularly for economics enthusiasts eager to see theory translated into real-world policy action.

Who Should Pay For Really Expensive Drugs? – OpEd	When is the last time you saw a news headline about cancer patients who died because they were unable to afford a drug that could have saved their lives? I bet you haven’t. One reason is that drug companies that make expensive drugs can’t afford the political backlash that would follow such a headline. Another reason is that large employers who provide health insurance can’t afford such a headline, either. Yet, despite the fact that Big Pharma and big business agree on the end result (people get the lifesaving drugs they need), they don’t always agree on who should bear the bulk of the cost. In fact, in the modern era there has been a continuing tug of war between the two that has been largely unreported. Enter the politicians to tilt the scale. A letter signed by a number of Democrats and Republicans in Congress supports a Biden administration proposed regulation that would remove many employer options. Instead of allowing normal market forces to play out, this regulation would allow drug companies to sell brand-name drugs at monopoly prices for virtually all patients with employer-provided health insurance. The result would be higher drug company profits and lower employee wages. Specialty Drugs The most expensive drugs are generally called 'specialty drugs.' These are primarily used to treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and genetic diseases. They can also cost thousands of dollars. For example, among the top ten most prescribed specialty drugs, the monthly expense ranges from $3,587 to $33,981. Including the treatment of HIV infection, only 5.9% of the US population uses a specialty drug. But those drugs now account for over 50% of total drug spending in the United States. Within the U.S., people with private health insurance tend to face very high out-of-pocket costs when it comes to specialty drugs. If a drug costs $2,000 a month, for example, an employee might have to pay the full cost for 3 or 4 months before reaching the deductible; then the employee’s health insurance takes over. For many people, this out-of-pocket cost may pose a significant barrier to obtaining the prescribed drug. Drug Companies To overcome that obstacle (at least in the short run), drug companies issue copay cards to use at a pharmacy to cover the initial cost. This gets patients started on the drugs their doctors say they need. Although it is not generally known, just about anyone starting out on an expensive drug regime can get copay cards for the first few months of treatment—regardless of income. (Remarkably, in issuing copay cards, drug companies are doing something that would be completely illegal if done by doctors and hospitals. If a doctor or hospital waived the patient’s out-of-pocket portion of the bill, they would be violating anti-kickback laws.) The drug companies’ second line of attack is the creation of Patient Assistance Programs. These are charitable enterprises that give financial assistance to people who are uninsured or underinsured. The amount of help generally depends on the patient’s income—with the goal of making the drug affordable. Large Employers In a free market for health insurance, a typical plan would leave the enrollee responsible for small expenses for which patient discretion is affordable and desirable, and have the health plan pay for large expenses that would otherwise be unaffordable. However, government regulation (which has become more onerous with the passage of time) forces employers to ignore the health condition of prospective employees. These regulations, along with the rising cost of health care, have induced employers to adopt health plans that turn traditional health insurance principles upside down. That means, for example, low out-of-pocket costs for primary care and high out-of-pocket costs for hospitalization. This is the type of plan that appeals to potential employees who are healthy and does not appeal to those who expect to need a lot of care. Drug coverage often fits this pattern. No employer wants to hire an employee whose family member needs a specialty drug. The employer could end up paying more in medical costs than in wages. Since it is illegal for the employer to ask about expected medical expenses at the point of hiring, the same end can be achieved by not covering the drug in the first place, or by covering it with a high deductible. This makes employment at the firm unattractive to anyone who needs the drug. The Tug of War We saw above how drug companies try to get private group health plans or health insurance to pay most of the cost of expensive drugs. Employers have been using strategies of their own. One straightforward approach is to not cover a specialty drug in their health plan or to cover it with high patient cost-sharing (which large, self-insured companies are allowed to do). When a doctor prescribes the drug, the employee is then directed to the drug company’s Patient Assistance Program (PAP) as someone who is not fully insured for the needed drug. Some advocacy companies actually specialize in helping the employee fill out the paperwork and navigate the byzantine PAP system. What happens if patients are rejected by the PAP, say, because their income is too high to qualify for financial assistance? Then the employer often makes a hardship exception and pays for the drug through its health plan. The congressional letter signers (noted above) want to put an end to these employer options. They want to force large employers to cover expensive drugs the way they cover other drugs—giving the drug companies a big win. And since employer health insurance benefits are ultimately paid for by lower employee wages, the drug company win would be an employee loss. There is no right or wrong solution when a monopoly seller clashes with buyers trying to avoid paying a monopoly price. That’s why government regulators should be held at bay and normal market forces should be allowed to play out.

Russia Now Has Two Million Homeless And Their Ranks Are Growing B...	Although the Russian government does not release any statistics on homelessness, the Shelter (Nochlezhka) organization, the oldest group in Russia devoted to helping the homeless, says there are now approximately two million homeless in Russia and that their numbers are growing because of the war in Ukraine. According to Nochlezhka, the three primary causes of homelessness are low incomes, family problems and the search for work in new places (tochno.st/materials/iz-za-krizisov-v-rossii-vyroslo-cislo-bezdomnyx-no-oficialnoi-statistiki-o-nix-net-my-proanalizirovali-dannye-noclezki-o-tom-kto-i-pocemu-cashhe-vsego-popadaet-na-ulicu). Their numbers rose during the pandemic and have risen even more since the start of Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine which has left many Russians without sufficient money to pay rent, increased problems within some families, and led others to move from one place to another in hopes of finding better jobs. Approximately four out of five are men, some are second generation homeless, and one in ten grew up in an orphanage. But despite public views, fewer homeless are alcoholics or drug abusers than are members of the Russian population as a whole, according to the data collected by Nochlezhka. Most of Russia’s homeless survive on the basis of temporary work or help from families rather than from social services provided by the government. Indeed, the group says, the only government service such people, who now form one in every 70 Russians, can rely is the government’s ambulance service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzt0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-20T16:56:04-08:00	
Albert Camus’s Thought And Its Impact On Later Thinkers – Analysi...	Albert Camus, the French-Algerian philosopher, writer, and journalist, left an indelible mark on modern intellectual thought through his exploration of absurdity, rebellion, and existential ethics. His ideas, articulated through works such as The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Stranger (1942), and The Rebel (1951), have resonated deeply with later thinkers, influencing diverse fields ranging from existentialism and postmodernism to politics and literature. Camus's unique perspective on the human condition challenged prevailing ideologies and provided a nuanced framework for understanding personal freedom, collective responsibility, and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe. The Core of Camus's Philosophy Camus's philosophy revolves around the concept of the absurd—the tension between human beings' relentless search for meaning and the universe's apparent indifference to that search. Unlike existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who sought to transcend the absurd through subjective meaning-making, Camus embraced the absurd as a fundamental condition of existence. For Camus, life's lack of inherent meaning does not lead to despair but calls for defiance and the conscious creation of value. This perspective laid the foundation for his emphasis on rebellion, not as a destructive act, but as an assertion of human dignity and solidarity. Impact on Existentialism: Sartre and De Beauvoir While Camus famously rejected the existentialist label, his work inevitably intersected with and influenced prominent existentialist thinkers, particularly Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre, in his monumental work Being and Nothingness (1943), shared Camus's preoccupation with freedom and responsibility. However, Camus diverged from Sartre in his refusal to embrace Marxist revolutionary violence as a means of achieving freedom. This difference came to a head in their public feud following the publication of Camus's The Rebel, in which he critiqued Marxist ideologies for their justification of historical violence. Simone de Beauvoir, in works such as The Second Sex (1949), explored existential themes of freedom and oppression, particularly in the context of gender. While she was more aligned with Sartre's existentialism, de Beauvoir acknowledged Camus's influence on her conception of personal responsibility and the confrontation with absurdity. Camus's insistence on solidarity as a form of rebellion resonates in her discussions of collective feminist struggles. Postmodern Thinkers: Derrida and Foucault The rise of postmodernism in the latter half of the 20th century saw thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault grappling with issues of meaning, power, and subjectivity, often in ways that echo Camus's absurdist sensibility. Derrida's deconstructionist approach, for instance, can be seen as a philosophical parallel to Camus's insistence on confronting the absurd without resorting to absolute truths. Derrida's emphasis on the instability of meaning aligns with Camus's rejection of ultimate purpose, emphasizing instead the creative potential of human agency in the face of uncertainty. Michel Foucault's analysis of power and resistance bears traces of Camus's influence, particularly in its rejection of totalizing narratives and its focus on individual agency. Foucault's concept of 'counter-conducts' in resisting dominant systems of control echoes Camus's vision of rebellion as a life-affirming act against oppressive ideologies. While Foucault does not explicitly cite Camus as a key influence, their shared emphasis on ethics and freedom in a fragmented world underscores an intellectual kinship. Political Philosophy: Hannah Arendt and Václav Havel Hannah Arendt, a leading 20th-century political theorist, found resonance in Camus's exploration of rebellion and human dignity. In her seminal work The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Arendt analyzed the dehumanizing effects of totalitarian regimes, themes that Camus also examined in The Plague and The Rebel. Both thinkers emphasized the importance of collective resistance against tyranny and the preservation of human freedom. Arendt's idea of 'natality,' the potential for new beginnings through human action, mirrors Camus's notion of defying absurdity through creative acts. Václav Havel, the Czech playwright, dissident, and later president, openly acknowledged Camus's influence on his political philosophy. Havel's concept of 'living in truth' as a form of resistance to oppressive regimes draws directly from Camus's celebration of personal integrity and rebellion. Camus's works provided a moral and philosophical framework for Havel and other dissidents during the Cold War, underscoring the enduring relevance of his ideas in political resistance. Camus's Influence on Literature Camus's literary legacy extends beyond philosophy, profoundly impacting writers such as Samuel Beckett, James Baldwin, and Milan Kundera. Beckett, in works like Waiting for Godot (1953), explores themes of absurdity and existential inertia that parallel Camus's depiction of human perseverance in The Myth of Sisyphus. The repetitive, purposeless actions of Beckett's characters reflect the absurdist condition Camus described, while also embodying a form of rebellion through endurance. James Baldwin, a towering figure in 20th-century literature, was deeply influenced by Camus's humanism and his critique of systemic injustice. Baldwin's essays, particularly in The Fire Next Time (1963), echo Camus's call for moral courage and solidarity in confronting oppression. Baldwin admired Camus's refusal to succumb to nihilism despite acknowledging the absurdity of the human condition. Milan Kundera, the Czech novelist, found inspiration in Camus's balance of philosophical inquiry and literary expression. Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984) reflects Camus's influence in its exploration of existential freedom and the tension between personal responsibility and historical determinism. Kundera's characters, like Camus's, navigate a world devoid of ultimate meaning, finding significance in their acts of defiance and creation. Contemporary Philosophy and Ethics In contemporary philosophy, thinkers such as Susan Neiman and Bernard-Henri Lévy have carried forward Camus's legacy. Neiman, in her book Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists (2008), draws on Camus's moral philosophy to argue for an ethical framework that combines realism with hope. She sees Camus as a model for engaging with life's challenges without resorting to cynicism or despair. Bernard-Henri Lévy, a prominent French intellectual, has championed Camus's ideas as a guide for navigating the complexities of modern geopolitics. In works such as The Genius of Judaism (2017), Lévy emphasizes the relevance of Camus's humanism in addressing issues of identity, conflict, and reconciliation. Critiques and Challenges to Camus's Thought Despite his widespread influence, Camus's ideas have also faced criticism. Postcolonial theorists, including Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, have critiqued Camus's ambivalence toward colonialism, particularly in the Algerian context. While Camus advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian War, his reluctance to support full independence for Algeria alienated some contemporaries. Additionally, feminist scholars have challenged the gendered implications of Camus's absurd hero, often characterized as a solitary male figure. Thinkers such as Luce Irigaray have called for a more inclusive conception of rebellion that accounts for diverse experiences of oppression and solidarity. Legacy in the 21st Century In an era defined by technological advancement, climate crises, and political polarization, Camus's philosophy continues to offer a compelling lens for understanding the human condition. His call for ethical rebellion and solidarity resonates with movements addressing systemic inequality, environmental degradation, and social justice. Camus's thought has influenced activists and intellectuals alike, from Greta Thunberg's climate activism to the Black Lives Matter movement. His insistence on confronting absurdity with courage and creativity provides a timeless framework for addressing contemporary challenges. Conclusion Albert Camus's thought, rooted in the recognition of life's absurdity, remains a beacon for those seeking to navigate a world fraught with uncertainty and conflict. His influence on thinkers such as Sartre, Arendt, Derrida, and Baldwin highlights the enduring relevance of his ideas in philosophy, politics, and literature. By championing rebellion as an affirmation of human dignity and solidarity, Camus offers a vision of hope and resistance that continues to inspire generations of thinkers and activists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzpjCAGuT2RmQ	2024-11-20T16:47:49-08:00	
Edward Said And Frantz Fanon: Pioneers Of Postcolonial Thought An...	Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, two intellectual giants of the 20th century, profoundly shaped postcolonial theory and decolonial thought. Said, a literary critic and cultural theorist, and Fanon, a psychiatrist and revolutionary, examined the deep-seated structures of colonialism and their enduring effects on culture, politics, and identity. While their works addressed different aspects of colonialism—Said through cultural critique and Fanon through political and psychological analysis—both shared a commitment to exposing colonial oppression and envisioning paths to liberation. This article explores the seminal contributions of Said and Fanon, their intellectual synergy, and their impact on later thinkers across disciplines, including Gayatri Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Achille Mbembe, Stuart Hall, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and others. Their ideas continue to resonate in fields as diverse as literary studies, political theory, anthropology, and critical race studies. Frantz Fanon: The Revolutionary Voice of Decolonization Frantz Fanon's major works, including Black Skin, White Masks (1952) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961), offer a searing critique of colonialism's dehumanizing effects on both colonizers and the colonized. Drawing from his experiences as a psychiatrist in Algeria during its war for independence, Fanon analyzed the psychological dimensions of colonialism, highlighting how it internalizes inferiority in the oppressed and superiority in the oppressors. He also called for violent revolution as a means to reclaim identity and autonomy. Edward Said: The Critic of Orientalism Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) revolutionized the study of colonialism by exposing how Western representations of the 'Orient' were rooted in power dynamics and served to justify imperial domination. Said's concept of 'othering' revealed how the West constructed the East as its binary opposite—irrational, backward, and exotic—thereby legitimizing colonial control. Through Culture and Imperialism (1993), Said expanded his critique to include the ways Western literature reinforced imperial ideologies. Synergy and Divergence: Said and Fanon While both thinkers critiqued colonial systems, their approaches differed. Fanon emphasized the necessity of physical and psychological decolonization through revolutionary action, while Said focused on dismantling the cultural narratives that sustained imperial power. Together, they laid the groundwork for a holistic understanding of colonialism's legacy, influencing subsequent scholars who integrated their insights into broader frameworks. Impact on Later Thinkers 1. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' Gayatri Spivak, a postcolonial theorist and literary critic, drew on Said and Fanon to develop her seminal concept of the 'subaltern'—marginalized individuals silenced by colonial and patriarchal systems. In her 1988 essay, Can the Subaltern Speak?, Spivak critiqued Western intellectuals for speaking on behalf of the oppressed rather than enabling their voices to emerge. She also extended Said's critique of cultural representation by emphasizing how imperialism intersected with gender. Spivak's scholarship has influenced feminist theory and postcolonial studies, pushing for greater attention to the intersectionality of race, class, and gender within colonial and postcolonial contexts. 2. Homi K. Bhabha: Hybridity and the Third Space Homi Bhabha built on Said's analysis of cultural representation and Fanon's exploration of identity to articulate key concepts such as hybridity and the 'third space.' In The Location of Culture (1994), Bhabha argued that colonial encounters produce hybrid identities, destabilizing the binary distinctions between colonizer and colonized. Bhabha's ideas have profoundly influenced discussions on globalization and multiculturalism, offering a nuanced understanding of how cultural exchanges reshape identity and power dynamics in postcolonial societies. 3. Achille Mbembe: Necropolitics and the Legacy of Fanon Achille Mbembe, a Cameroonian philosopher, extended Fanon's insights on violence and colonialism to develop his theory of necropolitics. In his 2003 essay of the same name, Mbembe examined how sovereign powers exert control over life and death, particularly in colonial and postcolonial contexts. He also engaged with Said's critique of Western domination by exploring how racial hierarchies are sustained in global systems of capitalism and governance. Mbembe's work has become central to critical race theory and discussions on contemporary forms of structural violence and exclusion. 4. Stuart Hall: Cultural Studies and Identity Politics Stuart Hall, a British cultural theorist, combined insights from Said and Fanon to analyze the interplay between culture, power, and identity. Hall's concept of cultural identity as dynamic and ever-changing draws from Fanon's exploration of identity formation under colonial rule. Hall's analysis of media representations also resonates with Said's critique of Orientalism. Hall's contributions have been foundational to cultural studies, particularly in understanding how race and ethnicity are constructed and contested in popular culture and political discourse. 5. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o: Decolonizing the Mind Kenyan writer and theorist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o directly engaged with Fanon's call for cultural decolonization in his seminal work, Decolonising the Mind (1986). Ngũgĩ argued for the rejection of colonial languages in African literature, emphasizing the need to reclaim indigenous languages as a form of resistance and empowerment. Ngũgĩ's ideas echo Said's critique of cultural imperialism and Fanon's emphasis on reclaiming identity through cultural production, making him a key figure in the global decolonial movement. 6. Arundhati Roy: Postcolonial Activism Indian author and activist Arundhati Roy has drawn from Said's and Fanon's critiques to address contemporary issues of globalization, environmental degradation, and social justice. In essays such as The Algebra of Infinite Justice (2002), Roy critiques the neo-imperial practices of multinational corporations and global powers, echoing Said's analysis of cultural hegemony and Fanon's critique of systemic exploitation. 7. Leela Gandhi: Postcolonial Ethics Leela Gandhi, in Postcolonial Theory: A Critical Introduction (1998), engaged deeply with the works of Said and Fanon to explore the ethical dimensions of postcolonialism. She emphasized the importance of building solidarity between the colonized and the colonizers, drawing from Said's notion of 'contrapuntal reading' and Fanon's vision of a humanist future beyond colonial violence. 8. Walter D. Mignolo: Decolonial Thinking Walter Mignolo, a prominent decolonial theorist, expanded on Said's and Fanon's ideas to develop the concept of 'epistemic disobedience.' In works such as The Darker Side of Western Modernity (2011), Mignolo critiques the dominance of Western epistemologies and calls for a decolonial shift in knowledge production. Contemporary Relevance In the 21st century, Said's and Fanon's ideas remain deeply relevant as scholars and activists grapple with the enduring legacies of colonialism. Movements such as Black Lives Matter, Indigenous land rights campaigns, and global decolonial efforts resonate with their critiques of systemic oppression and calls for liberation. The proliferation of postcolonial and decolonial studies as academic disciplines testifies to their enduring influence. Conclusion Edward Said and Frantz Fanon transformed the intellectual landscape by exposing the cultural, psychological, and structural mechanisms of colonial domination. Their works have inspired generations of thinkers—Spivak, Bhabha, Mbembe, Hall, and others—to explore the complexities of identity, resistance, and liberation in a postcolonial world. By confronting the past and envisioning alternative futures, Said and Fanon's legacy endures as a powerful call for justice, equality, and human dignity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzlqy-bgTdmU8	2024-11-20T16:45:00-08:00	
US, Under Fire, For Vetoing Resolutions Demanding Ceasefire In Ga...	The US veto on a Security Council (UNSC) resolution—demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza—was highly predictable. The resolution, which was vetoed November 20, also called for the release of all hostages and full humanitarian access for civilians. Since 1945, a total of 36 UNSC draft resolutions related to Israel-Palestine have been vetoed by at least one of the five permanent members (P5)—the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Of these, 34 were vetoed by the US and two by Russia and China, according to Al Jazeera, the Qatari-based Middle East news network. Meanwhile, the US, a strong ally with undying loyalty to Israel, came under heavy fire for its decision to exercise its veto—for the fourth time on a resolution on Gaza. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said the US used its veto, once again, to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza, including mass forced displacement and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The resolution it rejected also called for the release of Israeli hostages and compliance with international humanitarian law, both of which the US itself has called for. 'By continuing to shield Israeli authorities from pressure and scrutiny, the US is de facto condoning their crimes against humanity,' said Charbonneau. Brenda Moyfa, Head of Oxfam’s New York Office, said: 'It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a life-saving ceasefire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe.' This latest resolution for humanitarian access and an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza was promising on paper, but has little meaning vetoed, while past resolutions have gone unenforced, she pointed out. Security Council members continue to transfer arms for the Israeli military’s ongoing attacks on Palestinians trapped in Gaza without anywhere safe or the most basic resources to survive. 'The North Gaza governorate is being ethnically cleansed, with desperate civilians being deliberately starved to death in blatant violation of international law. Virtually no aid has entered all of Gaza for weeks now, yet member states continue to look the other way. 'This vote underlines Israel’s continued impunity to commit atrocities in Gaza. We need urgent reform within the UN Security Council. It is a profound failure and dereliction of duty for the member states who have pledged to uphold the UN Charter to maintain peace and protect lives,' Moyfa declared. Asked whether Secretary-General António Guterres has any reaction to the failure of the Gaza ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters November 20: 'I think it’s another example of the regrettable lack of consensus that we’ve seen in the Security Council between Member States and frankly, the lack of implementation of previous resolutions on Gaza'. For his part, the Secretary-General will continue in to support all efforts to see an end to the conflict in Gaza, to achieve the unconditional release of all hostages and to implement the two-state solution, he added. Dujarric also pointed out that the lack of unity among Member States, lack of unity among the Permanent Five 'makes our job that much more challenging.' Unity from the P5, unity from the Security Council as a whole, gives the Secretary-General clearer guidance on how to move on issues politically. 'I’m not going into analysing the motivation behind the various vetoes we’ve seen from the permanent members, but I think especially on humanitarian and political situations, unity is better for the brand. Let me put it that way', said Dujarric. Coincidentally, the 193-member General Assembly is currently debating the uses and abuses of veto powers by the P5. Ambassador Gianluca Greco of Italy told delegates November 20 the veto power is 'the problem'. While understandable in the specific historical context of 1945, nowadays it blatantly contradicts one of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter: that of sovereign equality of States, he said. In too many occasions, he pointed out, it has prevented the Security Council from discharging its vital responsibilities with regard to situations endangering international peace and security, in which the UN could have made a real difference on the ground. 'Which is why Italy has consistently advocated for a Security Council reform that does not exacerbate further the functional malaises of the Council by adding new permanent members with veto powers', he declared. Speaking on behalf of Germany, Michael Geisler, Political Coordinator, told delegates limiting both the scope and actual use of the veto is essential for creating a more inclusive, transparent, and responsive Security Council. 'Germany strongly advocates for restraint in the exercise of the veto, particularly in cases involving mass atrocities and war crimes, in order to prioritize the protection of civilians in conflict situations. We call upon all Member States to support the ACT Code of Conduct and the French-Mexican Initiative on veto restraint', he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtztOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-20T16:44:06-08:00	
Getting Ukraine To A Position Of Strength: A Strategy For The Tru...	By Luke Coffey Why Ukraine Matters to the United States Below are five reasons why Ukraine is important to US interests. 1. Protecting the US economy. North America and Europe account for nearly half of the world’s GDP. Two-thirds of foreign investment into the US comes from Europe, and 48 states export more to Europe than to China. This supports millions of American jobs. European stability, which Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine undermines, benefits the US economy and, by extension, the American worker. Aiding Ukraine helps preserve that stability. 2. Detering Chinese aggression. Russia is China’s junior partner. A weakened or defeated Russia means a weaker China. Beijing is watching how the West supports Ukraine. A strong and victorious Ukraine makes Taiwan appear stronger and deters Chinese aggression. 3. Succeeding in great power competition. Russia’s war against Ukraine is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. North Korea has provided 10,000 soldiers, millions of artillery shells, and hundreds of missiles to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meanwhile, Iran provides Russia with drones and ballistic missiles in exchange for fighter jets and other advanced capabilities. China’s technical, economic, and diplomatic support for Russia enables all this as part of Beijing’s strategy to undermine the US. 4. Preparing the US military enterprise for twenty-first-century warfare. Support for Ukraine has exposed major shortcomings in the US defense industrial base that can now be fixed. The war has also tested American-made military hardware in a way not possible in peacetime—with no American casualties. The US is learning what works, what does not work, and how systems evolve in combat. And as Ukraine receives US weapons, America replaces its own weapons stocks with newer, more effective systems. 5. Demonstrating strength. A successful Ukraine demonstrates American strength. However, acquiescing to Putin and abandoning partners shows the world American weakness. Even forcing Ukraine into a deal that lopsidedly benefits Russia would embolden US adversaries and cause America’s allies to hedge toward other security arrangements. What President Trump Needs to Do President-elect Donald Trump is sincere in his desire to end the war, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emphasized that he wants a 'fair' end to the war. But the end needs to be just and honorable. The incoming Trump administration needs to change course from the Biden administration’s approach so Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. Below are seven steps to do so. 1. Take meaningful steps to close sanctions loopholes. Russia diverts much of its trade through a network of partners to skirt Western sanctions. The US and its allies need to crack down on sanctions evasion to truly cripple the Russian economy. 2. Encourage European partners to establish an air defense mission in Poland and Romania. Russian missiles and drones routinely violate NATO airspace. Alliance members should use Polish and Romanian territory to intercept missiles or drones headed toward a NATO member, even in western Ukrainian airspace. This is a reasonable act of self-defense with a low risk of escalation because neither US nor NATO forces will be in direct confrontation with Russian troops. The mission would protect major Ukrainian population centers such as Lviv, allowing Kyiv to reposition scarce air defense systems closer to the front line. 3. Promote a pro-America energy policy. Congress and the executive branch should revoke all restrictions on liquefied natural gas exports. President Trump’s policies to unshackle US oil and gas production and his administration’s relationships with Gulf states could give the president powerful leverage on global energy prices. This would weaken one of Russia’s remaining economic lifelines. 4. Develop a strategy to boost Ukraine’s defense sector and integrate it with America’s. Ukraine’s defense sector has a highly skilled, innovative, and educated workforce. Before Russia’s 2014 invasion, Ukraine was among the top 10 global defense exporters. Even as it fights, Ukraine has debuted groundbreaking weapons systems, especially in the unmanned category. Bolstering Ukraine’s domestic defense industry is one of the best long-term guarantees of the country’s security. 5. Think boldly and creatively about weapons. The next administration should break President Joe Biden’s predictable cycle and show strength in the weapons it sends to Ukraine. So it should continue providing Kyiv with more of the weapons it has already used successfully, and consider arming Ukraine with longer-range weapons such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile Block III and Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER). 6. Remove all restrictions on the use of American-provided weapons and encourage European partners to do the same. By adhering to Russia’s dubious red lines, Washington allows Moscow to dictate the conflict’s terms. If the Kremlin’s forces strike Ukraine from Russian territory, the US should show strength and allow Kyiv to use any weapons system against any legitimate military target, even those inside Russia. 7. Urge Congress to (a) pass another Ukraine supplemental during the lame-duck session and (b) legislate for the seizure of frozen Russian assets to be used for Ukraine aid. Both actions would strengthen President Trump’s hand when he takes office in January.

Belarus: Lukashenko Pardons 32 More Political Prisoners Of Estima...	(RFE/RL) -- Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, has pardoned an additional 32 political prisoners, according to reports from the pro-government Pul Pervogo Telegram channel, although an estimated 1,300 opposition activists remain behind bars in the country. The identities of those pardoned were not disclosed, but the report said they had all been convicted of extremism, a charge widely used against political activists. The report further identified the pardoned individuals as 24 men and eight women, with nine of them above the age of 50. The pardons released the individuals from serving their full sentences but did not remove their criminal records. Their behavior will continue to be monitored by the Interior Ministry after their release, the report said. This marks the sixth instance of political prisoner pardons in Belarus this year, bringing the total number of individuals set free to 178. Earlier this month, 31 political prisoners were pardoned. In July, the government pardoned 18 people, including Ryhor Kastusyou, the former leader of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party who had been serving a 10-year sentence and is reportedly in poor health. Additional pardons followed in August (30 individuals), early September (30), and mid-September (37). In mid-November, prominent opposition figure Maryya Kalesnikava, who is serving an 11-year sentence on charges of conspiring to seize power, met with her father for the first time in 21 months. A month earlier, Lukashenka had suggested he might consider pardoning Kalesnikava if she submitted a formal request. However, it remains unclear whether she has accepted the offer. Kalesnikava has previously refused to request a pardon, maintaining her innocence and rejecting the legitimacy of the charges against her. The latest pardons come in the context of a harsh crackdown on dissent following the mass protests in Belarus in 2020, sparked by contested presidential election results. Lukashenka responded to the demonstrations with widespread repression, forcing at least 13,000 people into exile. According to human rights organizations, approximately 1,300 political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails, including politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, and civic activists. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for January 2025, with Lukashenka widely expected to be declared the winner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqRCDuDRJ0Mw	2024-11-20T16:34:03-08:00	
HRW: Proposed US Landmine Transfers Gravely Threaten Civilians	The Biden administration’s decision to transfer internationally banned antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine risks civilian lives and rejects the most successful humanitarian disarmament treaty of the past 25 years, Human Rights Watch said today. On November 19, 2024, the Washington Post reported that US President Joe Biden had authorized providing antipersonnel mines to Ukraine, which US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on November 20. 'They’ve [Ukraine] asked for these, and so I think it’s a good idea,' Austin told the New York Times. 'President Biden’s decision to transfer antipersonnel landmines risks civilian lives and sets back international efforts to eradicate these indiscriminate weapons,' said Mary Wareham, deputy crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. 'The US should reverse this reprehensible decision, which only increases the risk of civilian suffering in the short and long term.' A majority of the world’s countries rejected antipersonnel landmines decades ago due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term human suffering that they cause, Human Rights Watch said. Antipersonnel mines are designed to explode in response to a person’s presence, proximity, or contact. They are typically placed by hand, but they can also be scattered by aircraft, rockets, and artillery or dispersed from specialized vehicles. Antipersonnel mines cannot distinguish between soldiers and civilians, making them unlawfully indiscriminate under international humanitarian law. Uncleared landmines pose a danger until cleared and destroyed. Mined land can drive displacement of the civilian population, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities. Civilians made up 84 percent of all recorded landmine casualties in 2023, while children were 37 percent of casualties when the age was recorded. The United States has not used antipersonnel mines since 1991, has not exported them since 1992, has not produced them since 1997, and had no plans for future procurement. Over the past 30 years, the US has destroyed antipersonnel mines from its stockpile and has spent more than $1 billion on the development and production of systems that could be considered alternatives to antipersonnel mines. On June 21, 2022, President Biden announced a policy committing the US not to use antipersonnel mines anywhere in the world, except on the Korean Peninsula, and set the goal of ultimately joining the Mine Ban Treaty. Under that policy, the US committed to destroy antipersonnel mine stockpiles that are 'not required for the defense of the Korean Peninsula.' It promised that it would not develop, produce, or acquire antipersonnel mines. The policy explicitly requires the US 'not [to] assist, encourage, or induce anyone, outside the context of the Korean Peninsula, to engage in activity that would be prohibited' by the Mine Ban Treaty. In September 1994, the US became the first country to call for the 'eventual elimination' of antipersonnel landmines and participated in the 1996-1997 Ottawa Process that created the Mine Ban Treaty. The US did not adopt or sign the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Clinton administration set the goal for the US to join the treaty in 2006. The George W. Bush administration reversed that objective in 2004. In 2014, the Barack Obama administration issued a US landmine policy banning the production and acquisition of antipersonnel mines, as well as halting their use by US forces anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. In January 2020, then-president and current President-elect Donald Trump canceled a policy that would have eliminated all antipersonnel mines in the US stockpile. The existing US stockpile of antipersonnel mines is expected to expire—meaning that the mines will become unusable—by the early 2030s, in part because their 36-year shelf-life decreases over time as batteries embedded inside the mines deteriorate with age. The 2014 policy precluded the US from extending or modifying the life of the batteries in its stockpiled antipersonnel mines. The 2022 policy was understood to continue that practice. The Mine Ban Treaty entered into force on March 1, 1999; it comprehensively bans antipersonnel mines and requires destruction of stocks, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims. A total of 164 countries have joined the treaty, including all NATO member states, except the US; all European Union member states; and US allies such as Australia, Japan, and Ukraine. Ukraine ratified the Mine Ban Treaty on December 27, 2005, while Russia has not joined it. The US transfer decision comes days before the Fifth Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, to be held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from November 25-29. The US and Ukraine have registered to attend the event, also known as the Siem Reap Summit on a Mine-Free World. Russia has used antipersonnel landmines widely in Ukraine since its full-scale invasion of the country on February 24, 2022, causing hundreds of casualties and contaminating vast tracts of agricultural land. Russia has also created an unprecedented situation in which a country that is not party to the Mine Ban Treaty is using the weapon on the territory of a treaty party. Human Rights Watch has also documented Ukrainian use of antipersonnel mines in violation of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium, Kharkivska province, in 2022, when the city was under Russian control. Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating reports that forces used rocket-fired antipersonnel mines. By accepting and using antipersonnel mines, Ukraine risks further violating the Mine Ban Treaty, Human Rights Watch said. Under article 20 of the Mine Ban Treaty, a state party engaging in armed conflict is not allowed to withdraw from the treaty before the end of the armed conflict. The treaty is also not subject to reservations. 'Russian forces have repeatedly used antipersonnel mines and committed atrocities against civilians across Ukraine in violation of the laws of war, but this doesn’t justify transferring and using prohibited weapons,' Wareham said. 'Abiding by international protections for civilians means working to ensure that antipersonnel mines are never used again.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuLb8p71SqDX	2024-11-20T16:30:25-08:00	
As Chinese Buyers Snap Up Chiang Mai Properties, Thais Fear For F...	By Wittayakorn Boonruang Visitors who walk through a new housing development in Hang Dong, a district of Chiang Mai, might think they’ve stumbled into a slice of China because Chinese letters dominate storefront signs. This isn’t isolated to Hang Dong. Across Chiang Mai, Thailand’s northern cultural capital, Chinese investment is rapidly reshaping entire neighborhoods – and raising alarm about the city’s future identity and economic independence. 'If Chinese investors seriously enter the dormitory business and buy up properties to rent at higher prices exclusively to Chinese tenants, people living paycheck to paycheck who rent cheap accommodations will definitely struggle,' Naret Puntasrivichai, 43, who runs a monthly apartment rental business in Hang Dong, told BenarNews. His concerns aren’t unfounded. Over the past decade, buyers from mainland China have snapped up more than 1,000 housing units in Chiang Mai, with investments totaling between 3 billion and 5 billion baht (U.S. $86.1 million and $143.5 million), according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association. These properties, with pricetags starting at 3 million baht ($86,133) per unit, have spread across Chiang Mai’s three major districts – Hang Dong, San Kamphaeng and San Sai. In Hang Dong district alone, one Chinese-backed project spent 350 million baht ($10 million) on only four acres of land – a level of investment that dwarfs local developers’ capabilities, Prachachat Business, a local newspaper, reported in early 2023. The Chiang Mai Provincial Office reported that the city has a population of about 1.62 million Thai nationals, 7,190 Chinese and about 150,000 people from other nationalities. In addition to the 7,190 residents, many other Chinese take advantage of tourist visas allowing them to stay in Thailand for up to 60 days per visit. In Chiang Mai, it is common for Chinese nationals to use this route to reside and conduct business, according to authorities. In 2023, Chinese nationals were the largest group of tourists – about 200,000 – traveling to Chiang Mai. 'Chinese investors are transforming Chiang Mai from a tourist destination into their second home,' said Danaitun Pongpatcharatrontep who heads Chiang Mai University’s China Intelligence Center. 'They’re planning businesses in tourism and second-home construction, bringing their children to study here and establishing long-term residences for elderly Chinese. Investment comes both through pure Chinese companies and joint ventures with Thais,' he told BenarNews. Europeans, Americans and Middle Easterners dominated foreign property purchases in Thailand before the COVID-19 pandemic forced travel restrictions. Today, Chinese buyers outstrip not just other foreigners but even Thai nationals in the local property market, according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association 2024 report. Property prices in Chiang Mai can be several times lower than in China and budget airlines offer direct flights from major Chinese cities, cutting travel times to two to three hours. For China’s burgeoning middle class, Chiang Mai represents an affordable slice of paradise. In major cities Beijing and Shanghai, housing prices can average $6,800 to $8,400 per square meter, meaning a 1,200 square-foot (110 square-meter) home could cost $740,000 or more – compared to $80,000 to $180,000 in Chiang Mai. A 2023 survey by private education company New Oriental found many Chinese families choose Thailand to educate their children, where tuition and cost of living are lower than in Singapore and Japan. Local losses Thai law restricts foreign condominium ownership to 49% of total units and bars foreigners from owning land or houses. Yet Chinese investors have found creative ways around these restrictions, often using Thai nominees to hold their businesses. 'These practices not only circumvent the law but could affect the country’s economic system and security in the long term,' said Naret, who rents apartments in Hang Dong. 'Chinese investors often operate through informal channels, avoiding official registration while maintaining significant control over properties.' Local real estate professionals have experienced the change, according to agent Hathairat Polnirun, 38. 'The Chinese real estate system differs greatly from Thailand’s,' she told BenarNews. 'In Thailand, sellers pay commissions of 3% to 5%, while in the Chinese system, buyers pay 10% or more, making it impossible for Thai agents to compete when selling to Chinese clients.' This occurs when buyers, sellers and brokers negotiate additional terms beyond those stipulated by law, she said. 'Recently, Chinese operators have begun establishing their own real estate companies directly, though often using Thai names as cover,' Hathairat said. 'If large Chinese real estate companies with substantial capital enter this market, small agencies – both Thai and Chinese – won’t survive.' In September, a small survey by a local think-tank, The Glocal, reported on concerns among a group of Thai residents. Of the 30 respondents between the ages of 19 and 62, 60% said Chinese investment significantly impacted local businesses. The real estate sector topped concerns at 40%, followed by tourism (20%) and retail (16.7%). Notably, 17 supported increased regulation of Chinese investment. In neighborhoods with high Chinese concentration, cultural friction is becoming more apparent. 'Their behavior creates discomfort for Chiang Mai and Thai people, who have a culture of politeness, humility, and mutual respect,' Naret said, citing issues from loud conversations to traffic law violations to disregard for customs. Stricter control A legal analyst has advocated for comprehensive oversight. Tossapon Tassanapan, an associated professor at Chiang Mai University’s Faculty of Law, called for a thorough investigation of business practices. 'We must examine all aspects, from entry permits to financial transactions,' he said. 'While general laws don’t specifically target Chinese investment, as we must treat all foreigners equally, we need to investigate whether their activities fall into gray areas, whether officials are complicit and whether there are connections to money laundering or other criminal activities.' The solution, Tossapon said, involves rigorous enforcement of existing laws. 'We need to check everything – from tourist visas being used for business purposes to tax payments and financial trails. If these businesses can operate, it likely indicates either official complicity or negligence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzjz6UQInD2wU	2024-11-20T16:24:54-08:00	
What The Arakan Army’s Rise Means For The Rohingya – Analysis	By Dr. Azeem Ibrahim The Arakan Army is emerging as the dominant force in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, a dramatic shift that could redefine the region’s political landscape. Over the past year, this group has not only entrenched itself militarily, but it has also sought to carve out a role as a governing authority. This transformation, while significant, brings both opportunities and challenges for Rakhine’s people, including the long-persecuted Rohingya minority. The Arakan Army’s military achievements are striking. By mid-October, it had established control over an estimated two-thirds of Rakhine State, including critical areas such as the state capital Sittwe, the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone and the Myanmar military’s strategically important Western Command base. This consolidation is underpinned by the creation of nine military zones across the state and the deployment of thousands of troops in allied territories. This rise from obscurity is remarkable. Founded in 2009 with just 26 members, the Arakan Army now fields a force of about 40,000 troops. Its rapid growth reflects both its military prowess and its ability to position itself as a credible alternative to Myanmar’s junta. Yet, despite its successes on the battlefield, it faces significant governance challenges. The International Crisis Group notes that, while the Arakan Army has established de facto control over much of Rakhine, it lacks the capacity to address the state’s fundamental socioeconomic needs. The coming years will test whether it can translate its military dominance into effective governance. The Arakan Army has already taken steps toward governance. Even before the 2021 coup, it managed administrative and judiciary services in parts of Rakhine. Since gaining more territory, it has sought to establish legitimacy by engaging with diverse communities. For instance, it invited Rohingya representatives into its governance mechanisms and played a leading role in post-Cyclone Mocha recovery efforts in May 2023. These moves are critical for a state as fragmented as Rakhine, where ethnic and communal divisions run deep. By fostering inclusion, the Arakan Army has an opportunity to unify Rakhine’s communities and build a foundation for sustainable governance. However, its track record is mixed. In April and May, during the final stages of its offensive against junta forces, the group committed atrocities against civilians, including the shelling, looting and burning of Rohingya neighborhoods in Buthidaung Township. These actions, which forced thousands to flee, underscore the tension between its aspirations and its actions on the ground. The rise of the Arakan Army also changes the calculus for the Rohingya, who have historically borne the brunt of Myanmar’s ethnic strife. Its inclusive overtures, such as engaging Rohingya representatives, are promising. However, these gestures must be accompanied by genuine efforts to protect Rohingya communities and ensure their rights. The group’s actions during the Buthidaung offensive highlight the precarious position of the Rohingya. While the Arakan Army may view the Rohingya as a potential constituency, its willingness to commit violence against them suggests that ethnic hierarchies and power struggles still dominate Rakhine’s politics. For the Rohingya, the group’s rise presents both risks and opportunities. On the one hand, its dominance could offer a respite from the systematic persecution they have faced under the junta. On the other hand, its ability to govern inclusively and protect minority rights remains unproven. As the Arakan Army transitions from a rebel force to a governing authority, it will face immense challenges. Rakhine is one of Myanmar’s poorest states, with high levels of poverty, displacement and ethnic tension. Addressing these issues requires more than military strength; it demands a commitment to inclusive governance, economic development and reconciliation. The group’s relationship with the Rohingya will be a litmus test for its governance. If it can protect Rohingya communities, integrate them into its governance structures and address their grievances, it could pave the way for a more stable and inclusive Rakhine. However, continued violence and exclusion will only deepen the state’s divisions. The international community has a role to play in shaping Rakhine’s future. Diplomatic engagement with the Arakan Army should prioritize the protection of minority rights and the establishment of inclusive governance. Humanitarian assistance should be directed toward addressing the state’s urgent socioeconomic needs, particularly in Rohingya communities. At the same time, accountability for human rights abuses must remain a priority. Its actions in Buthidaung demonstrate the risks of unchecked power. Holding all actors accountable, including the Arakan Army, is essential for building a foundation of trust and justice in Rakhine. The group’s rise marks a new chapter in Rakhine’s troubled history. Its military dominance offers an opportunity to break free from decades of junta rule, but its ability to govern inclusively and address the state’s deep-seated challenges remains uncertain. For the Rohingya, its ascent is a double-edged sword, offering hope for change but also exposing them to new risks. The road ahead for the Arakan Army and Rakhine is fraught with challenges. Success will depend on the group’s willingness to transcend its origins as a rebel force and embrace its responsibilities as a governing authority. For the sake of Rakhine’s diverse communities, including the Rohingya, this transition cannot come soon enough.

Indo-Pacific Commander Gives Unvarnished View Of Situation In Reg...	By Jim Garamone Any discussion of the Indo-Pacific region must start with China as a rising global power, and Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo gave a snapshot of what military competition with China would look like for the United States. Paparo, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, spoke to Michael O'Hanlon and Lynn Kuok at the Brookings Institution, yesterday. The admiral also answered questions about North Korea and India during the wide-ranging discussion at the Washington think tank. China is demonstrating and working on improving its power. This past summer, China held exercises that covered a large geographical area and one that demonstrated joint capabilities, and the admiral followed them closely. 'It was the 'jointest' operations for air, missile, maritime power that I'd seen over an entire career of being an observer,' Paparo said. On one day, he noted, the Chinese had 152 vessels at sea, including three quarters of their amphibious force. He said the People's Republic of China exercised 43 amphibious brigades to include rehearsal in breaching obstacles and military operations in urban terrain. 'We saw also two demonstrations of military power in response to the Taiwan inauguration on May 20, and then, once again, on 1010 [October 10th] — Taiwan National Day, as it's so called,' he said. 'This was the largest rehearsal we've seen,' he said. It demonstrated the upward trajectory of PLA modernization. The Chinese military also exercised with Russian air and maritime forces this summer in the Bering Sea. That exercise included ships and long-range aviation, he said. China is not the only competitor in the region, and Paparo specifically talked about the threat North Korea poses to the region and beyond. He pointed to the recent test of its largest ballistic missile this past week. That missile 'reached an apogee of over 7,000 kilometers, portending a capability that will have the ability to range the entire continental United States,' he said. He added that the North Koreans have not demonstrated the capability of weaponizing the missile 'but we just see continued testing towards that.' But China is the main competitor in the region and Paparo was grilled on Chinese capabilities and intentions. He was specifically asked about the Chinese initiative to build a military that can challenge the United States by the centennial of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027. 'The closer we get to 2027 the less relevant the date becomes,' he said. He does not see that as the date the Chinese would invade Taiwan. 'I think it is a worthy benchmark to say, we had better pay close attention to this,' the admiral said. Paparo has the responsibility under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to be ready for any change to the status quo. 'I am responsible for being ready every single day,' he said. The United States has worldwide commitments and there are competing requirements for resources and systems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel are depleting stocks the Indo-Pacific might need, Paparo said. He said that until this year the effect on his command by the delivery of systems to Ukraine and Israel was negligible. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into stocks, … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he said. These high-end stocks are crucial in the Indo-Pacific, he said. 'It imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' Paparo said. Paparo also addressed the growing U.S. military partnership with India. The two countries are cooperating across a range of areas including undersea domain awareness, joint production and more. 'We see this security partnership growing year by year,' he said. 'India cherishes its history in the non-aligned movement. So those who aspire to an alliance with India, I think, don't hold your breath. We're not holding our breath either.' But that does not temper U.S. moves to a deeper partnership and deeper friendship with India. China also competes with India. 'There have been flash points of tension at sea and along its border, and those are opportunities for our cooperation as well,' the admiral said. India has ties with Russia, who supplied much of the weapons systems India used since the 1960s. 'I believe that those partnerships will likely fade over time as the partnership between the United States and India grows, but we cannot be complacent about it,' he said. 'But we have many, many mutual interests, and we've got to — both of us — keep our foot on the accelerator.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzvjtOoivvswD	2024-11-20T16:18:08-08:00	
Austin Announces Additional Security Assistance For Ukraine	By Joseph Clark The U.S. is sending a new round of military assistance, valued at up to $275 million to Ukraine, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said today. The package includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, mortar and artillery rounds and unmanned aerial systems to meet critical battlefield needs as Russia's war of aggression surpasses 1,000 days. In previewing the White House announcement of the latest round of assistance, Austin underscored the importance of continuing to support Ukraine. 'What we learned early on is that Ukraine matters and not just to Ukraine, and not just to Europe,' Austin said. 'It matters to the world. 'We shouldn't have any situation where someone can wake up one day and attack its neighbor and change the borders and annex its neighbor's property,' he said. 'That is just not the world that any of us want to live in.' The secretary added that the U.S.-led efforts to rally global allies and partners in support of Ukraine continue to be effective in countering Russia's onslaught. 'The largest military in Europe invaded its neighbor, who had a much smaller inventory, much less capability, and 1,000 days later they've yet to be successful,' he said. 'This war has gone on for 1,000 days and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has failed in every case to achieve any sort of strategic objective.' The latest round of assistance marks the 70th drawdown of military equipment for Ukraine from DOD inventories since August 2021. It follows President Joe Biden's commitment in September to surge the more than $5 billion in remaining presidential drawdown authority funds authorized by Congress. The assistance also comes with new urgency as Russia leans on thousands of North Korean troops to fill out its ranks. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier this week that nearly 11,000 North Korean troops have moved into Russia's Kursk Region. She said the Pentagon had not confirmed reports that the North Koreans had begun to engage in combat operations but said, 'They're moving into Kursk for a reason.' 'We have every expectation that they would be engaged in combat operations,' Singh said. Austin announced a new round of assistance from Vientiane, Laos, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member bloc of Southeast Asian nations. During the two-day series of engagements, Austin will meet with a range of regional allies and partners informally during the meeting and reaffirm the United States' commitment to regional security. Following the first round of discussions today, Austin announced that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. Tomorrow, Austin is expected to announce the first-ever Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. 'It's great to be back at the ADMM-Plus for my fourth time as secretary,' he said. 'Being here is a priority and a sign of strong support for ASEAN's central role in regional security. Engagement with ASEAN is focused on practical cooperation and mutual respect, and that includes training the next generation of leaders and tackling emerging challenges and deepening maritime cooperation.' Austin proposed a meeting with People's Republic of China's Minister of National Defense Dong Jun, who's also a member of ADMM-Plus. The secretary has continued to advocate for open lines of military-to-military communication between the U.S. and China but said today that his Chinese counterpart chose not to meet during this week's forum. 'The PRC decision is a setback for the whole region,' he said. 'As I've said consistently, the right time to meet is any time.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzumYJY-jPWxA	2024-11-20T16:13:29-08:00	
US Vetoes UN Resolution Calling For Ceasefire In Gaza And Release...	By Ephrem Kossaify The US on Wednesday used the power of veto it holds as one of the five permanent member of the UN Security Council to block a resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire' in Gaza and 'the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The resolution was put forward by the 10 elected, non-permanent members of the council. The US was the only one of the 15 members not to vote in favor of it. The text of the resolution also called for the 'safe and unhindered entry of humanitarian assistance at scale' to Gaza, including besieged areas in the north of the territory, and denounced any attempt to deliberately starve the population there. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October last year, and the UN says that in excess of 70 percent of the verified deaths were among women and children. More than 130,000 people have been injured. The UN believes these figures to be an underestimate, given that scores of bodies are thought to be buried under the rubble of destroyed or damaged buildings. The war has also displaced almost the entire population of the enclave, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe. On Monday, the UN’s Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices presented a report to the General Assembly in which it said the methods of warfare employed by Israel in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a weapon, the mass civilian casualties and the life-threatening conditions deliberately inflicted on Palestinians, are consistent with the characteristics of genocide. After the Security Council failed to adopt the resolution on Wednesday, Majed Bamya, the Palestinian deputy ambassador to the UN, told its members that they were witnessing an attempt 'to annihilate a nation' and yet the 'very tools designed to respond (to this are) not being used.' He added: 'Maybe for some we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin color, but we are humans and we should be treated as such. 'Is there a UN Charter for Israel that is different from the charter you all have? Is there an international law for them? An international law for us? Do they have the right to kill and the only right we have is to die? 'What more can (Israel) do for this council to act under Chapter 7? Or will this council be the last place on earth that cannot recognize a threat to peace when they see it?' Chapter 7 of the UN Charter relates to action that can be taken by member states in response to threats to peace and acts of aggression. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told council members: 'Today, a shameful attempt to abandon our kidnapped men and women by the UN was prevented. Thanks to the US, we stood firm with our position that there will be no ceasefire without the release of the hostages. We will continue in this struggle until everyone returns home.' Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador, said that an unconditional ceasefire would mean acceptance by the Security Council of Hamas remaining in power in Gaza. 'The United States will never accept this,' he added. 'Rather than adopting a resolution that emboldens Hamas, let’s instead demand Hamas implement Resolution 2735 without further condition or delay. 'Let’s continue to ensure Israel facilitates additional humanitarian aid into Gaza, and let's work to bring a durable end to the suffering and misery of Hamas’ many victims.' Security Council Resolution 2735, which was adopted in June, calls on Hamas to accept a proposed hostage and ceasefire agreement with Israel. British envoy Barbara Woodward, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the council this month, expressed regret over the failure of the council to adopt the resolution but vowed to 'keep striving, alongside our partners, to bring this war to a close.' She said: 'The deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic and unacceptable. All of Gaza is at risk of famine, and in some areas this is likely to be imminent. Yet the aid reaching civilians remains entirely insufficient to mitigate this unfolding disaster. 'The unthinkable hardship that civilians are already facing in Gaza is set to get even worse as winter approaches.' Woodward urged Israeli authorities to take 'urgent action to alleviate this crisis. International humanitarian law must be respected by all sides.' China’s ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, said that even with the imminent threat of famine in Gaza, 'the United States always seems to be able to find a justification to defend Israel.' It is a stance that represents a distortion of international humanitarian law, he added. 'People keep learning something new they never knew before was possible, and how low one can stoop. No wonder people feel angry,' said Fu. 'People’s indignation also stems from the fact that the continued supply of weapons from the US (to Israel) has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long, causing so many casualties and so much destruction.' He added: 'All hostages must be released. An immediate and unconditional ceasefire must be established. Both are important factors. There should be no conditionality. They cannot be linked to each other because facts have shown that Israel’s military operations in Gaza have long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages. 'Insistence on setting a precondition for ceasefire is tantamount to giving the green light to continuing the war and condoning the continued killing.' The Algerian ambassador, Amar Bendjama, told the council after the vote: 'Today’s message is clear. 'To the Israeli occupying power: You may continue your genocide and collective punishment of the Palestinian people with complete impunity. In this chamber, you enjoy immunity. 'To the Palestinian people: While the majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.' Nicolas de Riviere, France’s permanent representative to the UN, lamented the latest failure by the council to help bring an end to the war. 'France voted in favor of this resolution and deeply regrets that the (Security Council) remains unable to speak with one voice on the situation in the Middle East.' The Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, directly addressed his US counterpart and accused him of being responsible for the deaths 'of tens of thousands of innocent civilians (and) the suffering of hostages and illegally detained Palestinians.' He added: 'It was very interesting to hear the American representative today, in the wake of the vote, say that the resolution does not contain provisions on the release of hostages. Well, it does contain such a provision. Perhaps the US representative should read through the resolution before voting against it.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-20T16:07:21-08:00	
Jimmy Lai Takes The Stand In Yearslong Hong Kong National Securit...	By Daniel Payne Catholic human rights activist Jimmy Lai on Wednesday took the stand in his national security trial in Hong Kong, arguing in his own defense as he faces life in prison over allegations of sedition against the communist Chinese government. Lai, 76, was first arrested in August 2020 under China’s newly instituted Hong Kong national security law. He has faced multiple trials since his arrest and has been convicted on multiple charges of unlawful assembly and fraud. Advocates have argued that the charges are politically motivated. Lai, through several media enterprises including the long-running Apple Daily newspaper, has for years been a vocal pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong media, with Apple Daily itself encouraging citizens to participate in numerous pro-democracy demonstrations over the years. Chinese Communist Party officials, meanwhile, allege that Lai has engaged in what they claim is seditious activism, in part by allegedly advocating for Hong Kong’s independence from mainland China. At his trial on Wednesday, Lai denied allegations of sedition. 'All I was doing was carrying a torch to the reality,' he told the court of his publishing activities. 'The more information you have, the more you’re in the know, the more you are free,' he said. The publisher also denied that he had ordered the Apple Daily to continue as usual after his arrest. 'I had written to them, asking them not to take risks,' he said. The activist further disputed that he had colluded with the U.S. government in 2019 when meeting with then-Vice President Mike Pence. 'I would not dare to ask the vice president to do anything,' he said. 'I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me.' Wednesday’s trial comes after the Tuesday sentencing of 45 other Hong Kong democracy activists, all of whom received stretches of up to 10 years in prison under the national security law. Lai is a Catholic. He converted to Catholicism in 1997 and was received into the Church by Cardinal Joseph Zen. The cardinal was present at the trial on Wednesday, sitting with Lai’s family members, according to the Associated Press. His yearslong imprisonment has drawn international rebuke, including from supporters in the United States. Last December the Congressional Executive Commission on China urged the U.S. government to sanction Hong Kong prosecutors and judges if they fail to release Lai. The trial 'is a political prosecution plain and simple and another sad example of the Hong Kong government’s increasingly repressive policies,' the commission said. Father Robert Sirico, a Catholic priest and founder of the Michigan-based Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, told CNA in December 2023 that he '[doesn’t] have any hope' that the Chinese Communist Party will let Lai walk free. 'I want to be hopeful. I love the man,' Sirico said. 'I have a deep respect for him. I’m inspired by his bravery. But I know what he’s up against.' More recently, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in a report that the Chinese government should 'release Mr. Lai immediately.' The working group said the government should mount a 'full and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Lai and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of his rights.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-20T16:03:27-08:00	
Russia Says Ukraine Used ATACMS Against Military Target In Bryans...	By Merhat Sharipzhan (RFE/RL) -- The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on November 19 that Ukraine used six U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles in its attack on the Bryansk region overnight, claiming Russian forces managed to shoot down five of the missiles and damage one. According to the ministry, fragments from the damaged ATACMS fell on a military target, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. The ministry also said there were no casualties. Hours earlier, the Russian RBK news agency quoted an informed source within Ukraine's military as saying Kyiv had used ATACMS missiles for the first time, targeting an object in the city of Karachev in Russia's southwestern Bryansk region, successfully damaging the facility. The timing of this operation, coinciding with the 1,000th day of Russia's invasion, carries symbolic weight. By demonstrating its capacity to retaliate with precision and range, observers believe Ukraine seeks to shift the strategic calculus of the war, showing Russian territory is not immune from direct attacks. The same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an updated nuclear doctrine. This revision allows for the consideration of nuclear weapons use if Russia faces a conventional missile assault supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine now includes attacks with conventional missiles, drones, or other aircraft as potential triggers for a nuclear response. Additionally, any aggression against Russia by a state allied with a nuclear power will be viewed as aggression by the entire coalition. Ukrainians awoke on November 19 to news of yet another deadly Russian drone strike on a residential building. Ukrainian authorities said that six people were killed, including one child, in the early morning attack that hit a five-story building in the city of Hlukhiv, in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region. Twelve people were injured, two of them children, and one section of the building collapsed. Rescue workers were on the scene and officials expressed fears that the casualty count could rise. Just two days earlier, Russian forces targeted an apartment building in the regional capital, Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring more than 50. The Sumy region, which borders Russia, has been a frequent target of artillery and drone strikes, with attacks intensifying in recent months. Local authorities in Sumy have ordered the evacuation of 23 towns and villages, affecting around 6,000 people, as the region remains under near-constant threat. Russia's Defense Ministry continues to claim that it targets only military facilities, yet reports from Ukrainian officials and independent media document widespread civilian casualties and destruction of nonmilitary infrastructure. Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, has evolved into a prolonged conflict with significant losses on both sides. For Ukraine, the war has meant widespread destruction, over 20,000 civilian deaths according to international estimates, and millions displaced. For Russia, the conflict has brought economic isolation, military losses, and growing internal dissent. The use of ATACMS by Ukraine would reflect both the maturation of its military strategy and the increasing support from Western allies, who have progressively provided more advanced weaponry to counter Russian aggression. However, it also raises questions about the potential for further escalation, as attacks on Russian soil may provoke a harsher response from Moscow.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8loRK3rhV9T	2024-11-19T08:15:12-08:00	
Europe’s Five Big Powers Commit To Ukraine Regardless Of US Polic...	By Claudia Ciobanu Foreign ministers of the five biggest powers in Europe together with the incoming top EU diplomat and host Poland held talks in Warsaw on Tuesday to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression. 'We were in agreement that imposing on Ukraine peace recipes contrary to its interests or unacceptable socially would have a negative impact on the stability of the country,' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said after the meeting of Weimar Triangle foreign ministers (Germany, France and Poland) plus Italy, Spain and the UK. 'Any scenarios for finishing the war and putting an end to Russian aggression must be worked out in close cooperation with the Ukrainian government,' Sikorski added. The meeting was called to allay fears that Ukraine would be sidelined once the newly elected US president Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has repeatedly talked about bringing peace 'in 24 hours' by imposing a solution that would likely be heavily weighted towards Russia. Jitters were also caused by the decision of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to discuss the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a one-on-one call last week, the first since the full-scale invasion began. That call has been criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, among others. Sikorski was joined in Warsaw by the foreign ministers of Germany (Annalena Baerbock), France (Jean-Noel Barrot), Italy (Antonio Tajani) as well as Kaja Kallas, the future EU high representative for foreign affairs. The foreign ministers of Spain and the UK took part in the talks remotely. Explaining the reasons for organising the meeting, Sikorski said it was prompted by the weekend’s major attack on Ukraine, the largest since last year, as well as by the US presidential election. The meeting in Warsaw also served as an attempt by Poland to preserve its key role in European policymaking on Ukraine after apparently being snubbed last month by Berlin when it held talks on Ukraine with the US, UK and France but not Poland. It was also an opportunity for Sikorski to score a few domestic points ahead of his party’s primary election later this week to choose its presidential candidate for next year. German Foreign Minister Baerbock spoke about the importance of not 'having any breaks in securing the peace in Europe' in the context of uncertainties connected to the election of Trump as the next president of the US. EU countries, she said, 'must strengthen the European pillar of NATO' and 'invest significantly more than 2 per cent of GDP in defence'. She also warned against 'self-fulfilling prophecies', implying that it was too early to tell what a future US administration would do in relation to the war and US financial involvement in European defence. All the foreign ministers were careful to highlight the importance of cooperation with the US for ensuring peace in Europe, regardless of who holds the reins of power in Washington. 'It’s only by having strong transatlantic ties that we can counter the rising threats from Russia and other countries,' Sikorski said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnxnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-19T08:03:57-08:00	
Russia Broadens Conditions For Using Nuclear Weapons	As the war in Ukraine entered its 1,000th day Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine stating that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power is considered a joint attack and could trigger a nuclear response. The proclamation came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons from the U.S. to attack military targets in Russia. When Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if the revised doctrine was issued in response to the U.S. authorization, he said it was put forth 'in a timely manner' and that Putin wanted it updated to be 'in line with the current situation,' the Associated Press reported. The doctrine states nuclear weapons could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. It says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It doesn’t specify whether such an attack would definitely be met with a nuclear response. Peskov the aim of the updated policy was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. It also states that Russia could use nuclear weapons if another country attacks ally Belarus. 1,000 days of fighting Both Russia and Ukraine issued statements about the 1,000th day of the war, both vowing that they would continue fighting against each other. The Kremlin said Western support for Kyiv would have no impact on the military campaign. 'The military operation against Kyiv continues,' Peskov said, adding that Western aid 'cannot affect the outcome of our operation. It continues, and will be completed.' Ukraine, meanwhile, said it would continue to resist the Russian invasion. 'Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. Attack on Russian weapons depot There was no word if long-range U.S. weapons were used in Ukraine’s strike against a large weapons depot near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region more than 110 miles from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reported that Ukraine often uses domestically produced drones to hit targets deep inside Russia, and in an announcement on Tuesday, the military did not specify which weapons had been used for the strike. 'The destruction of ammunition depots will continue for the army of the Russian occupiers in order to stop the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian military said on the Telegram messaging app. An overnight Russian drone attack in the northeastern Sumy region killed eight people, including one child, Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. The attack on a residential building in the border town of Hlukhiv also wounded 12 people, including two children, Ukraine's national police force said on Telegram. Two high-rise buildings and a hospital were damaged, and more people could be in the rubble. Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday it shot down 51 out of 87 drones launched by Russia overnight. Tear gas detected near front line Also on Tuesday, Ukraine urged action after the international chemical weapons watchdog said banned CS riot control gas, also known as tear gas, had been found in Ukrainian soil samples from the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia has not reacted to the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which did not assign blame for the chemical. The Chemical Weapons Convention strictly bans the use of riot control agents including CS outside riot control situations when it is used as 'a method of warfare,' Agence France-Presse reported. CS gas causes irritation to the lungs, skin and eyes. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in the conflict, and Ukraine’s Western allies have claimed Moscow has employed banned weapons. 'Russia's use of banned chemicals on the battlefield once again demonstrates Russia's chronic disregard for international law,' a statement from Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. OPCW stressed however that the report did 'not seek to identify the source or origin of the toxic chemical.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8YXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-19T08:00:11-08:00

Eni Launches New Supercomputer HPC6 That Ranks No.5. In The TOP50...	Eni announced Tuesday the completion and launch of a new supercomputing system (High Performance Computing - HPC) HPC6. HPC6 provides a significant increase in computational powerto a peak of 606 PFlop/s, or over 600 quadrillion mathematical operations per second.

United States: Fighting To The Last Ukrainian – OpEd	When Joe Biden leaves office, he will leave as the president with a record that places him amongst the most militaristic of American leaders with responsibility for inflicting suffering and bringing death to possibly the largest number of innocent civilian casualties in this modern era. This is as a result of the wars taking place during his watch in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere. This record will become worse if the bleak outcome of his latest foreign policy decision becomes reality. In what independent observers view as a further attempt by Biden to continue and escalate the war in Ukraine, the lame duck president has authorised Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia. In the US, the following response by Congress representative Marjorie Greene has received 2 million views on X and 47,000 likes 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of U.S. long range missiles into Russia. 'The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' -- Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024 This decision, allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMs) with their superior range of up to four times more than the current missiles supplied to Ukraine for attacks inside Russia, has been justified with the most flimsy of excuses. Quoting American officials reported to be ‘knowledgeable’ about the matter but obviously designated by the White House to provide justification propaganda, the major policy change is being pitched by western media to the world as a response to North Korean troops reported to be positioned along Ukraine’s northern border. The explanation rings hollow. Since the war began, Russia has not called upon or relied on any non-Russian troops to fight its war. At this late stage when victory appears to be in sight, Putin will want for it to enter into the history books as an exclusive and singlehanded Russian victory against the combined forces of the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and other allies of the West. It will be foolish and extremely unlikely for Putin to welcome any participation from Russia’s allies in the current battlefield and military endgame in Ukraine. As to the presence of North Koreans in Ukraine, it is possible that there is a small number of them at the frontline. However, South Korea, which has the best intelligence on North Korea, has not been able to confirm that North Korean troops are now engaged in combat as reported by some US and Ukraine officials. Explaining Biden's Last War Hurrah What explains Biden’s last hurrah in US foreign policy is not difficult to understand. Firstly, he is giving way to the late ditch effort by the military-industrial (MIC) and deep state complexes that are key players of US domestic and foreign policy to obstruct the incoming president, Donald Trump, in his plan to end the war. Such a move which Trump has promised to take place within 24 hours after his assumption of office, would obviously adversely impact the windfall profits that the war in Ukraine has generated for the MIC complex. Biden had earlier resisted pressure from Zelensky and Western supporters to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia for fear that this escalation could draw the US and NATO into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. His change of mind at this late hour can also be interpreted in other ways besides his finally giving in to the military and industrial forces working behind the political scene in Washington and Kyiv. Foremost appears to be his personal animosity towards Trump who he condemned in a recent election campaign rally as a threat to democracy and someone that needed to 'be locked up'. Related to that animosity may also be a quest for retaliation against his nemesis fuelled by Kamala Harris’s election loss which many Democrat leaders attribute to Biden’s late withdrawal from the presidential race. Failure by Trump as the new president to stop the war as promised would put Biden’s foreign policy legacy of support for Ukraine in a better light and make Trump the loser in the American history books which Biden is now focused on influencing and rewriting. Earlier in his youth, Biden had shown promise of being anti-war in his sentiment. Like earlier presidents - George W. Bush and Bill Clinton - he was successful in avoiding the draft. According to a report by the US Army Times newspaper which serves active, reserve, national guard and retired US army personne, and analysed the draft dodging strategies of various presidents: 'Biden not only received deferments for his undergraduate days at the University of Delaware, but for three years of law school at Syracuse University. When his education deferments expired in 1968, Biden requested a deferment based on the fact he had asthma as a teenager. He did this in spite of the fact that, according to his own book, he was a star athlete in high school and in college played intramural sports and was a lifeguard in the summer.' -- Dodging and deferring: Trump wasn’t the only POTUS to avoid the draft The report also noted that as soon as he received his asthma deferment, Biden ran for local office and within two years after he would have been discharged from the Army, assuming he was not wounded or killed, he was elected to the Senate. As an outgoing president, Biden clearly has embellished his war record with this latest variant of US foreign policy - that is, of fighting to the last Ukrainian. This recalibration of US foreign policy is also being applied to hotspots such as Gaza and Lebanon in the Middle East and Korea and Taiwan in Asia. Fighting to the last Palestinian, Korean or Taiwanese can be expected as the US continues with its efforts to maintain geo-political dominance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn1sgBTt-8yVC	2024-11-19T07:51:37-08:00	
Trump Kept World Peace, And He’ll Do it Again – OpEd	Amidst the challenges of increasing geopolitical conflicts worldwide, America requires a leader possessing determination, foresight, and a track record of rebuilding stability domestically and internationally. Donald Trump embodies these qualities. His prioritisation of interests through the 'America First' approach alongside a fresh new position on international affairs, most importantly his dovish mantra and rejecting warmongering tendencies, offer a roadmap for economic revitalization within the U.S. and fostering a safer world. Trump didn't just impact the US, he also made his mark on the stage by standing up to countries threatening global and regional stability while working towards peace agreements. Critics of Trump's 'America First' ideology wrongly interpret it as isolationism when, in reality, his focus was on prioritizing America's military interests without disregarding its allies' well-being.He revamped trade deals such as NAFTA (replaced by the USMCA) to enhance protection, for workers and industries while safeguarding intellectual property rights. America fought and won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and established the rules-based order that preserved global stability. This long peace comes with a cost, and all Trump wants is for others to pay their equal burden and fair share for world peace. Trump called on NATO partners to fulfill their defense spending promises so that America's allies also took part in safeguarding security. This action aimed to redistribute responsibilities by reducing the U.S.' heavy burden of NATO defense duties and decreasing its dependence on countries for assistance. Trump's strategies have clearly demonstrated that America's economic strength is pivotal for global well-being. His stances on taxes, commerce, and energy self-sufficiency provide a groundbreaking positive foundation for future positive changes. Trump's tax reductions for corporations prompted investments in manufacturing, and his energy strategies turned the United States into a powerhouse in the energy sector, resulting in job security for workers in energy-intensive sectors and potential economic stability worldwide. Trump's initiatives extended beyond tax reductions; they aim to undo years of offshoring practices and enhance infrastructure while securing energy self-sufficiency for the nation's benefit. Trump won the elections with a resounding and thumping voice of the American people's victory in a powerful message of truth and will. The red wave has retaken the Senate and put the House under Republican control, marking a new era of change for the country. Trump's popular vote gain, not seen since Bush Jr., also marks a new era of change. Democrats warned that Trump and the MAGA movement are hijacking democracy. Now, they must acknowledge the truth: the Trump movement, no matter how much it has been panned by many, is a powerful expression of democracy. The red wave and Donald J. Trump's victory marked the greatest political comeback in history, symbolizing the advent of the prospects of a new world peace and an end to global conflicts. He won more votes with key demographic groups than last time, including Hispanic Americans and younger voters, compared to Harris, who did poorer than Biden with women, urban voters, younger voters, and Hispanics. Sixty percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, further worsened by the soaring inflation. Trump is now seen as the champion of the working class. Why Trump Has Always Been the Clear Choice The economy was booming under the first Trump administration with his low tax and low regulations mantra, and a second Trump administration will see bigger tax cuts that will boost domestic production and create more high paying jobs. In his first four years, stock markets and 401(k) were high. Businesses were easier to form, and jobs were returning. Inflation was almost at its lowest, and the sense of economic optimism and unity from both sides of the aisle was at its highest.Trump saved tens of millions of lives worldwide with Operation Warp Speed, in getting the vaccines ready in record time. Trump helped America build its strongest economy in history. Median household incomes rose to their highest level ever in 2019, while the poverty rate hit an all-time low. Under the Trump Administration, more Americans were employed than ever before, numbered at 160 million, and the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans without a high-school diploma all hit record lows, while the Trump 'Blue-Collar Boom' saw wages grow faster for workers than for managers or supervisors. Trump signed the largest relief package in American history to protect workers and families from economic devastation during Covid. The American economy surged back to life within months, seeing record growth and job gains. Trump returned law and order to the American people, and would be tough on crime in the new term. He brought the abortion decision back to the states and overturned Roe v Wade, the first in more than five decades. The pro-life stance started a new opening to save the lives of the unborn. Energy independence was achieved, where reliance is no longer on oil-rich countries in the Middle East. Under his new term, America will soon be an energy dominant country, with common sense utilisation of the vast black gold under the feet of Americans and with the 'drill, baby drill' mantra. In Trump 2.0, the fundamental economic problem plaguing the country will be addressed, starting by cutting energy prices in half within his first year. The appointment of three Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of federal judges, that have been confirmed during Trump 1.0 further sealed his legacy. He also oversaw the greatest transformation in the criminal justice reform, a feat where even Obama failed to pass. Border security was among the best in a very long time, and the greatest tax cut since Reagan has enabled manufacturing jobs to return. The military has been rebuilt, and veterans' welfare and support capacity have been prioritized. The Space Force has been created, providing the US with new space dominance for decades to come. When Biden-Harris took over the leadership, the economy got worse. Trump was right when he predicted, way before the 2020 Elections, that if Biden-Harris were to get elected, energy prices and inflation would be through the roof. 65% of Americans cannot afford to own a home, and 800,000 Americans lost their jobs last year. Instead, 1.2 million non-citizens took those jobs. Energy prices and crime were also through the roof. More than ten thousand manufacturing jobs were lost last month alone, just before the elections. Businesses are leaving because of high taxes and high regulations, and with the tariff in place under Trump 2.0, they will be coming back to America, and new manufacturing bases will sprout in America. Under Trump, the stock market and the economy were better off than before Covid era when he left office. He also reviewed and withdrew from global memberships including Paris Climate Accords that are weakening America and putting it at a disadvantage, mostly in constraining America's economic potential through green and carbon obligations. In contrast, other countries are allowed to have bigger leeway. For years,America was seen to be ripped off by foreign powers. While their cars dominate the American market, other countries are not accepting American cars. Trump's tariff will protect American businesses, get other countries to stop their dumping and market distortion that have obliterated American workers' interests, encourage more companies to shift and start their operations in America, and give new tax cuts to American enterprises. Peace Through Strength and New Advent of Global Peace Trump's America First agenda has been panned by the Democrats and the world over, but it brought unconventional approaches and returns to both America and the world through relative peace and stability. The world is safe because of his peace through strength mantra, which deterred aggression and preserved the rules-based order. Under his watch, no major conflicts or wars happened, and he stopped war-mongering neocons. Biden-Harris' Afghanistan withdrawal with the loss of 13 American soldiers and 85 billion dollars of military equipment left behind led to the perception of America's weakness, with negative ripple effects. Despite the casting of Trump as weakening America's global standing via his treatment of allies and withdrawal from multilateralism and globalism, Trump fixed the cancerous plague that has held America back with smart and common sense foreign policy that has benefitted everyday Americans and rebuilding the military with Space Force, taking care of the veterans and regaining America's military strength. Trump never left a vacuum in global dominance, he strengthened the US position through military and economic rebuilding at home. Most importantly, he is not a typical politician who is part of the system that panders to the military-industrial complex, in which the warmongers and hawks have been having a field day enriching themselves from the various global conflicts. Trump is definitely different, and peace and saving lives have always been his priorities. This is evident even now when warmongers have been left out of his new administration, but the outgoing Biden administration continues to be fixated on global conflicts and just recently approved the first use of US-supplied long-range missiles for Ukraine for strikes inside Russia. While Trump intends to prevent WWIII, the current establishment seems not to want to give Trump an easy transition in terms of global peace and stability. They continue to take a conventional approach to dealing with foreign leaders and viewing conflicts through traditional, outdated lenses and archaic foreign policy trappings. Traditional diplomacy typically focuses on ideological alignment or gradual confidence-building measures and friendshoring efforts. Trump's method is more transactional and direct, with 'win-win' outcomes, a focus on transactional diplomacy, and his willingness to challenge traditional norms in U.S. foreign policy. Traditional U.S. peace efforts often emphasized security guarantees or political agreements, but Trump highlighted economic incentives as foundational to long-term peace. Hopes are highest that Trump will follow through on his quest to prevent WWIII, end the Ukraine war and the conflicts in Gaza and West Asia, prevent new conflicts in East Asia and prevent warmongering hawks from dominating defense and foreign policy, which will trap the world into another endless cycle of wars and conflicts. The choice for the 47th President of the United States has always been clear, as proven by the red wave in the elections, and Trump will signal a new era of rejuvenation and global peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnyiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-19T07:50:37-08:00	
The Problem With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – OpEd	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been chosen by president-elect Donald Trump to be Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). From a Catholic perspective, there are serious problems with that choice. First and foremost is Kennedy’s position on abortion. It might be more accurate to say his positions on abortion. For most of his career he has been a staunch supporter of abortion-on-demand, but now he says he favors some restrictions. Kennedy didn’t evolve over the years on this issue. He did so recently when it became apparent that if Trump were to win the election he may land some post in the administration. Being pro-abortion, he obviously reasoned, could be a real problem, especially if he were up for the HHS job. When Kennedy was asked by former ESPN commentator, Sage Steele, whether there should be any limits on abortion, he said no. 'Even if it is full term…I don’t think it’s ever OK…I think we have to leave it with the woman rather than the state.' He didn’t say that ten years ago. He said it in May of this year. It gets worse. Literally three days after the Steele interview, Kennedy saidabortion should be permitted only before viability. There are other issues that should give Catholics pause. In December 2023 he told political commentator Patrick Bet-David that he did not support a ban on 'gender affirming' care for minors. Why? Because he did not 'know enough about it to say that it should be completely illegal,' and he needed 'to look at the data' before making a decision. But guess what? In May he decided he supported a ban on minors receiving 'gender affirming' care. Kennedy not only wants to make marijuana legal nationwide, he wants to legalize some psychedelics. That would presumably include psilocybin (magic mushrooms), the most popular psychedelic in the nation. He believes that there are significant benefits to psychedelics that have not been uncovered because the medical establishment has gone out of its way to prevent that research. Here’s what we know about magic mushrooms. They can cause frightening hallucinations, distorted thinking, impaired concentration, unusual body sensations, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, confusion and emotions ranging from bliss to terror. The fundamental problem with Kennedy is that he lacks a coherent understanding of these issues. He has no overriding philosophical vision. He spent his entire life defending abortion-without-limits, and had no problem justifying puberty blockers, chemical castration and mutilating the genitals of disturbed minors—until he experienced his grand epiphany in May. That must have been quite a month for him. And now he thinks we need to make it easier for Americans to hallucinate. This is Robert F. Kennedy’s vision of health and human services. It’s not ours.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn3aW42jO4oa7	2024-11-19T07:48:29-08:00	
Between Activism And Isolationism: What To Expect From Trump’s Mi...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The not-so-unexpected victory of former president Donald Trump on November 5 has sparked renewed discussion on his foreign policy and how a second term might differ from both his first term and current President Joe Biden’s. This article examines Trump’s potential approach to the Middle East, identifying possible shifts and continuities across key issues shaping the region today. These issues include the Iran-Israel confrontation (centered on the Iranian nuclear program), Arab-Israeli reconciliation (and the future of the Palestinian question), US military presence in Syria and Iraq, and broader efforts to reshape the Middle Eastern order within the context of US-China strategic competition. These topics continue to shape the region’s politics, affecting various state and non-state actors, both regionally and globally. As the dictum goes, 'personnel is policy.' Thus, the scenarios and possibilities discussed here consider the tensions between two core factions within today’s Republican Party: an isolationist faction on the farther right of the party aligned with Trump’s 'America First' vision, and a more activist faction that supports robust American power projection, though not through large-scale ground invasions as seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. These foreign policy strains are not new—they have deep roots within the Republican Party and American politics. For example, as seen with former President George W. Bush’s administration following the 9/11 attacks, domestic or international events can dramatically alter an administration’s course, even if it initially professes significant isolationist leanings. Israel-Iran Confrontation and Iran’s Nuclear Program The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is currently the most pressing regional issue, with a genuine risk of evolving into an all-out, multi-party, multi-front war. Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks and the subsequent Israeli response in Gaza, the conflict has been on a path of incremental escalation, initially by Iran and, more recently, by Israel. Israel has leveraged the multi-front assaults by Iran’s 'Resistance Axis' since October 7 as justification to break the taboo of launching direct attacks on Iranian soil. Much in terms of the trajectory of Iran and Israel’s confrontation depends on the threat perception, risk calculation and strategic objectives of each side. Iran has been in a mostly reactive position since the Israeli attack on Iranian consulate in Damascus in April. Israel has gained strategic initiative over Iran and is the party that would decide whether, when, how, and where to escalate based on what price it is willing to pay for the ends that it defines for itself. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has jubilantly hailed Trump’s return to the White House, Tehran views the prospect with deep wariness. However, much in the US-Israel-Iran relations depends on the direction of Iran’s nuclear program and whether Iran will be willing to negotiate with a Trump administration. Trump has signaled on several occasions that he does not seek regime change in Tehran and that he wants an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Iranian officials seem to cautiously welcome this approach, aiming to avoid the possibility of war with the United States or Israel and to relieve the devastating sanctions placed on them for decades. Iranian Vice-President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif, a primary advocate of the former Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal on Iran’s side, has indicated that Tehran would enter into talks with Trump if it is treated with 'respect.' However, the question remains: What kind of deal would Iran be able to negotiate? Would it be one that focuses solely on Iran’s nuclear program, and if so, how would it differ from the JCPOA? During his previous term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA and issued a twelve-point set of conditions for talks with Iran, which included terminating the military dimension of its nuclear program, allowing rigorous and sudden inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, halting Iran’s ballistic missile program, ceasing support for regional proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, and disarming Iraqi militias and integrating them into Iraq’s security forces. It is unclear whether the Trump team would insist on these conditions this time around. However, if they did, it would place Iran in a serious dilemma. Moreover, Iran’s repeated attempts to assassinate Trump in retaliation for his 2020 order to kill Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani could influence Trump’s personal stance toward Iran, adding another layer of complexity for Tehran. While survival is crucial for the Iranian regime, the form and basis of that survival matter. Without its network of regional militias, ballistic missile capabilities, and a nuclear program under stringent international monitoring, the Islamic Republic would undergo a transformation, appearing significantly weakened to both allies and adversaries. This level of concession could leave Iran vulnerable to external pressures and domestic unrest—the likelihood of which is heightened given the government’s oppressive stance on civil liberties, women’s rights, ethnic minorities, and overall economic mismanagement. Consequently, a deal with Washington along the liens of the 12 points might seem like an act of capitulation for Iran and could prove disastrous, without necessarily guaranteeing the regime’s survival. However, rejecting a deal exposes Iran to the serious risk of escalating Israeli and even US attacks, particularly as its air defenses are now severely compromised following recent Israeli strikes in late October. In short, the Iranian regime is caught between a rock and a hard place. Trump’s policy toward Tehran will also depend on the figures he appoints to key national security and foreign policy roles in institutions like the State Department—especially the person handling the Iran portfolio—the Defense Department, and the National Security Council. Should individuals with strong anti-Islamic Republic views assume these positions, it would be reasonable to expect an aggressive stance from the administration toward Iran. Currently, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is reported to be Trump’s choice to lead the State Department and former State Department Iran envoy Brian Hook is reported to be overseeing the department’s transition. Fox News host Pete Hegseth is Trump’s nominee for Defense Secretary nominee and Congressman Mike Waltz is the nominee for National Security Advisor, while Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is the nominee for US’s UN ambassador role. All these figures are known for tough stances on Iran and strong support for US allies such as Israel. Additionally, Mike Evans, a prominent Evangelical leader and Trump advisor, told Israel’s i24News that president-elect Trump encouraged Israel to target Iran’s energy infrastructure during Biden’s remaining lame-duck period. With Hamas significantly weakened and Hezbollah decapitated, Netanyahu may feel emboldened to launch a comprehensive strike on Iran before or shortly after January 20 to diminish Tehran’s threat to Israel. Overall, while the Trump administration is likely to avoid a direct regime-change policy, it will probably pursue a maximum pressure campaign by imposing new sanctions on key Iranian industries and officials, rigorously enforcing existing sanctions on Iranian oil sales (which have doubled under Biden compared to Trump’s first term), adopting a 'maximum support' approach if domestic unrest occurred in Iran, and potentially backing Israeli strikes on Tehran. The intent would be either to pressure Tehran into a new deal or to punish it severely for refusing one and for its regional behavior. Of Iran’s multi-layered deterrence strategies, only developing a nuclear weapon might shield it against future attacks and possible collapse, given the reduced effectiveness of its Resistance Axis and ballistic missile arsenal. This would certainly depend on Tehran’s threat perception. But with uranium enriched to 60 percent, Iran appears to be now capable of producing weapons-grade, 90-percent-enriched uranium within one to two weeks, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated in July. Despite internal pressure for such a move, whether Tehran will present the world with a nuclear weapon fait accompli—and the timing of such a decision—will be closely monitored by actors in the region and beyond. Taking actual steps toward building a bomb would certainly invite a devastating Israeli (and US) response. And if Tehran manages to secretly build such a bomb, it will prompt even greater sanctions from Washington and its Western, and possibly regional, allies. Abraham Accords 2.0 The Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan were undoubtedly the most prominent foreign policy achievement and legacy of the first Trump administration. Following years of unsuccessful efforts by the Biden administration, a second Trump administration would likely prioritize securing a similar agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. This would be seen as the culmination of the Abraham Accords, regardless of whether it retains the same title. However, there are significant obstacles to such a deal. Ongoing Israeli military operations and its reluctance thus far to agree on a new governing formula for Palestinian areas in Gaza or Palestinian statehood could hinder the likelihood of an Israeli-Saudi agreement. Without meaningful recognition for Palestinians and without a role for the Gulf states and Egypt, in supporting a future for Gaza and other Palestinian territories, the prospects of an expanded Abraham Accords or an Israeli-Saudi deal would face substantial challenges. Israel appears to favor a compartmentalized approach, distinguishing its relations with the Gulf and Saudi Arabia from the Palestinian question. Saudi Arabia, however, seems to prefer a comprehensive approach, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan recently reiterating the need for a recognized Palestinian state as a precondition for any deal with Israel. Given Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in the Arab and Islamic worlds and its guardianship of Islam’s two holiest sites, the kingdom cannot afford to appear as abandoning the Palestinian cause. As demonstrated by the October 7 attack by Hamas, the Palestinian issue and militant groups remain potent forces that could disrupt any Arab-Israeli deal that overlooks them. Overall, warmer relations and a higher degree of trust between the Republicans and Israel suggest that a deal is more likely under a Trump administration if approached strategically. Trump’s personal style of diplomacy and strong connections with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) may aid in this process. If Jared Kushner returns to a central role in Trump’s Middle East policy, the chances of a comprehensive Saudi-Israeli agreement may increase, given his close relationship with MBS and family ties to Trump. Should an Israeli-Saudi deal prove unachievable—mainly due to Israeli inflexibility on the Palestinian issue—a bilateral Saudi-US security agreement might be the most viable alternative, either in Biden’s final weeks or under a future Trump administration. US Military Deployments in Syria and Iraq Another key issue for the incoming Trump administration in the Middle East will be the ongoing presence of US troops in Syria and Iraq. These forces have faced numerous attacks by pro-Iran militias, and their strategic purpose is frequently questioned in Washington. Given Trump’s emphasis on ending 'endless wars' abroad, he may be tempted to bring these troops home. However, such a decision is easier said than done, as their deployment remains crucial to regional stability and US interests. Syria Syria has become a central arena for entangled regional and global rivalries over the past decade. The country is currently divided into three primary zones, each backed by a major regional or global power. The western part of Syria is dominated by Assad, with the support of Iran, its regional proxies, and Russia. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control the northern and northeastern energy-rich areas with the backing of a 900-strong US military deployment. Northwestern and parts of northern Syria are controlled by various, mainly Islamist groups supported by Turkey. Syria continues to be a hub of Iranian regional activity and a transit point for weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has prompted Israeli airstrikes, particularly since the October 7 attacks. Damascus also has an unresolved territorial dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights, which has been under Israeli control since the 1967 War. Syria was a primary base of the Islamic State (ISIS) and has recently witnessed troubling signs of ISIS resurgence, reminiscent of the group’s rise in the early 2010s. The official rationale for the US military presence in Syria is to prevent the re-emergence of ISIS. Complicating matters further, Syria has become a site of ongoing tension between Turkey and Kurds, as Ankara considers the Kurdish elements within the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which it has been battling for nearly four decades. Crafting a policy toward this complex landscape of regional and global interests is understandably challenging. In 2019, Trump ordered a partial withdrawal of US troops from the border areas between Syria and Turkey, enabling Turkey to launch incursions and occupy significant portions of Kurdish-majority areas previously held by the SDF. It remains to be seen whether a future Trump administration would take a similar approach. Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently stated that the president-elect wanted to withdraw the remaining US troops from Syria to avoid them becoming 'cannon fodder' in the event of a regional conflict between the Assad regime and Turkey. While the chances of an all-out war between Assad and Turkey are minimal, a US withdrawal would likely lead to further instability in Syria and result in a loss of critical leverage for the United States in both Syria and the broader region. Although the US military presence in Syria is small, it is strategically vital, yielding significant benefits by monitoring ISIS activity and limiting Iran’s regional expansionist efforts—the latter especially directly bearing on Israel’s security. Pulling out the troops would trigger a bloody struggle by various local and regional contenders for the control; of the SDF territory, sow chaos, and could potentially lead to the escape of hundreds, if not thousands, of captured ISIS elements and their radicalized family members from prisons and camps. Thus, it is not far-fetched to expect that Republican foreign policy segments, more attuned to broader regional geopolitical interests, may push back against Trump’s potential withdrawal and the more isolationist factions within his administration. The outcome of this internal struggle is uncertain, especially given that the composition of the Trump administration is not yet fully known. However, National Security Advisor pick Waltz and State Secretary nominee Rubio on Syria strongly opposed Trump’s troops’ withdrawal from Syria in 2019. Overall, maintaining the partnership with the SDF while addressing Turkish concerns by diversifying the SDF’s composition to include Kurdish and non-Kurdish groups more acceptable to Turkey would better advance the strategic interests of the United States and its allies. Iraq The United States and Iraq continue to share an uneasy relationship more than two decades after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Baath regime and the rise of the current political order in the country. The growing dominance of pro-Iran groups within Baghdad’s state institutions has strained this relationship further. Groups straddling both official Iraqi security and political institutions and the so-called Iran-led Resistance Axis continue to attack US forces in Iraq and Syria as part of Iran’s broader strategy to undermine US regional influence. This has placed Iraq and the United States in a murky dynamic, where they are neither true allies nor adversaries, despite the Strategic Framework Agreement they signed in 2008. Approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, advising Iraqi security forces on the critical mission of ensuring ISIS’s defeat. Iraq’s significance has grown amid the recent regional conflict since the October 7 attacks, as Iran-backed militias have targeted both Israel and US forces—with dozens of attacks on Israel in the past six weeks. These actions contradict Iraq’s official stance, which seeks to avoid becoming entangled in the conflict. Recently, Iraqi and US officials reached an agreement for US forces to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2026, with a small contingent remaining in the Kurdistan Region during the last year of this agreement to support the mission in neighboring Syria. This agreement awaits final approval from the US government. For Iraq, the priority is to see US troops depart and to strengthen economic and bilateral security ties beyond the anti-ISIS global coalition framework. The incoming Trump administration may find it tempting to withdraw US troops from Iraq either prematurely or in accordance with the scheduled plan. Or depending on the course of regional events and Iraq’s behavior in the context of the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, it might decide to keep troops in Iraq. Ongoing attacks on Israel could potentially make Iraq a target for the Israeli military, as has occurred with other members of the Iran-backed axis in Lebanon and Yemen. Washington has reportedly restrained Israel from adding Iraq to its list of targets, though this could change depending on US Middle East policy (under Biden or Trump) or the evolving calculations of Netanyahu’s government and Iran’s broader behavior. Iraq may also face sanctions due to militia activities, the continued smuggling of US-provided dollars to Iran and its proxies, and an Iraqi judicial arrest warrant for Trump following the killing of Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the umbrella group for predominantly Iran-backed factions. The possibility of Washington revoking exemptions that allow Iraq to purchase Iranian natural gas for its power plants is a tangible prospect, especially as part of its anticipated maximum pressure strategy against Iran. Washington’s best course of action regarding Iraq may be to leverage current regional tensions to pressure the Iraqi government toward meaningful security sector reforms. This could involve curbing the influence of Iran-backed armed factions and further integrating the PMF into the state’s military-security structure. The United States could also alternatively maintain a long-term military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan to support the Syria mission, broader regional interests, and the containment of a resurgent jihadi threat. Washington’s fatigue with Iraq should not overshadow prudent policymaking concerning the challenges and opportunities the country presents. The Middle East in a Moment of Global Rivalries The desire to reduce US engagement in the Middle East dates back to former president Richard Nixon’s administration, nearly half a century ago. This aspiration continued under both Trump and Biden, yet the region continues to demand US attention. Although US policymakers have argued for a pivot to East Asia and focusing more energy on Eastern Europe to counter China and Russia, the Middle East remains integral to global rivalries. China has made substantial inroads through economic, energy, and trade partnerships and flexed its diplomatic clout by brokering the 2023 Iran-Saudi deal. The region is also central to global trade routes, as evidenced by initiatives like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to integrate the region’s vast energy resources. From the perspective of some policymakers in Washington, the Abraham Accords and a surprising weakening of Iran and its Axis of Resistance in recent months offer a unique opportunity to reshape the regional order in alignment with US priorities. For Washington to maintain its influence, it would feel compelled to continue strengthening its allies, which necessitates some level of military presence or involvement. A leadership void due to Washington’s disengagement would likely invite interventions by China or Russia, or intensify regional rivalries among players like Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Turkey, and Iran. Actors like Iran tend to design their policies in the region or their support for Russia against Ukraine as part of a broader strategy to erode US influence and challenge the US-dominated global order. Viewing the region through this 'big picture' lens is essential to understanding the broader significance of regional events and the stakes involved. Interpreted cautiously, despite Trump’s professed preference against deploying military power or involvement in global conflicts/crises, the selection of individuals for key foreign policy and national security roles suggests a lean toward a more engaged US presence in the region than retreat. This indicates continuity in the use of American power and influence, support for Israel, and harsher policy toward Iran, much like Trump’s first term. Nevertheless, future US policy could still reflect isolationist tendencies, both due to Trump and the general American public’s hesitation regarding troop deployments and overseas interventions. The future of US policy in the Middle East will likely reflect a struggle between activist and isolationist inclinations within the Trump administration and the Republican foreign policy establishment writ large. Neither side is likely to gain full control, suggesting US Middle East policy will likely experience shifts in both directions. About the author: Mohammed A.

Challenge Before Trump As Russia-China-North Korea Axis Takes Sha...	The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty, or the mutual defence treaty signed between Russia and North Korea in June 2024 in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. Following the signing of a comprehensive defence treaty between Russia and North Korea in June 2024, North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia. Bilateral ties between the two soon developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un needs to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world know that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan expresses concern Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated by the day and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time. During his visit to Ukraine on 16-17 November, Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his counterpart Andrii Sybiha, and expressed grave concerns about the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia in its war against Ukraine and promised Japan’s unwavering stance of being with Ukraine in the conflict, now in its third year. As a quid pro quo, Russia seems to be transferring missile and nuclear technologies to North Korea. Iwaya’s visit symbolised the close relationship between the two countries. Zelenskyy expressed appreciation for the support Japan provided to Ukraine to the tune of $12 billion (1.85 trillion yen). The latest assistance from Japan consisted of electrical equipment items to help Ukrainians through the cold winter months, when power shortages are feared. The items, including 32 generators, were to be given to the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa through the UNDP and the JICA. Ukraine lost about 60 per cent of its power generation capacity due to Russian attacks on infrastructure facilities from March 2024. Iwaya was the first minister of the Ishiba Cabinet to visit Ukraine and the third Jaoanese foreign minister to travel to the country after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. No doubt, Zelenskyy called Japan a true leader in Asia in terms of protecting the rules-based international order as well as international order as well as human lives. Reaction of US State Department The US State Department reacted by saying that North Korea’s involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine causes 'great concern' and 'consternation' for the Indo-Pacific. The State Department statement underscored cooperation with South Korea, Japan and other countries in addressing the issue. The engagement of North Korean troops in combat operations in Russia’s western front-line Kursk region runs risk of the Ukraine war developing into a larger war. The US is working collaboratively with its partners in Japan and South Korea on this. While confirming the North Korean troops already in the combat zone, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Brussels that the deployment calls fir a 'firm' response. The larger concern is that the Russia-North Korea military partnership will have broad security implications for Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the world. South Korea’s Response South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol said that his country would 'implement appropriate effective measures' in response to North Korean troops being deployed to fight for Russia in Ukraine. At the same time, Yoon is making 'diplomatic efforts' with Russia. Yoon appears to be adjusting his position on sending Ukraine weapons in light of Donald Trump being elected US president. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. One other option before Yoon is to maintain 'strategic dialogue' with Beijing even as he called on Beijing to play a responsible role in contributing to stability on the Korean Peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Earlier, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, had confirmed that North Korean troops were deployed to Russia and engaged in combat in Ukraine. This was a clear departure from his earlier announcement of sending lethal weapons to Ukraine even as he weigh what policy response US President-elect Trump would adopt on this issue. Though China has leverage both with Russia and North Korea, there has been a clear reluctance on Beijing’s part to be grouped together with Russia and North Korea. Such a situation poses bigger challenge to other stakeholders to woo China to play its card on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUI9O83651OiB	2024-11-18T17:18:03-08:00	
Ron Paul: If Trump Didn’t Send Musk To Talk With The Iranians…He ...	One of the most encouraging and promising things President-elect Trump said in his post-election acceptance speech was, 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars…' We all understand that campaign promises often have a short shelf life after the election is over, but the Trump campaign’s repeated talk of peace over war at least demonstrates that he finds it a winning point to make to American voters. Will that talk of peace turn into action in the second Trump presidency, especially with the hawks he has named to senior foreign policy positions in his incoming Administration? It is hard to say, but last week’s report that he sent Elon Musk to meet with the Iranian Ambassador to the UN would be a good sign if true. Iran has denied that any such meeting took place, and with rumors swirling of Trump talks with Putin and other world leaders it may just be a media creation. But even if it is not true that Trump sent Musk to meet with the Iranians it would be a good idea to do so. Why Musk? Because Musk is not expected to take on a formal role in the incoming Trump Administration he can be seen as an informal advisor and friend of the President-elect. Plus, as a businessman Elon Musk speaks a different language than government diplomats. Why meet with the Iranians? What’s there to talk about? One important topic to bring up would be claims made by Biden’s FBI that there was an Iranian plot to assassinate then-candidate Trump. As many commentators including former CIA analyst Larry Johnson have asserted, the plot as outlined in the FBI indictment seems improbable. Is it possible that deep state hawks cooked up this alleged plot to guarantee that once taking office President Trump would not be tempted to open to Iran? There is a history of terror plots cooked up by the FBI so, sadly, this cannot be discounted. Does that mean that Iranian denials should be trusted? Of course not. But it is worth discussing. It is widely expected that in his second term President Trump will return to the 'maximum pressure' policy of his first Administration. That would be a mistake. Trump will not be stepping into the same world when he steps back into the White House. More than ever, the proxy war in Ukraine has demonstrated the futility of sanctions and pressure as a tool of foreign policy. The countries under US sanctions have increasingly joined together and formed their own pathways to trade and diplomacy without the US. In other words, we did not isolate Russia, China, and Iran with our sanctions upon sanctions. We isolated ourselves. We are seeing this clearly with the emergence of organizations such as BRICS. A more prosperous America requires more foreign trade, not less. Frédéric Bastiat is quoted as saying, 'When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.' We have already seen too much of that lately. Someone wrote recently that if only Nixon could go to China, perhaps only Trump can go to Iran. Making peace with Iran would be an achievement that would reverberate across the Middle East and beyond. It would even benefit Israel to have the current near state of war with Iran turned down. War destroys, peace builds. Let’s hope for a new approach.

Khamenei’s Succession Remarks Cause Turmoil Within Iran’s Regime ...	On November 7, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamanei met with the Assembly of Experts and discussed plans for his successor. 'The Assembly of Experts, as defined in our Constitution, is one of the most revolutionary institutions of the Islamic Republic,' he said. 'Its significance lies in its unique responsibility to select the nation’s leader. This readiness to fulfill that role must always be maintained.' One day after Khamenei’s remarks to the Assembly of Experts, where he emphasized the need for their readiness to select the next Supreme Leader, Mohammad Bagher Heydari Kashani, a member of the Assembly, described both the speech and the atmosphere as such: 'We held our breath. He gave explicit orders for the Assembly to act swiftly and decisively, without hesitation, to appoint the next leader in accordance with constitutional guidelines… The mere thought of the Leader’s absence moved some members to tears; they couldn’t hold back their emotions at the possibility of the Supreme Leader’s martyrdom.' These remarks sparked widespread controversy within the regime and surfaced in Friday prayer sermons on November 15 across various cities. Several of Khamenei’s appointees spoke on the issue, their conflicting statements revealing the confusion and anxiety caused by the anticipation of Khamenei’s potential demise at the highest levels of the regime. During Friday prayers in Shahrekord, Abdollah Keyvani, another member of the Assembly of Experts, outright denied Heydari’s account: 'Someone said the members of the Assembly cried… That’s not true; there was laughter, joy, and a sense of empowerment in the session. We were delighted, but there weren’t even tears of joy. The claim that the Leader directed the Assembly to discuss the next Supreme Leader is completely untrue.' In Isfahan, Abolhassan Mahdavi, Khamenei’s representative and the Friday prayer leader in the city, remarked, 'Khamenei’s statement that the Assembly should identify suitable candidates for leadership in case of emergency isn’t new; I’ve heard him mention this about 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years.' He continued, 'There is a committee within the Assembly of Experts responsible for identifying all individuals qualified for leadership—this extends beyond Iran, as the concept of ‘Velayat-e Faqih’ transcends borders. This committee works under strict confidentiality, and three members have been chosen to securely hold the names of potential candidates.' Despite the secrecy, reports circulating in the media and on social networks claim that the three confidential candidates include Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, who is said to control the IRGC, particularly its intelligence organization. The second is Alireza A’rafi, head of the seminaries and former leader of Al-Mustafa International University, known for recruiting and training overseas operatives. The third is Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri, a cleric reportedly regarded as the spiritual leader of the 'Paydari' faction. In another example of the controversy stirred by Khamenei’s remarks on November 7, Hossein Shafiei Darabi, the Friday prayer leader of Sari, said on November 15, 'The Thursday meeting between the Supreme Leader and the Assembly of Experts provoked reactions from the enemies [i.e., the oppressed society]. They sharpened their tongues and pens, speculating about what might happen. Don’t think that if something unfortunate befalls the Leader, you [the people] will benefit!' Although Mahdavi in Isfahan claimed to have heard Khamenei discuss the need to identify a successor 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years, his comments indicate that previous mentions did not provoke such strong reactions or turmoil within the regime. This current wave of responses, evident in the Friday sermons, underscores both Khamenei’s fragile condition and the severe crisis gripping the regime amidst its challenges—essentially a 'succession crisis' within the regime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUN0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-18T17:16:11-08:00	
The Indian Navy: A Resident Power In Indian Ocean And Rising Lead...	The Indian Navy stands at the crossroads of a transformative era, where global power dynamics and maritime security imperatives converge in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the Indo-Pacific. As a resident power in the IOR and an emerging leader in the broader maritime domain, the Navy reflects India’s strategic aspirations to ensure a stable, rules-based maritime order. Against the backdrop of Cold War 2.0 and an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy is crafting a new legacy—one that blends operational capability with diplomatic finesse to address complex 21st-century challenges. From Coastal Defense to Strategic Power: The Indian Navy’s Evolution Historical Roots and Geopolitical Awakening India’s maritime heritage is intertwined with its history of trade and cultural exchange. Yet, it was the post-independence era that catalyzed a shift from viewing the ocean as a commercial artery to recognizing its strategic potential. Early investments in naval infrastructure laid the groundwork for a force that would eventually evolve into a blue-water navy capable of influencing events far beyond India’s shores. The Emergence of SAGAR and Regional Ambitions The turning point in India’s maritime strategy came with the introduction of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) in 2015. This policy articulated a vision for an inclusive and cooperative approach to maritime security, positioning India as a stabilizing force in the IOR. SAGAR encapsulates India’s role as a net-security provider and emphasizes economic growth and collective prosperity in the region. Building Regional Leadership Through Multilateralism The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) India has adeptly used platforms like the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) to solidify its role as a regional leader. Bringing together littoral states, IONS addresses shared challenges such as piracy, climate change, and illegal fishing, fostering an environment of trust and collective action. This approach highlights India’s commitment to building partnerships rather than hierarchies. Operational Excellence: Cementing the Role of Net-Security Provider Defending Maritime Lanes The Indian Navy’s operational successes demonstrate its ability to counter both traditional and non-traditional threats. Notable missions include: Counter-Piracy Operations: In January 2024, the Navy’s elite MARCOS thwarted the hijacking of the MV Leela Norfolk in the North Arabian Sea. Similarly, the interception of the Iranian vessel Iman and the rescue of 17 crew members from Somali pirates spotlighted its proficiency in high-stakes operations. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR): From its response to the 2004 tsunami to delivering water to the Maldives during its 2014 water crisis, all the way to its medical assitance during the pandemic, the Navy has repeatedly proven its role as a force for good, enhancing India’s diplomatic and humanitarian reputation. First-Responder in Regional Crises India’s readiness to act as a first responder in regional emergencies solidifies its role as a dependable partner. Deployments such as the 2024 mobilization of 20 ships and 5,000 personnel to counter maritime threats highlight the Navy’s capability to respond swiftly and effectively while fostering goodwill among neighboring nations. Expanding Horizons: The Indian Navy in the Indo-Pacific Naval Diplomacy: Building Bridges and Projecting Power India’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific reflects its recognition of this region as the fulcrum of global power. The Navy’s goodwill visits and joint exercises have emerged as critical tools in shaping perceptions and forging partnerships: In 2024, the Eastern Fleet’s visits to Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines signalled India’s intent to deepen ties with Southeast Asia. These visits often coincide with heightened regional tensions, demonstrating India’s commitment to ensuring stability while subtly countering China’s assertive manoeuvres. Strengthening Alliances Through Multilateral Exercises Participation in multilateral exercises like Malabar, alongside the United States, Japan, and Australia, exemplifies India’s commitment to collaborative security. Such exercises enhance operational interoperability while reinforcing India’s image as a key player in the Indo-Pacific security architecture. Navigating the Complexity of Great Power Competition Countering China’s Expanding Influence China’s maritime strategies, from its String of Pearls initiative to its militarization of the South China Sea, present a significant challenge to India’s maritime interests. The Indian Navy’s response is multifaceted: Modernization: The induction of INS Vikrant, India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier, and Project 75I to expand the submarine fleet highlight India’s focus on bolstering its capabilities. Strategic Alignments: Partnerships with nations like France, Australia, and Japan reflect a deliberate strategy to counterbalance China’s regional influence. Balancing Relations Amid U.S.-China Rivalry As a cornerstone of the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy, India enjoys strengthened ties with Washington. However, its emphasis on strategic autonomy necessitates a careful balancing act, ensuring that partnerships with the U.S. do not compromise its broader diplomatic relationships, including with China. Harnessing Opportunities for Leadership Leveraging Technology for Maritime Superiority To maintain its operational edge, the Navy is investing in advanced technologies such as AI-driven surveillance systems and unmanned underwater vehicles. Collaborations with technologically advanced naval powers offer avenues for capacity-building and innovation. Economic Diplomacy and Connectivity Initiatives like the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) exemplify the convergence of India’s strategic and economic objectives. As an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the AAGC reinforces India’s commitment to fostering inclusive regional development. Conclusion: Charting India’s Maritime Destiny The Indian Navy’s evolution from a coastal defense force to a proactive player in the Indo-Pacific shows India’s strategic resolve in an era of shifting global power. As the IOR and Indo-Pacific become central to 21st-century geopolitics, India’s maritime strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. By balancing ambition with pragmatism, the Navy is positioning itself to be a force that defends India’s maritime interests and contributes to global stability. Whether through its role as a net-security provider in the IOR or its proactive engagement in the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy embodies a vision of cooperation, innovation, and resilience. As great power competition intensifies and the Indo-Pacific’s importance grows, the question remains: Can India sustain its momentum and emerge as a decisive maritime leader? The coming years will reveal the extent of India’s maritime rise—and its implications for the global order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUETbWctOpbo2	2024-11-18T17:15:19-08:00	
US’ Stake In Philippine Mid-Term Elections – Analysis	Donald Trump’s comeback to the White House after winning the US Presidential election in November 2024 may simply sustain the long-standing US-Philippine relations, the longest in Southeast Asia since colonial times. As US Ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson, confidently confirmed that the two countries 'will remain steadfast friends and iron-clad allies as well as partners in prosperity' In Trump’s previous presidency (2017-2021), US-Philippine had remarkable dynamics affecting regional stability, bilateral security cooperation, and economic ties. As US’s strategic ally in Asia, particulary Southeast Asia (SEA), Analysts surmise that Trump 2.0 will withstand US-Philippine relations ultimately to check on China’s military and economic domination of Asia. Indisputably, the US has a significant concern over the outcome of the Philippine mid-term 2025 elections as it will roughly define the future of US strategic geopolitical role in the Indo-Pacific region with its 'dependable' ally in the next three (3) years or up until the end of President Marcos Jr. six (6)-year term, and until Trump concludes his second term in office in 2028. The Philippine 2025 elections The Philippine 2025 election will determine who would occupy the over 18,000 positions, including 12 Senate seats, 316 seats in the House of Representatives (HoR) comprising representatives of legislative districts and party-list groups, local executives and legislators, and members of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) parliament. The politicians will ascertain the configuration of the Philippine Congress (Philippine Senate and HoR), the institution which influences the country’s foreign policy and sanctions defense programmes on the one hand, and regional as well local government bodies’ acting as collective institutions at the grassroot level to organize and mobilize local and popular boost to national policies and international commitments on the other hand. In as much as key legislators of the Philippine Senate and the HoR are mandated to frame and adopt laws and policies of national and international significance, it is imperative to the US to ensure that legislators closely conform with US foreign policy interest in the country as well as in the region, or offer less essential impediments or feeble resistance to US pursuit for power, security, and wealth in SEA. Geopolitical implications: The Mutual Defense Treaty and military cooperation agreements As a former colony of the US for 50 years and tied to a neocolonial relationship in the past 78 years US-sponsored independence in 1946, the Philippines as a major non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) US ally plays a key role especially where US foreign policy is increasingly focused over the growing influence of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). Equally, the country’s geographical position in the region is crucial for maintaining US’s presence particularly in projecting its power in the South China Sea (SCS), where territorial disputes between the country and PRC have escalated in recent years. Moreover, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the two (2) countries secured them militarily to support each other if one party is a victim of an armed attack on its 'metropolitan territory' (Art V of MDT), which by definition does not refer to territories under dispute. Addititionally, any counter-attack is not necessaritly automatic nor military in nature on the part of the US as the latter is required to invoke Art IV of the MDT: 'Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.' Given that PRC and Russia are permanent members of UN Security Council, they can easily exercise their veto power to annul any attempt for US to launch any military attack against China. Besides, military cooperation with the Philippines is indeed paramount to the US more than ever before especially with the termination of the 1947 US-Philippine Military Bases Agreement (MBA) in 1992 and with the new geopolitical landscape in East Asia dominated by the emerging regional rivalry between China and the US. The new strategic reality has been driven by China’s economic rise against backdrop of the US’s 'rebalancing' foreign policy in Asia and its relative economic decline. Also known as 'pivot to Asia,' the American military and diplomatic 'pivot,' or 'rebalance,' toward Asia became a popular buzzword after then US State Secretary Hillary Clinton first announced it at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 2010 in Hanoi and subsequently authored 'America's Pacific Century,' in Foreign Policy (2013). Pivot to Asia is a shift in the focus of foreign policy from the Middle East to the Far East to try to balance the growing influence of China and threats of North Korea. While essentially diplomatic and economic in nature (Graham 2013), the catalyst for the pivot was not only of reduced American regional power but the more assertive Chinese approach and actions, especially in the SCS disputes. This has reignited US involvement in the region; it is not waiting to be reduced to sub-primacy in the region as a result of what some have dubbed Chinese ‘domination by stealth.’ The US and some of its Asian ardent allies perceive China as a peril more than a partner in global development. China’s growing geopolitical importance has prompted US to strengthen its position, via balancing and engaging with China. In the period of 'pivot to Asia' and post-bases era, US-Philippine security relations has broadened and extended to Philippine politics. US’s geopolitical strategic interest makes it vital that the 2025 election produces politicians and leaders who continually endorse and commit themselves to key standing military cooperation agreements forged between the two states especially the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Implemented in 1999, the VFA paved the way to a series of uninterrupted annual conduct of Balikatan('shoulder-to-shoulder') military exercises, notables in 2001, 2016, 2022, 2023, and 2024, between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the US military. Although the first Balikatan military exercise held in 1991, a year prior to the closure of the US bases in the Philippines in 1992, and before the adoption of the VFA, was then under the MDT, the training exercises and war games have apparently been an important fixture of US-Philippine military-civil security relations. Balikatan has been designed to strengthen bilateral interoperability, capabilities, test air and missile defense systems, increase awareness of maritime security, trust and cooperation. The near cancellation of the VFA in 2020 by then President Duterte as Philippine foreign policy, and during President Trump’s first term, shifted towards China and away from the US is a testament that political leadership has direct impact on the complexion of the country’s foreign policy. Apart from the VFA, the country adopted the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) as a supplemental agreement to two previous accords – the 1951 MDT and 1998 VFA. The ten-year EDCA deal allows the U.S. to have a strengthened presence in the Philippines. This Agreement was however challenged by civil society organizations and legal experts before the Philippine Supreme Court (PSC) as it tolerates US to rotate its troops in the Philippines for an extended stay and consents it to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both US and Philippine armed forces. While opposition groups and parties argue that EDCA contravenes the Philippine constitutional provision on the establishment of a permanent foreign military base, the PSC ruled otherwise and with finality that EDCA is constitutional in its 2016 decision. The slow implementation of EDCA during then-President Duterte’s term (June 2016-June 2022) was willfully done as US is disdained by Duterte who is partial to China’s interest. Notwithstanding, the US and the Philippines agreed to have five (5) EDCA sites or military bases for the American troops in 2016, namely: Antonio Bautista Air Base (Palawan); Basa Air Base (Pampanga); Benito Ebuen Air Base (Cebu); Fort Magsaysay (Pampanga); and Lumbia Airport (Cagayan de Oro). With the shift of foreign policy that caters to the US interest, now President Marcos Jr., expanded the EDCA sites, covering four (4) more new bases in 2023, a year after he assumed the presidency. Additional sites are situated in north Luzon facing Taiwan (Republic of China), three, and one in Palawan facing the SCS. These are: Camp Melchora Dela Cruz (Gamu, Isabela); Lal-lo Airport ( Lal-lo, Cagayan); Naval Base Camilo Osias (Santa Ana, Cagayan); and Balabac Island (Palawan). The unilateral selection and identification of EDCA bases without the participation of people on the ground has been adversely received by local government officials. The governors of the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan were collectively offended by the national government’s choice of their provinces as EDCA armed bases as they become potential magnets of attack by Chinese missiles and nuclear attacks, and be caught at the crossfire of US and China armed rivaly in the region. Civil society organizations and groups also raised the alarm of wanton violation of human rights and confiscation of lands from indigenous peoples as a consequence of hosting EDCA military activities and training. Understandably, the non-participation of local government and community leaders in the political process of charting their future in a large-scale project like the EDCA military and civil scheme will not only isolate the program from the people but also produce adversarial relations between national and international actors on the one hand, and local government and community on the other hand. China’s economic growth It is argued moreover that US geopolitical interest in the region is intricately linked and cannot be disassociated with its economic goals. The US as a global political power no longer exercises sole dominion in Southeast Asia. Over the last two (2) decades, the PRC has become the main trading partner for most Asian nations replacing the historic primacy of Asian linkages with the US and the West. China’s economic rise and success did not only win the admiration of Southeast Asian countries, but also helped Beijing establish strong trade and financial ties with them. In Lowy Institute’s 2023 report (Patton and Sato 2023) it concludes that China has been more influential than the US using a variety of indicators such as regional affect across four categories: economic relationships, defense networks, diplomatic influence, and cultural influence. Of the ten (10) Association Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the U.S. is the most influential power in only two: the Philippines, which is a U.S. treaty ally, and Singapore, which is a staunch U.S. partner Similarly, in a 2023 study by the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore found that a majority of respondents in a poll found that China was now the most dominant economic and political-strategic power in Southeast Asia. Given China's growing economic presence in the region as well as in the Philippines, the US is keen on offering a counterbalance. By increasing trade, investment, and development assistance, the US aims to offer the Philippines an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. This is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the Philippines remains open to American businesses and geopolitical interests. In May 2022, the Philippines and the US joined 12 other partners to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The Philippines and the US look forward to strengthening economic partnership on: trade; supply chains; clean energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure; and tax and anti-corruption. And more through the Global Infrastructure and Investment (GIP) in support of IPEF economies, human capital, and sustainability goals. In terms of trade and investment, US-Philippine relations are relatively strong -- $22.6 billion in total goods trade in 2023 and an estimated $10.6 billion in trade in services in 2022. The US is also the country’s largest export market and is one of the country’s largest foreign investors. In 2024, the US Commerce Secretary brought 22 U.S. companies to the Philippines to explore commercial opportunities, resulting in US1 billion in investment pledges. These economic momenta have to be built further and expanded towards the conclusion of President Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028 as well as Trump’s first term in office. Having elected US-oriented candidates and/or politicians who make decisions that impact on labour laws, education, transportation, trade, and taxes will ensure that policies and regulations with national application protect and safeguard US capital and investments as well as guarantee that multi-national corporations (MNCs) have undue advantage. Any shift in the current business environment which will be unconducive to US economic and commercial interest would be deeply concerning and troubling to US investors as this may affect their business and commercial future in the country. Summary Given U.S.’s geopolitical interest in the region, the Philippine mid-term elections is highly significant to warrant its possible intervention. U.S.’s keen concern is driven by strategic, economic, security, and diplomatic reasons. The Philippines plays a crucial role in the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy, and the outcome of these elections could have significant implications on the assertion of the Philippine right to self-determinaion as a sovereign and independent state on the one hand and the US geopolitical interest in the region on the other hand. Leaders elected in 2025 will shape the Philippines’ foreign policy and its alignment with either U.S.-led alliances or with China's sphere of influence. The U.S. may view these elections as a way to support candidates and policies that align with its vision for a 'free and open Indo-Pacific.' The results of the 2025 midterm elections will also help shape the 2028 presidential race. Politicians seeking higher office in 2028 will use this election to build momentum and expand their influence. President Marcos Jr.s’ declaration in his 2023 State of the Nation Address (SONA): 'Our independent foreign policy – a friend to all and enemy of none – has proven effective' is obviously out of touch of the reality as his foreign policy is neither independent nor all-embracing.

Is America Turning Fascist? – OpEd	By Vincent Cook On October 25, ABC News published the results of a survey of 2,392 registered voters where 44 percent of the respondents said that Donald Trump is a fascist, while 23 percent said that Kamala Harris is a fascist. There was even a 5 percent overlap between the two groups—respondents who characterized both Trump and Harris as fascists. Only 32 percent of the respondents thought that neither candidate is a fascist. Is America really in danger of turning fascist? The survey defined 'fascist' rather broadly as 'a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.' This definition is misleading (perhaps intentionally so), since most Americans view communism as being an alternative form of political extremism and would hesitate to apply the fascist label to any communist. If the question had been reworded to ask whether or not a given candidate was 'fascist or communist,' many more respondents would likely have moved Harris into the extremist category. Another difficulty is that the words like 'fascist' and 'Nazi' have been routinely used as fear-evoking smears for a very long time. One of the keenest critics of the political abuses of language, George Orwell, despairingly called attention to the ambiguity of the word 'fascism' in its ordinary usage in his 1944 newspaper article 'What is Fascism?': It will be seen that, as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley’s broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else. Yet underneath all this mess there does lie a kind of buried meaning. To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy to point out and not easy to explain away, between the régimes called Fascist and those called democratic. Secondly, if 'Fascist' means 'in sympathy with Hitler', some of the accusations I have listed above are obviously very much more justified than others. Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word 'Fascist' in every direction attach at any rate an emotional significance to it. By 'Fascism' they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come. But Fascism is also a political and economic system. Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one—not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make. All one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not, as is usually done, degrade it to the level of a swearword. There is little doubt that the word 'fascism' has been used in an equally-ambiguous manner lately, with President Biden explicitly using the word against Trump and partisan legacy media outlets supporting Biden’s accusation with witnesses claiming Trump wanted to coerce political opponents on various occasions by using military, police, or angry mobs and of resorting to viciously-racist rhetoric and policies, particularly regarding illegal immigrants. Conservative commentators, in turn, accused Democrats and Democrat-friendly elites and bureaucrats of instituting censorship of social media, of instigating frivolous prosecutions and litigation directed against Trump and his supporters, of funding violent street protesters, of engaging in fraudulent vote counts, and of concocting numerous fabrications and misrepresentations against Trump with the assistance of numerous members of the intelligence community. Suspicions were also aroused by at least two assassination attempts against Trump by individuals having unknown motives and affiliations. To assess if American political trends bear more than just a superficial resemblance to the original Italian model, it is important to take up Orwell’s 1944 challenge and provide a clear definition of what qualifies as fascism, and to better understand how democracies are transformed into fascist states. The original Italian promoters of Fascism, dictator Benito Mussolini, and idealist philosopher Giovanni Gentile, were prolific writers who authored numerous works attempting to explain and justify fascism, including Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals(1925), Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (1929), and The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism (1932). However, it is not easy to formulate a clear definition of fascism from their works, in part because they rejected all-encompassing ideological explanations for what they viewed as spontaneous political developments driven by the practical political needs of the moment. What does emerge as a positive doctrine in their works is an elevation of the state to the status of an Absolute (not unlike G.W.F. Hegel’s deification of the Prussian state)—an organic entity that supposedly gives spiritual meaning to life and actively creates nationhood, and where mere individuals (contra classical liberalism) or economic classes (contra Marxism) count for nothing except to the extent they are harmoniously integrated together as parts of the nation-state whole. Another clearcut fascist doctrine is that the interests of different states are irreconcilable and, therefore, a state must go to war with other states in order to prosper. Again, in 1944, three classical liberals cut through the conceptual fog that bedeviled Orwell, writing books warning about the dangers of fascism—American journalist John Flynn (As We Go Marching) and Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises (Omnipotent Government) and Friedrich von Hayek (The Road to Serfdom). Flynn and Hayek offered troubling political, economic, and ideological comparisons between the two leading fascist nations and western nations (America and Britain respectively), warning that the prevailing ideas and policies of the New Deal in America and of Labour partisans in Britain were leading those countries down the same road that Italy and Germany had followed. Mises and Hayek analyzed the ideological origins of fascist regimes and the causes of their political success, with a particular focus on the rise of Nazism in Germany. Flynn listed eight defining characteristics of a fascist social system: (1) Governmental powers are unrestrained (totalitarianism); (2) Governmental powers are concentrated in the hands of a dictator supported by a political elite (the leadership principle); (3) Production and distribution are in private hands, but directed by state planners ('public-private partnerships' or corporatism); (4) State regimentation of production is effected through regulations promulgated by immense bureaucracies; (5) Investments are also regimented through an integration of government and private finances ('industrial policy' and 'monetary policy'); (6) Consumption is also subjected to government planning on a large scale via the deficit-financing of government spending (e.g., welfarism, public works) and the creation of purchasing power (inflation); (7) Militarism is also embraced as an element of planned consumption; (8) Imperialism also follows as a consequence from militarism and other elements of fascism Flynn aligned with the original Italian fascists in associating fascism with totalitarianism, corporatism, and military conquest, but he notably cited neither nationalism nor racism in his definition. While many protest Flynn’s omission, Mussolini and Gentile tended towards the view that states made nations and peoples, not the other way around. Unlike many Nazis, they were not reflexive chauvinists or eugenicists. For them, the state, not the nation as such, always comes first. To be sure, demagogic appeals to nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, etc. can explain why totalitarians gain public support in specific instances. Mises and Hayek offered critical qualifications about this though. In their view, interventionism, welfarism, and inflationism are what ultimately destabilized economies, democratic institutions, and international peace in spite of sincere democratic intentions of most of those who instituted such policies. While it may be an obnoxious nationalist demagogue who delivers the final coup de grace to a democracy, one could never succeed in seizing power without the institutions and ideology of economic collectivism already being in place. The illiberal policies that caused the First World War and the Great Depression and the economic chaos following from those events were necessary antecedents to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. In the penultimate chapter of his book, Hayek also presciently warned that multinational institutions would fail to keep peace among nations if central planning to continued to exist, either by states at a national level or by supranational authorities at a global level—a severe rebuke to the 'anti-fascist' pretensions of contemporary Davos elites. America is indeed in serious danger of turning fascist; not specifically because Donald Trump won the election, but because partisans on both sides, together with globalist elites and Deep State operatives, have built a system with most of Flynn’s fascist elements already in place, lacking only a willful executive empowered by an enabling act.

Wealth Redistribution Is A Hidden Property Right Infringement – O...	In The Theory of Political Spectrum, I presented three critical factors that influence the polarization of political ideologies: attitudes toward private property rights, the state of consciousness, and the degree of wealth redistribution. The article demonstrates that an assault on private property, the collectivization of consciousness, or widespread and involuntary wealth redistribution—either individually or collectively—are methods of making society more oriented to socialism. The last factor, wealth redistribution, has a close relationship with private property rights but is often ignored by mainstream academics and policy analysts. They have become so accustomed to extensive social programs and progressive taxation as normal conditions of a modern state that they fail to recognize the underlying economic and moral flaws. Neglecting this factor overlooks the central role it played in the gradual adoption of evolutionary socialism in the United States. The Significance of Wealth Redistribution For decades, the U.S. fought against the global expansion of communism, positioning itself as the defender of capitalist ideals and individual freedoms. Yet, during this global struggle, evolutionary socialism quietly took root at home. Unlike revolutionary socialism, which seeks to overthrow the existing order through radical means, evolutionary socialism advances gradually, using legal and institutional mechanisms. One of the most effective tools in this process is wealth redistribution. Through taxation and social programs, evolutionary socialism embedded itself in American society without attracting much attention. The U.S. was vigilant against external threats but failed to recognize how wealth redistribution was being used as a subtle tactic to undermine private property rights and promote socialist ideals within the country. Wealth redistribution shifted resources from private individuals to the state, creating the foundation for a more collectivist approach to economic and social governance. Therefore, wealth redistribution is an extremely important factor. It is not just a policy of economic adjustment, but a tool that gradually shifts the power dynamics in society, eroding individual property rights and enabling the expansion of state control. Ignoring this factor allows evolutionary socialism to grow in the background, weakening the foundations of private enterprise and individual freedom. The Origin of Evolutionary Socialism Evolutionary socialism advocates for gradual and legal reforms to bring about socialist changes within a capitalist society. Its roots trace back to key figures and movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably Eduard Bernstein and the Fabian Society in Britain. Eduard Bernstein, a German Marxist and political theorist, argued that socialism was attainable through gradual, democratic reforms instead of violent revolution. His ideas, expressed in Evolutionary Socialism (1899), emphasized the potential for adaptation and evolution within capitalism. Therefore, socialism could be integrated into existing political systems through reforms like extending suffrage, labor rights, and social welfare. Bernstein’s ideas laid the foundation for what would later be known as democratic socialism or social democracy. At the same time, the Fabian Society in Britain pursued a similar approach. Members of the Fabian Society and Bernstein likely influenced each other. Founded in 1884, the Fabian Society sought to implement socialism progressively through education, political activism, and legislative reforms. Rejecting revolution, the Fabians believed in working within existing institutions to transform society deliberately. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolized their strategy of subtle infiltration. They used established systems to introduce socialist reforms without direct confrontation. The Fabian Society had a strong influence on British politics, particularly in shaping the Labour Party’s platform, and had a significant, albeit less pronounced, impact on progressive thought in the United States. Today, the Democratic Party has openly endorsed the principles of evolutionary socialism. It would be more accurate to call them the Social-Democratic Party, as many of their European counterparts have done. Unfortunately, the Republican Party has not only failed to counteract the collectivist reforms pushed by the Democrats over the years, but it has also started embracing left-leaning ideas. This drift has taken the party further from the rightist position of economic and individual freedom. Both parties now view the state as a major economic player and rely more on government solutions than on market forces. Progressive Taxation and Property Rights What follows is a simplified numerical exploration of how progressive taxation, a central mechanism of wealth redistribution, constantly infringes upon private property rights, leading to the slow erosion of financial returns on privately owned property. Consider the example of a private enterprise that owns 10 units of equipment, each costing $1,000. These units of equipment are used to produce commodities that generate a total profit of $100,000 after all expenses. Under a 10% tax rate, the business would pay $10,000 in taxes, leaving a net profit of $90,000. Each of the 10 units of equipment contributes equally to the total profit, meaning each unit accounts for $9,000 of the net profit. Now, suppose the government implements a progressive tax structure that increases the rate to 20% for profits at or above $100,000. Under this new system, the business would be taxed $20,000, leaving a net profit of only $80,000. In this scenario, ceteris paribus, each unit of equipment now contributes only $8,000 to the net profit. The progressive tax effectively reduces the profit generated by each unit by $1,000. Prior to the tax increase, it was possible to attain the same $80,000 net profit by utilizing only 9 units of equipment (since $80,000 / $9,000 = ~9 units), with each unit contributing $9,000 under the original 10% tax rate. The additional tax renders one unit of the businessman’s equipment economically redundant. Even though the proprietor still possesses and maintains all 10 units, the government has silently confiscated the value created by one of them through elevated taxation. This gradual and hidden assault on private property means that while the businessman maintains his equipment, the income it generates is partially appropriated by the state. Progressive taxation undermines the fundamental principle of private property by eroding the financial returns that property is meant to produce. Faced with this situation, the businessman may resort to certain measures to protect his property and profit. Rather than allowing the government to seize a portion of the value produced by his equipment, he may choose to sell one unit outright, reducing his total production capacity. For instance, if the businessman sells one unit of equipment for $1,000, leaving him with 9 units, he can limit his production to keep total profits below $100,000. This keeps him in the 10% tax bracket, maintaining a higher after-tax profit. This strategy demonstrates how progressive taxation incentivizes business owners to limit their productive capacity in order to protect their property. This scenario illustrates how progressive taxation undermines private property rights, not through direct confiscation, but by diminishing the value that property can generate. Over time, this creates a gradual erosion of the businessman’s wealth and economic power. As each tax increase forces him to either accept reduced profits or downsize his operations to avoid further losses, the result is a steady transfer of wealth and productive capacity from private individuals to the state, undermining the very foundation of private enterprise and property ownership. The Immorality of Wealth Redistribution Of course, contemporary humane society does not want its members to experience hardship or lead a miserable existence. There are indeed categories of people, such as the disabled or elderly, who genuinely need assistance. Ideally, such help would come from voluntary donations by individuals and private organizations, which would not only provide for those in need but also demonstrate the true compassion and generosity of a society. Voluntary charity reflects a community’s collective empathy and moral values, showing that people are willing to uplift others without coercion or the force of law.While some level of state involvement in providing a safety net is not entirely rejected, it should remain limited and targeted. Government intervention in assisting the most vulnerable can play a role, especially in areas where private charity may fall short. However, mandatory wealth redistribution through extensive taxation is both economically and morally flawed. When the primary goal of such redistribution is to eliminate so-called inequality, it punishes success and discourages initiative. Those who work hard, take risks, and create value are penalized, while an underclass is created for whom 'poverty' becomes a profitable lifestyle. This system disincentivizes personal responsibility and ambition, rewarding reliance on state benefits rather than encouraging self-sufficiency and economic mobility.Moreover, when wealth redistribution is framed as a solution to economic inequality, it perpetuates a narrative of entitlement and resentment. The focus shifts from creating opportunities for growth and innovation to redistributing the achievements of others. Rather than fostering a society where people are motivated to strive for success, such policies breed stagnation, where personal effort is devalued, and the rewards of hard work are forcibly taken to subsidize those who may lack the same drive. In the long run, this undermines the moral fabric of a free and productive society, fostering a culture where dependence on government aid becomes normalized, and individual liberty is eroded.

The EU’s Dual Approach: Green Subsidies And Tariffs On China EVs ...	On October 29, 2024, the European Commission unveiled new countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports, effective the following day. This move is framed as part of a broader aggressive strategy to safeguard European industries, but it overlooks a significant reality. The EU itself has long been an active player in subsidizing its own green transition, including the EV sector. Recent EU statistics reveal that Brussels and its member states have poured substantial financial support into the 'new trio' industries—lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, and electric vehicles—through a mix of grants, tax breaks, low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and price subsidies. These subsidies, which are often justified by the need to boost competitiveness and drive regional development, have granted the EU a commanding role in emerging industries. Although the EU has rules to limit state funding, it has allowed member states to provide targeted financial support. On top of this, the EU itself has established dedicated funds for direct grants. In 2022 alone, the EU allocated a staggering 25 billion euros to solar power through its various financial mechanisms. This extensive dual-channel support, blending EU funds with member-state aid, has given European green industries a major competitive edge, which stands in sharp contrast to the tariffs now imposed on China’s own green transition. The European Union, under the pretext of advancing the green transition and aiding underdeveloped regions, has created an extensive network of at least 11 subsidy funds targeting emerging industries like lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and electric vehicles. These funds, including the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), Horizon Europe, and the Just Transition Fund, among others, form a robust financial infrastructure designed to fuel the EU’s competitive edge. With the EU’s strategic investment in these sectors, the bloc aims to dominate critical green technologies even as China’s similar efforts are increasingly met with tariffs and restrictions. As of April 2024, the RRF has allocated 87.9 billion euros to sustainable transportation projects, particularly in zero- and low-emission vehicles, reinforcing the EU’s green agenda. Horizon Europe, with a total budget of 93.5 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period, has already dispersed 22.7 million euros to bolster research and innovation. Meanwhile, the Innovation Fund, fueled by EU carbon emissions trading revenue, is expected to grant at least 40 billion euros by 2030 to advance low-carbon technologies. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), with a defined objective of narrowing the development gap between regions, has allocated 104.3 billion euros from 2021 to 2027. This sum will support green initiatives like energy transitions and sustainable urban mobility, furthering the EU’s low-emission agenda. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) also plays a crucial role, investing in interconnected, high-performance trans-European networks. From 2021 to 2022 alone, the CEF awarded 1.66 billion euros to 18 energy projects, spanning electricity, carbon dioxide, and renewable energy. The European Union’s focus on electric vehicles has elevated the battery industry as a key player, with EU funds pouring substantial support into this sector. Among the 'new trio' industries, battery projects have garnered the largest subsidies, often covering over half of their total costs. Horizon Europe, for instance, allocated 873 million euros to 307 battery R&D initiatives between 2014 and 2020. The Innovation Fund provided 161 million euros to eight battery projects from 2021 to 2022. Meanwhile, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) channeled 319 million euros into 459 battery-related initiatives across 14 member states. By 2023, the European Union had also firmly committed to the electrification of its transport sector, with all 27 member states enacting at least one electric vehicle (EV) consumption subsidy policy. These efforts have largely been driven by tax incentives and direct grants, offering substantial financial support for EV adoption. Among the frontrunners, Germany stands out, having allocated a remarkable 10 billion euros in subsidies to foster electric vehicle adoption. It has also extended motor vehicle tax exemptions for electric vehicles multiple times since 2012, including a 10-year circulation tax exemption for EVs, which began in 2016. Also that year, Germany introduced the 'Government Programme for Electric Mobility' by committing 1.2 billion euros for environmental bonuses for electric and plug-in hybrid cars, alongside 300 million euros to expand charging infrastructure. France, meanwhile, offers a 50 percent reduction on registration fees and a full exemption on license plate registration for both fully electric and hybrid vehicles. Spain, in 2023, introduced a 15 percent personal income tax reduction for electric vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, with deductions reaching up to 20,000 euros for EVs and 4,000 euros for chargers. Grants, too, play a crucial role in the push for EV consumption across the EU. France’s 8 billion euro 'Automotive Industry Revitalization Plan,' launched in 2020, includes direct subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, alongside trade-in bonuses for consumers who replace older fossil-fuel cars with greener alternatives. Locally, 131 cities in the Paris metropolitan area have offered varying degrees of aid to EV buyers. As the European Union escalates its efforts to counter Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports with new tariffs, subsidies often account for over half of the budget for many green initiatives. These subsidy programs—aimed at bolstering its green industries—have already reshaped the market, giving European companies an undeniable edge. Rather than hastily imposing punitive tariffs on China, the EU should instead foster a global, cooperative effort to advance green technologies, ensuring a fair, competitive, and sustainable EV market for all.

Trump’s Multiethnic Winning Coalition – OpEd	Go on, admit it. Don’t be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of 5–6 November? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump’s 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by three million votes (two percent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four percent). This time he won the popular vote by three million (76-73) and two percent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a ‘beautiful,’ ‘historical realignment’ in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In an NBC exit poll, Trump won 57 percent of white and 55 percent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In an AP exit poll, he won 20 percent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris’s 80 percent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden’s four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 percent of Latinos, 39 percent of Asian-Americans, 54 percent of ‘Other,’ 45 percent of women, and 43 percent of 18–29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump’s success in creating a new multiethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in an AP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases like the Latino, black, or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Traditional Voter Concerns Beat Woke Neoliberalism Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing in The Globe and Mail in reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as ‘manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself.’ His take on the outcome? ‘Sometimes the people get it wrong.’ He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that ‘this election was not an indictment’ of Harris but ‘an indictment of America.’ At least one Guardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the ‘simple, inescapable message’ from Trump’s victory is that ‘many people despise the left’ with progressives seen as ‘one judgmental, 'woke' mass.’ Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that ‘America is the greatest country in the world’ where ‘most people can make it if they work hard,’ again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump’s 14-point advantage among voters without college degrees flips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 percent of Americans admitted to having skipped meals to keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on 4 November. Speaking at his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: ‘We don’t need a star because we have policy.’ She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was ‘I am not Trump. I am not Biden.’ This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles, and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. Even Taylor Swift’s hometown of Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in the Wall Street Journal, it was ‘a landslide against the media’ (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the ‘quadfecta’ of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy, some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year’s Voice referendum here in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris’s massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they’d become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big ‘FU’ in return, just like with the Voice down under. Growing the Trump Voter Base There isn’t just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn’t one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to a Forbes analysis, Harris’s six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 percent Latino population that hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 percent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, the needle moved 20 points towards Trump from 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian’s off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, which Biden carried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris’s appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN’s exit poll shows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites, and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump’s new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women’s rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. The CNN exit poll confirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations too see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They too object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are wracked with guilt over historical sins like slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. Democracy Under Threat In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14 million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden’s cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris’s fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they’ve returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris’s concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world’s diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump’s efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris’ watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showed immigration and the economy as the voters’ top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 percent support. A Win for Women’s Rights against Trans Colonisation of Female Spaces The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don’t subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don’t believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don’t support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don’t obsess over personal pronouns, and don’t lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump’s disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people’s concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump’s counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year, 69 percent of Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trump gained three points from both. How could this be: Isn’t he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and ‘My Body, My Choice’ with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade in June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was 1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 percent jump from 625,978 in 2021 before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and the highest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don’t feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn’t align with the joy vibe and there’s something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don’t back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it’s a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpeted gender gap worked to Trump’s net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn’t even excite the young. About 39 percent of young women and 42 percent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 percent and 8 percent picked abortion. Trump won 40 percent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden’s margin by 19 points. He won among under-30 men by 14 percent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent $175 million on TV ads across the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent $123 millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: ‘Kamala’s For They/Them. President Trump is for you’ was exceptionally effective. The New York Timesreported on 7 November on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by a stunning 2.7 percent towards Trump after viewers watched it. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia’s critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. Indo-Americans For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups’ sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. Speaking at a function in Mumbai on 10 November, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that ‘a lot of countries are nervous about the US…We are not one of them.’ He said that Modi’s call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India’s global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are 5.2 million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations, and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It’s worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over 700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 percent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 percent for Biden in 2020. Harris’s share fell again to 60 percent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 percent, up from 22 percent in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation’s elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump’s Republican Party offer important clues on Trump’s appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

US Congressional Leadership Remains United In Devotion To Israel ...	Some things changed in politics in Washington, DC when on Wednesday Republican United States senators via a secret ballot vote selected Sen John Thune (R-SD) to become Senate Republican leader, replacing Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in the position. One of the things that remained the same, though, was that the Senate Republican leader position, along with the other three top leadership positions — Republican and Democrat — in the Senate and House of Representatives, remains held by a politician espousing devotion to the government of Israel and its war effort. In July of 2022, I wrote about the peculiar situation where these top congressional leaders were then as well lined up in adamant support for the Israel government despite the fact that Americans’ views regarding the Middle East nation were roughly evenly divided between favorable and negative views. Of the people then holding the four top Republican and Democratic leadership positions in Congress, only Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) remains in the group. Nonetheless, the unanimity in over-the-top support for Israel persists, irrespective of how out of step it is with the thinking of the American people, even as over the last year Americans have increasingly opposed the US government’s unwavering supplying of military and intelligence support for Israel waging its expanding war with catastrophic consequences. In January of 2023, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), a die-hard supporterof the Israel government, became the top Democratic leader in the House. Then, when Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted from the House speaker position in the fall of 2023, something astounding happened: All 11 candidates to succeed him as speaker — including ultimate winner Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) — had expressed both their devotion to Israel and their devotion to the US supporting Israel in Israel’s war. Continuing the trend, all three Senate majority leader candidates — Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) — competing last week were express devotees of the US government supporting Israel generally, as well as supporting Israel’s war effort. Cornyn made his devotion to Israel and its war crystal clear in an October 3 Dallas Morning News editorial titled 'America’s Next Commander in Chief Must Unapologetically Support Israel.' In the editorial, he declared: Support for Israel ought to transcend party lines, religion, race and ethnicity. This is not an issue of opinion; this is a battle of right and wrong, of good and evil. Israel is our most steadfast ally in the Middle East, and it deserves our full support, both in words and action.I was honored to visit Israel earlier this year, and I was also extremely proud to have voted for widely-supported legislation that sent critical aid and military resources to Israel. Scott in, of all places, his America First plank of his Rescue America plan put succinctly his dedication to supporting Israel. 'We will always defend our allies, starting with Israel,' Scott’s plan declares. Further, Scott made this promise in a September speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Summit: 'And, as Senate leader, you can count on support for Israel and protection for our Jewish communities being top priorities.' In the speech, Scott also declared: We need to show up for our friends and family in Israel right now. We need them to know we are with them, we will show up and we will fight with them. Thune, the winner of the Senate Republican leader race, is on the same page as his Senate Republican leader race opponents in regard to Israel. Thune wrote an editorial last month titled 'America Must Support Israeli Victory.' In the editorial, the senator criticized the Biden administration for not doing enough for Israel. This is the administration that has been pumping out weapons, intelligence, and military support to Israel at an incredible pace to aid Israel’s pursuit of its expanding war. After criticizing what he refers to as the Biden administration’s 'tepid support for Israel at a time when it needs a strong ally in the United States,' Thune declared the US 'needs to stand strongly with Israel as it faces enemies from every side that threaten its very existence.' And what did Thune do upon winning the leadership race? Thune called the prime minister of Israel, posting at Twitter for all to see a picture of Thune on the phone along with this message: 'Spoke with Prime Minister @netanyahu and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to standing with Israel, our closest friend and ally.' The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Monetary Policy: Donald Trump Versus Jerome Powell? – OpEd	President-elect Trump has, in the past, been at odds with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on monetary policy. Trump will likely favor lower interest rates and an easier monetary policy than Powell. However, Powell and the Fed act independently of the presidency, at least nominally, and when asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to, Powell said no. Powell has said he’s reluctant to lower interest rates until there’s good evidence that inflation is headed toward the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Such evidence will be difficult to come by in the next few months. It is unlikely that prices will continue their downward trend over the rest of the year. Recently released inflation data for October show that consumer prices rose by 2.6% over the past calendar year, which does not look that close to 2% to me. However, prices fell in November and December of 2023. Since the beginning of 2024, prices have risen by 2.9%. Any uptick in prices over the next two months will place the inflation rate for all of 2024 at or above 3%. Should that occur, it would appear from Powell’s comments that he would be reluctant to lower interest rates early in 2025 at the beginning of Trump’s term. That will put his agenda at odds with Trump’s. I expect some critical comments from Trump to be launched Powell’s way.

Why Putin Should Ignore Biden’s Pathetic ATACMS Provocation – OpE...	As provocations go, the latest by President Joe Biden to permit the use of long-range missile strikes on Russia is certainly audacious. But, ultimately, in practice, it is a pathetic gesture by a lame-duck president that will have no impact on Russia’s anticipated military victory against the NATO-armed Kiev regime. Biden’s reported decision is a desperate last-bid gamble to incite an escalation with Russia and to sabotage incoming plans by President-elect Trump to end the conflict in Ukraine. Biden’s move is reckless, reprehensible, and odious. But it should not be given any credibility as a serious threat. Russia would be best to ignore it. Of course, Russia has to defend itself against any increased potential threat to its territory that such weapons may pose. Nevertheless, Moscow should continue exercising the strategic restraint that President Putin is renowned for, and not retaliate over the provocation. Understandably, Russian politicians and media have reacted furiously to U.S. media reports that Biden gave the Ukrainian military the green light to deploy American-made ATACMS for striking deep into Russian territory. The ground-launched Mach-3 supersonic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometers. The audacity and arrogance of the American ruling class knows no bounds. It has sanctioned Russia to the hilt (to no avail mind you), it has weaponized a NeoNazi regime in Kiev, it has killed civilians in the Russian territory of Crimea already with ATACMS, and so on. Now Biden is ramping up the assault capability deep into Russia. Two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that if the U.S. took such a move, then it would dramatically alter the very essence of the conflict in Ukraine, one where Moscow would see the United States and its NATO partners as 'direct participants' in a war against Russia. Putin’s reasoning was correct. The deployment of ATACMS and other sophisticated long-range missiles against Russia would inescapably mean that American and NATO personnel were manning these systems. The Ukrainian military – riven with desertion, in disarray, and suffering from poor morale – would not be capable of targeting and operating such munitions. The use of ATACMS, or air-launched JASSMs, and the British and French Storm Shadow and Scalp cruise missiles to hit Russia is tantamount to NATO’s direct involvement in a war against Russia. The implication of what Putin said was grave and potentially catastrophic. If the Western states took that step, the result could mean an all-out war between nuclear powers. When Putin issued his stark warning in September, Biden and other Western leaders, including Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, appeared at the time to heed it and back down from considerations to permit the Ukrainian regime to use long-range missiles against Russia. Now, however, Biden has flipped to finally give his approval, according to reports. The style of anonymous U.S. officials briefing the New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated psychological operation. What has changed? Simple. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on November 5 with a resounding victory in defiance of the political establishment that wanted Kamala Harris to win. The Republican president-elect takes over in two months when he is inaugurated on January 20. Trump has repeatedly said he will negotiate an end to the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine, which has seen the U.S. and NATO allies bankroll a corrupt regime in Ukraine to the tune of $200 billion. And yet after all that obscene wasting of Western public money to bloat the war machine, Russia is going to defeat the NATO proxy. The stakes for NATO’s future and the Western imperialist war machine could not be higher. The impressive electoral mandate for Trump suggests that the American public wants the U.S. warmongering to stop and for their mounting economic and social needs to be taken care of as a priority. Under Trump, the war racket could well be over. His nomination last week of Tulsi Gabbard – an outspoken critic of the NATO proxy war in Ukraine – as his Director of National Intelligence is a major sign of his bold intentions of negotiating a diplomatic settlement to the conflict. That means the end of the blood money flowing into the coffers of the Western military-industrial complex and Wall Street. Biden and the Democrat candidate Kamala Harris were the puppets of the war racket. To perform well, they mouthed endless Russophobia, making negotiations impossible with Moscow, and they swore to keep the conflict in Ukraine going 'for as long as it takes.' European leaders like Starmer, Macron, and Scholz are equally contemptible. As Biden packs his bags for his overdue retirement, he is rendering desperate last-minute services to the war racket that lies at the putrid heart of American capitalism. Last week, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken (another non-entity puppet) said the Biden administration would release a further $9 billion in military aid to Ukraine so that it could keep fighting the war well into next year. Likewise, the reported green light from Biden on the use of long-range missiles is another ploy to keep the war racket going. Trump could reverse the decision when he enters the White House, but over the next two months, the Biden administration seems to be trying to sabotage Trump’s peace intentions by escalating the conflict to a dangerous point of no return. Russia should not take the bait. For a start, the United States does not have a large supply of ATACMS to give to Ukraine. Any use of these missiles will be limited. The Kiev regime’s so-called president Vladimir Zelensky – he canceled elections months ago and rules by decree – has no chance of stopping the rapidly advancing victory of Russian forces, even with a few ATACMS. No, this is not about defending Ukraine or enabling Zelensky’s ridiculous 'victory plan'. It’s all about the American-led Western imperialist deep state wanting to provoke Russia into a dreadful escalation to keep the war profits churning. Biden’s gesture is reckless, but it is something that should be treated with contempt. As he wanders off to the oblivion of his retirement dementia, people will soon forget about this failed politician. His 50-year career was one long shift of prostituting for U.S. imperialism. Legally, Russia could respond to Biden’s provocation with reciprocal attacks on U.S. and NATO sites. But such an escalation is exactly what the imperialist deep state of the U.S. and its NATO lackeys are betting on. The provocative gesture is more symbolic than a substantive threat. Russia should ignore it and focus on demolishing the NATO proxy regime in Kiev, and with that, thereby deal a fatal blow to U.S. and NATO credibility.

From One ‘Ism’ To Another: The Artistic Evolution Through Time – ...	Art, as a mirror of society, evolves dynamically over time. Movements, or 'isms', influence one another through reactions, innovations, and reinterpretations. These shifts are not merely aesthetic; they often embody changing cultural, political, and technological landscapes. From the grandeur of the Renaissance to the provocations of modern and postmodern art, each era contributes to an ongoing dialogue. Movements build upon the ideas of their predecessors, either by challenging established norms or refining them. The 'isms' of art do not emerge from a vacuum; rather, they are the continuation of a rich tradition or traditions that stretch back to the ancient era. Ancient art is the foundation upon which many modern movements and techniques were built. Emerging in prehistoric times, art served not only as a form of personal expression but also as a means of documenting history, religion, and daily life. Early cave paintings, like those found in Lascaux, France, reveal humanity's desire to communicate and connect with the environment and the spiritual world. As civilizations developed, the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans refined their artistic techniques, focusing on idealized forms and proportionality. Egyptian art, for example, adhered to strict conventions to convey the eternity and order of life. Greek and Roman art, on the other hand, emphasized humanism, exploring themes of beauty, the human body, and the natural world in greater depth. The Gothic period (12th–16th centuries) marked another important shift, with a focus on spirituality, complex architecture, and the human experience. Figures such as Giotto di Bondone, whose naturalistic approach to painting marked a shift towards realism, and Abbot Suger, who played a pivotal role in the development of Gothic architecture through his work on the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exemplify this era's innovations. Gothic art, particularly in cathedrals and stained glass, brought a new focus on light, verticality, and ornate detail. This style, deeply connected with religious themes, laid the foundation for the humanism of the Renaissance. Ancient and medieval art laid the groundwork for classical ideas that would later inspire Renaissance artists and beyond. From sculpture to pottery to murals, the flow of art demonstrates human creativity and the desire to represent and understand the world. The evolution of these early styles, though distinct in different regions, set the stage for the major movements that would follow, influencing generations of artists. Studying the progression of artistic movements, from ancient to modern times, offers invaluable insight into the evolving nature of human expression, culture, and society. Each 'ism' in art history reflects the unique concerns, ideologies, and advancements of its time, providing a window into the past and a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped civilization. By tracing the influence of one movement on another, we can better comprehend how cultural, political, and intellectual shifts influence creative expression. Art history also highlights the interplay between innovation and tradition, as artists respond to, reinterpret, or challenge established norms. Furthermore, understanding the lineage of art movements allows us to appreciate the enduring relevance of classical ideas and their transformation over time. These studies are not just about art for art's sake; they help us understand the broader social and psychological contexts in which these works were created. By studying art movements and their interconnections, we can cultivate a greater appreciation for how art shapes and reflects human history, inspiring future generations of artists and thinkers. This article explores influential transitions, shedding light on how one artistic philosophy inspires and informs the next, creating a continuous and interconnected history of creativity. Early Modern Movements 1. Renaissance → Mannerism The Renaissance celebrated realism, symmetry, and classical ideals, reaching its zenith through masters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. However, Mannerism emerged as a response, pushing boundaries with elongated forms and exaggerated perspectives. Mannerist artists such as Pontormo and Parmigianino sought to explore emotional intensity and complexity, moving beyond the harmonious ideals of the Renaissance. This transition marked a shift towards more experimental, personal expressions of art, reflecting the tensions and uncertainties of the late 16th century. Mannerism, thus, challenged the structured beauty of the Renaissance, paving the way for new artistic explorations that embraced ambiguity and distortion. 2. Mannerism → Baroque Baroque art followed Mannerism, emphasizing grandeur, drama, and movement. Artists like Caravaggio used chiaroscuro to heighten emotional impact, while Bernini's sculptures conveyed intense energy and spirituality. Rooted in the Counter-Reformation, Baroque art aimed to inspire awe and devotion among viewers. This movement embraced Mannerism's emotional depth but balanced it with a sense of clarity and purpose. Baroque art's theatricality and dynamic compositions marked a dramatic shift, reflecting the religious and political fervor of the 17th century. Through its elaborate forms and striking visuals, Baroque became a powerful tool for storytelling and spiritual engagement. 3. Baroque → Rococo As the Baroque period waned, Rococo emerged in 18th-century France, shifting from grandeur to lighthearted elegance. Artists like Fragonard favored playful themes, pastel hues, and intricate ornamentation, reflecting the leisure and decadence of the French aristocracy. While Baroque art sought to inspire awe, Rococo emphasized intimacy and sensuality. The movement's decorative style extended to architecture and interior design, celebrating refinement and frivolity. However, Rococo's emphasis on indulgence faced criticism during the Enlightenment, setting the stage for the rise of Neoclassicism. Despite this, its focus on beauty and detail remains influential in decorative arts and design. 4. Rococo → Neoclassicism Neoclassicism arose as a reaction against Rococo's perceived excess, drawing inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art. Artists like Jacques-Louis David championed moral seriousness, simplicity, and symmetry, aligning with Enlightenment ideals. The movement reflected a broader cultural shift towards rationality and civic virtue, particularly during the French Revolution. Neoclassical art used clean lines and heroic themes to convey timeless values and universal truths. This transition from Rococo's frivolity to Neoclassicism's discipline mirrored changing societal priorities. By reviving classical antiquity, Neoclassicism established a foundation for modern art's emphasis on form and function. 5. Neoclassicism → Romanticism Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a counterpoint to Neoclassicism's rationality, celebrating emotion, nature, and individualism. Artists like Caspar David Friedrich and William Blake explored themes of the sublime, depicting nature as a source of beauty and terror. Romanticism also embraced subjectivity, imagination, and the mystical, challenging Enlightenment ideals. This movement reflected the upheavals of the Industrial Revolution and societal shifts towards personal freedom. By prioritizing the emotional and the transcendental, Romanticism influenced literature, music, and art, creating a profound legacy that continues to resonate in creative expression. Modern and Pre-Modern Movements 6. Romanticism → Realism Realism emerged as a reaction to Romanticism's idealism, focusing on everyday life and social realities. Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet depicted rural labor and ordinary people with unvarnished honesty, rejecting Romantic heroism. This movement reflected the societal changes brought by industrialization and urbanization, highlighting class struggles and human dignity. Realism's commitment to truth-telling laid the groundwork for modern art's explorations of contemporary themes. By turning attention to the mundane and the overlooked, Realism expanded art's scope, encouraging artists to engage with their environments and present authentic narratives. 7. Realism → Impressionism Building upon Realism's focus on contemporary life, Impressionism explored fleeting moments and the effects of light. Artists like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas painted en plein air, capturing the vibrancy of modernity in loose brushstrokes and vibrant palettes. Impressionism broke from academic traditions, prioritizing immediacy and sensory experience over meticulous detail. This movement reflected the rapid transformations of 19th-century urban life, including industrialization and leisure culture. By emphasizing spontaneity and movement, Impressionism paved the way for further experimentation, challenging conventions and inspiring future generations of artists. 8. Impressionism → Post-Impressionism Post-Impressionism extended Impressionism's innovations, emphasizing emotion, symbolism, and structure. Artists like Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin moved beyond capturing fleeting impressions, exploring deeper psychological and spiritual themes. Paul Cézanne's focus on form and geometry laid the foundation for Cubism, while van Gogh's emotive color use influenced Expressionism. This movement bridged the gap between Impressionism's lightness and modern art's abstraction. By reinterpreting Impressionist techniques, Post-Impressionists expanded the possibilities of visual storytelling, fostering a diverse range of artistic expressions that shaped the 20th-century avant-garde. 9. Post-Impressionism → Fauvism Inspired by Post-Impressionism's bold use of color, Fauvism emphasized emotional power and aesthetic freedom. Henri Matisse and André Derain used vivid, non-naturalistic colors to create works that resonated with energy and joy. Fauvism sought to liberate color from its descriptive function, focusing on its expressive potential. This movement rejected realism, embracing abstraction as a tool for personal and emotional exploration. Although short-lived, Fauvism's radical approach to color and form profoundly influenced later movements like Expressionism and Abstract Art, marking a turning point in the evolution of modern art. 10. Post-Impressionism → Expressionism Similarly, Expressionism built on Post-Impressionism's emotional depth, channeling personal and societal anxiety into bold, distorted imagery. Artists like Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele depicted raw emotion, often using dark palettes and exaggerated forms to convey existential themes. Expressionism reflected the turmoil of early 20th-century Europe, addressing themes of alienation and psychological conflict. This movement expanded the boundaries of artistic expression, paving the way for Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. By prioritizing emotion over realism, Expressionism inspired artists to explore the inner workings of the human psyche, fostering a profound legacy of introspective creativity. 20th Century Avant-Garde Movements 11. Expressionism → Surrealism Expressionism's exploration of emotion and psychological depth influenced Surrealism, which delved into the unconscious mind. Inspired by Freud's theories, Surrealist artists like Salvador Dalí and Max Ernst created dreamlike, fantastical images. Surrealism extended Expressionism's introspection, adding a focus on the irrational and the mysterious. While Expressionism depicted emotional struggles, Surrealism sought to visualize the hidden and surreal aspects of human experience. This movement celebrated the unpredictable, challenging traditional artistic boundaries. By combining Expressionism's intensity with new intellectual frameworks, Surrealism expanded the horizons of art, influencing not only visual mediums but also literature, film, and theater. 12. Fauvism → Cubism While Fauvism celebrated color, Cubism deconstructed form. Pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism fragmented objects into geometric shapes, presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously. Fauvism's simplified forms inspired Cubism's break from realism, but Cubism pursued intellectual depth rather than Fauvism's emotive expression. This movement reflected the rapidly changing perceptions of space and time in the early 20th century, influenced by scientific advancements and industrialization. Cubism's innovative approach redefined art, inspiring Futurism, Abstract Art, and beyond. Its radical departure from tradition positioned it as one of the most influential movements in modern art. 13. Cubism → Futurism Cubism's fragmented representation of space and motion profoundly influenced Futurism, which celebrated speed, technology, and modernity. Italian artists like Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla embraced Cubist techniques to depict the dynamism of the machine age. Futurism extended Cubism's geometric abstraction, incorporating movement and energy into its compositions. This movement was deeply intertwined with the cultural and political fervor of early 20th-century Europe, reflecting the era's fascination with progress and innovation. By merging Cubism's aesthetic with a celebration of modernity, Futurism contributed to the avant-garde's ongoing redefinition of art's role in society. 14. Cubism → Abstract Art Cubism's reduction of form also influenced Abstract Art, which moved towards complete non-representation. Wassily Kandinsky, often credited as the first abstract painter, expanded on Cubism's innovations, focusing on the spiritual and emotional resonance of color and shape. Abstract Art rejected the need for recognizable subjects, emphasizing the expressive power of visual elements themselves. Inspired by Cubism's intellectual rigor, this movement opened new avenues for artistic exploration. By prioritizing abstraction, artists like Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian transformed art into a medium for universal ideas, laying the groundwork for countless modern movements. 15. Dadaism → Surrealism Dadaism's anti-establishment ethos and embrace of absurdity directly influenced Surrealism. Emerging during World War I, Dada artists like Marcel Duchamp rejected traditional art forms, instead using readymades and nonsensical works to critique societal norms. Surrealists adopted this rebellious spirit, channeling it into explorations of dreams and subconscious thought. While Dadaism embraced chaos and randomness, Surrealism sought to uncover deeper psychological truths. The two movements shared a disdain for conventional art, challenging viewers to question reality itself. By merging Dada's playfulness with intellectual depth, Surrealism created a lasting impact on modern art and culture. Abstract and Conceptual Developments 16. Suprematism → Constructivism Suprematism, led by Kazimir Malevich, emphasized pure geometric abstraction, stripping art of representational content. Constructivism built upon these principles, focusing on the practical application of abstract forms in design, architecture, and propaganda. Artists like Vladimir Tatlin used art to serve societal needs, aligning with the Russian Revolution's ethos. While Suprematism prioritized spiritual purity, Constructivism embraced functionality and materiality. This transition reflected a broader shift in art's purpose, moving from individual expression to collective utility. By merging abstraction with practicality, Constructivism laid the foundation for modern design and industrial aesthetics. 17. Constructivism → De Stijl Constructivism's geometric rigor influenced De Stijl, a movement dedicated to achieving universal harmony through abstraction. Artists like Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg reduced forms to vertical and horizontal lines, using primary colors to create balanced compositions. De Stijl expanded on Constructivism's ideas, seeking to integrate art, architecture, and design into a cohesive aesthetic. This movement reflected the modernist desire for order and clarity in a rapidly industrializing world. By focusing on simplicity and universality, De Stijl shaped modern art and design, influencing movements like the Bauhaus and Minimalism. 18. De Stijl → Bauhaus The Bauhaus movement drew heavily from De Stijl's minimalist aesthetic, combining art with functionality. Founded by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to unify creative disciplines, integrating art, design, and architecture. De Stijl's emphasis on geometric abstraction informed Bauhaus principles, particularly in its approach to modernist design. Bauhaus artists like Paul Klee and Josef Albers expanded these ideas, applying them to mass production and industrial design. This movement revolutionized art education and practice, emphasizing the intersection of beauty and utility. By adapting De Stijl's ideals, the Bauhaus became a cornerstone of 20th-century modernism. 19. Bauhaus → Minimalism Minimalism grew out of Bauhaus principles, embracing simplicity, form, and function. Artists like Donald Judd and Agnes Martin reduced art to its essential elements, stripping away ornamentation. Minimalism rejected narrative and symbolism, focusing instead on materiality and spatial relationships. The movement reflected Bauhaus ideas about industrial design, but it also responded to Abstract Expressionism's emotive excess. By prioritizing clarity and precision, Minimalism reshaped contemporary art, architecture, and design. Its influence extends beyond the visual arts, permeating fields like fashion, music, and technology. 20. Abstract Expressionism → Pop Art Abstract Expressionism's bold, emotive gestures influenced Pop Art's dynamic imagery. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein adapted the scale and immediacy of Abstract Expressionism but replaced abstraction with recognizable cultural symbols. Pop Art celebrated consumer culture and mass media, critiquing post-war materialism. This movement merged high and low art, reflecting the changing nature of modern society. By reinterpreting Abstract Expressionism's techniques in a commercial context, Pop Art created a new visual language, bridging the avant-garde and popular culture. Postmodern and Contemporary Movements 21. Pop Art → Postmodernism Pop Art's critique of consumer culture set the stage for Postmodernism's broader challenge to traditional narratives. Postmodern artists embraced pastiche, irony, and fragmentation, rejecting the notion of universal truth. Movements like Neo-Pop and Appropriation Art drew directly from Pop Art's playfulness and critique. By deconstructing cultural symbols, Postmodernism questioned authority and celebrated diversity. This transition reflected shifting societal attitudes towards pluralism and subjectivity. Postmodernism's legacy continues to shape contemporary art, design, and media. 22. Minimalism → Conceptual Art Minimalism's emphasis on essential forms influenced Conceptual Art, which prioritized ideas over physical objects. Artists like Sol LeWitt and Joseph Kosuth focused on intellectual engagement, using text, instructions, and ephemeral materials to convey meaning. This movement redefined the art object, challenging viewers to rethink traditional notions of creativity and authorship. By expanding Minimalism's reductive approach, Conceptual Art opened new possibilities for artistic expression, influencing installation, performance, and digital art. 23. Conceptual Art → Performance Art Conceptual Art's focus on ideas extended into Performance Art, where the artist's body and actions became the medium. Marina Abramović and Yoko Ono used performance to explore themes of identity, endurance, and audience interaction. Performance Art rejected static forms, emphasizing temporality and experience. This transition reflected a broader shift towards participatory and experiential art. By merging Conceptual Art's intellectualism with live action, Performance Art created a new dialogue between artist and viewer. 24. Performance Art → Installation Art Performance Art's immersive qualities influenced Installation Art, which engaged viewers in spatial and sensory experiences. Artists like Olafur Eliasson and Yayoi Kusama created environments that blurred the boundaries between art and audience. Installation Art expanded the scope of artistic practice, incorporating light, sound, and technology. This movement reflected a desire to create holistic, multisensory experiences. By building on Performance Art's dynamism, Installation Art transformed how audiences interact with art, redefining its role in contemporary culture. 25. Surrealism → Psychedelic Art Surrealism's exploration of altered realities inspired the vibrant, fantastical imagery of Psychedelic Art in the 1960s. Artists embraced vivid colors, swirling forms, and mystical themes, reflecting countercultural movements and interest in altered states of consciousness. This movement reinterpreted Surrealism's dreamlike qualities, infusing them with a sense of rebellion and experimentation. Psychedelic Art's influence extended beyond visual media, shaping music, fashion, and graphic design. Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Continuum of Art Art movements are rarely isolated phenomena; they are threads in a larger tapestry of human expression. Each 'ism' carries the DNA of its predecessors while carving new paths for the future. This interconnectedness not only reflects the evolution of artistic thought but also mirrors broader cultural, social, and technological transformations. As artists continue to innovate, the legacy of past movements ensures that the dialogue between tradition and experimentation remains vibrant and enduring.

Time For A Regional Response To An Emboldened Trump – OpEd	When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, the conventional wisdom was that we should take him seriously but not literally. This time, we ought to take him literally, too. Since his victory, he has announced a number of appointments — Robert F Kennedy for Health Secretary; Pete Hegseth for Defence; Marco Rubio for State; and Michael Waltz as National Security Adviser, to name a few — that suggests that the major ruptures promised during his campaign are likely to come to pass. Trump’s economic objectives are mutually incoherent: he wants to replace income taxes with tariffs, rebuild American manufacturing and keep inflation low. But the more effective his tariffs are in promoting domestic industries, the less revenue they will raise; conversely, if he wants to keep tariff revenue high and inflation in check, the only way would be an appreciation of the dollar which would hurt American manufacturers. Prepare, then, for a confused set of economic policies in Trump’s second term, and a transactional foreign policy that seeks flashy ‘wins’, probably at the expense of American strategic dominance. In many Asian capitals, the reaction to Trump’s return to the White House has been relatively sanguine. Trump’s first time posed major challenges for the region, of course, but the savvier leaders — former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe chief among them — learned to play on both his vanity and his venality to get by. His trade war with China caused great disruption to the most important economic relationship in the world, but it also created opportunities for other economies, most notably Vietnam, which saw major increases in American demand for the kinds of consumption good markets in which it already specialised and in which Chinese competitors had been rendered uncompetitive by Trump’s tariffs. But it would be a mistake for individual Asian countries to ignore the kind of damage that Trump is likely to do to the global system in the interests of securing a favoured position at Trump’s court. Indeed, the biggest danger for the region would be for each country alone to try to strike their own bargain with Trump. This was more or less the approach taken in the first Trump presidency, and as Shiro Armstrong argues in this week’s lead article, it was a tactical victory for some but a strategic bust for Asia as a whole. The World Trade Organization has still not recovered from the damage done by a bipartisan string of US Presidents, beginning with Obama, who have blocked the appointment of new appellate judges and left the WTO’s rule-enforcing power neutered. Former Director-General of the WTO Pascal Lamy has called for a broad front between the European Union and China to help protect global trade under Trump, but with powerful protectionist forces aligning in Brussels and deep distrust in Beijing, building such a coalition will be fraught. The region with the most to lose from an even more aggressively protectionist Trump is Asia, and so it is to Asia that the world looks for leadership in protecting the system of rules and institutions that have done so much to promote economic growth in Asia and in the world in general since 1945. The temptation for big players that are likely to be targeted by Trump again — most importantly, China and the European Union — will be to play tit-for-tat and retaliate with tariffs. While this may solve some domestic political problems, the economic effects of a generalised trade war would be devastating, particularly in Asia. Asia’s middle powers, Armstrong argues, need to mobilise to convince major powers that retaliation is not in their own interests. Trump’s wrong-headed policies will be their own punishment: there is no need for China to try to inflict more. Far more important, for China (which lacks allies) and for Asia more generally, is that the global trade system is insulated as best as possible from the deleterious effects of Trump’s almost guaranteed efforts to sabotage it. This will not be easy. Faith in Beijing’s good intentions is still at a low point, particularly following China’s naked attempts to coerce countries like Australia in recent years. Yet, as Armstrong notes, the institutional foundations for this kind of effort exist already, even if they need reinforcing: ASEAN-centred institutions like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in Asia need to be connected to European collective action. The stakes are high enough that a concerted effort from middle powers across Asia to stitch together a collective response to protectionist provocation in the United States is worth the diplomatic trouble. ‘The multilateral trading system is the biggest source of economic security for open trading nations’, Armstrong argues, and in a world that is fracturing on geopolitical lines, strengthening the open economic order is not just an economic mission, it is a national security imperative as well.

Contrasting Expectations For A Russia-Ukraine Settlement – OpEd	In his dramatic shift away from arming the Kiev regime, Donald Trump's Secretary of State Marko Rubio says he's now against funding a 'stalemate' concerning the NATO proxy war against Russia. The use of the word stalemate misrepresents the actual situation in a way that serves to prolong a conflict which Trump correctly said should've never happened. Since February 24, 2022, the start of Russia's Special Miliary Operation (SMO), the Russian military has qualitatively and quantitively gotten stronger with the Kiev regime going in reverse. During this same period, Russia's economy has fared comparably better than that of the EU. For all practical purposes, the Kiev regime doesn't have a functioning economy. In the US, the overall population face considerable socioeconomic challenges and is therefore reluctant to see massive aid going to Project Ukraine. This is a key motivating reason for Trump's resounding victory over the Democratic Party establishment. A limited American military engagement abroad enables a Trump administration concentration on US domestic concerns. In his changed position, Rubio notes that Ukraine is better off with a practical peace settlement which maintains the former Soviet republic as a functioning state. The US foreign policy establishment peace proposals are out of whack with reality. Shortly before Trump's decisive victory, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, gave an unrealistic commentary in Foreign Affairs. Contrary to Haass, Russia has already rejected the idea of a ceasefire for the purpose of building up Kiev regime military capability, as well as a 10-20 year wait on whether Ukraine can join NATO. As the party winning and most likely to win the NATO proxy war against it, Russia will have a great say on the settlement terms. Haass' selective BS (when applied to Russia) about ethically not redrawing boundaries via force is pretty rich given what NATO has done regarding Kosovo. Borders continue to be redrawn elsewhere via armed conflict. South Sudan is a recent example. In the not-too-distant past, Germany was reunified after it had been forcefully separated. Hence, it's not so out of the ordinary for some culturally, historically, linguistically and religiously Russian territory to be reunited. Mirroring Haass, New York former Republican Governor Geroge Pataki said on a November 12 WABC New York Talk Radio show (at the 40:24 mark) that aggression shouldn't be rewarded. He wasn't referring to neocon, neolib, neo-Nazi Banderite aggression. Rather, an overly selective and inaccurate overview on his part. The Hungarian-American Pataki is no Viktor Orban or Péter Szijjártó. Among the considerably better American commentators getting some establishment play, there's room for valid disagreement. James Webb of the Quincy Institute is the brilliant son of a former US Secretary of the Navy and Virginia Senator. In a November 12 segment on The Duran (at the 1:00:38 mark), Webb spoke of a hypothetical geopolitical exchange involving a Russian military withdrawal from Syria. For the purpose of satisfying Western neocon and neolib feelings, there's no need for this. Russia's number of military bases in the Middle East and elsewhere dwarfs that of the US. In Syria, the Russian armed presence is welcomed by the internationally recognized Syrian government unlike the current US troop deployment there. The secular Syrian government (which BTW is preferred by the majority of Syrian Christians) sought Russian, Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah help in combating Sunni extremists affiliated with either ISIS or Al Qaeda. Even with the Russian settlement terms, the collective Western foreign policy establishment can brag (albeit erroneously) about: - NATO adding two new members (Finland and Sweden, thus further extending itself) - how Putin didn't take all of Ukraine (not that he ever actually attempted to do such). At this time, a Russian proposed settlement is along these lines: - strictly adhered to Ukrainian neutrality, with a limited Ukrainian armed forces - all of Zaporozhe, Donetsk, Lugansk and Kherson going to Russia - end of SMO related sanctions against Russia - complete release of Russian 'frozen' (stolen) assets - protection of Russian identity (like language use) within Ukraine's Communist drawn boundary - discussion on a new Euro-Atlantic security arrangement. A year ago, the Kiev regime could've gotten a better deal. Going back further, the Minsk Accords was an even better option for it. The longer the proxy war against Russia continues, the greater the likelihood of the Kiev regime losing more Ukrainian territory. Don't be fooled by the clownishly pompous likes of Sebastian Gorka. On a November 16 RT aired show (at the 15:45 mark), Gorka said that if Russia refused a Trump peace proposal, the incoming US president will flood Ukraine with arms. Like Pataki, the Brit-Hungarian-American Gorka is no Orban or Szijjártó. Seasoned military analysts including Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud, Brian Berletic, Lawrence Wilkerson, Douglas Macgregor, Mark Sleboda and Scott Ritter, have conclusively shown how the Collective West is pretty much tapped out on what it can (within reason) militarily provide the Kiev regime, in conjunction with a dwindling number of available Kiev regime armed forces personnel. Daniel Davis has astutely detailed why the recently reported move by the Biden administration isn't going to change the eventual outcome.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUEc9vuLKzxCG	2024-11-18T16:47:46-08:00	
New Administration, New Outlook And New Action On Myanmar – OpEd	With the conclusion of the 60th U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump declared the 47th president, all eyes are on the incoming administration’s approach to domestic and foreign affairs when it assumes office on January 20, 2025. It’s essential to objectively observe the changes to come, as the campaign season was marked by bold rhetoric and sensational media coverage. While domestic economic priorities remain critical, the Trump administration faces equally daunting challenges on the global stage. As a leader in addressing crises worldwide, the U.S. must respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war in Gaza, terrorist activities in the Middle East, nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, and increasing strategic tensions with China—a dominant global economy and rising military power. The nominations of China hardliners Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State and Representative Tim Waltz as National Security Adviser indicate a tough stance on China, including security issues that extend beyond trade and tariffs. 1 However, Donald Trump is unlikely to pursue direct confrontation with Xi Jinping. Instead, his administration may adopt a restrained strategy, recognizing that American resources are finite and should be directed where they matter most. This approach could focus on countering China’s assertive actions in the Pacific by empowering allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia to maintain regional stability.2 While the U.S. concentrates on the South China Sea as a critical region for national security, Myanmar represents a significant oversight. For China, Myanmar provides vital access to the Indian Ocean, offering an alternative trade route to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Myanmar also plays a key role in the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As Myanmar’s largest investor, China seeks to dominate the region to protect its interests, including securing rare earth element (REE) imports from Myanmar. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s REE imports in 2022. A shortage of REE essential for military and technological advancements would be considered a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. However, since Myanmar's military ousted its democratically elected government on February 1st, 2021, the country has been engulfed in conflict. A nationwide resistance movement has united ethnic groups and opposition factions into a coalition against the junta’s oppressive regime, ushering in what is now called the Spring Revolution. Initially, China has maintained backdoor diplomacy with various factions while ensuring minimal U.S. involvement. Although it seeks to maximize influence, Beijing opposes the junta's collapse, fearing National Unity Government (NUG), which it perceived as a pro-Western, could gain power. 3,4 Since late 2023 and early 2024, the military has lost control of 60% of the territories of the country. In response, China has become more proactive, pressuring resistance forces for ceasefires, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. China has reportedly proposed establishing a joint security company with military regime to ensure the safety of Chinese projects and personnel. The news followed a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing on August 14, 2024. The report has raised fears of potential Chinese troop involvement in Myanmar through this proposed security company.5On November 6, 2024, Myanmar’s junta leader met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Kunming, Yunnan. Li expressed support for Myanmar's 'political reconciliation and transformation' to advance the construction of CMEC under the BRI.6 The Biden administration condemned the coup, imposed targeted sanctions, and supported limited humanitarian assistance. Senator Marco Rubio joined three other bipartisan members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in issuing a letter to urge President Joe Biden to help preserve democracy in Myanmar by outlining the key steps including to call for the immediate release of political prisoners and impose targeted sanctions on the senior leadership of the military and affiliated individuals.7 The US and Western democracies are providing important, but limited engagements on humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy despite the Burma Act passed in December 2022, that provides a framework for engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar. The US, EU, UK and Canada imposed targeted sanctions with limited impact on coffer for military to acquire jet fuels and weapons due to piecemeal implementation and lack of cooperation from the neighbors. China, India and ASEAN will now through combination of persuasion and pressure have proposed so called 'all-inclusive dialogue' about cease-fire, humanitarian aid, and sham elections that lack credibility. These initiatives will face colossal failure just like the Five-Point Consensus since the military will not accept to abandon its political dominance, kleptocratic-economic conglomerate and centralization dogma. The negotiated settlement will not succeed unless the military accepts civilian oversight and relinquishes its involvement in politics and impunity. Meanwhile, lost time due to the endless empty talks will prolong civilian suffering with no end to the military’s reign of terror against its own population.8 The new Trump administration must recognize the Myanmar crisis as a war of terror by the junta against its people, rather than a conflict between political factions. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces aligns with a restrained strategy in neutralizing China’s unchecked influence in the region. The U.S. should lead by formally recognizing the NUG. This move would encourage ASEAN, Western democracies, and neighboring countries to follow suit, fostering meaningful dialogue among anti-junta stakeholders, delivering humanitarian aid, and enforcing coordinated effective sanctions to cut off the junta’s resources. Empowering the NUG would allow Myanmar to break free from China’s shadow, consolidate resistance groups, and establish good governance and monetary institutions in liberated areas. This approach could deter Myanmar from becoming a failed state or a rogue regime like North Korea. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces offers the U.S. a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to counter China’s influence in Southeast Asia. A decisive, transparent policy that strengthens partnerships with allies and communicates effectively with Beijing would signal that the U.S. seeks balance, not Cold War-style dominance, in the region. 9 By prioritizing Myanmar, the U.S. could bolster regional security, promote democracy, and neutralize China’s monopoly in Southeast Asia, securing strategic gains for the U.S. in the era of heightened competition between the world’s two most powerful nations.9 References:	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUNJTUwvZPZ9O	2024-11-18T16:45:50-08:00	
Thank You For Emitting: The Hypocrisies Of COP29 – OpEd	COP29 was always going to be memorable, for no other reason than the hosting country, Azerbaijan, is a petrostate indifferent to the issue of emissions and scornful of ecological preachers. It has seen its natural gas supply grow by 128% between 2000 and 2021. Between 2006 and 2021, gas exports rose by a monumental 29,290%. A dizzying 95% of the country’s exports are made up of oil and gas, with much of its wealth failing to trickle down to the rest of the populace. The broadly described West, as stated by President Ilham Aliyev in his opening address to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was in no position to be lecturing his country about cutting back on the use of fossil fuels. They were, he grandly claimed, 'a gift from God'. In this, he should have surprised no one. In April 2024, he declared that, as a leader of a country 'which is rich in fossil fuels, of course, we will defend the right of these countries to continue investments and to continue production.' A few days later, Aliyev played the other side of the climate change divide, suggesting at a meeting with island leaders that France and the Netherlands had been responsible for 'brutally' suppressing the 'voices' of communities in such overseas territories as Mayotte and Curaçao concerned with climate change. (Aliyev himself is no stranger to suppressing, with dedicated brutality, voices of dissent within his own country.) This proved too much for France’s Ecological Transition Minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who cancelled her planned attendance to the summit while attacking Baku for 'instrumentalising the fight against climate change for its undignified personal agenda.' On the second day of the summit, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, tried to turn the attention of delegates to the urgent matter at hand. 'The sound you hear is the ticking clock – we are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and time is not on our side.' Others, however, heard the sound of money changing hands, with the fossil fuel industry lurking, fangs and pens at the ready, presided over by the good offices of a petrostate. In the background lie assessments of gloomy inevitability. The Climate Change Tracker’s November 2024 briefing notes this year was one characterised by 'minimal progress, with almost no new national climate change targets (NDCs) or net zero pledges even though government have agreed to (urgently) strengthen their 2030 targets and to align them with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.' As easy as it is to rage against the opportunistic Aliyev, who crudely blends environmentalism with ethnic cleansing, few attending the summit in Baku come with clean hands. As with previous COP events, Baku offers another enormous event of emitters and emission, featuring tens of thousands of officials, advisors and minders bloviating in conference. That said, the 67,000 registrants at this conference is somewhat lower compared with the 83,000 who descended on Dubai at COP28. The plane tracking website FlightRadar24 noted that 65 private jets landed in the Azerbaijani capital prior to the summit, prompting Alethea Warrington, the head of energy, aviation and heat at Possible, a climate action charity, to tut with heavy disapproval: 'Travelling by private jet is a horrendous waste of the world’s scarce remaining carbon budget, with each journey producing more emissions in a few hours than the average person around the world emits in an entire year.' COP29 is also another opportunity to strike deals that have little to do with reducing emissions and everything to do with advancing the interests of lobby groups and companies in the energy market, much of it of a fossil fuel nature. In the spirit of Dubai, COP29 is set to follow in the footsteps of the wily Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who chaired COP28 in Dubai. Prior to the arrival of the chatterati of climate change last year, the Sultan was shown in leaked briefing documents to the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) to be an avid enthusiast for advancing the business of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). It was hard to avoid the glaring fact that Al Jaber is also the CEO of Adnoc. The documents in question involve over 150 pages of briefings prepared by the COP28 team for meetings with Jaber and various interested parties held between July and October this year. They point to plans to raise matters of commercial interest with as many as 30 countries. The CCR confirms 'that on at least one occasion a nation followed up on commercial discussions brought up in a meeting with Al Jaber; a source with knowledge of discussions also told CCR that Adnoc’s business interests were allegedly raised during a meeting with another country.' The COP29 chairman, Samir Nuriyev, had already put out feelers as early as March this year that a 'fair approach' was needed when approaching countries abundant with oil and natural gas, notably in light of their purported environmental policies. He went so far as to argue that Azerbaijan was an ideal interlocutor between the Global South and Global North. His colleague and chief executive of the COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, showed exactly how that process would work in a secret recording ahead of the conference in which he discusses 'investment opportunities' in the state oil and gas company with a person posing as a potential investor. (The person in question purported to be representing a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm with a sharp line in energy.) 'We have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed,' Soltanov insists. 'We will have a certain amount of oil and gas being produced, perhaps forever.' In many ways, the Baku gathering has all the hallmarks of a criminal syndicate meeting, held under more open conditions. Fair play, then, to the Azerbaijani hosts for working out the climate change racket, taking the lead from Dubai last year. Aliyev and company noted months in advance that this was less a case of being a theatre of the absurd than a forum for business. And so, it is proving to be.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUKnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-18T16:43:44-08:00	
Indo-Pacific Strategies Of BRICS And The Quad: Digitalization As ...	The recent 16th BRICS Summit, held in October of this year, gave fresh momentum to the group's digital and geopolitical strategies, especially in the Indo-Pacific. The outcome of this summit is likely to have direct implications for the core themes of digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, and the ongoing competition with the Quad. The summit also announced the inclusion of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE, into its fold, thus promising to strengthen BRICS' outreach into regions that have high digital infrastructure potential. Russia announced its framework for the Digital Silk Road, which ties directly into creating a parallel digital ecosystem across member states. This expanded BRICS connectivity plan could rival Quad-led infrastructure projects like the Blue Dot Network, especially in underserved areas of the Indo-Pacific. Quad's focus on open, secure, and resilient infrastructure may face stiffer competition now as BRICS consolidates its influence through larger membership and shared resources. These raise a few questions: how will the inclusion of new BRICS members reshape the digital landscape in the Indo-Pacific? How will Quad nations respond to BRICS' ambitions in cybersecurity and digital infrastructure? The Quad strategically focuses on the Indo-Pacific with a primary focus on security in the Indo-Pacific, countering China’s growing influence, and promoting a free, open, and inclusive region. On the other hand, BRICS is not strictly Indo-Pacific-centric. However, China and India, key BRICS members, have major stakes in the area. Russia, through its 'pivot to Asia' strategy, has also increased engagement. Such an architecture creates indirect interactions, as BRICS and Quad member states pursue their objectives in the same geographic theater. While the US’s 'pivot to Asia' is a counterbalancing mechanism to contain the resurgent China, Russia’s strategy is to diversify from the West and strengthen ties with Asia. QUAD is often seen as a security alliance, though it lacks formalized military commitments. India is both in the BRICS and QUAD groupings and this puts it in a unique position to exercise what is known as ‘strategic autonomy’. In the Quad, India aligns with democracies like the US, Japan, and Australia to address security concerns, particularly about maritime security cooperation and China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific. At BRICS, India collaborates with emerging economies, this time again with China, to address different sets of issues about global economic and development challenges and emphasize a multipolar world order. To an extent, India has been utilizing this unique presence in both groups to balance its security interests with its economic and geopolitical priorities and often acting as a bridge between the Global North (Quad) and Global South (BRICS). See Fig 1: the network graph illustrating India’s association. Fig 1: India is a member of both BRICS and QUAD groupings In discussions at the recent BRICS summit there was increased emphasis on technological collaboration in AI. China's leadership has potentially set the tone for other members to take an interest in this. The UAE, which has a strong focus on AI development ( it is also ranked among the top nations in AI readiness), has brought added expertise to the table, bolstering BRICS' collective capabilities. AI-driven innovations have significant potential that could enhance BRICS' ability to offer competitive digital solutions in the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, Quad nations may need to accelerate their AI initiatives to counter BRICS' collective technological capabilities, especially as AI becomes a decisive factor in digital economies. In light of Russia and China advocating state-controlled cyberspaces, the BRICS summit's emphasis on cybersecurity frameworks directly aligns with the group's push for digital sovereignty. The proposed collaboration on cyber threat mitigation could be strategic and has the potential of establishing BRICS as a significant player in the global cybersecurity dialogue, challenging Quad-led initiatives. Cybersecurity discussions also included creating suitable safeguards against interference in national data systems, impacting Indo-Pacific digital trust networks. Quad's collaborative cyber defense efforts may need to scale up to address the increasing sophistication of BRICS-led frameworks. BRICS reassured its commitment to strengthening digital economies through projects like the New Development Bank (NDB)'s digital transformation and digital infrastructure programs. NDB, formally known as the BRICS Development Bank, finances infrastructure and sustainable development projects of emerging economies. In the meeting, there was particular emphasis on collaboration in blockchain and fintech-related areas. This initiative positions BRICS as a strong contender in shaping the Indo-Pacific’s digital economy. In contrast, Quad nations may need to bolster their digital economy projects in the region to counter BRICS' growing influence in areas such as digital payment systems. With an expanded membership, BRICS could further facilitate more widespread adoption of 'BRICS-driven technologies' in the Indo-Pacific. Huawei has been continuing to lead 5G projects among BRICS member states. Hence Quad must focus on secure and transparent 5G networks. This is crucial if it has to counter BRICS' technological advancements. There are some issues with Quad's digital openness model. The model may need to articulate clearer policies on balancing sovereignty and openness to maintain its influence in the Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the BRICS summit’s focus on digital sovereignty has underscored the importance of national control over cyberspace. In the current summit, the discussions included how dependence on US-led tech ecosystems could be reduced. Its expanded membership and push for advanced AI and cybersecurity initiatives, highlight a comprehensive strategy that could challenge Quad's dominance. This evolving rivalry highlights the urgent need for a deeper analysis of how digitalization shapes geopolitics in this critical region. There is a variation in the strategies of 'technology as a geopolitical tool' with a focus on two groups of countries embedded in different (yet interconnected) geopolitical contexts, namely the Quad and BRICS. As a result of this commitment to technology, both groups have developed respective strategies that cast technology as a geopolitical tool. The BRICS Strategy for Economic Partnership employs soft measures to reach geopolitical goals by setting rule-based cooperation frameworks in the developing part of the continent and using global cooperation law. The strategy was directed mostly at China, scaling up its involvement in these directions. The actors of the Quad, in contrast, have much less commitment toward developing such initiatives, and thus they use hard power measures to attain geopolitical aims - a comprehensive approach to allocate diplomatic pressure and funds for reducing China’s influence in these regions as an answer to its earlier policies. On the one hand, BRICS, the relative latecomer, attempts to push digitalization further in the direction of multipolarity, promoting inter-civilizational dialogue, developing cooperative formats with African nations, and providing digital access to those left out or marginalized by the major digital platforms. On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific Quad exhibits the efforts invested by the rising powers in promoting their strategies for digitalization in the regional architectural space as a statement of their ability to shape regional dynamics. As a geopolitical tool, the alliances within and between BRICS and the Quad are distinct. While intra-quad pacts are non-binding, the one signed with the EU has also gained significance because it is format-exclusive. Intra-BRICS arrangements, on the other hand, are binding owing to the multilateral nature, interests, and responsibilities of the signatory states. The difference between the two regional digital strategies is not only about ideology but also about interests and forces that drive the geopolitics of connectivity and digitalization. As a leading member, China shapes BRICS’ agenda to align with its interests, often countering Western hegemony. Quad, on the other hand, explicitly seeks to counterbalance China’s assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific. India’s presence in both groups reflects its practical approach to balancing competition with cooperation. Future research may help in gauging how the relative power structure may indeed begin changing once digital generations, beyond 5G, take an avowed center stage. For instance, hypothesizing how a post-quantum world or scenarios where pervasive AI comes into play may produce different structural and systemic realities. It is suggested that while there may indeed be areas as this trend develops, where BRICS countries and Quad members may incipiently end up cooperating, future scenarios, given the terrain, may also reveal that both camps may primarily and increasingly be juxtaposed against each other as they promote their 'digital' strategies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUOroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-18T16:41:37-08:00	
Tectonic Shift In Sri Lankan Tamil Politics – Analysis	In the November 14 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections, the minority Tamils broke away from ethnic parties and supported the all-island, left wing, National Peoples' Power (NPP) in a tectonic political shift. As predicted by most, the National Peoples' Power (NPP) swept the Sinhala-dominated areas of Sri Lanka in the November 14 parliamentary elections. The NPP had the reputation of being a Sinhala nationalist party and its fortunes were on the upswing given the alienation of the other national parties from the public. But what came as a surprise was the NPP's sterling performance in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated areas of North and East Sri Lanka. Breaking with a seven-decade tradition, Sri Lankan Tamils flocked to the all-island National Peoples' Power (NPP) party in preference to ethnic Tamil parties, including the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK). Concern for good governance appears to have weighed in substantially. Mobilisation on traditional Tamil political issues like provincial autonomy through the full implementation of the 13th., amendment and accountability for alleged war crimes etc., had weakened. Instead, faith was reposed in the NPP's promise to give a clean, people-oriented government. The NPP put the Tamils' favourite party, the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), in the shade, and emerged as the number one choice in many of the electorates in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated Northern and Eastern provinces. The NPP's performance was impressive especially taking into account the fact that the party was a total 'outsider' to the area. It was a 'Sinhalese' party witch had no presence at all in the Tamil-dominated North ever before. For most of its life, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is the core of the NPP, had campaigned against devolution of power to the Tamils. It was dead against the 13 th., Amendment. It rejected the Tamils charge of 'war crimes' against the armed forces. Even in its election manifesto, the NPP did not commit itself to meeting any of the traditional Tamil demands. It only said that all issues of national importance will be taken up when the new parliament discusses a new constitution for the country. NPP's Dominance in North and East In Vaddukoddai, in Jaffna district, which had been an ITAK stronghold, the NPP got the single largest number of votes - 21.5%. The All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) came second with 13.48%; and the ITAK came third with 13.39%. In Kankesanthurai also, the NPP was in the forefront with 13.37% of the votes. The ITAK got 12.57%; and the ACTC 7.15%. In Manipay, the share of votes had NPP at the top with 30.94%; and ITAK at number two with 13.49%. In Koppai, the NPP secured 29.86% and the ITAK 12.63%. The score in Uddipiddy was NPP 20.16% and ITAK 15.07%. In Point Pedro too, the NPP came first with 21.89 % and the ITAK second with 19.71%. In Nallur, a Hindu stronghold, the NPP came first with 31.44% and ITAK third with 11.49%. In Jaffna proper, NPP came first with 41.46% and ITAK second with 11.81%. However, in Kayts, the NPP got less than the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP). In Chavakachery, an Independent Group for the maximum number of votes. In Kilinochchi, ITAK President S.Sritharan's pocket borough, the ITAK bagged 43.79% of the votes and came first. The NPP came second with 16.39%. In Kalkuda in Batticaloa district in the Eastern province, the ITAK was the top scorer with 28.10 %. But in Batticaloa town, the NPP was first with 27.11% with the ITAK and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress were slightly behind. In Paddiruppu, the strong hold of the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puigam (TMVP), the NPP stood third. In Trincomalee District, which is ethnically mixed, the NPP got the largest percentage of votes in both Seruvila and Trincomalee town, cornering 56% and 40% respectively. In Mutur, the NPP came second to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). In Digamadulla (Ampara) district, the NPP was the top scorer in Amparai town, Sammanthurai and Kalmunai. It was second to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) in Pottuvil. NPP's Tamil winners Though a hard line Sinhala party, the NPP put up Tamil candidates in areas where the Tamils were concentrated and made many of them win. In Nuwara Eliya, NPP's candidate Krishnan Kalaiselvi was one of the winners. In Matara, deep in the Sinhala South, an NPP Tamil candidate, Saroja Savithri Paulraj was among the winners. In the Wanni, the NPP managed to get two of its Tamil candidates elected in the six seats up for grabs. In Batticaloa, its candidate K.Prabhu bagged one of the five seats. In Badulla, NPP got 2 Tamils elected –K.Selvaraj and S. Ambika in the nine-seat electoral district. In Ratnapura, NPP got S. Pradeep elected to one of the 11 seats. In Jaffna, three of NPP candidates (all Tamils) won. The ITAK and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress got only one each. Ethnic Nationalisms on the backburner While the NPP did not play up Sinhala nationalism in its campaign, the Tamil parties played up Tamil nationalist demands like federalism, accountability for alleged war-time atrocities, vacation of military-occupied lands and the full implementation of the 13 th.Amendment for more power devolution. But a substantial section of voters appeared to have overlooked the contentious ethnic issues and pitched for better governance, less corruption and more people-centred development which were promised by the NPP. Tamils voted for the NPP despite the fact the NPP's election manifesto had nothing to say on the Tamils' ethnic issues as such. It promised a new constitution, but left its contents vague, leaving the issue to be tackled by the new parliament. Though this was neither here nor there, the Tamils voted for the NPP because their attention was elsewhere, namely, on their deteriorating economic circumstances created by the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis of 2022. They were desperately in need of a government which would give them some relief. It is not clear as to how the NPP government will bring relief to the people given the lack of financial resources, the dependence on foreign aid and debt repayment obligations. Ahilan Kadirgamar, a professor at the University of Jaffna told Frontlinemagazine that the lands released from military occupation in the Northern Province could be developed by local cooperatives with a local village level official drawing up plans for their development and use. Development of this kind will be 'bottom up' and not 'top down', as is the case now. Development efforts will then be more effective. Most importantly, the NPP, being a hard core Sinhalese or Sri Lankan nationalist party, can take bold steps to bring about ethnic reconciliation because it cannot be accused of being anti-Sinhala or anti-Sri Lankan, Kadirgamar pointed out. The Tamils could make use the window of opportunities which is open now, to realize their reasonable demands within the frame of Sri Lanka's constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUMQ36glFESvq	2024-11-18T16:37:27-08:00	
What Donald Trump’s Administrative Picks Mean For US Foreign Poli...	By Majda Ruge On 20 January 2025, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 47thpresident of the United States. In Europe, uncertainty looms regarding Trump’s future approach to foreign policy and whether he might act on radical pledges regarding European security; minimise America’s role in NATO; withdraw US troops from Europe; or force Ukraine into a peace deal which includes territorial concessions to Russia and military neutrality for Ukraine. In European capitals, all eyes are on the incoming appointments for Trump’s foreign and security policy cabinet positions. The expectation is that – if the maxim 'personnel is policy' holds true – then Trump’s appointments to key cabinet positions (including the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Pentagon) may help Europeans decipher the direction of his second foreign-policy agenda. And Trump’s second-term cabinet is likely to be more aligned with his instincts regarding European security and America’s commitment to its European allies. Identifying the Republican party’s three foreign-policy tribes (primacists, prioritisers, and restrainers) is therefore vital to interpreting his first cabinet picks; and how they may cooperate or clash in the battle for Trump’s mind. Primacists comprise the majority of the traditional Republican foreign policy elite in Congress and support continued US global leadership. They see America’s leadership in NATO and the country’s continued support for Ukraine as being in America’s strategic interest. Prioritisers and restrainers, by contrast, argue that US support for Ukraine is depleting America’s military capacity in a region which is not in America’s key strategic interest, and urge for the prioritisation of financial and military resources to the Indo-Pacific to deal with the threat from China. Restrainers especially want the US to focus on problems at home – starting with securing the country’s southern border with Mexico – and to show restraint in its deployment of military force abroad. Ultimately, both restrainers and prioritisers want Europe to take full responsibility for its own security and for Ukraine’s, allowing the US to focus on China and domestic issues. Trump’s own view is that, during his first term, a primacist-dominated cabinet sabotaged his foreign policy agenda in conjunction with the ‘deep state’. He labelledmany of his first-term advisors 'globalists and warmongers' and pledged to exclude them from his second administration – confirmed via Trump’s announcement that he will not invite Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two prominent primacists from his first administration, to return to his second cabinet. His son, Donald Trump Jr., is a key member of Trump’s transition team: he reposted on X that the '‘stop Pompeo’ movement is great but it’s not enough' and pledged to entirely root out 'neocons and war hawks' from the next administrative line-up. But the announcement that Trump has picked Florida congressman Michael Waltz and senator Marco Rubio as national security advisor and secretary of state respectively indicates that Trump’s second-term cabinet is prepared to accept some primacists – albeit with certain adjustments. Waltz and Rubio are both former primacists turned prioritisers, and prominent ‘China hawks’ in Congress. Previously an advisor in the George W. Bush administration, Waltz is highly critical of US aid spending in Ukraine, arguing that it should end the ‘blank check’ policy and hand over responsibility for Ukraine’s defence to wealthy European nations – in particular France, Germany, and the UK. Waltz has also spoken out against Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership. Similarly, Rubio has become increasingly critical of US support for Ukraine. He sees America’s greatest task as 'forcing the outdated foreign policy blob… to reprioritise and focus on America’s most pressing threat: the Chinese Communist Party. And that will require tradeoffs and burden-sharing…'. In other words, both Waltz and Rubio have shed their previous primacist beliefs. They want to end Russia’s war in Ukraine as soon as possible, hand over responsibility for Ukraine to Europe, and shift US focus to developments in the Indo-Pacific. And the same is true for the appointment of Elise Stefanik, who Trump has appointed as his next UN ambassador. During the 2016 to 2020 term, she displayed primacist tendencies by disagreeing with Trump’s position on NATO and opposing the administration’s effort to broker an agreement with Taliban. However, Stefanik is proving herself an ardent Trump loyalist, throwing her support behind him during the Ukraine impeachment hearings in 2019 and after the Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021. This, along with her outspoken support for Israel, has secured her a spot at the top table: given Trump’s general disdain for the UN and other international institutions, Stefanik’s role is likely to be similar to that of Haley during Trump’s first term. This mostly focused on advocacy for Israel and defence of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from international agreements and institutions. For now, it seems that prioritisers and restrainers will be steering the ship on Ukraine. This seems, chiefly, to involve opposing Ukraine’s NATO membership while heightening the expectation that Europeans should take collective responsibility for providing security guarantees to Ukraine – and support a Trump-brokered deal between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. But how Trump’s administration will approach foreign policy with regard to the Middle East is less clear cut. Unlike their views on Europe, Waltz and Rubio retain strong primacist instincts on the Middle East, especially with regard to the Israel-Iran issue. On the issue of US-supported Israeli military strikes on Iran, their views could potentially conflict with those of true prioritisers like incoming vice president, JD Vance. The latter has pledged he would not support authorising military strikes on the Iranian mainland and is keen to prevent any escalation in the region which may see a heightening of US involvement. Finally, an important dynamic will emerge between key cabinet members and the ‘corporatist’ tribe around Trump. Influential individuals such as Elon Musk, Richard Grenell, and Jared Kushner do not fall officially into any of the foreign-policy tribes. But their strong business interests in other global regions – Musk in China and Kushner in the Middle East and Arab Gulf states – mean they may not necessarily be aligned with the ideas promoted by Trump’s prioritiser members of the cabinet. There is a possibility of conflict between Musk’s business interests in China and the highly hawkish approach by prioritisers such as Waltz, Vance, or the potential next US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Kushner’s designs for peace in the Middle East also may not align with the prioritiser or restrainer tribes, which seek to retrench from the region and avoid escalation with Iran at all costs. In contrast, however, the second-order foreign policy issues – on which prioritisers and restrainers have no opinion – will be entirely run by those, such as Grenell, who are both in charge and do have a strong opinion. Here, a prime example is the Western Balkans. There is also the possibility of the Trump wild card: he is erratic and unpredictable, and has already swung between the different foreign-policy tribes during his first term of office. But in the end, Trump’s lack of foreign policy coherence means his foreign policy advisors also have ample space through which to develop and determine America’s outreach. While the results will likely be messy and inconsistent, it is crucial that the governments of European countries braces themselves to deal with the foreign policy of a second Trump term. It will not come close to anything like his first. The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions.

Mobile Home Residents Should Be Able To Buy Their Parks – OpEd	Even in a barrelful of rotten apples, you might think there’d still be a few good ones. But don’t get your hopes up looking into barrels labeled 'private equity investors.' These esoteric, multibillion-dollar Wall Street schemes rig the marketplace so 'high-net-worth individuals' can grab fat profits and special tax breaks to buy up doctors’ offices, hometown newspapers, child care centers, etc. Consider America’s humble but beneficial mobile home parks. Homeownership has become so pricey that these affordable manufactured units now make up 10 percent of all single-family home sales. But while the buyers own the houses, they must rent lots from mobile park owners. This has generally been a square deal — at least when park owners live among the renters, providing decent services at reasonable rates. One such park is Linnhaven Center with some 300 mobile home residents in Brunswick, Maine. But these homes for millions of people have become a quick-buck target for Wall Street’s equity profiteers. Waving cash at longtime trailer park owners, private equity investors have been snatching up thousands of these lots. Without warning, people’s homes are literally being bought out from under them. The absentee predators then raise rents to drive out residents, clearing the spaces for high-dollar renters or buyers. But there’s good news for a change. A new law in Maine gives mobile home residents a chance to buy their park — and community cooperatives exist to help arrange financing. That’s what the modest-income people of Linnhaven have now done. Such a big leap isn’t easy, but give people a fair chance and they can make it work. As one Linnhaven woman put it, the community effort was much more than a property deal: It felt like 'a chance to control your own destiny.'

Moscow Prescribes Own Terms For Talks With Trump On Ukraine – Ana...	By Vladimir Socor Moscow is in no hurry to hold talks with US President-elect Donald Trump on halting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Kremlin expects its forces to continue, slowly but steadily, seizing more Ukrainian territory, grinding down the country’s infrastructure and housing stock with air strikes, setting preconditions for a social crisis in Ukraine this coming winter, and depleting the national morale. Trump shows himself eager to substantiate his 'deal-maker' reputation by brokering a peace deal between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents even before his own presidential inauguration. From Moscow’s perspective, however, holding such talks at this time could stymie its military operations in Ukraine before they attained their objectives. It would be entirely out of character with the Kremlin to enter negotiations with a major foreign leader who has not yet taken office. Moscow will, however, be ready to engage with Trump following his January 20 inauguration. By then, Russia also expects its military position to have grown stronger in Ukraine. The Kremlin could then turn Trump’s manifest eagerness for a deal into leverage against the US president. Awaiting that moment, Moscow is prescribing its own terms for possible talks with Trump on Ukraine. Within two days of Trump’s November 5 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin used a high-profile Valdai Club event to announce his willingness to hold talks with Trump on Ukraine when certain conditions are met. Putin listed those conditions but not before paying his respects to Trump’s 'courageous, manly reaction to the assassination attempt against him. The man proved himself, showed his character in that extraordinary situation.' Congratulating Trump on his election, Putin professed to be 'more than ready' to hold talks with Trump and 'open to restoring relations with the United States,' but he would not initiate a telephone call to the US president. 'The ball is in the US court' (Kremlin.ru, November 7). Follow-up statements by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (Interfax, November 9) and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (TASS, November 13; Mid.ru, November 14) elaborated on Putin’s list of conditions for Russia-US high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine. The conditions are familiar for the most part. They refer to prerequisites, processes, and outcomes, including: Talks can only commence once Russia regains the entire territory of its Kursk oblast. The United States should initiate talks with Russia. No quick fixes. 'His [Trump’s] signals about a super-quick settlement are nothing but election campaign rhetoric' (Ryabkov). 'The subject matter of talks cannot be merely a ceasefire, but a solution that would lead to restoring cooperation between these two peoples that are indisputably fraternal despite these tragic events' (Putin). Peace talks must at first involve Russia and Ukraine bilaterally. They must proceed from the 'Istanbul documents,' tentatively drafted by Moscow and Kyiv in March-April 2022 and based on Putin’s own June 14, list of demands to Ukraine (see EDM, March 17, 30, 31, April 4, 5, 2022, May 29, 30, June 20). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy must rescind his October 2022 decree banning direct political negotiations with the Kremlin (see EDM, October 5, 2022). 'Russia will certainly consider and answer Trump’s and any US proposals if geared to a political settlement, but not geared to supporting the Kyiv regime and feeding its expectations' (Lavrov). 'Western countries … should abruptly [rezko] cut the volume of their support to Kyiv, including military support, and get [their] Kyiv clients to abandon the idea that they could achieve anything without a direct dialogue with Moscow. This is what the US-led West must focus on during Trump’s presidential term' (Lavrov). 'Ukraine’s post-war borders must reflect the sovereign decisions of the people who live on the lands that we name our historic lands' [alluding to the four Russian-annexed provinces on the Ukrainian mainland] (Putin). The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had opened its door to Ukraine aiming to 'appropriate our [Russia’s] historical territories.' Post-war good-neighborly relations between Russia and Ukraine would only be possible if Ukraine is a permanently neutral country. 'The European Union has practically turned into the same thing as NATO in a military-political sense … NATO and the European Union will arrange some division of labor between them (Lavrov)—a warning that Russia could deem Ukraine’s candidacy to EU membership as incompatible with neutrality. These terms and parameters are not new, nor is their listing complete. They are presented with fresh emphases to familiarize Trump’s incoming team with them, ahead of possible direct contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government. These statements concern putative negotiations on a bilateral basis between Moscow and Kyiv but stop short of referring to follow-up negotiations in a multilateral format regarding post-war security guarantees to Ukraine. This multilateral track became the proximate cause for the collapse of the 2022 'Istanbul' negotiations because Russia was included among the would-be security guarantors of a neutral Ukraine. If Russia insists on being included in the multilateral format again, the negotiations are bound to collapse.

South Korea Best Off Balancing Deterrence And Diplomacy With The ...	By Rachel Minyoung Lee Unification is a perennial topic of interest among Korea watchers, but it has been particularly popular — and confusing — in recent months, with North and South Korea each sending diametrically opposed signals. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol delivered a rare speech dedicated to unification on Liberation Day, 15 August 2024, reaffirming Seoul’s commitment to unification and even telling Pyongyang that South Korea would ‘keep the door to inter-Korean dialogue wide open’. This was despite Kim Jong-un’s announcement at the end of 2023 of a new two Koreas policy, which defined North and South Korea as ‘two belligerent states’ and discarded the decades-long policy of peaceful unification. There was much speculation following the October 7–8 session of the North Korean parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, about whether the assembly had indeed revised the constitution to remove unification-related language and define North Korean territory according to Kim’s instructions in early 2024. Pyongyang subsequently implied that it made at least one revision related to inter-Korean issues — defining South Korea as ‘a hostile state’ — but it remains unknown whether it made other related amendments. North Korea never responded to Yoon’s Liberation Day speech, indicating a lack of interest in improving relations with Seoul. To the contrary, Kim himself reacted quickly to Yoon’s Armed Forces Day parade speech on 1 October 2024, even leveling an unusually direct nuclear threat that the North would ‘use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons’, against South Korea if its sovereignty was violated. Dialogue with North Korea — however desirable and necessary — is unrealistic for the foreseeable future. This raises the question of what is the best way forward. Kim’s two Koreas policy is here to stay. It is a result of a fundamental policy reorientation that occurred over a period of more than four years, going back to the breakdown of the Trump-Kim Hanoi summit in 2019. Kim’s call for the development of tactical nuclear weapons and the revised nuclear law, which implicitly expanded the scope of nuclear strike targets to South Korea, were just two of multiple indicators. Pyongyang’s South Korea policy change should be viewed within the broader context of its foreign policy reorientation. North Korea has given up its three decade-long policy of normalisation of ties with the United States through denuclearisation — distinct from a lack of appetite for normalisation of relations altogether — and, by natural extension, its policy of nonalignment with China and Russia. Kim’s decisions seem to increasingly be driven by the opportunities he sees in great power competition and the shifting geopolitical landscape, giving him even less motivation to improve relations with South Korea. Pyongyang’s policy towards the United States was almost certainly affected by what it perceived to be waning US leadership on the global stage due to US–China competition and a ‘multipolar’ global order. North Korea’s relations with Russia have reached new heights since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as evidenced by their new bilateral treaty. We should note that Kim announced the new South Korea policy in the midst of his ever-blossoming relations with Putin. This relationship probably emboldened Kim to trash the concept of unification, his forefathers’ legacy and one that has been deeply ingrained in the North Korean people’s minds. For as long as the current circumstances persist, the most realistic way for South Korea to manage relations with the North — and the potential for US–China competition and deepening Pyongyang–Moscow relations to amplify North Korea’s growing nuclear threats — is to balance deterrence with clearer signals for dialogue. Priority should be given to strengthening deterrence. In that vein, South Korea should continue to make efforts to advance its weapons systems. Seoul should continue to strengthen its alliance with the United States and work with it to maintain the credibility of extended deterrence. It should also step up trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. It is important to remember that muscle-building in and of itself cannot be the goal of deterrence — the goal is to maintain peace and lay the groundwork for future diplomacy. Accordingly, Seoul should redouble its efforts to signal to North Korea that its interest in dialogue is genuine. The first step to doing this is for Seoul to tone down on the themes that Pyongyang finds hostile — such as North Korean human rights and right of access to information — in its public messages specifically targeting North Korea. It is important for South Korea to continue to take the lead in working on these issues with the international community. But these themes do not have to be emphasised in messages that are intended to resonate with North Korea. Seoul should also learn from the lessons of the past that North Korea will not trade its nuclear weapons for economic compensation. The Lee Myung-bak administration’s Vision 3000: Denuclearisation and Openness and Yoon’s ‘Audacious Initiative’, both of which sought to incentivise North Korea to denuclearise through economic compensation, failed. It is time to recognise that North Korea’s strategic interests have changed, understand the reasons for this shift and craft viable policy options that work for both sides. Striking the right balance between deterrence and dialogue is not an easy task. But if Seoul can bring itself to be a little more flexible, it may be in a better position to deal with North Korea when the country is ready to start engaging. The time for diplomacy may arrive after January 2026, when North Korea is expected to hold its next quinquennial Party Congress and review and recalibrate its domestic and foreign policy.

Viewing A Fragmented America Through The Lens Of Economic Data – ...	By Muren Jin In recent times, U.S. economic data has become a target of criticism, with the degree of division caused by it being no less intense than the polarization between the two major parties during U.S. elections. This division is evident across multiple aspects, an indication of the fragmentation of the American economy at various levels. First, there is a clear split between different data points at the same time, particularly in the Markit Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI. According to data released by S&P Global on October 24, due to strong demand in the services sector, U.S. business activity maintained steady growth for most of October, with expectations of a rebound to the highest point in over two years. However, manufacturing has contracted for the third consecutive month, although the pace of contraction has slightly slowed. The preliminary October Markit Manufacturing PMI for the U.S. stood at 47.8, slightly higher than the expected 47.5 and the previous 47.3. Meanwhile, the preliminary October Markit Services PMI was 55.3, surpassing the expected 55 and the previous 55.2. Whether examining recent short-term data or the long-term decline of the Rust Belt since World War II, it is clear that the concept of a 'financially-driven nation' has become more deeply entrenched in the U.S. This suggests a widening industrial divide, pointing to an underlying imbalance in the American economy. Second, the same data, presented at different times, shows a clear divide, particularly evident in the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI's 'wild swings' around the dividing line of expansion and contraction. On November 5, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released data showing that the U.S. ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI for October was 56, the highest in nearly two years, well above the expected 53.8 and the previous September value of 54.9. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction. The October reading significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing the forecasts of nearly all economists surveyed. However, it is important to note that since the second quarter of this year, the U.S. Non-Manufacturing PMI has been quite volatile. In April and June, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI fell into contraction, while the data for September and October showed a noticeable improvement. The ups and downs of non-manufacturing data correspond with the Federal Reserve's major shift from maintaining a tightening cycle to initiating a loosening cycle with interest rate cuts. The data fluctuations have cleverly paved the way for rate cuts and later helped support the economic soft landing. On October 25, former Fed Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh openly stated in an interview with CNBC that the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September was at odds with its previous policy statements. Warsh raised concerns, 'I do not want to be the person accusing them of politics. That’s not the central bank I know. But when you don’t have a theory and follow it, it’s easy to get that accusation'. Third, the same data type, presented by different institutions at the same time, shows a stark divide, particularly evident in the significant discrepancy in 'non-farm payroll' data. On October 30, the ADP employment report showed that in October, U.S. companies hired at the fastest pace in over a year, indicating an extraordinary demand for labor. According to the latest data from ADP, U.S. private sector employment grew by 233,000 in October, far surpassing expectations. Additionally, the September ADP employment figure was revised upward from 143,000 to 159,000. The latest ADP data exceeded the forecasts of all economists surveyed by Bloomberg and was significantly higher than the 114,000 jobs expected by most economists. In contrast, on November 1, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data showing that non-farm payrolls in October had plummeted to just 12,000, a sharp decline from September's 254,000 (revised down to 223,000), marking the lowest increase since 2020, and well below the expected 106,000. While Fed 'voting member' Christopher Waller and President Joe Biden's chief economic advisor, Lael Brainard, both indicated that this report likely reflected temporary job losses due to recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the BLS acknowledged in its statement that while hurricanes may have affected employment in certain sectors, the impact on overall U.S. employment, hours worked, or income could not be quantified. The BLS also stated that the hurricanes had no significant effect on the overall national unemployment rate. The stark discrepancy in important data, combined with conflicting views from data release agencies, the Fed, and government officials, highlights the significant differences in perspectives on the state of the U.S. economy. Fourth, there is a divergence between history and reality, specifically reflected in the triggering of the Sahm Rule and the deviation of U.S. GDP growth. On August 2, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the U.S. unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.3% in July, the highest level since October 2021, and higher than the expected 4.1%. The increase in the unemployment rate triggered the well-known recession indicator, the Sahm Rule. Notably, historically, the Sahm Rule has been confirmed in all 11 U.S. economic recessions since 1950, without exception. However, data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on October 30 showed that the U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter, a slowdown of 0.2 percentage points from the second quarter, and below the economists' expectation of 3.1%. Still, the growth was better than most other developed economies during the same period. Economists also pointed out that while the growth rate slightly slowed compared to the second quarter, it remains relatively strong compared to historical trends. The differing perspectives between historical experience and current realities regarding economic development continue to resonate in the ongoing heated debate about whether the U.S. economy is headed for a soft landing. Fifth, there is a divergence between data and personal experience, specifically reflected in the contrast between the decline in inflation data and the harsh inflationary pressures felt by ordinary people. On October 30, data released by the BEA showed that the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 2.2% on an annualized quarter-over-quarter basis in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than the market expectation of 2.1%, but 0.6 percentage points lower than the second quarter. Subsequently, on October 31, data from the BEA revealed that the U.S. PCE price index for September rose 2.1% year-over-year, in line with expectations, marking the lowest level since early 2021. In contrast, starting in mid-September, U.S. dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree began to lower their sales forecasts and warned that their core consumers were under pressure, which caused their stock prices to drop sharply. Dollar stores, known for their low-cost, limited-product, and low-price business model, originally priced all items at a dollar and have long been a source of food and basic goods for low-income Americans. The sales performance of these dollar stores provides a clear indication of the real state of U.S. inflation and its impact on the consumption spending of middle- and low-income groups. The decline in cold, hard inflation data sharply contrasts with the dire economic realities faced by ordinary citizens. As ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan put it, the current U.S. inflation data is unreliable; the base effect of the data masks the deeper underlying significance beneath the surface. Overall, in recent times, the fragmentation of U.S. economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-level divisions within the United States. Kung Chan has pointed out more profoundly that the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data are now highly questionable. In the future, the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution, as the importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, making it almost inadvisable to use such data directly. Final analysis conclusion: In recent times, the fragmentation of American economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-layered divisions within the United States. At the same time, there are significant doubts about the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data. The importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, which means that the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution.

Has Anyone Noticed What BRICS+ Is Telling Us About A New World Or...	By Jean-Daniel Ruch In the beginning, there were four: Brazil, China, India and Russia. Following their first summit in 2009, they expanded to become BRICS with the accession of South Africa in 2011 and then nine in January 2024. At the sixteenth BRICS summit this October in Kazan, Russia, two African countries, Egypt and Ethiopia, and two Middle Eastern countries, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, made up what people now refer to as BRICS+. Thirteen among the more than thirty countries that have formally expressed their interest in membership are now associated with BRICS+: four Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam), two Latin American countries (Cuba and Bolivia), three African countries (Algeria, Nigeria, Uganda), two Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) and two European countries (Belarus and NATO member Turkey). They were given the status of 'partner states' in Kazan. To say that the Americans are not enthusiastic about the appeal of this new global club would be an understatement. Should the success of the summit in Kazan be interpreted as a sign of the failure of their strategy to isolate Russia? Worse still, are we witnessing the beginning of the end of the American century? In addition to the nine member states and thirteen partners, the summit was also attended by some representatives of countries whose presence was rather unexpected, such as the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, the very Russophilic Alexander Vulin. However, it was the presence of UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutierres that caused outraged reactions, especially in Ukraine. 'The UN Secretary-General declined Ukraine’s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland. However, he has accepted the invitation of the war criminal Putin to Kazan,' hammered the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. It is true that Gutierres boycotted the Bürgenstock meeting this spring. It is also legitimate to wonder whether a UN Secretary-General should shake hands with a person accused of war crimes, even if he is the president of a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin on March 17, 2023. This juicy skewer of participants is notable for its heterogeneity. There are dictatorships and democracies, Muslim, Christian and secular countries, economic superpowers and failed nations, some have characterized as rogue states. Are what we are witnessing merely an updated reiteration of that elastic non-aligned movement launched in the 1960s by Yugoslavia’s Prime Minister Josip Tito and Indian Jawaharlal Nehru, which encompassed two-thirds of the world but never achieved any real global influence? No, something else is happening here. In the space of sixty years, the balance of global power has clearly changed. A motley but (almost) global group with growing influence Antonio Gutierres is a realist. He understands how historically significant the bubbling events within the BRICS states are. He was in Kazan because it is important. To underline that point, consider a few figures. The nine countries now called BRICS+ account for more than half of the world’s population. Their combined gross national product is already greater than that of their rivals in the G7, the Western directorate comprising the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. The gap is likely to widen in the coming years, since the BRICS+ growth rate is around 5%, while Western economies are stagnating at 1–2% — and some, like Germany’s, are officially in a recession. Despite these new geo-economic realities, the international order established by the West after the World War II has been resistant to change. The UN Security Council will remain secure in the hands of its five permanent members — three Western states plus China and Russia — for a long time to come. However, the BRICS states are not seeking to change the United Nations Charter or create a parallel system to the United Nations. Rather, they are focusing on the economic and financial governance of the world. Parallel to the founding of the United Nations, the victorious Western powers, at the Bretton Woods conference in 1945, created institutions designed to regulate world finance. The dollar became the world’s reserve currency, making every country vulnerable to US sanctions. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which provide financial assistance to countries in difficulty, are run like shareholder meetings, in which the US holds a decisive vote. Together with the other Western nations, they possess an absolute majority. It is these two pillars of Western power in the world that the BRICS states hope to compete with. But how? It would be literally impossible to reform the international financial institutions in such a way as to reduce Western influence in them. However, they cannot prevent the creation of parallel systems of payment. The BRICS countries are thus working on three main tasks: A mechanism for processing international payments independent of SWIFT — from which Russia was excluded after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. An intensification of trade that is invoiced in local currencies instead of dollars, in order to accelerate the 'de-dollarization of the world.' A development bank that competes with the World Bank and finances infrastructure projects. There are currently 96 projects underway with a total volume of $32 billion. Critics of the BRICS states doubt that they are able to really compete with the dollar. Despite a steady erosion, the greenback still accounts for 55% of the reserves of the national banks. And when it is replaced by other currencies, these tend to be Western currencies, with the notable exception of the Chinese renminbi. Nevertheless, the trend is clear and the potential of BRICS+ is there. The formation of alternative transportation corridors is part of the same strategy to break free from Western, i.e., American dependency. Land routes vs. sea routes In a globalized and interdependent world, the transport of goods represents a strategic dimension. From cars to cell phones, hardly any industrial activity exists that does not include and depend on an accumulation of natural resources and semi-finished products from all corners of the world. Over the last hundred years, goods have primarily been transported by sea. Today, sea freight accounts for 70% of world trade. You only have to look at a map of the 128 US naval bases around the world to realize how important the sea lanes are to Washington’s power strategy. From the Sea of Japan to Malacca, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Panama, Rotterdam and New York, Washington’s ambition — sometimes supported by its British ally — to dominate the seas is obvious. With its 'Belt and Road' initiative, China has been trying for several years to develop land routes to, compete or at least complement the existing sea routes. It is therefore very revealing that one of the flagship projects highlighted in Kazan was the North–South Corridor, which will ultimately connect St. Petersburg with India, without passing through any Western-controlled areas. Is it worth remembering that India has become the largest importer of Russian oil products, despite the very audible gnashing of teeth in Washington? What is Switzerland doing? Between soft power and economic impact, the BRICS+ are redrawing the geopolitical map. Is Switzerland even aware of this probably irreversible development? Has it sought an invitation to Kazan? The answer is yes, Swiss companies are well aware of the underlying forces shaping the world of tomorrow. This is why some, for example in the trade sector, are moving to Dubai. Yes, Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs is well aware of this. It wants to update our free trade agreement with China. Switzerland is the only European country apart from Iceland to have concluded such an agreement. That is an advantage. Unfortunately, the options chosen by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport have not been helpful. By running after the Americans, who have been losing all their wars for twenty years, weFO° Exclusive: Make Sense of BRICS Summit in Russiahave turned Russia against us and made China doubt our reliability.

Medicare Advantage Is Saving Taxpayers Money – OpEd	A new study finds that the migration of people from traditional Medicare to the Medicare Advantage program over the last decade has saved the federal government $144 billion. The study arrives at a time when critics have stepped up their claims that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are over-billing Medicare and causing a waste of taxpayer money. The study was conducted by Elevance, a private insurer with an obvious financial interest in the topic. However, the researchers make their data sources apparent and their results are available for scrutiny by others. The Elevance study builds on a finding by other, more limited investigations: What happens in the MA system indirectly affects what happens to patients in traditional Medicare. In a typical MA plan, doctors are encouraged to practice integrated, coordinated care—sharing medical records and following agreed-upon treatment plans, for example. This results in more efficient care. Yet these very same doctors also treat traditional Medicare patients. So, methods they employ to practice cost-effective care for one set of patients are more likely to be repeated in the treatment of other patients. Other studies have found that where there is a large presence of MA patients in an area, there tend to be spillover effects. Protocols used by MA plans tend to be become more widespread—affecting all Medicare patients. The Elevance study measures this effect nationwide. It is a first-time comparison of spending on MA patients and traditional Medicare patients in the same counties, across the entire country. The finding: larger enrollment in MA plans leads to lower spending on all Medicare patients. Specifically, a 10% increase in market share by MA plans leads to an average decrease in spending on all Medicare beneficiaries of between $105 and $127 per person, per year. Savings for Seniors More than half of all seniors in Medicare get their health insurance from a private MA plan. Because these plans typically provide comprehensive coverage, enrollees avoid paying for 'medigap' insurance that other seniors acquire to plug the holes in traditional Medicare. That’s one reason why the average senior in an MA plan is saving $2,541 a year in out-of-pocket costs. Participants also get extra benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get, including dental, eye, and hearing care. Since the program was originally a bipartisan creation, you would think that politicians in both parties would openly brag about the program and claim credit for it. Yet in recent years, many on the left have become increasingly hostile. The Biden administration has slashed payments to MA plans over the past two years, causing some MA plans to leave the market altogether and others to reduce the benefits they offer. The administration has also been a ruthless regulator. Based on a 'secret shopper' report, the administration fined one company $190 million for falling to answer a phone call in less than 8 seconds! Are MA plans overpaid? The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) claims that MA plans are paid 20% more than Medicare pays for patients with similar health conditions in traditional Medicare. They admit that MA patients get more benefits than regular Medicare patients But, they argue that giving MA enrollees benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get is not a good use of taxpayer money. One problem with MedPAC’s analysis is that traditional Medicare enrollees are not a homogeneous population. Some are also in employer plans. Some are also in Medicaid. They have different levels of out-of-pocket exposure. In failing to thoroughly adjust for these differences, MedPAC did not make a true apples-to-apples comparison between Medicare spending on enrollees in traditional Medicare and on MA enrollees. A more rigorous study by Milliman corrected for these problems and found that the government saves money when people leave traditional Medicare and enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. The savings equal $576 per enrollee per year. This is consistent with the Elevance results, independent of spillover effects. Upcoding One reason why the Medicare Advantage program works so much better than the (Obamacare) exchange is individualized risk adjustment. That means that MA plans get paid based on the health condition of their enrollees. If a patient is very sick, the government will pay the plan more. These payments are designed to make the healthy and the sick equally attractive to an insurer. As a result, MA plans have a financial incentive to find and report every health condition that generates a more generous payment from Medicare. 'Upcoding' occurs when the plans report conditions that might not be reported by doctors practicing in traditional Medicare. Critics claim that MA companies are overly zealous—perhaps even reporting phantom conditions. This is one of the suspicions behind the claim that MA plans are overpaid. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal (in collaboration with Medicare) found that in a single year, Medicare paid insurers $50 billion for diseases no doctor ever treated. However, doctors and hospitals treating traditional Medicare patients also have a financial incentive to overbill Medicare. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there are a higher percent of coding errors in traditional Medicare and they cost taxpayers twice as much money ($31.2 billion versus $16.6 billion in 2023). Efficiency The Better Medicare Alliance (an industry-funded organization), reports that MA plans deliver 13% lower inpatient hospitalization costs, 49% lower acute care hospital stays, and a 43% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations. This is despite the fact that MA enrollees have lower incomes, less education and are more likely to be from a minority population. The comparison is even better for people enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid—thought to be the most vulnerable population. Among this group, being in an MA plan means a 14.2% lower likelihood of a hospital stay, a 72.6% higher likelihood of receiving a colorectal cancer screening, and a 52.5% higher likelihood of having a breast cancer screening. The Medicare Advantage program has shown that competition in the marketplace is superior to government-run health insurance—in raising quality and lowering costs.

‘NAFTA Fever’ And The Myth Of Government-Created Free Markets – O...	By David Brady, Jr. Left or right, the enemy is the free market. Every problem is the fault of the free market. On the left, the supposed radical deregulation of the 1980s paved the way for the financial crisis and the destruction of the environment. On the right, free trade is responsible for the gutting of manufacturing. The free market is made out in this mythos to have had its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s and destroyed everything. Even free market advocates fall into this trap, saying that this time in the near past was a free market victory. The results—they try to argue with the market critics, but they agree with the causal analysis: Markets won! Hooray!The fact is that all three of these groups are wrong. There was no American market revolution in the ‘80s. It is important to make note of the rhetoric of American life up until the 1980s. American life at the beginning of the 1930s was introduced to the message of 'market failures' that justified the New Deal. By the end of the 1940s, Americans were thrown into the Cold War, where all of American life was defined by a battle between 'American Capitalism' and 'Soviet Communism.' Paying lip service to the free market was easy. Fusionism became the default conservative ideology, the mixture of so-called 'fiscal conservatism,' the 'moral majority,' and hawkish foreign policy. The hawkish foreign policy—the boogeyman of National Review—was bearing the brunt of the load. As Buckley put it: We have got to accept Big Government for the duration [of the Cold War]— for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged…except through the instrumentality of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores. 'Fiscal conservatism' was cast aside in the name of fighting the Soviet menace, but it was in the name of capitalism because everything was done in the name of fighting communism. Every American who bought into the existential crisis of Cold War rhetoric could be coaxed into supporting any policy in the name of capitalism and free trade. So when politicians wheeled forward thousand-page treaties with import/export quotas, environmental regulations, and currency price controls under the name of 'Free Trade Agreements.' No wonder the American people got behind it. No wonder free trade got stuck with the blame. It is an age-old tactic to give bills positive names while they have the opposite effect (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act). Who would oppose the 'Giving Puppies Good Homes Bill of 2024'? At the end of the Cold War, who would oppose a supposed free trade agreement with our fellow capitalist allies? With the backing of the tail-end of the Cold War market-rhetoric and every Cold War 'free enterprise' think tank, we were given NAFTA. Rothbard himself lamented the rise of NAFTA fervor in every so-called 'free market think tank.' He wrote in his essay 'The NAFTA Myth': For some people, it seems, all you have to do to convince them of the free enterprise nature of something is to label it 'market,' and so we have the spawning of such grotesque creatures as 'market socialists' or 'market liberals.' The word 'freedom,' of course, is also a grabber, and so another way to gain adherents in an age that exalts rhetoric over substance is simply to call yourself or your proposal 'free market' or 'free trade.' Labels are often enough to nab the suckers. And so, among champions of free trade, the label 'North American Free Trade Agreement' (Nafta) is supposed to command unquestioning assent. 'But how can you be against free trade?' It’s very easy. The folks who have brought us Nafta and presume to call it 'free trade' are the same people who call government spending 'investment,' taxes 'contributions,' and raising taxes 'deficit reduction.' Let us not forget that the Communists, too, used to call their system 'freedom.' One has to wonder where NAFTA supporters found their solace: Was it ignorance of what was actually in the treaty? Was it in favor of some 'middle-of-the-road' policy? Or was it by virtue of being purchased and funded by vested business interests that benefited from the treaty? We may never quite know. But we can know for certainty that a treatise with thousands of pages, featuring currency controls, import controls, and imposed cross-border regulations is hardly a laissez-faire victory. But these rhetorical victories that Rothbard decries become stuck in the minds of Americans. The media proclaims the 'new age of free trade!' and most buy into it. The failures of interventionism are thus blamed on the free market. Reagan is lauded as a limited government president who unleashed the markets through deregulation but that is truly a myth. Reagan may have allowed his bureaucracies to loosen environmental regulations in his tenure but it opened the door for the dreaded Chevron Doctrine. Reagan did not touch the New Deal and Great Society apparatus of regulation. The bureaucracies of the Progressive Era remained intact. The central bank remained. Reagan may have lowered some income tax rates, but he was hardly a deregulator. Lest any progressive try to blame so-called 'financial deregulation' for the 'Dotcom' and 2008 recessions, the only needed response is Tom Woods’ book Meltdown. Central banks playing price controls with interest rates created the financial crises. Thus, we reach the two-fold path of 'NAFTA fever.' It comes in two forms: either the radical insistence on a free market victory that never truly happened or the hatred of the free market based off of a rhetorical scheme that never was true. Neither are honest or helpful. Those defending markets should not fall into NAFTA fever, into a dogmatic orthodoxy whereby they defend NAFTA and the illusion of a free market victory. These were never free market victories, but intervention dressed in the garb of market rhetoric. We should not be jumping to the defense of the results of interventionism. Interventionism causes a death spiral of failure and continually worse social conditions. To bring about free markets and a more prosperous society, we need to make it clear what is the fault of interventionism and what isn’t. The United States has been defined by interventionist economic policy for a century, so it is no wonder that social conditions have worsened and more have become discontent. Free markets didn’t cause our conditions, they were simply the costume in which interventionism was packaged.No wonder more people today despise markets. By buying into the rhetorical marketplace of the time interventionists and cronies passed off their interventionist legislation as part of a 'market revolution.' The revolution never came, unlike the revolution described by Garet Garrett. American political discourse needs a cure to its NAFTA fever.

There Are No ‘Easy Wars’ Left To Fight, But Do Not Mistake The Lo...	Israelis, as a whole, are exhibiting a rosy assurance that they can harness Trump, if not to the full annexation of the Occupied Territories (Trump in his first term did not support such annexation), but rather, to ensnare him into a war on Iran. Many (even most) Israelis are raring for war on Iran and an aggrandisement of their territory (devoid of Arabs). They are believing the puffery that Iran ‘lies naked’, staggeringly vulnerable, before a U.S. and Israeli military strike. Trump’s Team nominations, so far, reveal a foreign policy squad of fierce supporters of Israel and of passionate hostility to Iran. The Israeli media term it a ‘dream team’ for Netanyahu. It certainly looks that way. The Israel Lobby could not have asked for more. They have got it. And with the new CIA chief, they get a known ultra China hawk as a bonus. But in the domestic sphere the tone is precisely the converse: The key nomination for ‘cleaning the stables’ is Matt Gaetz as Attorney General; he is a real 'bomb thrower'. And for the Intelligence clean-up, Tulsi Gabbard is appointed as Director of National Intelligence. All intelligence agencies will report to her, and she will be responsible for the President’s Daily briefing. The intel assessments may thus begin to reflect something closer to reality. The deep Inter-Agency structure has reason to be very afraid; they are panicking – especially over Gaetz. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have the near impossible task of cutting out-of-control federal spending and currency printing. The System is deeply dependent on the bloat of government spending to keep the cogs and levers of the mammoth ‘security’ boondoggle whirring. It is not going to be yielded up without a bitter fight. So, on the one hand, the Lobby gets a dream team (Israel), but on the other side (the domestic sphere), it gets a renegade team. This must be deliberate. Trump knows that Biden’s legacy of bloating GDP with government jobs and excessive public spending is the real ‘time bomb’ awaiting him. Again the withdrawal symptoms, as the drug of easy money is withdrawn, may prove incendiary. Moving to a structure of tariffs and low taxes will be disruptive. Whether deliberate or not, Trump is keeping his cards close to his chest. We have only glimpses of intent – and the water is being seriously muddied by the infamous ‘Inter-Agency’ grandees. For example, in respect to the Pentagon sanctioning private-sector contractors to work in Ukraine, this was done in coordination with 'inter-agency stakeholders'. The old nemesis that paralysed his first term again faces Trump. Then, during the Ukraine impeachment process, one witness (Vindman), when asked why he would not defer to the President’s explicit instructions, replied that whilst Trump has his view on Ukraine policy, that stance did NOT align with that of the ‘Inter-Agency’ agreed position. In plain language, Vindman denied that a U.S. president has agency in foreign policy formulation. In short, the ‘Inter-Agency structure’ was signalling to Trump that military support for Ukraine must continue. When the Washington Post published their detailed story of a Trump-Putin phone call – that the Kremlin emphatically states never happened – the deep structures of policy were simply telling Trump that it would be they who determine what the shape of the U.S. ‘solution’ for Ukraine would be. Similarly, when Netanyahu boasts to have spoken to Trump and that Trump 'shares' his views regarding Iran, Trump was being indirectly instructed what his policy towards Iran needs to be. All the (false) rumours about appointments to his Team too, were but the interagency signalling their choices for his key posts. No wonder confusion reigns. So, what can be deduced at this early stage? If there is a common thread, it has been a constant refrain that Trump is against war. And that he demands from his picks personal loyalty and no ties of obligation to the Lobby or the Swamp. So, is the packing of his Administration with ‘Israel Firsters’ an indication that Trump is edging toward a ‘Realist’s Faustian pact’ to destroy Iran in order to cripple China’s energy supply source (90% from Iran), and thus weaken China? – Two birds with one stone, so to speak? The collapse of Iran would also weaken Russia and hobble the BRICS’ transport-corridor projects. Central Asia needs both Iranian energy and its key transport corridors linking China, Iran, and Russia as primary nodes of Eurasian commerce. When the RAND Organisation, the Pentagon think-tank, recently published a landmark appraisal of the 2022 National Defence Strategy (NDS), its findings were stark: An unrelentingly bleak analysis of every aspect of the U.S. war machine. In brief, the U.S. is 'not prepared', the appraisal argued, in any meaningful way for serious ‘competition’ with its major adversaries – and is vulnerable or even significantly outmatched in every sphere of warfare. The U.S., the RAND appraisal continues, could in short order be drawn into a war across multiple theatres with peer and near-peer adversaries – and it could lose. It warns that the U.S. public has not internalized the costs of the U.S. losing its position as the world superpower. The U.S. must therefore engage globally with a presence—military, diplomatic, and economic—to preserve influence worldwide. Indeed, as one respected commentator has noted, the ‘Empire at all Costs’ cult (i.e. the RAND Organisation zeitgeist) is now 'more desperate than ever to find a war it can fight to restore its fortunes and prestige'. And China would be altogether a different proposition for a demonstrative act of destruction in order 'to preserve U.S. influence worldwide' – for the U.S. is 'not prepared' for serious conflict with its peer adversaries: Russia or China, RAND says. The straitened situation of the U.S. after decades of fiscal excess and offshoring (the backdrop to its current weakened military industrial base) now makes kinetic war with China or Russia or 'across multiple theatres' a prospect to be shunned. The point that the commentator above makes is that there are no ‘easy wars’ left to fight. And that the reality (brutally outlined by RAND) is that the U.S. can choose one – and only one war to fight. Trump may not want any war, but the Lobby grandees – all supporters of Israel, if not active Zionists supporting the displacement of Palestinians – want war. And they believe they can get one. Put starkly and plainly: Has Trump thought this through? Have the others in the Trump Team reminded him that in today’s world, with U.S. military strength slipping away, there no longer are any ‘easy wars’ to fight, although Zionists believe that with a decapitation strike on Iran’s religious and IRGC leadership (on the lines of the Israel’s strikes on Hizbullah leaders in Beirut), the Iranian people would rise up against their leaders, and side with Israel for a ‘New Middle East’. Netanyahu has just made his second broadcast to the Iranian people promising them early salvation. He and his government are not waiting to ask Trump to nod his consent to the annexation of all Occupied Palestinian Territories. That project is being implemented on the ground. It is unfolding now. Netanyahu and his cabinet have the ethnic cleansing ‘bit between their teeth’. Will Trump be able to roll it back? How so? Or will he succumb to becoming ‘genocide Don’? This putative ‘Iran War’ is following the same narrative cycle as with Russia: ‘Russia is weak; its military is poorly trained; its equipment mostly recycled from the Soviet era; its missiles and artillery in short supply’. Zbig Brzezinski earlier had taken the logic to its conclusion in The Grand Chessboard (1997): Russia would have no choice but to submit to the expansion of NATO and to the geopolitical dictates of the U.S.. That was ‘then’ (a little more than a year ago). Russia took the western challenge – and today is in the driving seat in Ukraine, whilst the West looks on helplessly. This last month, it was U.S. retired General Jack Keane, the strategic analyst for Fox News, who argued that Israel’s air strike on Iran had left it 'essentially naked', with most air defences 'taken down' and its missile production factories destroyed by Israel’s 26 October strikes. Iran’s vulnerability, Keane said, is 'simply staggering'. Kean channels the early Brzezinski: His message is clear – Iran will be an ‘easy war’. That forecast however, is likely to be revealed as dead wrong. And, if pursued, will lead to a complete military and economic disaster for Israel. But do not rule out the distinct possibility that Netanyahu – besieged on all fronts and teetering on the brink of internal crisis and even jail – is desperate enough to do it. His is, after all, a Biblical mandate that he pursues for Israel! Iran likely will launch a painful response to Israel before the 20 January Presidential Inauguration. Its riposte will demonstrate Iran’s unexpected and unforeseen military innovation. What the U.S. and Israel will then do may well open the door to wider regional war. Sentiment across the region seethes at the slaughter in the Occupied Territories and in Lebanon. Trump may not appreciate just how isolated the U.S. and Israel are among Israel’s Arab and Sunni neighbours. The U.S. is stretched so thin, and its forces across the region are so vulnerable to the hostility that the daily slaughter incubates, that a regional war might be enough to bring the entire house of cards tumbling down. The crisis would pitch Trump into a financial crisis that could sink his domestic economic aspirations too.

Robert Reich: There Was No Mandate For Trump, There Was No Red Sh...	Trump is saying the election gave him a 'very big mandate.' Rubbish. It wasn’t a mandate at all. It wasn’t even a 'red shift' to Trump and the Republicans. It was a blue abandonment. We now know that nine million fewer votes were cast nationwide in 2024 than in 2020. Trump got about a million more votes than he did in 2020 (700,000 of them in the seven battleground states). That’s no big deal. The bigger news is that Harris got 10 million fewer votes than Biden did in 2020 (400,000 fewer in the battleground states). Harris campaigned hard in the battlegrounds, so her erosion from Biden’s vote there wasn’t nearly as much, proportionately, as it was everywhere else across the country. The biggest takeaway is that Biden’s 9 million votes disappeared. Why? It couldn’t have been because of virulent racism because we elected a Black man, twice. It couldn’t have been misogyny, since Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than Trump in 2016, and Clinton’s actions and statements probably triggered more misogyny in 2016 than did Harris’s in 2024. There’s no evidence of illegal vote tampering or of voter suppression nearly on this scale. In fact, it was easier to cast a ballot this year than in 2020. So what happened to the 9 million? We can’t know for sure but it seems most likely that those 9 million potential voters — mostly working class — said to themselves, 'I won’t vote for Trump because he’s an asshole. But I won’t vote for the Democrats either, because they don’t give a damn about me.' The task for the Democrats is what it should have been all along: remaking the party into the party of the bottom 90 percent — the party of people who don’t live off stocks and bonds, of people who are not CEOs or billionaires like Mark Cuban, the party that rejects Elon Musk and the entire American oligarchy. Instead, the Democratic Party must be the party of average working people whose wages have gone nowhere and whose jobs are less secure. Blue-collar private-sector workers earned more on average in 1972, after adjusting for inflation, than they are earning now in 2024. This means today’s blue-collar workers are on average earning less in real dollars than their grandparents earned 52 years ago. Yet the American economy is far larger than it was 52 years ago. Where did the additional money go? To the top. So what’s the Democrats’ task? To restructure the economy toward more widely shared prosperity. This isn’t a blue-state versus red-state phenomenon. It’s a class phenomenon. In Missouri, one of the reddest of the red, voters passed an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by a wide margin, even as they overwhelmingly rejected Harris. It looks like they did the same in Alaska. In ruby-red Nebraska, roughly 75 percent of voters backed a measure to institute paid sick leave, although they rejected Harris. (Nebraskans also came close to unseating their incumbent senator in favor of Dan Osborn, a union activist who ran as an independent and railed against corporate overlords.) Americans across the board want a fairer economy. Trump Republicans won’t deliver one. Instead, Trump and his allies are readying more tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthy and regulatory rollbacks. They’re preparing to hand the country over to billionaires. Democrats! This is your opportunity! Take it! This article was published at Robert Reich's Substack	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-15T17:37:36-08:00
