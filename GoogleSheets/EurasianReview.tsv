Presidential Elections In Belarus: Lukashenko And The Art Of Bala...	Belarus will hold its presidential elections on 26 January 2025. According to the Belarusian Constitution, the president is elected for a five-year term. Under the electoral law, any citizen of Belarus born in the country, who is at least 35 years old, and has resided continuously in the Republic of Belarus for at least ten years prior to the elections, is eligible to run for president. Candidates must not have a criminal record. Presidential candidates are nominated by citizens of Belarus, provided they secure at least 100,000 signatures from eligible voters. The nomination process is conducted by initiative groups of citizens, comprising at least 100 members. The presidential elections are considered valid if more than 50% of all citizens of the Republic of Belarus registered on the electoral roll participate in the voting process. A candidate is elected president if they receive over 50% of the votes cast during the election[2]. The Central Election Commission (CEC) has registered five candidates for the upcoming seventh presidential elections. These include the incumbent Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko; the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus Oleg Gaidukevich, chairman of the Republican Party of Labour and Justice Alexander Khizhnyak, private entrepreneur Anna Kanopatskaya, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus Sergei Syrankov. After verifying the authenticity and accuracy of the collected signatures, the nominees were officially confirmed as candidates. According to data from the Central Election Commission, Lukashenko’s candidacy secured over 2.5 million supporting signatures, while the other candidates collected just over 100,000 signatures each. Igor Karpenko, chairman of the Central Election Commission, stated that 93 international observers have been accredited to monitor the presidential elections, along with 951 national observers in regional commissions. From 1 January 2025, the electoral process entered the pre-election campaign phase. The number of registered voters as of 25 February 2024 stands at 6,825,985. Presidential elections 2020 The outcome of the presidential elections held in early August 2020, in which Lukashenko won by a large majority, intensified tensions with the domestic opposition, backed by Western powers. This led to several thousand protesters gathering at Independence Square, facing the seat of the Belarusian government, in a manner reminiscent of the so-called 'colour revolutions' in many former Soviet republics at the beginning of the 21st century. At the same time, Lukashenko's relations with Moscow were strained following the detention of 32 Russian nationals and one Belarusian citizen, accused of plotting to destabilise Belarus and overthrow his government. While Moscow awaited the release of its citizens, early signs of a 'colour revolution' began to emerge, resembling the one in Ukraine in early 2014. Western countries issued threats and attempted to intimidate Lukashenko, warning him of sanctions and isolation. Some Western governments, primarily France, Germany, and Poland, went as far as demanding a repeat of the presidential elections. The demonstrations escalated into violence between some protesters and security forces, leading to the arrest of hundreds of demonstrators. In the streets of Minsk, vehicles driven by protesters ran over police officers, resulting in the deaths of nine security personnel—an unprecedented event in the history of 'colour revolutions.' Although Lukashenko took the initiative to apologise to protesters, called on the Minister of Internal Affairs to take responsibility for failing to adhere to directives on the peaceful handling of demonstrators, and ordered the immediate release of all detainees, the unrest persisted. Russian state media joined the campaign against the Belarusian government, airing footage of violence by Belarusian security forces and their excessive breaches of the rights and safety of ordinary citizens uninvolved in the protests. This fuelled growing dissatisfaction and outrage among political and social circles both within Belarus and internationally. Disturbing scenes from the bloody demonstrations were featured on the programme Solovyov Live (Соловьёв Live), hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, a figure closely aligned with the Kremlin. Solovyov claimed that Belarusian security forces would not have resorted to violent treatment of helpless youth, women, and the elderly without the approval and explicit directives of the state leadership. This, he speculated, might partly explain the violent actions of some protesters. In an effort to present a balanced view, Solovyov also aired footage of armed clashes between security forces and certain protesters. These individuals displayed combat skills and street-fighting experience, suggesting they had been trained and prepared in advance, likely under instructions from a 'third party' that manipulated the peaceful protests, turning them into violence and bloodshed. Moscow scaled back its unconditional support for the government in Minsk, permitting Kremlin-affiliated commentators to criticise and condemn Lukashenko’s handling of his citizens. He was accused of betraying Russian interests, including his refusal to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia after the 2008 armed conflict. His refusal to acknowledge Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, citing strict adherence to the UN Charter and international law, heightened the pressure on him to change his stance. Facing intense pressure from the West and a coordinated Russian campaign against the Minsk government, President Lukashenko decided to release the detained Russian members of the Wagner Group. The president realised the consequences of his policy of prioritising closer ties with the West over Russia. Analysts believe that Lukashenko has always been skilled at balancing relations between East and West to safeguard Belarus’s independence. Opposition without a leader Belarus’s political opposition was effectively without leadership, with no one ready to enter into dialogue with the government within a political framework that could serve as a roadmap for managing the crisis and moving towards negotiations with the current president. Observers pointed to the incompetence of opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, whom opposition supporters claimed won approximately 70-75% of the votes, while official results announced by the Central Election Commission indicated that she secured just over 10%. Tsikhanouskaya urged her supporters to stay off the streets and remain calm[3] before fleeing to neighbouring Lithuania, where she proclaimed the 'need for new elections in Belarus.' From Lithuania, she declared that she would not concede defeat and announced the start of consultations to form a so-called Coordination Council[4], which she stated was intended to facilitate a transfer of power in the country. Tsikhanouskaya reiterated her willingness to engage in dialogue with the authorities, provided that all individuals detained during the protests are released and those responsible for ordering crackdowns and shootings at protesters are held accountable. Simultaneously, she called on the international community and European nations to assist in facilitating such dialogue. Meanwhile, protesters on the streets of Minsk escalated their demands, calling for Lukashenko’s resignation. The Russian perspective on the 2020 elections Alexander Lukashenko received congratulations from several key allies, including China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a diplomatically lukewarm congratulatory message, characterised by generic phrases that emphasised hopes for the continued strengthening of bilateral relations across all areas, as well as support for Belarus’s cooperation within Eurasian organisations and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which links Belarus with Russia and several former Soviet states in matters of security and defence. Russia feared losing Belarus in the same manner it lost Ukraine after the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. In response to the reconciliation initiative proposed by the Belarusian president, Russia acted swiftly to mitigate the risk of the revolution taking a direction detrimental to its interests, as had occurred in Ukraine. Public discontent over the Covid-19 pandemic The demonstrations in Minsk and the ensuing political crisis after the presidential elections were essentially rooted in an economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Economic growth fell below 5%, while unemployment rose from its previous level of around 4%. Relations with the Russian Federation were further strained by Alexander Lukashenko’s demands for Moscow to increase transit fees for pipelines, oil, and goods bound for Europe (Poland and Germany), a request that Russia rejected. Belarus adopted a completely different approach to the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the rest of Europe, including its closest neighbours, Russia and Ukraine. While Ukraine implemented a state of emergency in Kyiv and other regions, and Russia closed schools, cancelled group events, and suspended domestic and international flights, daily life in Belarus continued unaffected, as if nothing had happened. President Lukashenko maintained that there was no need for his country to adopt preventive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 'Such things happen, but the most important thing is not to panic!' Lukashenko declared. Constructive opposition – a matter of national interest Opposition is a vital component of any democratic society, tasked with monitoring government policies with the aim of improving them or highlighting certain shortcomings and errors that may arise in the management of public affairs by the executive branch. Constructive opposition is a legitimate right and a cornerstone of democracy. Protests and the peaceful expression of views and demands are democratic practices universally recognised in democratic systems around the world. Genuine and constructive opposition plays a constitutional role and is accountable solely to the electorate, and should remain free from the influence of external factors that are viewed unfavourably by Belarusian citizens. It represents the essence of democracy and provides a strong foundation for safeguarding the state within the framework of the constitution and the law, while also reinforcing other state institutions. A clear distinction must be drawn between constructive opposition, which seeks to address and rectify mistakes for the benefit of the nation and its citizens, and destructive opposition, which leverages errors to destabilise security and stability, pushing the state into a spiral of violence and chaos. Portrait of the current president The current president, Alexander Lukashenko, has held power for 30 years, ascending to office in 1994 amidst the turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Early in his presidency and throughout his tenure, he sought to preserve what remained of the state institutions inherited from the USSR. He succeeded in keeping much of the industrial sector under state control and consistently opposed any foreign interference in the country’s domestic affairs. His relations with Russia have always fluctuated, while he simultaneously worked to establish normal relations with the West and NATO. Lukashenko’s professional life has gone through numerous stages, taking him from a farmer and villager to a politician and president, and eventually to a leader whom many in both the West and the East wish to remove from power. Yet, each time, he manages to thwart these efforts and maintain his hold on power. In an October 2021 interview with Matthew Chance, a journalist from the American television network CNN, Lukashenko was asked whether he believed there would be another president of Belarus. Lukashenko replied, 'Matthew, I am not going to be president until I die. If you and your patrons in the West, wherever they are, stop interfering in our situation, and we can be calm and confident as a sovereign independent nation and a people who deserve to be independent and sovereign, believe me, everything will happen sooner than you think. But if you dare to interfere in our affairs again, as in 2020, it will be bad.'[5] Analysts struggle to reconcile the duality of a president who claims he wants to remain in power to resist Russian aspirations to annex Belarus and Western interference in its internal affairs, yet is also portrayed as a dictator who must be removed and whose legitimacy is denied. The West has never criticised other leaders of former Soviet states, such as Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev or Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev, among others. The question is: Is Lukashenko a dictator or a patriot? A famous saying goes: 'No human being embodies absolute good or absolute evil; instead, every person carries a blend of both, in varying degrees.' This reflection may well be the most accurate description of any individual, including Lukashenko. It is an undeniable fact that not all nations are prepared to adopt and implement the Western model of democracy. This model is often incompatible with countries that have distinct cultures, traditions, and unique socio-political developments. The success of a specific democratic model in the United States or Germany does not imply that it should be imposed, generalised, or exported to all countries. Each nation has its own democratic framework, rooted in its traditions, historical experiences, and national values. The painful aftermath of the Arab Spring still demonstrates this, where, instead of democracy, anarchy unfolded in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and the ensuing chaos and lawlessness even led to the creation of the terrorist quasi-state ISIS as a direct consequence. New hopes pinned on President Trump’s policies The new American administration under Donald Trump could introduce changes and take concrete steps in US-Belarus relations. From the American perspective, Belarus is likely to remain within Russia’s sphere of influence. Rather than focusing on severing Minsk-Moscow ties, efforts may shift toward containing and reducing Russian influence in Belarus. As a result, the US stance toward Belarus and the potential easing or tightening of sanctions will most likely depend on US-Russia relations. Criticism of the Belarusian authorities for human rights violations is likely to continue, albeit in a softer tone and remain largely declarative. Belarus’s pro-Western opposition fears that support from the United States may diminish. It is quite likely that the new American administration will delegate the responsibility for backing Belarus’s pro-Western opposition to the European Union. The Trump administration is likely to prioritise enhancing dialogue with Russia to address geopolitical challenges, such as countering Chinese influence, potentially shifting its approach from confrontation to cooperation. Under this scenario, Belarus might expect certain diplomatic concessions from Washington, including visits by senior US officials, similar to those during Trump’s first term. High-profile visits, such as those of National Security Advisor John Bolton on 29 August 2019 and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 1 February 2020, could be repeated in the near future as part of efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war. Additional positive signs of a potential easing in US-Russia relations have emerged from Washington with Trump’s appointment of Keith Kellogg, a former National Security Advisor and retired US Army Lieutenant General, as Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg’s focus will be on ending the war in Ukraine, and he advocates for tough negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine to achieve this goal. In an interview with Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk on 13 August 2024, US President Donald Trump commended the authoritarian leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as 'at the peak of their game.' While acknowledging their controversial practices, Trump remarked that, despite often being labelled as dictators, these leaders demonstrate a profound love for their nations, albeit 'a different kind of love.'[6] [1] IFIMES - International Institute for Middle East and Balkan Studies, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, has a special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council ECOSOC/UN in New York since 2018, and it is the publisher of the international scientific journal 'European Perspectives', link: [2] The Central Election Commission of the Republic of Belarus.

AUKUS: Flawed And Sinking – OpEd	A stillborn agreement treated as thrivingly alive; an understanding celebrated as consensual and equal. The AUKUS security arrangement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, envisaging the transfer and building of nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy, continues operating in haphazard fashion. So far, the stream has flown away from Australia and into the military industrial complexes of the UK and the US, both desperate to keep the production of these absurd boats steady. Australia has yet to see the fabled white elephants of the sea and remain at the mercy of the US Congress. In the meantime, the country is becoming garrisoned, billeted and appropriated to Washington’s geopolitical vanities. Not being a natural enemy and adversary in any sense, and being the most lucrative trading partner, China has become a fantastically idiotic target for Canberra’s foreign policy dunces. Announced in September 2021 as 'an enhanced trilateral security partnership', AUKUS has hobbled and stuttered its way into 2025. Commentary from the pompom holders for war at such outlets as The Economist continue with such mild remarks as 'ambitious but expensive'. The Australian, armed and eager to do battle in print and digital media against the Yellow Peril, features an article about feeding the military industrial complex by politely calling it 'a defence revolution.' 19FortyFive fastens onto the idea that Australia’s naval modernisation is central in this endeavour, though never mentions the obvious beneficiary. (In two words: not Australia.) 'Nevertheless, AUKUS allows for a broader integration of technological advances in its partners and much-needed modernization of the Australian navy.' This optimistic glow, despite the limping, the delays, and the blunders, can also be found in Australian Defence. The military industrial complex never needs concrete reasons to exist. It’s a creature onto itself. 'Global firms are partnering with Australian based entities in a bid to position themselves for lucrative AUKUS submarine contracts, despite law reforms needed to progress.' One of them is the Texas-based Fluor Corporation, an engineering and construction firm proud, in the words of its Australia & New Zealand president, Gillian Cagney, of its 'thousand engineers who have nuclear capability.' Cagney, like most chiefs and CEOs in this line of work, is good at saying nothing about nothing in particular. When doing so, the language can be guaranteed a good mauling. 'We have that experience and capability that we will be supporting the joint venture to bring to bear and making sure we’re bringing the best in class globally.' Even then, Cagney concedes that the whole business of nuclear-powered submarines for the RAN, known in military planning circles as 'Pillar One', is dicey. Hardly a reason to panic, as this tortured statement testifies: 'One of the things as Worley Fluor Australia we are able to do is in multiple sectors globally is to ramp up to meet our customers needs so it’s no different.' From the United States Studies Centre, that comfortable, uncritical bastion of Pax Americana, a senior research associate, Alice Nason, is found telling France’s Libération that hiccups are bound to take place when the tasks are large. 'In a project of this size, length and complexity of AUKUS, it’s no surprise that disruptions and delays are going to arise.' The truism here is intended to excuse the unpardonable. Why projects of such scale are ever needed is left dangling in ether. These dreary excuses for justifications dressed up as analysis never hide the fundamental defect of AUKUS. It remains, almost entirely, governed by US domestic and foreign interests. It says almost nothing about Australia’s needs, merely speaking to confected Australian fears. It advances the agenda of insecurity, not security. The analysts, lined up from one row to another, cannot assure anybody about what Congress will do if the submarine supply quota lags, or if there will be a war over that strip of territory known as Taiwan. No publication, however lovingly disposed to the business of war, can avoid the teasing worries. Even that pro-Washington, and US defence industry funded outlet based in Canberra, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, has gone so far as to consider a heresy. In December, it ran an article by Peter Briggs, past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, suggesting that Canberra consider acquiring 'at least 12 submarines of the French Suffren design. The current AUKUS plan for eight nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) has always been flawed, and now its risks are piling up.' And so we return to where we began: a Franco-Australian agreement to acquire submarines that was sunk in 2021 by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. All in all, forget the submarines, Pillar One, or whatever pillar the strategists tie themselves in knots about. Focus, instead, on the second 'pillar'. Australia has become captive – aided through its dim bulbed representatives – of an empire that fears growing old, haggard and weak. It has been enlisted as servitor, grounds keeper and nurse. Retirees from the US Navy are being given astronomical sums in consultancy fees to divulge wisdom they do not have on junkets Down Under. Think tankers from Australia purporting to be academics make similar trips to Washington to celebrate a failing agreement with treasonous delight. The price Australia is paying is already savagely burdensome. It may well, in the long run, prove worse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geNdAaiLqzvhY	2025-01-12T17:29:34-08:00	
The Fall Of Syria’s Assad Regime Is Bad News For Libya – Analysis	Russia’s apparent fast-tracking of plans to establish a military hub in Libya could worsen that country’s protracted conflict. By Peter Fabricius For Russia, as for Iran, last month’s fall of the 54-year-old Assad dynasty in Syria was a major geo-strategic setback. Former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s sudden defeat threatened Russia’s important military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Now Moscow is believed to be trying to negotiate a continued presence with the new Syrian authorities. But it is also transferring military equipment from Syria to nearby Libya, apparently to establish or strengthen Russia’s presence in that country as a new hub for its African operations. This could seriously damage efforts to resolve Libya’s protracted conflict. The end of al-Assad’s regime also has repercussions for Russia’s growing presence across Africa. Moscow’s naval and air bases in Syria have been the hubs for supplying Russia’s continental operations – mainly in Libya and also in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic and Sudan. Assad hosted a major Russian military presence in Syria with a warm-water naval base in the port of Tartus, an air base at Khmeimim to the north near the port of Latakia, and a helicopter base at Qamishli in the far northeast. Peace agreements among rival Libyan parties say foreign militaries should have left the country long ago ‘The rapid collapse of the Assad regime in Syria – a regime that the Kremlin helped prop up since 2015 – is a strategic political defeat for Moscow and has thrown the Kremlin into a crisis as it seeks to retain its strategic military basing in Syria,’ the Institute for the Study of War said on 9 December. ‘Putin … intervened on behalf of Assad in 2015 to secure Russian military bases in Syria, support Russia’s wider efforts to project power in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, increase its global footprint in the Middle East and Africa, and threaten [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s] southern flank. ‘Russia is attempting to secure its bases in Syria as opposition forces come to power, but Russia’s continued military presence in the country is not guaranteed. [This] especially as Russia’s actions in support of Assad over the past nine years have likely undermined Moscow’s ability to form a lasting, positive relationship with ruling Syrian opposition groups,’ the institute said. Uncertainty about who might constitute the new government also probably complicates these negotiations. And so perhaps as a precaution, Moscow has begun shifting military resources to Libya, where it had already started reinforcing its military presence in 2023/24. ‘Four weeks ago, Russia experienced a clear setback in Syria – an outcome it had not planned for, since losing Assad undermines a key logistical hub that, for nine years, supported its operations in Libya and beyond into Sub-Saharan Africa,’ an analyst at The Sentry, a US-based investigative and policy organisation, told ISS Today. ‘In a bid to preserve its African operations, Moscow has been bolstering its footprint in Libya to compensate for its deteriorating circumstances in Syria in recent weeks. And so far, it has done so without introducing a naval element – at least not yet. ‘Over the last four weeks, Russia has been moving substantial amounts of military resources by air to Libya, from Syria, from Russia and from Belarus.’ Turning Libya into a base for major-power rivalries would complicate the country’s internal crisis Several other reports in mainstream media as well as intelligence sites confirm several flights of large Russian Air Force cargo aircraft from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria to Russia’s al-Khadim near Benghazi in eastern Libya in the last week of December. They speculate the planes were carrying military equipment. This week, Ukrainian intelligence sources who asked to remain anonymous and other analysts said several Russian ships were scheduled to dock in Tartus. They said that the roll on-roll off Sparta and Sparta II would be used to transport military equipment to Libya, though some would be transported back to Russia. The bolstering of Russia’s military presence in Libya threatens to perpetuate, if not aggravate, the conflict in that country. Russia has for years backed the eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar of the Benghazi-based government in its protracted struggle with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. In December, Abdul Hamid Dabaiba, Prime Minister of the government of national unity in Tripoli, strongly objected to Russia reinforcing its Libyan bases. He said this was turning Libya into a base for major-power rivalries and would complicate the country’s internal crisis. It should also be noted that in terms of the peace agreements among rival Libyan parties, all foreign militaries should have left Libya long ago. The sudden collapse of the Assad regime raises questions about Russia’s ability to provide security support to its allies ‘The sudden collapse of the Assad regime also raises questions about Russia’s ability to continue providing military and security support to its allies,’ says Denys Reva, an Institute for Security Studies Researcher. ‘It seems that Russia might currently be overstretched and unable to spare additional resources.’ He says that if Russia were also to lose its access to Libya, that would undermine Moscow’s ability to appropriately support and supply its troops in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. ‘The Russians have definitely seen their circumstances degrade in Syria,’ says The Sentry’s analyst. ‘Even if one assumes that they stay in Latakia and Tartus, the environment has become more uncertain, less convenient and riskier. ‘By strengthening its footprint in Libya, Russia may be attempting to compensate for that deterioration in Syria – or at least part of it. If it didn’t do so, Moscow would be risking a fragilisation of its missions in Sub-Saharan Africa.’ For Africa, the net effect of Assad’s demise remains uncertain. A weakening of Russia’s military presence on the continent would arguably be positive, given its performance in the Sahel especially. In Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, Russia is propping up military regimes that took power via coups, and is accused of gross abuses against civilians, without any visible improvement in curbing terrorism. For Libya, the likely consequences seem to be more unambiguously negative. By switching the focus of its military operations to Libya, Russia has acquired an even stronger incentive to entrench itself in that country and perpetuate the internal conflict, as Dabaiba warned.

Trends In Terrorism: What’s On The Horizon In 2025? – Analysis	By Colin P. Clarke (FPRI) -- Sitting down to write my annual assessment on trends in terrorism in early 2025, I am struggling more than usual, fresh off the horrors of an Islamic State (ISIS)-inspired terrorist attack in New Orleans that killed fourteen people and injured dozens more. It is always a challenge to look beyond the immediate, to take a step back and weigh myriad factors and variables that impact which trends may accelerate and which may disappear. It is impossible to know whether the New Orleans attack suggests a 'new wave' of ISIS-inspired attacks in the West and in the United States in particular. Rather, the attack is another data point that demonstrates what many in the counterterrorism community have been saying ad nauseum for years—the threat posed by ISIS is consistent, enduring, and likely to ebb and flow over time in response to geopolitical events and counterterrorism pressure. Still, the threat is enduring and will remain an uncomfortable truth for policymakers as they attempt to right-size the resources provided to counter-terrorism agencies with their agreed-upon level of risk tolerance. Predicting when and where terrorists will strike is among the most difficult tasks an intelligence analyst has. This requires assessing the combination of capabilities, intent, and operational environment, overlayed with public statements and propaganda of terrorist groups to understand their grievances and discern possible target selection. Terrorism does not always proceed in a linear fashion. In other words, sometimes what seem to be the most obvious or pressing threats fail to materialize, while others that appear to have faded reemerge again. Before the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, few counterterrorism analysts outside of Israel dedicated any bandwidth to analyzing the group. And before Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) December offensive that saw the group topple longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad and seize control of Syria, the organization was something of an afterthought, outside of a small circle of committed scholars and experts. As HTS looks to assume power in Syria, disaffected hardliners within the group, including jihadists belonging to the Turkestan Islamic Party and other Central Asian battalions, could seek to splinter off and continue their violent campaign. Both Syria and Afghanistan are now governed by terrorist groups (HTS is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, while the Taliban is not, although elements of the Taliban are designated through their affiliation with the Haqqani Network). So, while Hamas and HTS were mostly under the radar, the group that many were most concerned about—Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K—also launched several high-profile attacks (Iran in January 2024 and Russia in March 2024) while a flurry of plots was disrupted, including a plan to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, Austria over the summer. The perpetrators in the Swift plot were extremely young, reflecting another trend—youth radicalization—that remains a constant challenge for counterterrorism authorities. ISIS attacks in Dagestan and Oman showed the group’s geographic expanse, a trend likely to continue in the coming year as it seeks to resurge from Syria to Somalia. The group inspired a plot to attack the United States on Election Day in November. Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi was arrested by the FBI before he was able to put his plan into action, in which he intended to murder civilians with AK-47 rifles. The ISIS-K presence in Afghanistan, which the Taliban has failed to attenuate, will continue to destabilize South Asia, where militant groups including Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and the Baluchistan Liberation Army also remain growing threats to monitor. The former has directly threatened the government in Islamabad while the latter continues to target Chinese nationals and disrupt security along Beijing’s signature foreign policy initiative, the Belt and Road infrastructure project. Sub-Saharan Africa, especially the Sahel region, will continue to be a hotbed of terrorism, as failed states and ungoverned spaces provide sanctuary to a range of jihadist groups associated with both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin operates with near impunity in Western Africa, even conducting a massive attack last year that killed more than 600 people in Burkina Faso. The security situation continues to deteriorate as jihadist groups push out toward coastal West Africa, threatening previously stable countries like Ghana and expanding their reach from Cameroon to Nigeria. Along with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali have employed private military contractors from Russia’s Wagner Group (now rebranded as Africa Corps) to help with coup-proofing, and the mercenaries have behaved predictably, engineering a scorched earth counterinsurgency approach that has exacerbated the terrorist threat, rather than mollifying it. Elsewhere in Africa, both al-Shabaab and ISIS threaten Somalia and the greater Horn of Africa, while the Islamic State’s presence has ebbed and flowed in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among other states in the region. The incessant reverberations of October 7th and the collapse of the Assad regime mean that geopolitical events in the Middle East will still be a significant driver of terrorism this year. Lebanese Hezbollah has been attenuated to a degree many could not have imagined just one year ago. Israel’s devastating pager and walkie-talkie attack in September left the group reeling, killing more than a dozen and injuring thousands more. As the centerpiece of a relentless military campaign in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces assassinated Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in September. While Hezbollah has no doubt been severely degraded, the group remains dangerous and could seek to revert to its roots as a purely terrorist organization. The last time Israel killed a Hezbollah leader, as occurred with Abbas al-Musawi in 1992, the group responded by launching bombing attacks against Israeli targets in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Its global network remains intact, and in the past, it has demonstrated reach with attacks in Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Bulgaria and plots disrupted in Cyprus, Egypt, and Singapore. Hezbollah could look to strike US and/or Israeli interests, including embassies, in countries throughout Latin America, Africa, or elsewhere based on perceived security vulnerabilities. Like Hezbollah, Hamas has also been crippled. Israel’s scorched earth approach in Gaza and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe—45,000 Palestinians have been killed so far—will make it easier for Hamas to recruit the next generation of militants. Hamas will also look to spread its influence in the West Bank. But the group’s capabilities will be limited for the foreseeable future. Still, even if Hamas remains limited in Gaza, the conflict itself has spilled across borders and catalyzed protests, demonstrations, and acts of violence abroad, including in Europe, North America, and Australia. If Hamas decided to do so, it could likely leverage pro-Palestinian sentiment and anti-Israeli grievances to inspire attacks in the West among its supporters or these individuals could take action on their own. This could take many forms, including attacks or plots to attack Israeli embassies or consulates, as occurred in Serbia in June and almost occurred against the Israeli Consulate in New York City in December. Following the attacks of October 7th, there has been a massive spike in both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism globally, with spillover impacting many Western countries. Of all the proxies belonging to Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' the Houthis in Yemen may be the most difficult to deter. The United States, United Kingdom, and Israel have all taken turns bombing Houthi positions in an effort to blunt the group’s ability to launch attacks and disrupt commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Between the Houthis, which the Trump administration will seek to redesignate as a foreign terrorist organization, and an array of Iraqi Shia militia groups, including Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba, elements of the Axis present an omnipresent threat in the Middle East. Upon scanning the horizon, looking ahead it seems plausible that a terrorist group will seek to command the spotlight through a spectacular attack, which could feature the use of an emerging technology like drones, 3-D printing, or involve the use of a weapon of mass destruction. The more lethal or high-profile an attack, the more prestige it garners, and the more mileage an individual or group can get out of propaganda geared toward supporters, followers, and potential new recruits. There is also a growing trend in cooperation between terrorist groups, including the case of the Houthis working with al-Shabaab in Somalia, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula expanding cooperation with the Houthis. There is also a state sponsorship element present, with both Russia and China assisting the Houthis with targeting data and weapons, respectively. With President-elect Donald Trump taking office in just a few weeks, there are a host of other terrorism-related issues to consider. The Trump administration could look to designate one of the leading Mexican cartels—the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas—as a foreign terrorist organization, a move which would facilitate more kinetic action against drug traffickers south of the border. As part of its border security policies, the Trump team will be looking to severely curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, which is facilitated by individuals in China who work hand in glove with criminal organizations in Mexico. On the domestic terrorism front, Trump has discussed the possibility of pardoning some of the January 6thinsurrectionists, a move that 'could trigger a renaissance for militant extremists, sending them an unprecedented message of protection and support,' according to a recent article in ProPublica. 2025 could bring a spike in far-left extremism from those groups, networks, and individuals who see Trump’s presidency as existential. This includes violent anarchists and the most extreme members of Antifa, in addition to single-issue terrorists motivated by a range of issues, including the environment, animal welfare, and access to abortion. With the assassination of a healthcare CEO by a lone actor late last year—and the seeming groundswell of support enjoyed by the attacker—it is not inconceivable that a palpable anti-capitalist streak motivates a copycat action. The attacker was also apparently impressed by the writings of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, and what his manifesto had to say about the creeping ubiquity of technology, an aversion shared by neo-Luddites and so-called technophobes who have attacked 5G cell towers and are pushing back against the encroachment of artificial intelligence. Far-right domestic extremism also looms large, especially when considering the polarization and hyper-partisanship infecting US domestic politics. Moreover, with the immigration debate likely to heat up even further, it is not unreasonable to foresee animosity between immigrant communities and those opposed to their presence. In August 2019, a white supremacist walked into an El Paso Walmart and killed twenty-three people because of his hatred of Mexicans and his obsession with the Great Replacement Theory, a conspiracy positing that there is an ongoing replacement of the native-born white population in the United States, primarily orchestrated by a nefarious cabal of Jews and political elites. Some far-right extremists, particularly racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists, could be emboldened by careless mainstream violent political rhetoric. In both 2024 and 2025, the years have begun with high-profile terrorist attacks committed by ISIS. The trends indicate another concerning year, with a complex array of threat actors and advanced capabilities. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Israel’s military campaign in the Middle East, and a rising China all demand great power attention. Yet, as the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023 and the takeover of Syria by HTS demonstrated, violent non-state actors, especially terrorist groups, still play an outsized role in geopolitics. Expect this year to be no different. The United States and its allies face no shortage of challenges, compounded by a change in administrations, with no time for Trump to ease back into the job. On the contrary, a bevy of 'Day One' problems await his arrival. About the author: Colin P.

Jimmy Carter: Life And Legacy Of The 39th US President – Analysis	The death of Jimmy Carter on December 29, 2024, marked the passing of the 39th President of the United States, who served from 1977 to 1981 during a pivotal period in the mid-Cold War and a time of societal changes in America. Carter was the only U.S. president to reach the age of 100 and the longest-living former president, with a remarkable 44 years of post-presidency. Although he served only one term, his tenure was marked by significant domestic and foreign policy events and processes that he directly or indirectly shaped. This ensures Carter’s place as an important figure in the history of the U.S. and the world. Moreover, his tireless post-presidency work—founding the Carter Center in 1982 to promote human rights, reduce suffering, and advance peace worldwide—cemented his legacy. For his post-presidency efforts, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Considering his modest beginnings as the son of a rural working-class family in the American South, few could have predicted Carter’s extraordinary life achievements. Childhood and Youth James Earl Carter Jr., officially known as Jimmy Carter, was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, a small town in rural Georgia in the southeastern United States. He was the oldest of four children born to farmer James Earl Carter Sr. and nurse Lillian Gordy Carter. Raised in modest circumstances, Carter was exposed from an early age to the social injustices of the American South: racial segregation and the inequalities between the rich and the poor. Carter’s childhood was steeped in life on the family peanut farm. Growing up in a hardworking environment among ordinary Americans shaped his strong work ethic and sensitivity to the struggles of everyday people. In addition to pursuing his education, Carter assisted his parents on the farm. His mother encouraged his education, while his conservative father emphasized discipline and responsibility. Although racial barriers were deeply entrenched in Georgia society, Carter’s family rose above white-black divisions. His mother was known for providing medical care to Black families and openly expressed sympathy for the fight for equality. Although his father supported segregation, he allowed young Jimmy to interact with Black children. These experiences with racial segregation would later inspire Carter to reflect on human rights and justice. Carter attended local schools in Plains, where he excelled academically, particularly in history and science. His dedication to learning and humility made him a model student. After finishing high school, he applied to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he was accepted in 1943. The academy was rigorous, but Carter quickly adapted. He graduated in 1946 as one of the top students. During his studies, he developed an interest in engineering and technology. While at Annapolis, he met Rosalynn Smith, his future wife, also from Plains, who would play a key role in his political career. Upon graduation, Carter began his service in the U.S. Navy, working on nuclear energy development for submarines under Admiral Hyman Rickover’s leadership. Although he seemed destined for a bright future in naval science, his father’s sudden death in 1953 forced Carter to leave the Navy and take over the family peanut farm in Plains. Entry into Politics Carter inherited a farm saddled with debt. Despite his naval expertise, transitioning to agriculture was challenging, but he and his wife managed to succeed. Despite financial struggles, droughts, and inexperience, the Carters transformed the family business into a thriving enterprise by the 1950s. Living in Georgia, a state fraught with racial tensions, pushed Carter into an unexpected political career. As a dedicated member of the Democratic Party, he advocated for the abolition of racial segregation, the fight against corruption, and electoral reform. These progressive views led to his election to the Georgia Senate in 1962, where he was re-elected two years later. Such positions were unusual for a white Southern Democrat, but voters recognized his commitment. Although he ran for governor of Georgia in 1966, he lost. Disheartened by the defeat, Carter found solace in Christianity. He became an even stronger proponent of Christian values, opposing racial segregation and social inequality while championing justice. Governor of Georgia and Presidential Campaign In 1970, Carter won the gubernatorial race and served as governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. Although he was initially reserved on segregation during his campaign, he declared it a thing of the past upon taking office. He appointed women and African Americans to government positions and introduced numerous reforms. Carter modernized the state administration, reduced bureaucracy, and increased efficiency, focusing on education and environmental protection. After completing his governorship, Carter made a bold decision to run for president. Though a radical move, he believed he had the necessary skills—and he was right. Successfully balancing progressive ideas with pragmatic solutions, he appealed to a broad base of voters. Moreover, Americans were weary of familiar faces. The Watergate scandal exposed the corruption of Washington’s political elite. President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 due to illegal wiretapping, and public trust in politicians was at a historic low. Carter, as a young, untainted, and moral politician from the South, was a refreshing contrast to the worn-out Washington establishment. During his campaign, he adopted a grassroots approach, visiting nearly every state and engaging directly with voters. Though an outsider to the establishment, his messages of trust, integrity, and the return of ethics to politics won over the electorate. In November 1976, with Walter Mondale as his vice-presidential candidate, he narrowly defeated Republican President Gerald Ford. Carter became the first Southern president since the Civil War openly opposed to racial segregation. Presidency Jimmy Carter’s tenure as the 39th President of the United States was characterized by ambitious domestic reforms, foreign policy successes and setbacks, and conflicts with Congress and the public. Adopting an informal style of dress and speech, he frequently held press conferences and reduced the pomp of the Oval Office. Early in his term, he introduced a series of ambitious programs for healthcare, education, administrative, and economic reform. However, most of these proposals faced opposition in Congress, despite the Democratic Party holding a majority in both the House and the Senate. At first glance, such resistance seems paradoxical, but it can be understood in the context of the time. Congress, after the Vietnam War and Nixon’s Watergate scandal, had become highly skeptical of presidents and often blocked their legislation. In the U.S., a president without Congress can achieve little. Carter grew frustrated and disappointed by the betrayal of his party colleagues, whom he publicly criticized. High hopes and unmet expectations due to unimplemented reforms had already lowered his approval ratings by 1978. In hindsight, it can be argued that Democratic congressmen shot themselves in the foot, as Republican Ronald Reagan came to power in 1981, followed later by George H. W. Bush. Carter’s reputation was further damaged by scandals involving members of his administration, such as accusations that his brother was a lobbyist for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi—allegations later proven false. Domestic Policy Carter inherited an economy plagued by inflation, stagnant economic growth, and rising unemployment: a state of stagflation. Inflation rose from 6% in 1976 to over 12% by 1980, unemployment remained high at 7.5%, and volatile interest rates reached a staggering 20% during 1980. The 1979 oil crisis, following the Iranian Revolution, further worsened the economic situation, leading to soaring energy prices and growing public dissatisfaction. Business leaders and the general public blamed Carter for the nation's economic woes. However, it was Congress, not the president, that bore the blame. Distrusting major oil corporations, Carter established the Department of Energy in 1977 and proposed a National Energy Plan that included a tax on oil, conservation measures, and the use of alternative energy sources. The Senate rejected the proposal. Carter also founded the Department of Education. Foreign Policy Human rights were at the heart of Jimmy Carter’s foreign policy. His administration openly criticized authoritarian regimes in Latin America, Africa, and Asia for human rights violations, even when these regimes were U.S. allies. While the human rights-first policy earned praise from international activists, it caused tensions with some traditional U.S. allies. In 1977, Carter signed treaties with Panama to transfer control of the Panama Canal to Panama by 1999 while guaranteeing the canal’s neutrality. One of Carter's most significant foreign policy achievements was the 1979 peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, known as the Camp David Accords. Carter personally mediated between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, organizing peace talks at the presidential retreat of Camp David. The agreements resulted in formal peace between the two countries and Israel’s withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On January 1, 1979, Carter established full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China while simultaneously severing official ties with Taiwan—a recognition of reality. For much of his presidency, Carter sought to improve relations with the Soviet Union. In Vienna, in June 1979, he and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II). However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 ended these efforts. In January 1980, Carter withdrew SALT II from Senate ratification. In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter introduced the Carter Doctrine in January 1980: imposing sanctions on the Soviet Union (a grain export ban), boycotting the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and increasing military and CIA spending (Operation Cyclone). One of the most challenging moments of Carter’s presidency was the Iran hostage crisis. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 American citizens hostage, later supported by the Iranian Shia authorities led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The crisis lasted 444 days, and Carter's inability to swiftly resolve the situation severely damaged his political reputation. A military operation to free the hostages, known as Operation Eagle Claw, ended in failure. Ultimately, the Iran hostage crisis marked the end of Carter’s administration. Electoral Defeat and Post-Presidency In 1980, Carter faced a challenge within his own Democratic Party when Senator Ted Kennedy attempted to contest his nomination for a second term. Although Carter secured the Democratic nomination, he faced an ambitious Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, in the presidential race. Carter lost decisively, with Reagan winning 489 electoral votes to Carter’s 49. However, Carter did not retire from politics in January 1981. On the contrary, he became more active as a global citizen. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center in Atlanta, focusing on humanitarian work, promoting peace, human rights, education, and combating disease. Carter became renowned for his mediation efforts in international crises, helping resolve conflicts in Kenya, Sierra Leone, the Holy Land, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 1990s, he played a role in reducing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. He also acted as a diplomat in resolving various conflicts in Panama, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, and Haiti. For his efforts, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Carter authored 32 books outlining his vision for a fairer world. Carter and Biden’s Friendship 'America and the world, in my opinion, have lost an extraordinary leader… He was a statesman and humanitarian. And Jill (Biden’s wife, editor's note) and I have lost a dear friend,' said Joe Biden hours after Carter’s death. Biden delivered a eulogy at Carter’s funeral on January 9, where their decades-long friendship was once again evident. Carter had previously requested that Biden deliver his eulogy. In his speech, Biden stated that his friendship with Carter taught him 'that strength of character transcends titles or power we possess. It’s the strength of understanding that everyone must be treated with dignity and respect. That everyone—and I mean absolutely everyone—deserves a fair shot. Not a guarantee, but a chance.' The friendship between the two politicians began when Biden, a young senator from Delaware, became the first senator to endorse Carter’s outsider candidacy for the White House in 1976. At the time, Biden was serving his first term in the Senate and had not yet become the powerful figure he would later become. Instead of aligning with influential Democratic colleagues in the Senate, he chose to support Carter and campaigned for him across the U.S. during the primaries. The two politicians shared many similarities. Both were moderate on fiscal and social issues and opponents of racial segregation. Both openly spoke about their faith—Biden as a Roman Catholic and Carter as an evangelical Baptist. Despite occasional disagreements, Biden supported Carter during the 1980 Democratic primaries against Senator Ted Kennedy. Carter supported Biden in his bids for the presidency in 1988 and 2008, albeit not very publicly. When Biden ran for president a third time in 2019, Carter remarked, 'I hope there’s an age limit. If I were 15 years younger, I don’t think I could handle the duties I had while I was president.' Nevertheless, he supported Biden at the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC). Both Carter and Biden endured four challenging years in the Oval Office before being forced to leave in ways they did not desire. Carter suffered a heavy defeat to Ronald Reagan, while Biden had to forego reelection due to poor health. Both lost to above-average Republican candidates—Reagan and Donald Trump. However, it is undeniable that Carter will have a better place in history as a president due to his 44 years of post-presidency, during which he enhanced his reputation. As a global citizen, Carter promoted peace and democracy worldwide through the Carter Center in over 100 elections across 40 countries. Biden will not have such a post-presidency due to his advanced age. Carter’s legacy is noble, though difficult to achieve in the harsh realities of 21st-century global politics.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geLsp7eEW8h66	2025-01-12T16:48:38-08:00	
Reality Of Kuala Lumpur-Singapore Interdependence – Analysis	The Annual Retreat between Singapore and Malaysia and the visit by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong marked the symbolization of strategic realization of mutual importance. For Lawrence, it is critical to establish a continuation of rapport and momentum with elevation of personal ties and trust and camaraderie at the highest level with his counterpart. It is vital for Singapore to also tap into Malaysia's model for ASEAN direction this year, especially where Singapore is also trying to establish its own pragmatic version of its foreign policy and in its quest to have its own friendshoring efforts and the tricky navigation in dealing with both China and the important ally of the US. This is also strategic for Lawrence to establish his own set of direction and leadership style as a message to both Malaysia and the region, and using this retreat as the platform in building future resilience and understanding of the direction and intent of the top Singaporean leadership. Singapore is also navigating a new set of geopolitical challenges, and thus trying to increase fallback on both the traditional reliance on the West and also at the same time increasing dependence on alternative powers including the entity of ASEAN.This is where the role of Malaysia in shaping ASEAN in getting the needed economic and political returns to Singapore is capitalised on. In Singapore's efforts to enhance its economic dependence and fallback reshoring options, Singapore does not want to be seen as too obvious in the approach to de risk from possible retaliations or new approaches by China, and by increasing dependence and mutual interdependence with Malaysia, it serves as the needed and closest source of economic and food and energy assurance. Although key sensitive and critical issues between both states still remain unresolved and are being handled with care, both realise that the need to transcend this systemic barrier is stronger and that this should not jeapordise the vast economic and geopolitical returns to both nations if strategic common areas of benefits are to be jointly developed. Common Threats and Interdependent Geopolitical Settings The visit and the Annual Retreat set the path to strengthen future ties and set the benchmark and platform in orienting new visions and pathways of partnerships, also as the symbol that the new leadership under Lawrence is different from the past legacy of his predecessor. In the efforts to present a new independent direction of Singapore, and increasing its resilience, and sees Malaysia as the most critical regional player and the inevitable geographical neighbour. Singapore's food security and supply chain interests at least in the next short term timeline will still be at the dependence of Malaysia, and a new set of ties with Malaysia that is escaping from past legacies and traps will be crucial. Thus, Malaysia is seen as vital to be leveraged in different policy modes, and this is also important to Lawrence in shaping domestic trust and support. Lawrence realises that the new perception, demands and trust among the domestic audience have changed with past controversies plaguing the governance and for him to set a new governance direction, Malaysia plays a central role in ensuring continuous prosperity and security wellbeing. Challenges remain, in the form of continuous security dilemma between both powers, and hard security wariness over bitter and contentious past disputes and issues However, new shared threats and challenges in the region from the continuing potential flare ups in South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and where both shared the same external security dilemma of maritime threats and big power rivalry, both will want to consolidate more effective deterrence measures and address common gaps. Existing defence mechanisms and ventures including the Five Powers Defence Arrangements (FPDA) are seen as inadequate in providing the tangible and realistic common defence assurances and framework in dealing with the fluidity of the nature of return of traditional threats settings. In the realm of non traditional threats and potential returns in areas of new geopolitical facets, Malaysia's advantage in new fields including rare earths, semiconductor, digital economy and security upperhand in geographical topography to work more closely together. Knowing that US has enjoyed trade surplus with Singapore and thus having a new hope of positive enhancement of ties under Trump 2.0, having closer ties with Malaysia is needed for better utilization of common frameworks with the US in targeting the same sectors of joint interests both in the high value chain development and the values based approach, and as an alternative and de-risking approach from China led initiatives. The United States has a trade surplus with Singapore, and in 2022, the U.S. had a trade surplus of USD $38.3 billion with Singapore. In 2023, the U.S.-Singapore services trade totaled over $49 billion. U.S. services exports to Singapore hit an all-time high of $37 billion in 2023. The U.S. has a large presence in Singapore, with American companies supporting around 215,000 American jobs. In 2022, U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Singapore was US$309.4 billion, which is more than in Mainland China, Japan, and South Korea combined. Although Singapore is well poised to be rest assured in economic and investment assurances from Washington, its strategic pragmatism and realisation of its own geographical limitations propelled it to venture into the need to secure its near border and neighbouring realities and scope of entanglement. ASEAN can be used as a softener to Singapore's approach in securing its interests, in which ASEAN is used as the more collective voice and platform in reflecting and voicing Singapore's concerns for regional security and also the actions by external powers including China. Hence for Singapore, the platform of Malaysia and ASEAN can be seen as necessary in serving as an added fallback option, where Singapore also does not want to be seen as being too aggressive in taking a direct strong response to China and others in expressing concerns on regional power postures. For Singapore, the Special Economic Zone will be beneficial in breaking away from its own geographical limitations and barriers, where the extended land and economic zones in Johor will enable Singaporean firms to use that as a new hub for its expansion into the region and the world. It serves as a needed hub for global expansion and as a consolidation of its status as the premier shipping hub and in securing its supply chain resilience. This is also vital for Singapore to increase its food, energy and supply chain security in getting the needed assurances for its long term security in areas of low politics, and this Special Zone is used as a trust building platform for better overall ties between both nations. As Singapore is reaching its economic maturity and saturation point, it is vital for it to continue to seek for the needed near shore capacity in diversifying its core areas and to provide for the continuous need to feed its increasing demands of its domestic audience, and in preparing for a greying nation and the new challenges of the inter-generational and demographic challenges. In accommodating the new political landscape and demand, Lawrence realizes that conventional economic and socio economic policies will need new revisions and tweaks, in both facing the renewed external headwinds and uncertainties and in facing the changing domestic demographic and political demands and expectations, away from the Lee era. This will be used as a platform to foster greater trust and confidence level and as a confidence building measure in using this as transcending the previous structural bilateral issues. By using low politics and increasing connectivity, people-to-people ties, the increased speed and ease of doing business, investments, and easier cross-border facilitations, both nations can use this means as the transcending factor in dealing with the current thorns and issues in bilateral relations. An Investment and Insurance for the Future Both Malaysia and Singapore remain each other's second-largest trading partners, with bilateral trade amounting toUSD78.59 billion (RM360.12 billion) from January to November 2024, a 6.7% increase over the same period in 2023. This year also marks 60 years of diplomatic ties. For Malaysia, this zone can be capitalised to tap into Singapore's entrenched status as the premier shipping hub and its status as the premier financial and services centre. Knowing that Malaysia cannot do this alone or package this investment hub using Malaysia's advantages and offerings alone, tagging Singapore as a complete package will offer more benefits and attractions to foreign investors by using Singapore's complementary offerings and branding in this regard. With more than 1000 similar economic and investment zones in ASEAN, this Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone will need to stand out in capturing the needed unique factor by factoring in the existing status of Singapore and also the vast new potential of Johor and Malaysia and the geographical card. This also includes the potential and new openings of the critical sectors and technologies where both nations are keen to develop in either joint capacities or within their own national strategic developments. These include areas of critical minerals, new energy transition, Artificial Intelligence, digital economy and green economy and services and new financial models. This special zone also serves as a needed alternative and fallback option for Malaysia as an exit gateway for the decentralization of its economic dependence on traditional external economic powers including China, and it serves as a message that this model of effective neighbouring economic partnership can be the salvation and as a parallel new investment and economic passageway without the baggage of external factors that might influence domestic and foreign policy considerations and political fallout. Malaysia also needs the critical and strategic high skilled labour, talents, knowledge creation, transfer of technologies and the needed capital in line with the economic transition and energy transition of the country and in parallel of the momentum over the years in positioning Malaysia as the growing regional and global hub for key sectors including on digital transformation, high technology hubs and forward advancement platforms for critical sectors on key minerals, semiconductors and others. By having this renewed initiative, it is hoped to create more spillover impact and getting the needed injection of external inflow of the needed capacities and also in getting the local settings in producing the needed skilled and high skilled talents and human capital, and in incentivising local SMEs as well as local workforce, and in raising income levels and in improving social mobility and holistic living status. This zone also must be streamlined and connected to the existing economic zones and parks and in line with the combined impact of the National Semiconductor Strategy and the New Industrial Masterplan. In the end, both nations realise the inevitable fact that both cannot run away from their geographical and neighbouring factual reality, and that both realise that if one is in trouble or faces renewed threat settings, it will in actual fact cause direct and indirect effects on the other, whether in economic or security threats. As such, as much as both will want to prioritise each national interests and advantages, both realise that one's future resilience, interests and security capacity and wellbeing also predominantly depend on the other, and naturally will not want the other to suffer instability, chaos or facing security threats that will have interlinked domino effects.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geCsAGWefyARB	2025-01-12T16:44:19-08:00	
Removing Zero From Iran’s National Currency: Economic Stability O...	Under the corrupt rule of the mullahs, Iran’s economy is facing deep, complex, and worsening challenges, including chronic inflation and the sharp devaluation of the rial to the rising growth of liquidity. These factors have severely weakened the national currency and reduced the purchasing power of the people. In such circumstances, the government’s proposal to remove zeros from the national currency, which is celebrated by the administration, raises this question: Can this policy be an effective solution to the economic crisis, or is it merely a superficial, hollow action and deceptive propaganda? The Importance of National Currency in the Economy In the complex world of modern economies, currency is recognized as a symbol of stability and trust in financial systems. When the value of a national currency declines due to overwhelming inflation and economic instability, governments seek solutions to restore confidence and stability to their monetary unit. The policy of removing zeros from the national currency is one such solution that has been employed by various countries throughout history. One of the main reasons for implementing the policy of removing zeros is to control inflation and restore monetary stability. High inflation often leads to an abnormal increase in monetary figures, making their management in transactions and accounting challenging. This situation not only reduces economic efficiency but also significantly increases the costs of printing and managing banknotes. Removing zeros in such circumstances simplifies and clarifies the monetary system, thereby improving financial efficiency. Enhancing public trust and creating a positive psychological impact are also among the motivations for implementing this policy. Reducing the number of zeros in the monetary unit can foster a sense of economic improvement among the public. This policy is often perceived as a symbolic act demonstrating the government’s commitment to economic reform. Another advantage of this policy is the enhancement of the international credibility of the national currency. In countries experiencing severe devaluation of their currency and extreme exchange rate volatility, removing zeros can improve the standing of the national currency in international trade and foreign investment. This action portrays a positive image of the economic system and facilitates commercial processes. In countries where continuous inflation has severely reduced the value of the national currency, the increase in the number of zeros on banknotes not only complicates daily transactions but also undermines public trust in the currency. In such situations, removing zeros can be an effective measure to restore stability and simplify the monetary system. The experiences of countries such as Turkey, Brazil, Russia, and Argentina show that the removal of zeros will only succeed if accompanied by structural reforms and sustainable economic policies. In cases where high inflation and currency volatility remain uncontrolled, this policy can quickly become ineffective and even create new problems. The State of Iran’s Economy and Its Challenges Ahead Morteza Afaghah, a monetary and banking expert, states about the removal of zeros from the national currency:'With such superficial and legal measures, inflation cannot be controlled. Iran’s inflation stems from economic, social, and cultural structures, and it is so deep that even economic measures, such as reducing liquidity levels in recent years, have not managed to control it.' On January 4, Kabna News website wrote: 'The most important precondition for the success of removing zeros is the stable control of the inflation rate. In circumstances where prices are constantly rising, the removal of zeros will only have a short-term effect.' What is certain is that Iran’s economy is facing high inflation rates, continuous liquidity growth, and a lack of economic stability. The excessive printing of unsupported banknotes is a betrayal of the national currency’s strength and a systematic theft of people’s assets by the regime. In such circumstances, the removal of zeros from the national currency might have a psychological and temporary soothing effect in the short term, supported by regime propaganda and deceptive policies, but it will not have real and lasting impacts. As mentioned, controlling inflation, reducing liquidity growth, and making fundamental budgetary changes are among the essential prerequisites for the success of this policy—conditions that seem unachievable in an occupied Iran under a repressive and warmongering government. Ironically, removing zeros from Iran’s national currency could lead to new problems for the Iranian people, further emptying their pockets for the regime’s looting purposes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geD2wDmXW19XJ	2025-01-12T16:41:24-08:00	
India, Positioned To Manage A Trump World – OpEd	2024 was billed as the year of elections, and voters in India — the world’s largest democracy — and the United States — the world’s richest — certainly made their feelings clear. Dissatisfaction over jobs and inequality weakened Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s electoral mandate, and disillusionment with inflation and the state of politics saw the United States turn back to Donald Trump. Indian officials are now getting their playbook ready to deal with Trump 2.0, drawing confidence from the two leaders’ round one bonhomie. The place to start will be to draw out the lessons from the electoral shock. Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were widely expected to romp to a commanding majority of 400 seats, granting him an even bigger mandate for his vision of India as a majoritarian Hindu state. Instead, the electorate bowled a googly and sent the BJP backwards. With the loss of 63 seats and his majority in the Lok Sabha parliament, Modi was forced into coalition government for the first time in his prime ministerial career. As Robin Jeffrey writes in this week’s lead article, the key reason for the surprise result was that India’s ‘enviable economy story … has not produced the millions of new jobs that young voters are desperately searching for’ — those offering ‘predictable wages in profitable activities’. While ‘service industries (especially IT), domestic construction, real estate and finance’ are flourishing, these sectors employ only a tiny fraction of India’s workers. Most of the population remains stuck in low-productivity agricultural work, if they have jobs at all. The government has signalled that it understands the frustration of disenchanted workers. Notably, it has introduced ‘employment-linked incentives’, targeted at new entrants into the workforce and the manufacturing sector, and created the ‘Prime Minister’s Internship Scheme’ for young people not in full-time study or employment. But ad-hoc schemes such as these will not address the deeper structural issues in the Indian economy. Those advocating for a focus on high-skilled services and technology to propel India’s growth overlook the fact that unemployment has become as much a social issue as an economic one. The imperative is for India to devise an economic strategy that makes use of its comparative advantage of a vast, young workforce. The government has ambitions to build a ‘self-reliant India’, but India’s economy is and will continue to be dependent on external trade, chiefly with China and the United States. As Jeffrey points out, ‘[m]ost Indian exports are US-bound’ and ‘[m]ost of its imports — manufactured goods, components, chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients — come from China’. The question now is what consequences Trump’s return will have for India’s strategic environment. Trump appears determined to continue his ‘America First’ policy, prioritising bilateral agreements over multilateral institutions and taking a deals-based approach to international relationships. For India, there is some appeal in Trump’s transactionalism. Both governments define China as their principal strategic threat and see a convergence of interests in countering Beijing’s rise. Under Trump and Biden, India’s role as a counterweight to China grew. The two countries deepened military ties by signing interoperability agreements such as the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement and the Security of Supply Arrangement. With the US likely to strengthen this security-led deals-based framework under Trump 2.0, India will become an even more important partner. As Pratnashree Basu wrote earlier in East Asia Forum, ‘India has become central to US defence and strategic thinking in the Indo-Pacific’ due to its ‘geographic position in the Indian Ocean and growing military and economic capabilities’. And there’s a political element, too. Jeffrey notes that the BJP ‘accused the Biden administration of carrying out 'a deep state agenda' to undermine India’s success story’. Such accusations are less likely under a Trump administration that many expect will go easier on democratic backsliding than a Harris administration might have done. Yet navigating the relationship will not be plain sailing. Any benefits that Trump might provide for Indian domestic politics and security ties is likely to be undermined by the threat he poses to the international economic environment. India’s population is large but not wealthy, meaning that capital investments and demand for its products and services must come at least in part from foreign markets. Maintaining a stable rules-based trading system is still a core interest for India so that it can accelerate its growth trajectory by playing a bigger role in global value and production chains. Trump has already promised 60 per cent tariffs on China and 10 per cent on imports from the rest of the world. His policies threaten to destabilise the international trading regime and depress global incomes — the last thing India needs at this stage of its economic development. What’s more, with the US running a sizable trade deficit against India and Trump having labelled the country as a ‘very big abuser’ of tariffs, India may well find itself in the firing line. The temptation will be to seek a bilateral deal. Jeffrey contends that the ‘Modi government hopes Trump will make problems go away by granting waivers where needed’. This is a temptation that it would be wise to resist. Trump is likely to demand India to commit to a stronger Western-aligned security posture, which risks overextension of India’s capacity and would undermine its prized foreign policy philosophy of strategic autonomy and non-alignment. The fact that US-India strategic convergence is founded on mutual concerns about China is also a risk. In his first term, Trump sought a managed trade deal with China. Though it failed to deliver on his aims, he may again seek a bilateral ‘G2’ style agreement. Washington and Beijing finding a way to manage their conflict would diminish the need for New Delhi as a counterweight, undermining the main ballast of US-India alignment. Countries in Asia have shown that middle powers can come together to advance their interests independently of the United States, most notably through their initiatives in negotiating RCEP (despite India’s in the end walking away from the agreement) and finalising the CPTPP after Trump pulled out of the TPP in 2017. A framework now exists in East Asia to coordinate on Trump through RCEP, the world’s largest free-trade agreement — which membership of and participation in remains open to India. RCEP is an avenue for India to engage in the defence of the rules-based trading order, consistent with the pursuit of its urgent economic agenda. In an increasingly economically fragmented world, swing powers like India have the sway to play a more influential role. It may not have the clout to determine global issues by itself, but no global issue can be easily solved without India’s heft. With the advent of a second Trump presidency, India is well positioned to use its growing leverage to defend the global order that made the Asia–Pacific a stable and prosperous region and realise its ambition for a genuinely multipolar order.

The Politics Of The Fourteenth Amendment – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya In the run-up to the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as 47th president of the United States, political activists, frustrated by the fact that Kamala Harris lost the election, have attempted to revive the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment precludes Trump from taking office. They rely on a decision of the Colorado Supreme Court concerning the events of January 6, 2021, where the court stated that, 'the [Colorado District] court found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in Section Three [of the Fourteenth Amendment].' The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that: The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting portions of Congress’s January 6 Report into evidence at trial. The district court did not err in concluding that the events at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, constituted an 'insurrection.' The district court did not err in concluding that President Trump 'engaged in' that insurrection through his personal actions. President Trump’s speech inciting the crowd that breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was not protected by the First Amendment. Despite the Colorado decision having been subsequently reversed by a unanimous United States Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson, 601 U.S. 100 (2024), the lawfare activists still feel they have an arrow left in their Fourteenth Amendment quiver. They depict Trump’s Supreme Court victory as largely dicta with no legal force. They clutch at the straws thrown by the Court’s liberal members, who suggested that the majority had gone too far in expressing a view on the role of Congress in upholding the Fourteenth Amendment (that is, activists argue that the Supreme Court dicta on this point should not be read as part of its binding decision). In this vein, the New York Times reported that, 'The court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — expressed frustration at what they said was the majority’s needless overreach in a joint concurring opinion.' The liberal members said that the majority had needlessly chosen to 'decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy,' and that, 'In a case involving no federal action whatsoever, the Court opines on how federal enforcement of Section 3 must proceed.' The liberal judges went on to add that: Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oath breaking insurrectionist from becoming President. Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision. Because we would decide only the issue before us, we concur only in the judgment. Trump’s political opponents derive some comfort, however tenuous, from those barbed words. Paradoxically, the liberal members of the Supreme Court, who usually favor an activist judicial role, in this case called for judicial restraint—an approach that potentially creates scope for further scheming by Trump’s political enemies seeking to relitigate the events of January 6 as many times as possible. In a further paradox, the longer-term constitutional implications of the majority opinion were overshadowed by widespread relief that the Supreme Court had averted an election crisis, and that the liberal justices had somehow managed to refrain from dissenting even though they disagreed with the majority on key issues. Justice Barrett said: The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up. For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home. The longer-term implications for the balance of power between federal and state authority merit closer consideration, as the majority emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment vests power in the federal court rather than in the state courts. As Ilya Somin observes, The per curiam opinion emphasizes the need for uniformity in determining eligibility for federal office and argues that states lack the power to make such determinations… This argument ignores the long-standing role of states in enforcing and adjudicating other constitutional qualifications for candidates for federal office. This constraint on state power may have had the advantage of avoiding inconsistent state decisions about Trump being excluded from the ballot, but, as Somin points out, 'Concerns about a potential 'patchwork' of conflicting state rulings are ultimately policy objections to the Constitution’s decentralized state-by-state scheme of election administration.' This undermines the constitutional tradition of decentralized government power. As Donald Livingston has argued, decentralized government was the original vision of America: America began as a highly decentralized regime of independent moral and political communities jealous of their liberty. These political societies created a central government as their agent and endowed it with enumerated powers. This government was only a speck on the political landscape and its presence was scarcely felt in everyday life. From 1865 to 1965 it underwent a transformation, emerging as the most consolidated and centralized military and financial power in history. From its inception, the Fourteenth Amendment was instrumental in that consolidation of centralized power, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson further entrenches that trend. Roots of the Fourteenth Amendment The NYT commentary on Trump v. Anderson noted the context in which the Fourteenth Amendment arose: 'to deal with the problem of former Confederates holding positions of government power.' However, there is much more to the political origins of this amendment. While its legislative history cannot be covered in this brief article, a key point to note is that the amendment was not simply about keeping Confederates out of office—the more ambitious goal was to consolidate power in the federal government. According to William A. Dunning in his book Reconstruction, Political and Economic 1865-1877, the Fourteenth Amendment was seen by Radical Republicans as a prerequisite to reconfiguring the balance of power between state and federal governments. One of the challenges the radicals faced, as Dunning explains, was President Johnson’s respect for the 'old-time Constitution.' Johnson did not think Congress had power 'to exclude states from representation' as the radicals proposed in an attempt to force the Southern states to accept the diminished scope of state power. Radicals feared that any legislative reform would be bypassed by Southern legislators or vetoed by President Johnson, who indeed vetoed the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. President Johnson objected to these radical bills on grounds that they amounted to unconstitutional federal encroachment on states’ jurisdiction. As explained by Dunning, Johnson’s view was: ...that the [Civil Rights] bill embodied an unheard-of intrusion of the Federal government within the sphere of the states, and was a stride towards centralization. He stood stiffly on his belief that the situation in the South involved no conditions which required for their treatment a break with the ancient political system. Constitutional amendments served as a vehicle through which, as Dunning puts it, 'the majority in Congress proposed to appeal to the people against the policy of the president.' This concern with the constitutional balance of power is also reflected in various Supreme Court decisions cited in Trump v. Anderson: Proposed by Congress in 1866 and ratified by the States in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment 'expand[ed] federal power at the expense of state autonomy' and thus 'fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.' Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996). Similarly, Forrest McDonald observes that, Whatever else the Radicals had in mind in pushing through the Reconstruction Amendments—their motives were diverse and conflicting—it is clear that some of them, at least, intended that the Fourteenth should greatly increase the powers of Congress at the expense of the states. As Dunning explains, the plan behind the Fourteenth Amendment was, …in essence, to deny the privileges of statehood to the southern communities until the guarantee of certain results of the war, as the North conceived them, should be incorporated in the Constitution, and should be formally consented to by the southerners themselves. Dunning argues that in pursuit of this goal, the Reconstruction Committee paid scant regard to the constitutional debates and instead emphasized the need to quell the rebellious spirit of the South. The Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson mentions an example of this, the 'statement of Rep. Stevens, warning that without appropriate constitutional reforms ‘yelling secessionists and hissing copperheads’ would take seats in the House.' By spinning the case for constitutional revolution in that way, it was hoped to secure popular support for excluding both the President and the Southern states in pushing through plans for the expansion of federal authority. Dunning explains: The majority report evaded any thoroughgoing discussion of the constitutional questions of state status, in which the strength of the president’s case lay, but put the chief stress on the right of Congress to say the final word as to the restoration of the insurgent communities, and on the evidence that the white people of the South were still rebellious and impenitent in spirit, bent on oppressing the freedmen and white Unionists, and eager for representation in Congress only in the hope of regaining thus the power and influence which they had lost by the resort to arms. Although the radicals depicted their reconstruction proposals as a corollary of their victory in the war, President Johnson correctly understood that these proposals amounted to nothing short of a constitutional revolution. Allen Mendenhall observes in his analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment that, Few issues divide libertarians the way the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does…. On the one side are those who praise the amendment for circumventing the power of the states to prejudice, police, regulate, or otherwise use force to impose discriminatory laws on their citizens. On the other side are those who, while acknowledging the problematic nature of state misconduct and wrongdoing, are not willing to condone the transfer of power from states to the federal government, and in particular to the federal judiciary. This controversy illustrates the extent to which political activists drive a coach and horses through the Constitution if it stands in the way of their goals—precisely as President Johnson, in his failed attempt to defend the 'old-time Constitution,' had feared, and precisely as attempted by the Democrats in their recent attacks on Donald Trump.

Zelenskyy Says Ready To Swap Captured North Korean Soldiers For U...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is prepared to hand over captured North Korean soldiers to Pyongyang if reclusive leader Kim Jong Un can arrange a prisoner swap for Ukrainians held in Russia. 'Ukraine is ready to hand over his people to Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for our soldiers who are in captivity in Russia,' Zelenskiy wrote on social media on January 12. He also offered 'some other paths' for any North Korean soldiers who did not want to return to their authoritarian home country. 'In particular, those Koreans who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war [back] in Korea will have such an opportunity,' he added. The Ukrainian president’s comments came as South Korea said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, confirming remarks made a day earlier by Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials. 'Through real-time cooperation with Ukraine's intelligence agency...[South Korea's National Intelligence Service] has confirmed that the Ukrainian military captured two North Korean soldiers on January 9 in the Kursk battlefield in Russia,' Seoul said in a statement. Neither North Korea nor Moscow has commented on the reports. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence on January 11 released a video showing two men in hospital bunks, one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. Ukrainian officials said the prisoners were talking through interpreters working with South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS). The SBU said one prisoner, who said he was born in 2005, claimed he believed he was 'going for training, not to fight a war against Ukraine.' The other man was forced to write his answers because of an injured jaw, the SBU said. That soldier said he was born in 1999 and was a sniper in the North Korean Army. In separate televised comments, Zelenskiy said one to the two captured soldiers had 'expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine, the other to return to Korea.' The NIS also said one of the captured soldiers had claimed he received training from the Russian military after he arrived in the country in November. 'He initially believed he was being sent for training, realizing upon arrival in Russia that he had been deployed,' South Korea’s intelligence agency said. It added that one of the prisoners 'went without food or water for four to five days before being captured' by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has launched new attacks in Kursk to prevent Russia from snatching back territory. A lightning Ukrainian offensive first captured large swaths of the Kursk region in August 2024. It was the largest incursion onto Russian soil since World War II. Last fall, North Korea sent some 11,000 troops to the Kursk region to support Russian forces. Moscow has reclaimed some 40 percent of the territory, but Ukrainian troops still control more than 500 square kilometers in Kursk, and Pyongyang's troops have reportedly been experiencing mass casualties. Zelenskiy on December 23 said more than 3,000 troops, or about a quarter of the North Korean special forces sent to Russia, had been killed or injured, though he did not provide evidence. White House spokesman John Kirby on December 27 told reporters that North Korean forces were suffering heavy casualties on the front lines, adding that some 1,000 of their troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region over a one-week period. 'It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,' Kirby said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geMjel6Krgg44	2025-01-12T16:30:59-08:00	
Malala Yousafzai Asks Muslim Leaders To Reject Taliban’s Treatmen...	By Ayaz Gul Nobel Peace Prize laurate Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders Sunday not to 'legitimize' Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban, accusing them of being the 'perpetrators of gender apartheid' and calling for accountability. Yousafzai spoke at the closing session of a Pakistan-hosted international summit on girls’ education in Muslim communities around the world, sharply criticizing the hardline Taliban government for imposing sweeping curbs on Afghan women’s access to education and employment. 'For the past three-and-a-half years, the Taliban have ripped away the right to learn from every Afghan girl. They have weaponized our faith to justify it,' the education activist stated. 'The Taliban are explicit about their mission. They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society,' she said. 'Simply put, the Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justification.' The Taliban swept back to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, imposing their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' Afghan girls are entirely banned from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Women are prohibited from public and private workplaces except for a few departments, such as health, immigration, and police. The Muslim World League, or MWL, co-hosted the two-day conference in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, bringing together ministers, education officials, and scholars from nearly 50 Muslim-majority countries and representatives from the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. 'I have a message for everyone in this room,' Yousafzai said. 'As Muslim leaders, now is the time to raise your voice and use your power. You can show true leadership; you can show true Islam,' she told the gathering. 'Afghan women and girls must be free to shape their own future. The very loudest champions of their cause must be fellow Muslims, leaders such as yourselves,' she added. Yousafzai sought a united voice from Muslim scholars to openly challenge and denounce the Taliban’s 'oppressive laws.' Taliban officials did not immediately comment on the criticism. They vehemently defend their governance, saying it is aligned with Sharia and culture in Afghanistan. A conference declaration issued Sunday condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The declaration noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s (Islamic world’s) concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it. 'It is essential to disavow their ideology, whether they are an individual, an institution, or an entity—public or private,' the statement said. The multi-page declaration did not mention Afghanistan, the only country where girls are banned from seeking secondary school education and beyond. Pakistani officials said that the Taliban government in Kabul had been formally invited to attend the global summit, but Islamabad did not receive a response. Speaking at the opening session on Saturday, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the MWL secretary-general, stressed that men and women must acquire education as mandated by Islam. 'The Islamic world is united in its belief that those who oppose women’s education are misguided and do not represent true Islam,' Al-Issa responded when asked if the outcome of the summit could encourage the Taliban to relax restrictions on Afghan women and girls. Nonetheless, the Saudi scholar clarified that the gathering in Islamabad was not directed at any specific community or country. 'We have simply tried to address the concerns of those who oppose women’s education and conveyed our message that there are no restrictions in Islam regarding education for girls,' Al-Issa stated, without naming the Taliban. Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, attended the summit, telling a panel that leaders of Islamic countries need to support Afghan girls. 'I really call on all these ministers ... who came from all over the world, to offer scholarships, to have online education, to have all sorts of education for them. This is the task of the day,' she said. No country has recognized the Taliban government primarily over its curbs on Afghan women and girls. While the United States and the West at large have refused to engage with the de facto Afghan leaders diplomatically and relocated their embassies from the country, neighboring and regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, have retained their diplomatic missions in Kabul and maintain close contacts with the Taliban.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geDFdhqVCIq6J	2025-01-12T16:23:59-08:00	
Ukrainian Special Forces Capture Two North Korean Soldiers In Kur...	(EurActiv) -- Ukraine has captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday (11 January), the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the war last autumn. North Korean regular troops entered the war on Russia's side in October, according to Kyiv and its western allies, who initially estimated their numbers at 10,000 or more. In a post on X, Zelenskyy said that the soldiers had been brought to Kyiv and were communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country's domestic intelligence agency. 'As with all prisoners of war, these two North Korean soldiers are receiving the necessary medical assistance,' Zelenskiy said. He said that journalists would be given access to speak to them. Kyiv says that North Korean troops are fighting in the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August. Kyiv says it still controls several hundred square kilometres of territory there. Pyongyang has also been supplying Russia with vast quantities of artillery shells, according to Kyiv and its western allies. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Korean troops in Kursk, and there was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Pyongyang to the latest report. Ukraine had previously said it captured North Korean soldiers in combat, but that they had been badly wounded and died shortly afterwards. Special forces operation Zelenskyy said in a later video address that the troops had been captured by Ukraine's special forces working alongside paratroopers. The special forces posted a video filmed from a drone claiming to show part of the operation. It showed five men in ghillie suits in a forested area, although other details were hard to make out. A video posted by the SBU appeared to show the two captured men. One had his jaw bandaged due to an apparent wound, while the other was drinking through a straw. A doctor interviewed for the SBU’s video, who was not named and had his face blurred, said one of the soldiers had a facial wound and would be treated by a dentist, while the other soldier had an open wound and a lower leg fracture. The SBU said the North Koreans had been transferred to Kyiv for questioning, and that because they could not speak Ukrainian, Russian or English, their questioning was being done in Korean with the help of South Korea's NIS intelligence agency. The SBU said one of the soldiers had been captured with a Russian military document with the name of another person registered in Russia, while the other did not have any documents. The agency said the soldiers had been born in 2005 and 1999, and had been serving in the North Korean armed forces since 2021 and 2016 respectively. The SBU said the two prisoners were being held in conditions that were in accordance with international law, and that a criminal investigation was being conducted to see if the men broke Ukraine's law against planning or conducting a war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geMAZVkIU6lMJ	2025-01-12T16:22:21-08:00	
Bangladesh: Despite Yunus Govt Promises On Press Freedom, Journal...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury Five months after the repressive Awami League government fell, with an interim administration preaching freedom of the press, some Bangladeshi media are producing critical coverage but others are censoring themselves, saying there is 'an atmosphere of fear.' Media leaders and observers said those committing self-censorship are afraid of reprisals, including facing false murder complaints, losing their jobs, being defamed on social media or being accused as supporters of the old government. Z.E. Mamun, a former chief executive of private TV station ATN Bangla, said some media outlets came under attack on Aug. 3, 2024, two days before the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina collapsed amid massive student-led protests. 'False murder cases were filed against a huge number of journalists after the downfall of the government,' Mamun told BenarNews, adding, 'they have been tagged as collaborators of Sheikh Hasina.' Mamun said he was named in a case linked to a killing in Dhaka on Aug. 5, the day Hasina left Bangladesh and fled to India. The complaint filed by citizens was lodged at the International Crimes Tribunal, which was established by Hasina’s Awami League to try people accused of war crimes during Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Mamun said fears arise from the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus 'parroting' statements of the Students’ Movement against Discrimination – the group that spearheaded pro-democracy protests that led to Hasina’s downfall. Shafiqul Alam, the press secretary for the interim government, rejected allegations by Mamun and others. Along with being named in a murder complaint filed in August, Mamun lost his job two months later. He said he understood why many of those in the same boat as him had gone quiet – at least 140 journalists identified as being supporters of Hasina’s Awami League government, face murder complaints filed by citizens, according to official figures. 'They cannot discharge their professional responsibilities. They have been practicing self-censorship,' he said. 'If they had been collaborators, the government should investigate and find out what crimes they have committed. If proved beyond doubt, the authorities can take legal action against them,' Mamun said. Instead, the interim government has cancelled journalists’ accreditations, sought information about their finances and frozen bank accounts, he alleged. The Press Information Department cancelled accreditation cards, which facilitate access to the government offices, of 169 journalists since the fall of Hasina’s government. A ‘prevailing’ fear Sohel Haider Chowdhury, president of the Dhaka Union of Journalists, said almost all media outlets had terminated or sidelined journalists who were branded as 'enablers of fascist Hasina,' while another group of journalists opposing the Awami League took over the key posts. 'The consequences are – one group is silent while another group is spreading negative activities of the previous government and hailing the interim government and the students by hiding the critical stories,' said Chowdhury, who like Mamun, faces murder complaints. 'I would say there is no direct intervention from the government, but an atmosphere of fear has been created. The journalists have been working in constant fear,' Chowdhury told BenarNews, adding that his and other journalism trade offices had been locked by the government. 'We cannot work,' he said. Chowdhury said he has been named in four murder complaints filed by survivors of protesters who were killed in anti-Hasina protests in July and early August. While he said he had no details about the complaints, they all named Hasina as the top suspect. Nazrul Islam Mithu, president of Overseas Correspondents Association Bangladesh, said there was no atmosphere for good journalism during Hasina’s regime, and this has carried over under the interim government. 'The government urges journalists to criticize them. But they are not ensuring conditions conducive to healthy journalism. An atmosphere of fear is prevailing,' Mithu told BenarNews. 'Anyone criticizing the government faces physical assault and harassment in public places, their houses are attacked. But no action from the government to prevent such recurrence is visible,' he said. Government response Press secretary Alam pushed back against such assertions and said journalists were enjoying new freedoms under the Yunus administration. 'The interim government has not slapped any repressive laws or passed any administrative orders to muzzle the press as practiced by Hasina government. No legal actions were taken against the journalists,' he told BenarNews. 'The DGFI, the prime minister’s press wing of the information ministry, has not issued any order to dictate the media,' Alam said, adding no journalists have lost jobs because of directives from the government. DFGI is the military’s intelligence wing. 'Rather we have decided to scrap the repressive Cyber Security Act and the government has decided to withdraw all cases relating to freedom of the press and the freedom of expression filed under it,' he said. Regarding the murder cases, Alam said, 'Can you find a single instance where the government filed a case against the journalists? The cases were filed by aggrieved individuals who seek justice for the murder of their children during the July and August protests.' 'If an individual files a case, the government cannot stop it,' he said. Alam noted that Yunus had invited journalists to criticize his government. 'What else can we at the government do if the journalists practice self-censorship?' he said. M. Abdullah, a former president of the pro-Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami faction of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, offered support for the interim government’s efforts. BNP and Jamaat were the major opposition parties under Awami League-rule. 'I do not think the journalists have been facing problems for doing journalism. No government agency has been issuing any directives to the media outlets,' he told BenarNews. He said those journalists who are censoring themselves are doing so because of their 'previous controversial roles and personal weaknesses.' 'For instance, the financial statements of some of the journalists show they transacted crores (millions) of Taka, which is unusual,' he said. Robaet Ferdous, a journalism professor at Dhaka University, said the owners of media outlets and the journalists had colluded with the government led by Hasina – but much remained the same. 'People thought the situation would change after Aug. 5. But the situation has not changed. Now, the students have replaced the government agencies deciding who would go to TV talk shows or not,' he told BenarNews, adding 'political parties aspiring to get power have already started placing their favored journalists in key positions in media.' 'Theoretically, an atmosphere of free journalism exists, but not in practice,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geLzpO9v2uIrM	2025-01-12T16:16:58-08:00	
Switzerland Ready To Serve As Host For Putin-Trump Meeting On Ukr...	Switzerland is ready to serve as a host to a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President-elect Donald Trump on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, if such request emerges, Swiss daily Le Temps reported on Sunday. 'Following the Burgenstock summit, Ukraine, Russia and the United States were regularly informed of our readiness to support any diplomatic efforts regarding the peace settlement,' the Swiss daily stated citing Nicolas Bideau, a spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, as saying, TASS reported. The daily added that the Swiss authorities would not be taking the initiative regarding this issue. According to Le Temps, the confederation is just one the countries on the list that are ready to host the meeting of the Russian and US leaders. On January 10, US President-elect Donald Trump announced that preparations for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin were underway. According to Trump, it was necessary to put an end to the Ukrainian conflict. Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said later that the Russian president was ready to meet with Trump without any preconditions. The Kiev-initiated forum on Ukraine was held in Burgenstock, Switzerland on June 15-16, 2024, Armenia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, the Holy See, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mexico, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates did not sign the summit communique. Russia was not invited. Most UN delegates did not attend either. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the conference as a total failure as she argued that 'get-togethers' like this do nothing to bring a lasting peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geBf-aUZ48IFw	2025-01-12T16:12:49-08:00	
President Biden Awards Pope Francis Presidential Medal Of Freedom...	By Tina Dennelly U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Pope Francis on Saturday and named him a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the White House said in a statement. As the nation’s highest honor, the medal is 'presented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public, or private endeavors,' the statement said. This is the first time Biden has awarded the medal 'with distinction,' according to the statement. 'The first pope from the Southern Hemisphere, Pope Francis is unlike any who came before,' the statement continued. 'Above all, he is the People’s Pope — a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.' 'For decades, [Jorge Bergoglio] served the voiceless and vulnerable across Argentina,' the White House statement said. 'As Pope Francis, his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths.' Earlier this week, Biden canceled his planned trip to Rome and a visit with Pope Francis in order to address the ongoing deadly wildfires in California. Biden was set to travel to Rome from Jan. 9–12 at Pope Francis’ invitation. His audience with the Holy Father was set for Jan. 10. The president’s meeting with the pope was set to focus on efforts to advance peace around the world. Biden was also scheduled to meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Biden last met with Pope Francis in June of last year where the two discussed foreign policy in Israel, Gaza, and the Ukraine as well as climate change. During a private audience at the G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy, the two leaders 'emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and a hostage deal' in Gaza and the need to 'address the critical humanitarian crisis,' according to the White House. CNA senior editor Daniel Payne contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geNIcX2pXeT8Q	2025-01-12T16:09:56-08:00	
Switzerland’s Most Renowned Trans Person No Longer Wants To Be A ...	When Chris Brönimann became Nadia just before the turn of the millennium, the whole of Switzerland watched in fascination. Now, the country’s most famous transgender figure is publicly grappling with regret over that choice. This is not a story of redemption, but a post-woke plea. By Marc Leutenegger The text message confirming our meeting is signed Chris/Nadia. It’s a late summer’s day, the air is crisp and clean over Lake Zurich in the small town of Lachen. The café on the promenade where Chris/Nadia Brönimann works part-time is quiet, just like the life of the one-time most famous transgender woman in Switzerland. It’s quiet, at least for now. It has been only a few days since Brönimann renounced her transition, a decision that was splashed across Swiss media and flooded Instagram with messages of both hate and support. In Switzerland, transsexuality is as polarising as it is in other Western societies. It is often referred to as 'gender dysphoria', when a person does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. The number of young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria has risen drastically, with Canada, the United States and many countries in Europe recording a tenfold increase since the turn of the millennium. It is mostly women who feel they were born in the wrong body. While societies have become more tolerant, hormone therapies and gender-affirming surgeries remain controversial. Traditionally progressive countries such as Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom have banned the prescription of puberty blockers to minors or limited their use to medical research. Many key questions surrounding sexual transition remain unanswered. A fierce debate over who holds the authority on the subject and how to interpret it has unfolded, even among medical professionals. At the same time, the transgender issue is being politicised, as was seen in the recent US presidential elections. Gender tags During our chat at the café, the political dimension does not seem an issue, at least not initially. The conversation focusses on the personal situation and the reasons behind Brönimann’s latest coming-out, a move that has once again touched a taboo topic and put her in the spotlight. Over the past three years, Brönimann has increasingly distanced herself from Nadia. Maintaining her image had become almost a chore or a daily performance. 'The pressure on transgender people to fully take over the role of a man or a woman is huge,' says Brönimann. 'You are constantly asking yourself: Am I good enough? Am I female enough?' Here lie constraints, shame and a self-image that is solely dominated by gender. Brönimann wanted to break free from all of this. 'This is exactly what many people didn’t understand. My latest coming-out is not just a return to ‘Christian’. It is impossible to fully go back, neither physically nor as a person. Both Christian and Nadia are a part of me. Since my latest coming-out, I have been able to rediscover my identity.' Of course, Brönimann adds, there are also uncertainties and fears and the question: 'Have I turned into a freak?' Brönimann has been bombarded with emails and messages asking questions like: 'Are you non-binary now?' Such questions, Brönimann says, are exactly the problem today. 'We open up all opportunities, but we also tend to compartmentalise. For now, I don’t want a tag. I want to explore where my individual soul lies, my inner home, beyond being a man, a woman or a non-binary person.' This statement bears a hint of criticism of gender identity politics. But there’s more to it. Woke and anti-woke A few weeks after our interview at Lake Zurich, Brönimann appeared before the human rights committee of the Geneva cantonal parliament, which is looking into the issue of gender transition. In Lausanne, she spoke to the media alongside a man opposed to his underage daughter undergoing a gender transition. For a few years now, Brönimann has taken a conservative stance on gender transition for young people. The former icon of the Swiss trans scene rejects surgical interventions for anyone younger than 18 and opposes puberty blockers and hormone therapies. Before the media stint in Lausanne, Brönimann had already expressed doubts in an interview with the German-speaking Sonntagsblick newspaper, criticising Switzerland’s liberal practice. She argued this approach to gender relied too heavily on the self-diagnosis of young people and enabled premature medical treatment – a phenomenon exacerbated by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. 'Gender transitions are turning into a woke lifestyle,' says Brönimann. Although controversial, the theory that gender transitions are socially contagious still prevails in conservative circles, which has led to the coining of the phrase 'rapid onset gender dysphoria' (ROGD). It suggests that vulnerable teenagers believe they were born in the wrong body because they are repeatedly exposed to this idea on social media. A few days after the interview, the Sonntagsblick published an article featuring a doctor associated with the Transgender Network Switzerland (TGNS) who rejected Brönimann’s criticism. He emphasised that transgender cases in Switzerland were thoroughly assessed. The doctor’s statement reflects the official stance of the TGNS, a national advocacy group for transgender people in Switzerland. 'The reasons behind the rising numbers of gender transitions or therapeutic measures often lack an in-depth analysis, or they are simplified in favour of populist buzzwords such as ‘woke-mania’,' the TGNS states in a press release. The fact that more transgender people today are receiving 'adequate treatment at an earlier stage', according to the TGNS, is due to improved access to care and greater awareness among medical staff. The press release also takes quotes from a study published in the American Journal of Surgery in August 2024, which found that the regret rate was below 1%. However, this figure, which has been used in earlier studies, is controversial. Knowledge gap The TGNS failed to respond to a list of questions surrounding Brönimann’s latest coming-out, stating they could not handle the 'high volume of media inquiries'. Switzerland’s most famous transgender person and the Transgender Network do not see eye-to-eye. However, Brönimann is not alone in criticising the trans-affirmative treatment practices that prioritise the wishes of patients. Medical professionals have also raised concerns about current approaches. In mid-2024, the Swiss Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry called for a revision of the new treatment guidelines for children and adolescents who suffer from gender dysphoria. In making this appeal, the Swiss society follows the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which has criticised the scientific evidence of the so-called Dutch Protocols, a key reference for affirmative treatment practices, as too weak. It also pointed out that puberty blockers and hormone treatment may cause health complications. Claims about the benefits or risks of gender transitions often lack sufficient scientific evidence. This research gap became evident three years ago when the UK Department of Health commissioned the Nice Report, which aimed to assess the clinical benefits of puberty blockers using data from existing studies. Of 525 papers, only nine met the criteria for the evaluation. Critics often use cases such as Brönimann’s to point out the risks associated with trans-affirmative treatment. However, this perspective often lacks nuance. The American short film Detrans features young adults describing how they were misguided and found liberation through detransitioning but does not offer opposing viewpoints. The film was a Christian-conservative production. Brönimann does not entirely agree with this. 'Of course, I am not categorically against all gender transitions. On the contrary, I am happy for every single trans person who has successfully undergone a sex change and found happiness. I just want each case to be thoroughly assessed by a differential diagnosis that explores other potential causes of psychological distress. I want the greatest possible precaution when it comes to irreversible procedures and an open society where trans people have their secure and equal place, but one that also allows for critical discussions.' Chaos or rainbow When Christian became Nadia just before the turn of the millennium, Brönimann was in their late twenties. Swiss television captured the journey in a detailed documentary. For eight years, filmmaker Alain Godet followed Brönimann, creating a film that portrayed a transformation, but not a liberation. At the end of the film, Godet asks Nadia: 'If you look back now, would you do it again?' Brönimann reflects and responds: 'Just imagine the chaos that would erupt if I said ‘No’. Then I would be really stuck.' The person having a chat in a café by Lake Zurich gives a different, more composed impression. During the research for this story, many emails were exchanged that Brönimann usually signed with a rainbow and the phrase: 'Colourful regards to you, Chris/Nadia.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geFZOs_3uJ9_Q	2025-01-12T16:07:50-08:00	
Dr. Martin Luther King’s Prophetic Warning, Denouncing The Mercha...	Over the past three years, a collective of volunteer researchers, lawyers, and commentators created The Merchants of Death War Crimes Tribunal, dedicated to holding accountable four weapon manufacturing corporations based in the U.S. Their tribunal amassed copious evidence to prove that Boeing, Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly Raytheon) and General Atomics (a company which manufactures weaponized drones) are guilty of committing war crimes. On January 15, 2025, as the world marks the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, a press conference will announce the Tribunal's verdicts and release the report of ten international jurors who have weighed the evidence submitted to them. Of necessity, the evidence was culled from examining a limited range of devastatingly criminal U.S. 'forever wars,' of brutal and needless wars of choice. The Tribunal focused on specific U.S. war crimes and crimes against humanity in the invasions, occupations and aerial assaults which followed the '9/11' attacks in 2001. What if we could enlarge the Tribunal, bringing before it war crimes occurring right now, the U.S.-assisted massacres we watch in real time on our phone and computer screens? Certainly, one witness we would beg to appear for testimony would be Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who was the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital when such a place existed. The Tribunal would wish to amplify his testimony on the harrowing weeks of siege during which Israel subjected his hospital to artillery and aerial bombardment. They would help to record his story of witnessing assassinations targeting medical staff, field executions of people clutching white flags in an attempt to surrender, the hospital's forced evacuation with at-gunpoint humiliation stripping of women and girls. The initial attacks disabled the hospital's operational capacities by targeting power generators and oxygen production equipment, but now an iconic photo shows Dr. Abu Safiya walking towards an Israeli tank through collapsed buildings and rubble. The Tribunal would like to interview him, but he is being held without charge by Israel's military. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, walking through the rubble in his white coat before being kidnapped by Israeli forces. Photo via Kathy Kelly Our tribunal would surely turn to three of the world's most crucial international human rights groups for testimony. On December 5, 2024, Amnesty International concluded that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Its research documents how, during its military offensive launched in the wake of the deadly Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, 'Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians in Gaza brazenly, continuously and with total impunity.' On December 19, 2024 Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors Without Borders) stated that 'repeated Israeli military attacks on Palestinian civilians over the last 14 months, the dismantling of the health care system and other essential infrastructure, the suffocating siege, and the systematic denial of humanitarian assistance are destroying the conditions of life in Gaza.' The report says there are 'clear signs of ethnic cleansing' by Israel as it wages war in Gaza. Also issued on December 19, 2024 was a report from Human Rights Watch, entitled'Extermination and Acts of Genocide,' stating that Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians in Gaza by denying them clean water which it says legally amounts to acts of genocide and extermination. Corroborating the testimony of health care workers and human rights advocates in Gaza would be Pope Francis's January 9, 2025, message to international diplomats. Pope Francis denounced Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave 'very serious and shameful.' Pope Francis referenced the deaths of children who froze to death because of Israel's destruction of infrastructure: 'We cannot in any way accept the bombing of civilians. We cannot accept that children are freezing to death because hospitals have been destroyed or a country's energy network has been hit.' Recommendations made by jurors in the Merchants of Death War Crimes Tribunal call for major weapon makers to pay reparations for suffering caused. They echo the words of Pope Francis, whose message to the assemblage of diplomats made this appeal: 'With the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, let us establish a global fund that can finally put an end to hunger and favor development in the most impoverished countries, so that their citizens will not resort to violent or illusory solutions, or have to leave their countries in order to seek a more dignified life'. Considering such testimony from so many diverse sources, one might expect that U.S. lawmakers would re-evaluate their murderous, unwavering support of Israel. Instead, on January 9th, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to sanction the International Criminal Court in protest of its arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Who are the criminals? U.S. news coverage of five former or current presidents gathered for the funeral of President Jimmy Carter never hinted that hideous wars of choice along with massive increases in weapon sales had marked the administration of each of the five. There was no mention of President Biden's order to send eight billion dollars of weapons to Gaza. This gathering of U.S. presidents is referred to as 'The World's Most Exclusive Club.' Exclusive indeed. What other club of so few has caused so much suffering to so many? On April 7, 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famously insightful, prophetic speech about another illegal U.S. war of choice – 'Beyond Viet Nam: A Time to Break the Silence' – in which Dr. King said: 'Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken: the role of those who make peaceful resolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments.' Dr. King's verdict, in this speech, on the momentous first anniversary of which he was taken from us, was that 'This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.' The four defendants before our Tribunal certainly did their part to pressure these five other criminals toward their varied crimes, but we all have a choice to hold ourselves accountable in the face of Dr. King's warning that we are approaching spiritual death. One step toward reconciling with wisdom, justice and love would be to demand the release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya from an Israeli prison so that we could humbly learn from him about war crimes and reparations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geI0eumd5xfMx	2025-01-12T16:05:12-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Implications Of Visit Of Somalia’s Pre...	It is a long journey from the accusation of President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud in February 2024 during the Ordinary Session of the Executive Council of the African Union, when he alleged that he was prevented from entering the Headquarters of the AU in Addis Ababa by Ethiopian security forces, and that he was rescued by President Ismael Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, to yesterday, January 11th, 2025, when the President of Somalia was extended a warm welcome to Addis Ababa. Abiy Ahmed’s message on 'X' which read 'I warmly welcome President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud of the Federal Republic of Somalia, on his working visit to Ethiopia.' Speaks out loudly on the event. The two countries have been at logger heads on the matter of the Somali sea and Ethiopia’s continuous and constant complaint of its need for access to a sea. The illegal MoU it signed with one of the regions of Somalia was considered by the latter as a transgression on its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Despite the 'Ankara Declaration' pressured and worked on by Türkiye, Ethiopia does not appear to have reversed its quest for taking part of Somalia’s territory and/or sea through a lease process, much like the Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which was leased to the USA for a specific period and which still remains in its hands. Many Somalis are accordingly wary of the visit of the President Mahmoud to the country which, in their minds, is working hard to dismantle it and balkanize it. During the long and continuing civil war of Somalia, Ethiopia played a nefarious role encouraging many regions to pull away from the center, which weakens Somalia. A country of one people, one language, one faith and one culture, has been turned into a bad lands region and according to many Somalis, Ethiopia played, despite its claims of helping the country, a bad hand in the process. Many read the visit as an attempt to weaken the relationship between Somalia and Asmara and Cairo who recently signed a tripartite arrangement along with Mogadishu to look after each other in the boiling geopolitical situation and location of the region and in particular with the quest of Ethiopia to have access to Somalia’s sea. Others read the visit as a game engineered by the President of Djibouti to weaken Asmara only and still others view the visit as Hassan selling out his country just to preserve his political career through a military, political and social support of Ethiopia as it maintains substantial presence in the country. However, the Horn of Africa States region has been a volatile region for many years now, where alliances shift. A number of years ago, there was a tripartite arrangement between the countries of Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Today, the tripartite arrangements still exist but with Ethiopia being replaced by Egypt, a far-off country, mainly interested in the Nile waters and unmindful of the fate of the people of the region. In all these arrangements, Dibouti was always and still is the missing link in the potential Horn of Africa States region of the SEED countries (Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti). Some major countries such as those which have failed in their relations with Africa are also reported to be pushing a wrong agenda for the region, including selling naval vessels to and training naval forces for Ethiopia, a country which is geographically landlocked and which does not have a sea. This appears to have been the major cause of the recent volatility in the region, which does not need hostilities of this nature. Other regional powers have also used their resources to interfere in the region and more particularly Somalia, which they see as the weak link of the region. Their involvement appears to be aimed at controlling the ports of Somalia, the seas of Somalia and especially the very Horn of Africa, which separates the waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Sea (the northern Indian Ocean) and link it with the Yemeni-held islands off the coast of Somalia. These activities pose major implications for the region. It is reported that President Guelleh of Djibouti may have played a role in arranging the visit of the President of Somalia to Addis Ababa, which if true, could pose well for the region to coming closer together. President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud of Somalia has also been reported to be working on creating peace between Eritrea and Djibouti, two countries which have had disputes over a tiny space of ground in the border between the two countries. Should such a closer relationship among the countries of the region materialize, it would have major implications not only for the region but also for others who have interest in the region from major powers to regional powers and seafaring nations. Note the region would be in control of some 4,700 km of a coastal belt and over a million square kilometers of marine space in the form of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and hence a sizeable blue economy. The region overlooks the Indian Ocean/ Suez Canal waterway, which is reported to handle some 12 per cent of global trade and is the source of the Blue Nile which provides fresh water to millions of people in the countries of Sudan and Egypt. The effect of the Houthi disruption would then be toned down, as it would have to face a major unified region on the other side of the sea, which disrupts its economic systems. Currently all the countries of the region only mind their individual interests irrespective to the damage that a disruption of the waterway brings to the development of the region. The possibilities of port, rail and road developments from the region to the rest of Africa is pushed back to the distant future, as each country of the region only works to manage its own external affairs both politically and economically. A cooperation among the countries of the region, designed more like the European Union, with each country maintaining its sovereign and territorial integrity and working with others for the common good of the region, in terms of economic and political issues, and facing other regions of the world collectively and not on individual basis, would be good for the region. Note that tiny states like Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and others in the European Union have the same rights as the giants like Germany and France and Spain. Why shouldn’t the countries of the region work on the same basis? Many of the major, middle and regional powers who are currently involved in the region would be better off should the region be peaceful, stable and settled instead of being volatile, disruptive and warring with each other and others. It is where President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud’s visit to Ethiopia, appears to change the equation, adding a fresh formula for the region where they can work together and settle issues on a common platform. Ethiopia does not need to be enticed by foreign forces to seek Somalia’s waters and seas or for that matter any other country’s waters. A Horn African States platform would probably attend to the Hobbesian fear of each country of the other (s).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geB4siBZRnR3H	2025-01-12T16:03:20-08:00	
Bangladesh: Fracas Over Reforms Or Elections – OpEd	Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Mohammed Yunus is facing a growing challenge by leading political parties who have opposed his plans to delay parliament polls. Backed by student agitators and radical Islamist parties who installed Yunus after ousting the Awami League government, the Nobel laureate has said he needs time to push through reforms he considers ' esserntial for the future of democracy ' in Bangladesh. But both the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP) have said reforms is best left to an elected government. Sensing a clear chance of winning the parliament elections if it is held soon, the BNP leadership is now at loggerheads with Yunus, the students leaders and the Islamist parties backing him. The BNP clearly want elections within the next few months and are uncomfortable with Yunus pitching for polls in mid-2026 after completing the reforms. The BNP , like the Awami League, has raised a basic question over Yunus' locus standi to pursue an agenda for reforms. Its leaders argue that any comprehensive reforms should be carried out by an elected parliament and not an interim government which has a tenuous constitutional basis. On the other hand, radical parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami with a unconcealed agenda to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic state have backed Yunus on his plans for reforms before elections. The Jamaat, which is yet to apologise for supporting the Pakistani genocide during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, has gone all out to push the Yunus administration to restore bilateral relations with Pakistan after the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League government in August. It sees in the current political climate a huge opportunity to undo the secular-linguistic edifice of Bengali nationalism and supplant it with a radical Islamist ideology clearly aimed at undermining minority and gender rights . The student leaders, mostly educated in religious seminaries, have unhesistatingly jumped into the Islamist bandwagon with calls to replace the 1972 secular constitution with one driven by Shariat laws. One of them, Sargis Alam, described the Jamaat-e-Islami student front , Islamic Chatra Shibir, as 'comrades' in the oust-Hasina campaign while another student leader Hasnat Abdullah has openly challenged the BNP's push for early elections. 'So many young people have not died to see one fascist dispensation replaced by another,' Hasnat told mediapersons in response to the BNP's call for early elections. Bangladesh's leading constitutional expert Barrister Tania Amir says the student leaders , with Jamaat-e-Islami backing, have definite plans to undo the key features of the 1972 constitution with those emanating from hardline Islamist ideology. 'That is why they want much time because they want a new Constitution in place before any election is held,' Amir told the Federal in an interview. 'The West is yet to see through the plans to hijack the democracy movement to create an Islamist state in Bangladesh.' 'The liberal facade of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is smartly used by the Islamic parties, so long marginal players in post-independence Bangladesh, to fool the West about their real mission. The reforms they plan are to create a theocracy and not a democracy,' said Selim Mahmud, a law professor in Dhaka university heading the Awami League's Information Office. The BNP, which backed the student agitation to get rid of its bete noise Awami League, seems to have now seen through these plans. Their leaders have firmly opposed dumping the 1972 Constitution and challenging the legacy of the Liberation War. They are downplaying their past alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami as 'merely for political convenience and not one based on ideological compatibility.' The BNP is a centrist party founded by military dictator Gen Ziaur Rahman who had fought in the 1971 Liberation War. It realises any surge in religiosity will help Islamic parties like Jamaat . On the other hand, with the Awami League on the backfoot, the BNP clearly fancies usurping the Liberation War legacy by highlighting Zia's declaration of independence on 27 March 1971. The US , which strongly backed the oust-Hasina movement and the Yunus-led interim government, may change course. Outgoing US ambassdor in India, Eric Garcetti, called for early elections in Bangladesh to 'restore the democratic process' during a press conference in Kolkata. Garcetti called on India to work closely with US to 'strengthen democracy in Bangladesh' in what many feel is a subtle appeal to Delhi to cooperate with the Yunus administration. India has not only sheltered ousted PM Sheikh Hasina but recently extended her residential permit after the Yunus administration called for her extradition to stand trial in dozens of cases filed against her. Delhi is clearly worried over the Yunus government releasing convicted Islamist terrorists like Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) chief Jashimuddin Rahmani. So if the BNP raises the ante over early elections and the Awami League echoes the same, Delhi may not only support it but try influencing the incoming Trump administration to push for early elections.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geIuDkM6vvIW0	2025-01-12T16:01:01-08:00	
HIV Drug Access Crisis Persists Despite Trial Success – Interview	Promising new drugs to prevent and treat HIV have the potential to transform the response to the disease. But getting these drugs to those who need it most will be critical, says Beatriz Grinsztejn, president of the International AIDS Society. Grinsztejn is the first Latin American to head the IAS, which has been advocating since the 1980s for science-based HIV policies, free from stigma. Leading research at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Grinsztejn has a long history as a pioneer in the field and says prioritising poorer countries is her central focus. She spoke to SciDev.Net about addressing inequities, combating stigma and criminalisation, and advocating for key populations to ensure a robust HIV response that is truly universal. How has your tenure as IAS president been so far? Honestly, it has been an incredible opportunity. I am learning a lot and dealing with different regions and stakeholders and regions, which has been both enriching and challenging. It’s the first time someone from my region has got to this position. So, it means a lot for me as a woman from Latin America to have the opportunity to be IAS president. And it’s a lot of work. What are your priorities as IAS president? Being someone from the global South, my major priority is to put the global South at the centre. We have a lot to say and we are very diverse. I am not an expert in Africa, but my perspective is rooted in the global South. My objective is to make us visible and to bring our needs to the centre of the table for discussion. This means prioritising access to new technologies [for low- and middle-income countries]. Above all, it’s about addressing stigma, discrimination, and criminalisation. In the different regions, we face different challenges regarding human rights. With the advance of right-wing ideologies in several countries, these challenges have grown significantly. Another focus is on key populations—different groups depending on the region—but the goal is to put these hidden people at the centre of the discussion, because we need to work for them. What challenges do regions such as Africa and Latin America face around access to HIV medicines? We have recently seen impressive results from the Purpose 1 and 2 studies, which evaluated the efficacy of [the drug] lenacapavir for prevention of HIV. In the Purpose 1 study, conducted among young women in Africa and presented by Linda-Gail Bekker at the AIDS 2024 conference in Munich last July, we saw impressive results: no HIV infections among the group of women who use lenacapavir. Since then, we have seen the results from Purpose 2, first presented in Lima at the 5th HIV Research for Prevention conference, also showing very impressive results. Gilead [the US pharmaceutical company which developed lenacapavir] has positioned itself to work on the licensing for generic versions of the drug. They have contracted six different factories that will produce the generics, but it will take years until we have these products. This license only covers 120 countries, and countries in Latin America, who contributed massively to the study for Purpose 2, are out of the agreement. Access is a major topic for us at the IAS. We really aim to bring this topic to discussion with stakeholders, with advocates, and use our voice to promote access. That needs to go much beyond this licensing that was already signed. We also have long-acting cabotegravir [a drug used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS], which … has been available for four years now. Generic production was only agreed upon two years ago. The agreement was signed with the Medicines Patent Pool, and of course, there is very limited access to cabotegravir. How do these issues specifically affect key populations? In Latin America, we’re seeing rising HIV infections among young men who have sex with men and transgender women. These groups are disproportionately affected, yet interventions like pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP, a medicine that can reduce the risk of getting HIV] are not scaling up fast enough. While countries like Brazil have made progress, many other nations in the region lag behind. Similarly, in Africa, key populations face unique challenges tied to criminalisation and stigma. These barriers lead to lower rates of viral suppression among these groups compared to the general population. It’s crucial to tailor our interventions to meet their specific needs. Criminalisation is a big point for us, and we want to bring the conversation on human rights and criminalisation as a central topic for us at the IAS. Criminalisation of LGBT people in Africa, homophobia and transphobia in Latin America are major issues. What are the sticking points preventing progress? One major issue is the lack of strong health systems. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) struggle to absorb and scale up new technologies. Stigma and discrimination—both within health systems and society—also play a significant role. Legal reforms are needed to address criminalisation, but funding for such initiatives is often inadequate.What about treatment options in low- and middle-income countries? We also need to make progress in regard to treatment. People have issues in regard to using oral PrEP and many people also have issues in keeping adherence to antiretroviral therapy. We now see a gap between the richer countries and us, the LMICs, in regard to what kind of antiretroviral treatment is available. In guidelines of almost all rich countries you have long-acting antiretrovirals as an important option and it’s completely out of any guideline that serves LMICs. I believe we are moving slower than needed, but we are moving. At this point … we need to stay more united than ever so that we can guarantee that we don’t lose the rights that were already achieved. And guarantee that we have enough funding as well. Keeping HIV, the financing of the HIV response, as a major topic for us, is critical at this point where we need to discuss the replenishment of the Global Fund [to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]. So we need to be together, unite our voices so that we can keep the AIDS response in the centre. How positive do you feel about progress in tackling HIV? While progress is slower than we’d like, there have been significant advancements in HIV prevention and treatment technologies. Innovations like lenacapavir and long-acting cabotegravir have the potential to transform HIV care—if made accessible. However, the real work begins with ensuring these technologies reach the people who need them most.

The New Drones Boosting Russia’s Advances On The Battlefield In U...	By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service and Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- As Russian forces have intensified their advances in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks, they're being helped by a new tool on the battlefield: drones that fly with the use of fiber-optic cables. 'The use of fiber-optic FPV drones definitely creates new challenges on the battlefield,' said a border guard with the Pomsta Brigade who goes by the call sign 'Phoenix.' RFE/RL agreed to identify him and other soldiers by their call signs or first names for this story, according to rules set by the Ukrainian military. Unlike standard FPV (first-person view) drones -- the term used for drones piloted through a video feed wirelessly transmitted to a pilot's headset, mobile device, or other displays -- the use of fiber-optic cables allows drones to operate without radio signals. This makes them less vulnerable to electronic jamming as they stay directly connected to their operators through up to 15 kilometers of thin coils of fiber-optic cable that resembles a fishing line. While Ukrainian forces are grappling with declining Western arms support and Russia's manpower advantage, the modified drones represent a shift in battlefield tactics in Ukraine. Both Kyiv and Moscow are ramping up fighting as they enter a pivotal stage of the war ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump -- who has vowed to quickly end the war -- returning to office on January 20. The new drones have reportedly been in use since the summer, but Ukrainian soldiers stationed across the country tell RFE/RL they are becoming a staple of Moscow's battlefield strategy as it pushes for more territory in Ukraine's east. 'A Very Dangerous Weapon' Many said that, in addition to being used for reconnaissance, they are being increasingly used by Russian troops as self-destructing drones with a small payload attached to target Ukrainian positions and vehicles. 'This is a very dangerous weapon. It's like a brick with a propeller flying at you, and there is little you can do about it,' said 'Varan,' an officer in the 148th Artillery Brigade. Faced with changing tactics, soldiers say they've been forced to adapt quickly -- with mixed results. Kostyantyn, a commander of the battalion of the National Guard's Bureviy Brigade, says the ineffectiveness of electronic jamming against the new drones allows them to push farther into Ukrainian lines and fly or reach targets with more accuracy compared to traditional FPV drones. 'This allows them to see our positions better, strike more accurately, and fly longer distances. This makes the situation a little more complicated,' he said. These complications led Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Main Intelligence Agency of Ukraine's Defense Ministry, to call the new drones 'a huge problem for us' during a December 31 broadcast by Ukrainian media. On January 8, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that Russia is increasingly deploying fiber-optic drones as part of its current offensive and said the drones have carried out a series of new strikes along the front lines. 'Shvayka,' a drone pilot and platoon commander stationed near Soledar in eastern Ukraine, says the long fiber-optic cables can make the drones more difficult to detect. While soldiers can often spot antennas used to allow standard FPV drones to be piloted from a distance and disable them, the Russian drones have only a long, thin line with an easy-to-hide coil that feeds it. 'There is only a small box where the fiber-optic cable from the drone itself is placed, and it's very easy to miss this because it's the size of a pack of cigarettes,' he said. Another advantage is that they are less likely to lose their signal than standard FPV drones and can pursue targets more easily. 'If the pilot is professionally trained, using a fiber-optic drone allows them to fly very low, even skimming the ground in vegetation, without losing the video signal,' said 'Lyutiy,' the commander of an FPV unit in Ukraine's Third Separate Assault Brigade. '[This allows] them to conduct reconnaissance and reach otherwise inaccessible targets [better] than a regular drone.' Not Without Drawbacks 'Medoid,' a Ukrainian border guard, says the biggest lesson he's learned from dealing with the drones is the need to take extra precautions and better camouflage potential targets and personnel. The fiber-optic drones are not without their drawbacks, he adds, saying they struggle in terrain and spaces that aren't open and that he's seen several caught up in tree branches. The drones are also limited in the distances they can cover and where they can strike based on the cable's range. Given these obstacles, soldiers say the easiest way to take out the tethered drones is with small arms fire. Others say they've deployed large nets -- even fishing nets — to take them out. The cables can be manually severed, but doing so risks exposing soldiers to incoming fire. But in a war where every advance could prove crucial, the new drones are having an impact on the battlefield. Russia is reportedly ramping up production of the fiber-optic drones and Ukraine is also looking to develop its own versions, including a model showcased by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier this month. 'For now, we are still in the testing phase,' Lyutiy said. 'We all see these flashy ads with promises, but in practice, we are only beginning to develop in this direction.' RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service has seen its audience grow significantly since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and is among the most cited media outlets in the country. Its bold, in-depth reporting from the front lines has won many accolades and awards. Its comprehensive coverage also includes award-winning reporting by the Donbas.Realities and Crimea.Realities projects and the Schemes investigative unit.

Thailand Lets Autocratic Neighbors Hunt Down Opponents On Its Soi...	By Zachary Abuza Even by Cambodian standards, it was a brazen attack on an opposition figure. Lim Kimya, a 73-year old member of the banned Cambodia National Rescue Party, or CNRP, was gunned down by an assassin in Bangkok on Jan. 7. The hit was the latest in a growing pattern in which governments in Southeast Asia are complicit in the killing or rendition of opposition figures from neighboring countries –- or at least turn a blind eye to extralegal operations of their security forces within their borders. This has been going on for years, but with little official accountability, the security forces appear to be acting with more impunity, and often in violation of the international legal norm of non-refoulement. At the heart of this is Thailand, a magnet for migrants or refugees from its poorer neighbors whose government is increasingly willing to work with its authoritarian neighbors, or is unable to prevent other security services from conducting operations on its soil. Chinese security forces have long targeted dissidents in Thailand, such as Gui Minhai, who was snatched from his holiday home in Pattaya in 2015, or Li Xin, who went missing in the country a year later. In both cases, it’s unclear the degree of Thai government complicity, but Bangkok’s decisions reflect the vast asymmetry in power between China and Thailand. There’s no such power imbalance among Southeast Asian states, though. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch has described the traffic in targeted dissidents as a 'swap mart.' There is no evidence that there are formal agreements between and among the countries, but there’s clearly a lot of informal cooperation. Lao authorities, for example, notoriously disappeared rural development expert Sombath Somphone in December 2012 after taking him into police custody, and attempted to kill Anousa Luangsouphom in April 2023. Quid pro quo But less well known is their targeting of Free Lao activists on Thai soil. In August 2019, a 34-year old Thai-based Lao activist, Od Sayavong, and his housemate went missing from his home in Bangkok. Thai authorities pled ignorance in the case and their investigation has stalled. In May 2023, Kitiyano Bounsuan, a 56-year-old Thai-based Lao democracy activist who had received UNHCR refugee status, was gunned down in bordering Ubon Ratchathani province. These incidents may represent a quid pro quo between Bangkok and Vientiane. Following the Thai military’s May 2014 seizure of power, a number of democracy activists fled to Laos. During an April 2018 visit to Bangkok, Lt. Gen. Souvone Leuangbounmy, the chief-of-staff of the Lao People’s Armed Forces, pledged assistance to Gen.Prayuth Chanocha in tracking down Thai activists. Disappearing activists That help was already ongoing. In June 2016, the Thai anti-monarchy activists Ittapon Sukpaen disappeared; in 2017, Wuthipong Kachathamakul was abducted and never seen again. In January 2019, the bodies of two other anti-monarchy activists, Chatcharn Buppawan, 56, and Kraidej Luelert, 46, washed up on the Thai bank of the Mekong River. The two bodies were handcuffed and their feet bound, and they had been disemboweled, with their stomachs filled with concrete in order to sink the corpses. One other activist, Surachai Danwattananusorn, 78, went missing at the same time, but his body has never been found. In 2020, a Thai activist, Wanchalearm Satsaksit, was snatched from the streets of Phnom Penh. Just last November, Thailand deported six members of the CNRP -- four women and two men, along with a child -- back to Cambodia. The six had escaped Cambodia in 2022, and were immediately charged with treasonupon their return. There is less cooperation between Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. Malaysian security forces have become displeased with the human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and overall lack of accountability of Thai security forces in Thailand’s deep south, where ethnic Malay separatists have been waging a low-level insurgency for 21 years. Nonetheless, sometimes there is a bit of Thai-Malaysian cooperation. In September 2021, Thai authorities arrested and returned Nur Sajat, a Malaysian transgender entrepreneur, who was wanted by authorities for failing to appear before a sharia court on charges of insulting Islam. This is all the more surprising given Thailand’s very progressive attitudes and laws on LGBTQ issues, and Malaysia’s draconian policies, including forced conversion therapy. Helping Hanoi No country has benefitted more from Thai cooperation or a blind eye in recent years than Vietnam. In January 2019, Thai authorities detained Radio Free Asia blogger Truong Duy Nhat, who was in the process of applying for refugee status, and turned him over to Vietnamese police, who spirited him across the border to Laos and then Vietnam. Thai authorities have denied involvement. In March 2020, a Vietnamese court sentenced Nhat to 10 years for fraud, dating back to a nearly two-decade old investigation into the purchase of land for the newspaper’s office when he was editor at Dai Doan Ket, a state-owned paper in Danang. Nhat had fled to Thailand in 2016 after serving a two-year prison term for 'abusing democratic freedoms,' after writing blog posts that were critical of the Communist Party. In April 2023, Vietnamese security forces allegedly abducted an exiled journalist, Duong Van Thai, 41, from outside of his house in northern Bangkok. Security cameras captured his shrieks. Thai had fled to Thailand in 2019 fearing persecution, and like Nhat, was in the process of applying for refugee status. Thailand’s ostensible democracy While Vietnamese authorities may be chastened about trying more snatch-and-grabs from the streets of Germany, they clearly feel they can act with impunity or tacit approval in Southeast Asia. Vietnamese authorities have also pursued legal extraditions. In mid-2024, Thailand returned an ethnic minority Montagnard activist to Vietnam. Y Quynh Bdap, 32, had been living in Thailand since 2018 and had received UN refugee status. Last October, a Thai court authorized his extradition, despite the fact that he faced a 10-year sentence after being tried and convicted in absentia of 'terrorism' charges. Even more alarming, last March, a group of police from the Central Highland provinces of Dan Lak and Gia Lai were in Thailand conducting interviews in Montagnard refugee communities, trying to learn of Bdap’s whereabouts and to pressure the asylum seekers to return to Vietnam. It is unlikely that Vietnamese police could have operated so overtly without the approval and support of Thai security forces. In January 2024, nearly 100 Montagnard suspects were put on trial and convicted for riots that killed nine people, including four policemen, and resulted in the burning of commune offices. Some 53 of them were convicted on charges of 'terrorism against the people’s government.' While we should not be surprised by the actions of Lao, Cambodian or Vietnamese security forces, Thailand is ostensibly a democracy. Since the 2014 military coup in Bangkok, however, Thai authorities have either been complicit or turned a blind eye to the actions of the security forces of neighboring authoritarian countries. The elected Thai government of Paetongtarn Shinawatra is already on its back feet after the courts ousted her predecessor Srettha Thavsin. Under military pressure, no Thai government can afford to be seen as anti-monarchy in any way. To ensure access to exiled Thai anti-monarchists, Thailand has chosen to remain at the center of this informal compact to target neighboring dissidents.

Pakistan Struggles To Bring Trade To China-Built Port – Analysis	By Sarah Zaman Pakistan is struggling to attract commercial activity to a Chinese-funded deep-sea port in the southwest that experts say is hampered by local insecurity, a lack of basic services and the absence of plans to make the port prosper. A press release issued Wednesday after a meeting chaired by Pakistani Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal indicated that authorities do not have a plan to attract trade to the port, nearly a decade after the first container ships traveled through it in 2016. 'The minister noted the lack of commercial analysis and a comprehensive operational plan for Gwadar Port, calling for immediate efforts to unlock its potential,' the statement said. Iqbal has ordered a plan to be drawn up within six months to generate trade traffic, according to the statement. Constructed in 2007 at a cost of nearly $250 million and operated by the China Overseas Ports Holding Company since 2013, Gwadar port is situated in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Although built before the 2015 launch of the roughly $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the port is billed as the 'crown jewel' of the energy, infrastructure and investment project launched as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Despite nearly a billion dollars of additional infrastructure development in and around Gwadar city, a report by Pakistan’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs has noted that during the fiscal year 2022-23, Gwadar, the smallest of the country’s three ports, handled less than 1% of Pakistan’s seaborne trade at its three berths. 'All this is symptomatic of absence of long-term planning in Pakistan's governance system,' said Muhammad Faisal, an expert in Pakistan’s foreign policy at the Sydney-based University of Technology. 'From the beginning, Gwadar was more of a ‘geopolitical’ venture than a pure commercial case,' Faisal said in a written statement. In a bid to ramp up shipping activity in Gwadar, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that 60% of public sector imports and exports should pass through the port. This came after Sharif ordered at least 50% of public cargo to go through the port in a Cabinet meeting last August. Former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told VOA that the port lacks the infrastructure and manpower to handle massive cargo. 'Unless you spend another 3 billion to 4 billion dollars there and make a world-class port, you really can’t call it a port,' Abbasi said, criticizing what he called the Sharif government’s unrealistic approach. According to reports, the Chinese firm operating the Gwadar port plans to build a total of 100 berths by 2045. Pakistan’s largest airport by area, which was built near Gwardar port, also remains largely unused. Aviation website Skyscanner shows three weekly domestic flights to Karachi and one international flight to Oman from the massive new facility. Constructed with a $230 million Chinese grant, the opening of New Gwadar International Airport suffered several delays prior to its soft launch last month. Wednesday’s statement from the planning ministry said Iqbal directed the preparation of marketing templates and packages showcasing Gwadar’s cost-effective trade routes and potential incentives for international businesses. Insecurity, lack of services a hurdle Abbasi, who is also an aviation expert, told VOA that while the new Gwadar airport is a necessary accompaniment to the deep-sea port in the long term, the lack of basic facilities such as water, electricity and security in the city make it an unattractive destination for airlines. 'Airlines have a basic requirement that there must be passengers. No passenger wants to come to Gwadar or leave from Gwadar,' Abbasi said. Balochistan province, home to Gwadar, has been in the throes of a separatist insurgency for two decades, and violence has escalated in recent months. At least six people, mostly security personnel, and eight militants were killed recently as Pakistani forces thwarted an attack on the Gwadar Port Authority complex near the port. The port gives China a shorter route for trade with the Middle East and Central Asia. Despite Pakistan’s failure to market Gwadar port and airport to international businesses, Sydney-based expert Faisal said the project may not become a liability like Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, which Beijing took control of in 2017 after Colombo failed to pay off debt linked with it. 'Since Pakistan fundamentally viewed Gwadar port in ‘geostrategic’ terms and contrasts it with India's cooperation with Iran in neighboring Chahbahar port, Gwadar will remain useful for Pakistan,' Faisal told VOA. Mustafa Hyder Sayed, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan-China Institute, said the slow pace of business in Gwadar is not a problem for bilateral ties. 'State-to-state relations are deep-rooted in long-term strategic interests and not any [one] event; not any project or single instance can harm any state-to-state relations,' Sayed told VOA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5fJU5R20hQpX	2025-01-11T16:49:38-08:00	
Global South Solidarity Sparks A Multipolar Evolution – Analysis	The geopolitical dynamics of 2024 underscored a world in flux. From the relentless Russia-Ukraine war to mounting tensions in the South China Sea, external provocations have fueled global uncertainty. Yet, amidst the turbulence, China has maintained a steady hand, leveraging its resilience to foster an environment conducive to high-quality development. By projecting stability in a fragmented world, Beijing has reinforced its role as a crucial pillar for global equilibrium. China's growing influence within the Global South signals a shift in the global balance of power. Once a marginalized bloc, the Global South is now ascending, with Beijing at its forefront. Through initiatives promoting peace and sustainable development, China has amplified its leadership in shaping a multipolar world. This rise has not gone unnoticed in Washington, where a waning unipolar dominance faces unprecedented challenges. For decades, the United States wielded unparalleled global power, but China's ascent has forced a recalibration of this dynamic. Determined to maintain its primacy, the U.S. appears intent on curbing China's ambitions, a strategy that reflects an entrenched resistance to relinquishing its status as the world’s preeminent power. In the days of the Cold War, the world was divided into two camps, and the Non-Aligned Movement emerged as a third force. Back then, it was about politics - an assertion by the Global South that it wouldn’t be co-opted by either side. The South had its own priorities, its own problems, and a fierce desire for independence. But today, the conversation has shifted. The battleground isn’t ideology anymore; it’s economics. Take the ripple effects of sanctions on China, for example. When trade routes are obstructed, it’s the South that often pays the price. For countries striving to grow, these economic pressures are more than inconvenient - they’re devastating. This is why the idea of a united Global South is gaining traction again, but with a modern twist. It’s not just about saying 'no' to the North; it’s about building enough economic strength to chart an independent path. The South, after all, shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of decisions made elsewhere. To balance the scales, it must come together, leveraging collective power to reject unilateral impositions. In this era, solidarity isn’t just a lofty ideal; it’s an economic necessity for a fairer, more resilient world order. The West must recognize that constant pressure on the Global South is neither sustainable nor fair. The Global South, with its unique challenges and aspirations, seeks a balanced approach - not alignment with either the East or the West. For these nations, trade and access to both spheres are vital for fostering growth and development. Losing economic ties with either bloc would ripple through their economies, stalling progress and destabilizing futures. However, the Global South is still in the process of coalescing into a unified voice. As this collective takes shape, there’s a pressing need for structured collaboration to evaluate and respond to the North’s actions. This would empower these nations to manage the complexities of global power struggles while protecting their own interests. The path forward for the Global South lies in building strength through unity, ensuring their economic and developmental priorities cannot be overlooked. Globalization, with its promises of borderless trade and free markets, remains an distant dream. The world is still divided into three distinct factions - the East, West, and South - each navigating its own interests under the guise of shared ideals. Western powers, while championing free trade in rhetoric, routinely contradict this principle. Sanctions, often wielded as tools of economic dominance, are the antithesis of open markets. They stifle competition and undermine the very foundations of globalization. Take the United States, for instance. Its advocacy for free trade rings hollow when selective tariffs are applied to imports from rival nations. True free trade demands fair competition, yet the U.S. finds it challenging to match China’s economic dynamism. With its 1.4 billion consumers and vast manufacturing capabilities, China thrives in global trade, exposing the inefficiencies and higher costs entrenched in the U.S. economy. In response, Washington resorts to punitive measures - sanctions and heightened tariffs - designed to curb China’s rise. Such actions reveal the fragility of the free trade narrative. A genuine commitment to globalization requires multilateral engagement through institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These platforms, devoid of superpower dominance, could establish equitable trade policies, including fair tax levels, to address disparities. Only through cooperation can the global community dismantle the barriers of protectionism and foster a truly competitive, inclusive market. Until then, globalization remains more myth than reality, a vision clouded by the self-interest of its loudest proponents. The rise of the Global South is exemplified by the increasing influence of BRICS, a once modest economic alliance that has grown into a formidable platform for political and security cooperation. In many ways, BRICS represents a challenge to the dominance of Western-led institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With its emphasis on reshaping global governance, BRICS signals a shift toward a multipolar world where power is shared more equitably among emerging and established nations. At the heart of this transformation is China, whose leadership within BRICS has been both ambitious and strategic. Beijing has championed efforts to establish alternatives to Western frameworks, notably through the New Development Bank. This institution focuses on providing infrastructure financing and supporting sustainable development projects—crucially, without the stringent conditionalities that have long been a hallmark of Western lenders. What makes this evolution particularly striking is its timing, occurring at a moment when traditional global powers appear divided and uncertain in their strategies. For BRICS nations, this is an opportunity to assert their vision of a fairer, more inclusive international system. Yet, whether this vision can fully materialize depends on whether these nations can maintain unity in their shared push for a rebalanced world order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5YjwOP08pqdw	2025-01-11T16:47:41-08:00	
Protecting Buddhist Shared Heritage: Exploring India’s Quest With...	The cultural heritage of a country is a fundamental factor in forming and shaping the identity of a nation. It becomes more significant in the context of a war-torn nation like Afghanistan. Afghanistan has been experiencing a war-like condition for the last four decades that proved disastrous for its centuries-old historical heritage. The first phase of the Taliban government in Afghanistan was a dark period for Afghan cultural heritage. However, it has been observed that Taliban 2.0 presents a different approach towards Afghanistan’s cultural heritage and its preservation. It seems that Taliban 2.0 is comparatively different towards heritage and is ready to allow preservation activities in the country. This approach of the new Taliban regime could be seen as a turning point for protecting and preserving the country’s cultural heritage. Recently, the meeting of India’s foreign secretary with the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan in Dubai seems to have opened a new arena in the policy of interaction with the Taliban Government in Afghanistan. Maybe the comparative difference in the Taliban 2.0’s approach, India has decided to give preference to realpolitik policy. Here, the global community have an opportunity to save the cultural treasures of humanity and provide the people of Afghanistan with better economic opportunities. Such a change in approach is significant for India, too, as in addition to its humanitarian assistance, it can provide immediate financial and technical support to save Afghanistan's and India's shared cultural heritage. The perception of Afghanistan among the general global audience is affected by political turmoil, violence, terrorism and ethnic conflict. The takeover of political power by the Taliban administration in August 2021 further strengthened the image of the country. Afghanistan has been famous as a 'crossroad of cultures and civilisations' that shaped its society of multicultural and syncretic identities. This 'crossroad of cultures' has evolved because of its geographical location and accompanying interactions with nearby cultures. Communities from West Asia (the Persian Empire), Central Asia (Bactrian cities of the Bronze Age), South Asia (Colonies of Alexander and his Indo-Greek successors, the Kushan Empire, the Islamic Empires of Ghaznavids, Timurid Empire and Mughal Empire) and China (cultures along the Silk Route) have met in this region and communicated with each other over centuries via multiple means such as trade, commerce, migration, religious missionaries and periodic conflicts between the regional powers. Centuries of multifaceted interactions of hugely diverse cultures have led to the creation of significant and exciting treasures such as art pieces, architectural and literary developments, and archaeological sites. These heritages are of both national and international importance. Whether it is a statue of Buddha found in the Afghan land or the remains of architectural geniuses of Timurid styles, cultural symbols like these form an identity of Afghanistan. The cultural heritage of Afghanistan's pre-Islamic is present before us as a living example of its rich and glorious past. Taliban 1.0 regime’s destructive approach towards Cultural Heritage However, there must be caution in moving forward, keeping in mind that the Taliban is an ultraconservative religious and political group that emerged in the mid-1990s after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1989 from Afghanistan. It literally means 'students' in the Persian language, which is generally referred to denote this political group. The Taliban were former fighters from the mujahideen groups organised to resist the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1989 led to political instability, resulting in the Civil war between the mujahideen factions. One such faction was organised as the Taliban in 1994, which later took control of the Afghan administration. The Taliban regime was led by Mullah Muhammad Umar, whose power base was in Qandahar. Taliban had applied the extreme interpretation of Islamic laws in the name of bringing peace and stability to the region. The guerrilla wars of the 1980s by the Mujahedin groups against the Soviets, the Civil war of the 1990s and the fundamentalist and extremist regime of the Taliban till 2001 have contributed to the destruction of the country’s age-old cultural heritage, which became the soft targets to gain finance and to give political messages to the global and domestic audiences. The rise of the Taliban government in 1996-2001 CE was the worst period for the Afghan cultural heritage, at least in the last century. Afghanistan witnessed the regime of the Taliban, which promoted the monoculture idea of Afghanistan primarily guided by their agenda of radical Islamist understanding. The excesses of the fundamentalist regime were evident when the Taliban proceeded with the destruction of the colossal statues of the Buddhas of the Bamiyan valley that had been standing there since the 2nd-4th century CE. This was despite massive opposition at the global level. The Taliban had attacked and destroyed artefacts kept in National Museum at Kabul, and several archaeological remains of the Buddhist Monastery sites such as Hadda, where the statue of Kushan emperor Kanishka reigned in this region during the 1st century CE, was destroyed. The first phase of the Taliban regime was primarily guided by its mono-cultural understanding of Afghan culture and considered the pre-Islamic Buddhist artefacts do not belong to Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. Taliban 2.0 and its pragmatic Approach The experience of the first phase of the Taliban policies towards cultural heritage brought a general belief among the people globally that the re-emergence of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan could further destroy its cultural heritage monuments. However, the approach of Taliban 2.0 since 2021 should be perceived differently. Taliban 2.0 is comparatively more prepared, more inclusive of the different ethnic tribal groups, etc., than the previous regime. Taliban 2.0 has recently started negotiations with UNESCO regarding restoring and protecting historical monuments and providing security to the state Museums and archaeological sites like Bamiyan (Bakhtar News Agency, 2023). Taliban 2.0 transcend its fundamentalist mono-cultural idea about cultural heritage and shows a comparatively inclusive approach, particularly towards the pre-Islamic Buddhist heritage of the country. It is argued that the major objective guiding the Taliban state towards this protective approach about the cultural monuments is to gain a sense of acceptance among the global community. Such an image of inclusive Afghanistan could provide them with much-needed international political and financial assistance, which was stopped in August 2021 because the Taliban regime is not yet recognised by any nation and United Nations Organisation (UNO). Global Response Despite the opening of limited diplomatic channels with Pakistan, Russia, Qatar etc., Taliban 2.0 is generally facing international isolation. The Taliban Administration in Afghanistan is continuously trying to get recognition as a legitimate government from the other nations and on the international forums. It is noteworthy that the economy of Afghanistan, even before the Taliban, was primarily based on international assistance, and due to the Taliban's control since August 2021, all such aid/assistance was stopped. Such a condition has broken down Afghanistan's economy. Since then, UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation) has had to work under its planning document for the Transitional Engagement Framework (TEF). This assistance is limited to providing humanitarian support and technical support to the preservation activities due to the non-recognition of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. It is observed that the cultural heritage is again under severe threat of destruction because of negligence and lack of scientific preservation due to halted international financial and technical support. This time, it is not the policy of the Taliban regime but the inaction of the global community responsible for the negligence. The global community must understand that the heritage of Afghanistan is a heritage of humanity whose diverse cultures interacted with each other in the past to develop such art marvels. The policies of Taliban 2.0 should be seen in the larger context as present Afghanistan is not the same as the last Taliban regime (1996-2001). Society and the economy have changed in comparison to the first Taliban regime. People are now more educated, capable, and conscious of their identity. It is also true that the Taliban compromised the democratic principles of the Western world due to its conservative and fundamental understanding of culture. However, the global community should also understand and utilise the changed approach of Taliban 2.0 towards their cultural heritage and be ready to provide security and support to international organisations in the process of preservation of cultural monuments. The cultural heritage monuments can’t wait for long as they are facing not just natural degradation but also illegal exploitation. Such degradation and exploitation would lead to the vanishing of the centuries-old heritage of humanity. International organisations should act proactively and catch the low-hanging fruits by providing financial and technical support despite the non-recognition of the Taliban regime, which Taliban 2.0 is already welcoming. An Opportunity for India India is a growing power not just in the region but globally. India’s policy towards Afghanistan had been guided by soft power and mutual friendship. The re-emergence of the Taliban regime in 2021 brought a break in their friendly relations. The current relationship between India and Afghanistan may be considered a complex one. This is because India has not yet recognised the Taliban regime as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. Still, simultaneously, the diplomatic channels between them are continuous and limited, and the recent meeting of India’s foreign secretary with Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister is a positive sign. Interestingly, the cultural heritage of Afghanistan could be understood as the shared heritage of India, too. The ancient past and history of both these countries are common because both belong to one cultural geography: the Indic civilisation zone, the Sapt Saindhava-Saraswati civilisation, and the Gandhara Buddhism in South Asia. The remains of this shared Buddhist culture of both these countries are spread in Afghanistan, facing the threat of destruction. Therefore, if India decides to support Afghanistan in preserving its cultural heritage, India is indirectly saving its own heritage. India should grab this opportunity to help the people of Afghanistan by providing financial and technical support in the field of cultural heritage preservation in addition to its humanitarian assistance, which India is currently providing to Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5f_IMdCVDzTh	2025-01-11T16:45:49-08:00	
Government Spending Will Cause The Next Financial Crisis – OpEd	By Daniel Lacalle Crises are never caused by building excessive exposure to high-risk assets. Crises can only happen when investors, government bodies, and households accumulate risk in assets where most believe there is little to no risk. The 2008 crisis did not occur due to subprime mortgages. Those were the tips of the iceberg. Moreover, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, state-owned entities, guaranteed the subprime mortgage packages, which prompted numerous investors and banks to invest in them. Nobody can anticipate a crisis stemming from the potential decline in the Nvidia share price or the value of Bitcoin. In fact, if the 2008 crisis had been created by subprime mortgages, it would have been absorbed and offset in less than two weeks. The only asset that can really create a crisis is the part of banks’ balance sheets that is considered 'no risk' and, as such, requires no capital to finance their holdings: government bonds. When the price of sovereign bonds swiftly declines, the banks’ balance sheet rapidly shrinks. Even if central banks conduct quantitative easing, the spillover effect on other assets leads to the abrupt destruction of the money base and lending. The collapse in the price of the allegedly safest asset, government bonds, comes when investors must sell their existing holdings and fail to purchase the new supply issued by the states. Persistent inflation consumes the real returns of previously purchased bonds, leading to the emergence of evident solvency problems. In summary, a financial crisis serves as evidence of the state’s insolvency. When the lowest-risk asset abruptly loses value, the entire asset base of commercial banks dissolves and falls faster than the ability to issue shares or bank bonds. In fact, banks are unable to increase capital or add debt due to the declining demand for sovereign bonds, as banks are perceived as a leveraged bet on government debt. Banks do not cause financial crises. What creates a crisis is regulation, which always considers lending to governments a 'no-risk,' 'no capital required' investment even when solvency ratios are poor. Because the currency and government debt are inextricably linked, the financial crisis first manifests in the currency, which loses its purchasing power and leads to elevated inflation, and then in sovereign bonds. Keynesianism and the MMT fallacy have driven global public debt to record levels. Furthermore, the burden of unfunded liabilities is even larger than the trillions of dollars of government debt issued. The United States’ unfunded liabilities exceed 600% of GDP, according to the Financial Report of the United States Government, February 2024. In the European Union, according to Eurostat, France and Germany each accumulate unfunded liabilities that exceed 350% of GDP. According to Claudio Borio of the Bank for International Settlements, a government debt glut may cause a bond market correction that could spill over into other assets. Reuters reports that large government budget deficits suggest that sovereign debt could rise by a third by 2028 to approach $130 trillion, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF) financial services trade group. Keynesians always say that public debt does not matter because the government can issue all it needs and has unlimited taxation power. It is simply false. Governments cannot issue all the debt they need to finance their deficit spending. They have three clear limits: The economic limit: Rising public deficits and debt cease to function as purported tools to stimulate economic growth, instead becoming a hindrance to productivity and economic development. Despite this completely false theory, most governments continue to portray themselves as engines of growth. Today, this is more evident than ever before. In the United States, every new dollar of debt brings less than 60 cents of nominal GDP growth. In France, the situation is particularly alarming, as a 6% GDP deficit results in a stagnant economy. The fiscal limit: Rising taxes generate lower-than-expected receipts, and debt continues to rise. Keynesianism believes in government as an engine of growth when it is a burden that does not create wealth and only consumes what has been created by the private sector. When taxes become confiscatory, tax receipts fail to rise, and debt soars regardless. The inflationary limit: more currency printing and government spending creates persistent annualised inflation, making citizens poorer and the real economy weaker. In most developed nations, the three limits have been clearly exceeded, but it seems that no government is willing to reduce its spending, and without spending cuts, there is no debt reduction. Irresponsible governments, forgetting that their role is to administer scarce resources rather than create debt, will trigger the next crisis. Countries like Brazil and India are seeing their currencies plummet due to concerns about the sustainability of public finances and the risk of borrowing more while inflation remains high. The euro has plummeted due to the combination of France’s fiscal woes and bureaucrats’ demands for Germany to increase its deficit spending. As always, the next crisis will be attributed to the final drop that causes the dam to collapse, but it will also be caused—as always—by government debt. Politicians’ lack of concern stems from the fact that taxpayers, families, and businesses will bear the brunt of all the adverse consequences. When the debt crisis arises, Keynesians and astute politicians will argue that the solution demands increased public spending and debt. You and I will pay.

Thirty Years Of The World Trade Organization – OpEd	By Katrina Gulliver This month marks the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the World Trade Organization. The WTO was created as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which had been in place since 1947. GATT was formed as a method of stabilizing and restoring trade after the Second World War. But the global trade landscape had changed dramatically over the succeeding fifty years (not least the development of containerization for international shipping of goods). International trade had expanded massively, and developing nations were becoming manufacturing hubs, keen to export. The WTO was the culmination of years of talks and preparation, reflecting the ambitions of politicians to expand international trade, but also to make sure their own nations got the best deal possible. Its arrival was, however, not welcomed by all. The rounds of talks and summits for the organization’s early years were contentious, both within the discussion rooms and outside the buildings. The third round of discussions in December 1999 in Seattle saw unprecedented protests. Rather than a routine international event, with diplomatic limousines and photo opportunities, there were scenes of chaos outside. These raucous protests would become known in the press as the 'Battle of Seattle'—hardly the image President Bill Clinton had hoped to present to a global audience. Passions were running high inside the meeting too. As the Wall Street Journal reported at the time: Inside the WTO meeting, delegates from developing nations, including Pakistan, India and Brazil, threatened to block a new round of trade talks, refusing to sign any agreement to launch negotiations unless the U.S. and Europe agreed to their demands. Outside the meeting, Seattle police SWAT teams used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber pellets and billy clubs against protesters who blocked access to the WTO meeting, forcing the trade organization to cancel its opening ceremony. Later in the day, about 30,000 labor-union members marched in a display of anti-WTO fervor. Horrified, Seattle Mayor Paul Schell instituted a curfew and called in the National Guard. The protesters had support too: the International Longshore and Warehouse Union held work stoppages at the ports of Seattle, Tacoma, and Oakland. In Seattle, the protesters were supported by a number of NGOs, particularly labor rights and environmental groups, who had planned the protests for months. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) also held a rally. In London, simultaneous action by anti-WTO activists included attacking police, and a train station was shut down. In retrospect, the WTO planners should have seen it coming. Anti-globalist feelings had been building up steam in the 1990s. Two years before the Seattle talks, there had been similar protests at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Vancouver. Anti-WTO sentiment brought together disparate groups, from workers’ rights campaigners and right-wing nationalists to environmentalists (and any number of other hangers-on). It’s a fascinating artifact of that moment in political shifts to see anti-WTO protesters waving the Gadsden Flag. But the WTO was the result of years of working towards liberalizing trade, spurred on further by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. Of course it did not create 'free trade' everywhere (if it had, there would be no need for such an organization to exist). It was there to promote free-er trade, while also allowing members to push for particular national protections. (In a world of truly free trade, there would also be no 'trade talks.') We can be cynical that it is just another talking-shop of rent-seekers, as so many other international agencies seem to be. But it has brought more countries into networks of international markets. In 2001, China would join the WTO, probably the biggest shift in global trade for decades, as Asia became the world’s manufacturing center—a fact that is still causing economic ripples throughout the West. Today, the WTO has 166 members, accounting for 98 percent of world trade. It hasn’t removed the issue of national tariffs, protectionism, or concern about globalization (from all political angles). An ongoing sticking point, for example, has been agricultural subsidies in the EU and the USA. But it marks a step in the long road of international trade that started when the first ships headed out in the Classical world, to trade goods around the Mediterranean. Today all of us can buy things produced across the globe: and our daily life is based on this level of access and cooperation. Happy Birthday, WTO.

Wildfires And The Hoary Hoax Of A Burning Planet – OpEd	Here they go again, blaming the wildfire catastrophe in Los Angeles on Climate Change when the actual culprits are the very politicians who never stop howling about what is a monumental hoax. In the first place, of course, the current raging California fires, like those which have periodically gone before, are largely a function of misguided government policies. Officials have essentially curtailed the supply of water available to LA firefighters, even as they have drastically increased the supply of combustible kindling and vegetation which feeds these wildfires. The latter, in turn, are being amplified by the seasonal Santa Ana winds, which have visited the California coast since time immemorial. The kindling at issue stems from forest management policies that prevent the removal of excess fuel via controlled burns, which are fires intentionally set by forest managers to reduce the buildup of hazardous fuels. As we amplify below, red tape and bureaucratic obstacles have frequently delayed or prevented these controlled burns, allowing brush, dead trees, and other flammable materials to accumulate excessively. In this case, state and Federal politicians have simultaneously curtailed the supply of water available to Los Angeles firefighters in order to protect so-called endangered species. Specifically, southern California is being held hostage by sharp curtailment of the water pumping rates from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in order to protect the Delta Smelt and Chinook Salmon. These former are shiny but tiny little buggers, as suggested by the handful of Smelt in the first picture below. But apparently, if they are protected, fished, and then fried up, they make for a certain kind of delicacy. Needless to say, California is entitled to stew in the foolishness of its own policies—if that’s what its voters really want. But its self-imposed misery should not be an occasion for more howling in favor of Washington policies to fight climate change. At least with respect to the latter, the Donald has his head screwed on right. And he does not hesitate to opine on the matter, which is all to the good of balancing what has otherwise been a wholly one-sided and utterly misleading Climate Crisis narrative. Naturally, the latter has been promulgated and peddled by statists because it provides yet one more big, scary, and urgent reason for an 'all of government' campaign of more spending, borrowing, regulating, and the curtailing of free market enterprise and personal liberty. So let us once again review the bogus case for AGW or what is known as Anthropogenic Global Warming. And perforce it must start with the geological and paleontological evidence, which overwhelmingly says that today’s average global temperature of about 15 degrees C and CO2 concentrations of 420 ppm are nothing to fret about. And even if they rise to about 17-18 degrees C and 500-600 ppms, respectively, by the end of the century owing mainly to a natural warming cycle that has been underway since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in 1850, it may well on balance improve the lot of mankind. After all, bursts of civilization during the last 10,000 years uniformly occurred during the warmer red portion of the graph below. The great civilizations of the Yellow, Indus, Nile, and Tigris/Euphrates river valleys, the Minoan era, the Greco-Roman civilization, the Medieval flowering, and the industrial and technological revolutions of the present era all were enabled by periods of elevated temperatures. At the same time, the several lapses into 'dark ages' happened when the climate turned colder (blue). And that’s only logical. When it’s warmer and wetter, growing seasons are longer and crop yields are better—regardless of the agricultural technology and practices of the moment. And it’s better for human and community health, too—most of the deadly plagues of history have occurred under colder climes, such as the Black Death of 1344-1350. Yet the Climate Crisis narrative deep-sixes this massive body of 'the science' by means of two deceptive devices. Without them, the entire AGW story doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on. First, it ignores the entirety of the planet’s pre-Holocene (last 10,000 years) history, even though the science shows that more than 90% of the time in the last 600 million years global temperatures (blue line) and CO2 levels (black line) have been higher than at present; and that 50% of the time they were much higher—with temperatures in the range of 22 degrees C or 50% higher than current levels. That’s far beyond anything projected by the most unhinged climate models today. But, crucially, the planetary climate systems did not go into a doomsday loop of ever increasing temperatures ending in a scorching meltdown. To the contrary, warming epochs were always checked and reversed by powerful countervailing forces. Even the history the alarmists do acknowledge has been grotesquely falsified. As we have demonstrated elsewhere, the so-called 'hockey stick' of the most recent 1,000 years in which temperatures were allegedly flat until 1850 and are now rising to supposedly dangerous levels is a complete crock. It was fraudulently manufactured by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to 'cancel' the fact that temperatures in the pre-industrial world of the Medieval Warm Period (1000-1200 AD) were actually significantly higher than at present. Secondly, it is falsely claimed that global warming is a one-way street in which rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and especially CO2 is causing the earth’s heat balance to continuously increase. The truth, however, is that higher CO2 concentrations are a consequence and byproduct, not a driver and cause, of the current naturally rising (and falling) global temperature cycles. Again, the now 'canceled' history of Planet Earth knocks the CO2-forcing proposition into a cocked hat. During the Cretaceous Period between 145 and 66 million years (third orange panel) ago a natural experiment provided complete absolution for the vilified CO2 molecule. During that period, global temperatures rose dramatically from 17 degrees C to 25 degrees C—a level far above anything today’s Climate Howlers have ever projected. Alas, CO2 wasn’t the culprit. According to the science, ambient CO2 concentrations actually tumbled during the 80 million years expanse of the Cretaceous, dropping from 2,000 ppm to 900 ppm on the eve of the Extinction Event 66 million years ago. So temperature and CO2 concentrations actually moved in the opposite directions. Big time. You would think that this powerful countervailing fact would give the CO2 witch-hunters pause, but that would be to ignore what the whole climate change brouhaha is actually about. That is, it’s not about science, human health, and well-being, or the survival of Planet Earth; it’s about politics and the ceaseless search of politicians and statists for control of modern economic and social life. The resulting aggrandizement of state power, in turn, is mightily assisted by the Beltway political class and the apparatchiks and racketeers who gain power and pelf from the anti-fossil fuels campaign. Indeed, the Climate Crisis narrative is the kind of ritualized policy mantra that has been concocted over and again by the political class and the permanent nomenklatura of the modern state—professors, think-tankers, lobbyists, career apparatchiks, officialdom—in order to gather and exercise state power. To paraphrase the great Randolph Bourne, inventing purported failings of capitalism—such as a propensity to burn too much hydrocarbon—is the health of the state. Indeed, fabrication of false problems and threats that purportedly can only be solved by heavy-handed state intervention has become the modus operandi of a political class that has usurped near complete control of modern democracy. So doing, however, the career political class and associated ruling elites have gotten used to such unimpeded success that they have become sloppy, superficial, careless, and dishonest. For instance, the minute we get a summer heat wave or an event like the current LA fires these natural weather events are jammed into the global warming narrative with nary a second thought by the lip-syncing journalists of the MSM. Yet there is absolutely no scientific basis for all this tom-tom beating. For instance, on the related issue of heat waves and dry period wildfires, NOAA publishes a heat wave index. The latter is based on extended temperature spikes which last more than 4 days and which would be expected to occur only once every ten years based on the historical data. As is evident from the chart below, the only true heat wave spikes we have had in the last 125 years were during the Dust Bowl heat waves of the 1930s. The frequency of mini-heat wave spikes since 1960 is actually no greater than it was during the 1895-1935 period. Likewise, all it takes is a good Cat 3 hurricane and they are off to the races, gumming loudly about AGW. Of course, this ignores entirely NOAA’s own data as summarized in what is known as the ACE (accumulated cyclone energy) index. This index was first developed by the renowned hurricane expert and Colorado State University professor, William Gray. It uses a calculation of a tropical cyclone’s maximum sustained winds every six hours. The latter is then multiplied by itself to get the index value and accumulated for all storms for all regions to get an index value for the entire year. That’s shown below for the past 170 years (the blue line is the seven-year rolling average). Your editor has an especially high regard for Professor Gray—not the least because he was roundly vilified by the very inexpert, Al Gore. But back in our private equity days, we invested in a Property-Cat company, which was in the super-hazardous business of insuring against the extreme layers of damage caused by very bad hurricanes and earthquakes. So setting the premiums correctly was no trifling business and it was the analytics, long-term databases, and current-year forecasts of Professor Gray upon which our underwriters crucially depended. That is to say, hundreds of billions of insurance cover was then and still is being written with the ACE index as a crucial input. Yet if you examine the 7-year rolling average (blue line) in the chart, it is evident that ACE was as high (or higher) in the 1950s and 1960s as it is today, and that the same was true of the late 1930s and the 1880-1900 periods. To be sure, the blue line is not flat as a board because there are natural short-term cycles, as amplified below, which drive the fluctuations shown in the chart. But there is no 'science' extractable from the chart that supports the alleged linkage between the current natural warming cycle and worsening hurricanes. The above is an aggregate index of all storms and is therefore as comprehensive a measure as exists. But for want of doubt, the next three panels look at hurricane data at the individual storm count level. The pink portion of the bars represent the number of big, dangerous Cat 3-5 storms, while the red portion reflects the number of lesser Cat 1-2 storms and the blue area the number of tropical storms that did not reach Cat 1 intensity. The bars accumulate the number of storms in 5-year intervals and reflect recorded activity back to 1851. The reason we present three panels—for the Eastern Caribbean, Western Caribbean, and Bahamas/Turks and Caicos, respectively, is that the trends in these three sub-regions clearly diverge. And that’s actually the smoking gun. If global warming was generating more hurricanes as the MSM constantly maintains, the increase would be uniform across all of these sub-regions, but it’s clearly not. Since the year 2000, for example, The Eastern Caribbean has had a modest increase in both tropical storms and higher rated Cats relative to most of the past 170 years; The Western Caribbean has not been unusual at all, and, in fact, has been well below the higher counts during the 1880-1920 period; The Bahamas/Turks and Caicos region since 2000 has actually been well weaker than during 1930-1960 and 1880-1900. The actual truth of the matter is that Atlantic hurricane activity is generated by atmospheric and ocean temperature conditions in the eastern Atlantic and North Africa. Those forces, in turn, are heavily influenced by the presence of an El Nino or La Nina in the Pacific Ocean. El Niño events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less favorable environment for hurricane formation and decreasing tropical storm activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Niña causes an increase in hurricane activity due to a decrease in wind shear. These Pacific Ocean events, of course, have never been correlated with the low level of natural global warming now underway. The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may also undergo a 50–70-year cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Again, these cycles are unrelated to global warming trends since 1850. Still, scientists have reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century (@1700) and found five periods with elevated hurricane activity averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years each; and six other more quiescent periods averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years each. These periods are associated with a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance, which is responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year, and clearly not a product of AGW. Moreover, like in so many other cases the very long-term records of storm activity also rule out AGW because there was none for most of the time during the last 3,000 years, for instance. Yet according to a proxy record for that period from coastal lake sediments on Cape Cod, hurricane activity has increased significantly during the last 500-1,000 years versus earlier periods–but even that increase happened long before temperatures and carbon concentrations reached 20th-century levels. In short, there is no reason to believe that these well understood precursor conditions and longer-term hurricane trends have been impacted by the modest increase in average global temperatures since the LIA ended in 1850. As it happens, the same story is true with respect to wildfires like the current LA inferno. This has been the third category of natural disaster that the Climate Howlers have glommed onto. But in this case it’s the aforementioned bad forestry management, not man-made global warming, which has turned much of California into a dry wood fuel dump. And don’t take our word for it. This quotation below comes from the George Soros-funded Pro Publica, which is not exactly a right-wing tin foil hat outfit. It points out that environmentalists have so shackled Federal and state forest management agencies that today’s tiny 'controlled burns' are but an infinitesimal fraction of what Mother Nature herself accomplished before the helping hand of today’s purportedly enlightened political authorities arrived on the scene: Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change. We live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres — an area about the size of Maine — to restabilize in terms of fire. In short, if you don’t clear and burn out the deadwood, you build up nature-defying tinderboxes that then require only a lightning strike, a spark from an unrepaired power line, or human carelessness to ignite into a raging inferno. As one 40-year conservationist and expert summarized, …There’s only one solution, the one we know yet still avoid. 'We need to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load.' The failure to do just such controlled burns is exactly what is behind the LA wildfire today. That is, a dramatically larger human footprint in the fire-prone shrublands and chaparral (dwarf trees) areas along the coasts has increased the risk residents will start fires, accidentally or otherwise. California’s population doubled from 1970 to 2020, from about 20 million people to nearly 40 million people, and nearly all of the gain was in the coastal areas. Under those conditions, California’s strong, naturally-occurring winds, which crest periodically, as is occurring at the moment, are the main culprit which fuels and spreads the human-set blazes in the shrublands. The Diablo winds in the north of the state and the Santa Ana winds in the south can actually reach hurricane force, as has also been the case this week. As the winds move West over California mountains and down toward the coast, they compress, warm, and intensify. These winds, in turn, blow flames and carry embers, spreading the fires quickly before they can be contained. And on top of that, the Santa Ana winds also function as Mother Nature’s blow dryer. As they come down the mountains toward the sea, the hot winds dry the surface vegetation and deadwood rapidly and powerfully, paving the way for the blowing embers to fuel the spread of wildfires down the slopes. Among other proofs that industrialization and fossil fuels aren’t the culprit is the fact that researchers have shown that when California was occupied by indigenous communities, wildfires would burn up some 4.5 million acres a year. That’s nearly 6X the level experienced during the 2010-2019 period, when wildfires burned an average of just 775,000 acres annually in California. Beyond the untoward clash of all of these natural forces of climate and ecology with misguided government forest and shrubland husbandry policies, there is actually an even more dispositive smoking gun, as it were. To wit, the Climate Howlers have at least not yet embraced the patent absurdity that the planet’s purportedly rising temperatures have targeted the Blue State of California for special punishment. Yet when we look at the data for forest fires we find, alas, that unlike California and Oregon, the US as a whole experienced the weakest fire years in 2020 since 2010. That’s right. As of August 24 each year, the 10-year average burn had been 5.114 million acres across the US, but in 2020 it was 28% lower at 3.714 million acres. National fire data year to date: Indeed, what the above chart shows is that on a national basis there has been no worsening trend at all during the decade ending in 2020, just huge oscillations year-to-year driven not by some grand planetary heat vector but by changing local weather and ecological conditions. You just can’t go from 2.7 million burned acres in 2010 to 7.2 million acres in 2012, back to 2.7 million acres in 2014, then to 6.7 million acres in 2017, followed by just 3.7 million acres in 2020—and still argue along with the Climate Howlers that the planet is angry. To the contrary, the only real trend evident is that on a decadal basis during recent times there is just one place where the average forest fire acreage has been slowly rising—California! But that’s owing to the above described dismal failure of government forest management policies. Even then, California’s mildly rising average fire acreage trend since 1950 is a rounding error compared to the annual averages from prehistoric times, which were nearly 6X greater than during the most recent decade. Furthermore, the gently rising trend since 1950, as shown below, should not be confused with the Climate Howlers’ bogus claim that California’s fires have 'grown more apocalyptic every year,' as the New York Times reported. In fact, the NYT was comparing the above average burn during 2020 versus that of 2019, which saw an unusually small amount of acreage burned. That is, just 280,000 acres in 2019 compared to 1.3 million and 1.6 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 775,000 on average over the last decade. Nor is this lack of correlation with global warming just a California and US phenomena. As shown in the chart below, the global extent of fire-causing drought, measured by five levels of severity with dark brown being the most extreme, has shown no worsening trend at all during the past 40 years. This brings us to the gravamen of the case. To wit, there is no angry weather signal of impending climate crisis whatsoever. But the AGW hoax has so thoroughly contaminated the mainstream narrative and the policy apparatus in Washington and capitals all around the world that contemporary society was fixing to commit economic Hara Kari—well, until Donald Trump came along vowing to pull the entire Team America off the playing field of global green nonsense. And for damn good reason. In contradistinction to the phony case that the rise of fossil fuel use after 1850 has caused the planetary climate system to become unglued, there has been a sharp acceleration of global economic growth and human well-being. And one essential element behind that salutary development has been the massive increase in the use of cheap fossil fuels to power economic life. The chart below could not be more dispositive. During the pre-industrial era between 1500 and 1870, global real GDP crawled along at just 0.41% per annum. By contrast, during the past 150 years of the fossil fuel age global GDP growth accelerated to 2.82% per annum–or nearly 7 times faster. This higher growth, of course, in part resulted from a larger and far healthier global population made possible by rising living standards. Yet it wasn’t human muscle alone that caused the GDP level to go parabolic as per the chart below. It was also due to the fantastic mobilization of intellectual capital and technology. And one of the most important vectors of the latter was the ingenuity of the fossil fuel industry in unlocking the massive trove of stored work that Mother Nature extracted, condensed, and salted away from the incoming solar energy over the long warmer and wetter eons of the past 600 million years. Needless to say, the curve of world energy consumption tightly matches the rise of global GDP shown above. Thus, in 1860 global energy consumption amounted to 30 exajoules per year and virtually 100% of that was represented by the blue layer labeled 'bio-fuels,' which is just a polite name for firewood and the decimation of the forests which it entailed. Since then, annual energy consumption has increased 18-fold to 550 exajoules (@100 billion barrels of oil equivalent), but 90% of that gain was due to natural gas, coal, and petroleum. The modern world and today’s prosperous global economy would simply not exist absent the massive increase in the use of these efficient fuels, meaning that per capita income and living standards would otherwise be only a small fraction of current levels. Yes, that dramatic increase in prosperity-generating fossil fuel consumption has given rise to a commensurate increase in CO2 emissions. But as we have indicated, and contrary to the Climate Crisis narrative, CO2 is not a pollutant! As we have seen, the correlated increase in CO2 concentrations—from about 290 ppm to 415 ppm since 1850—amounts to a rounding error in both the long trend of history and in terms of atmospheric loadings from natural sources. As to the former, CO2 concentrations of less than 1000 ppm are only recent developments of the last ice age, while during prior geologic ages concentrations reached as high as 2400 ppm. Likewise, the oceans contain an estimated 37,400 billion tons of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2,000-3,000 billion tons, and the atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 or 20X more than current fossil emissions shown below. Of course, the opposite side of the equation is that oceans, land, and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously so the incremental loadings from human sources is very small. More importantly, even a small shift in the balance between oceans and the atmosphere would cause a much more severe rise/fall in CO2 concentrations than anything attributable to human activity. But since the Climate Howlers falsely postulate that the pre-industrial level of 290 parts per million was extant since the Big Bang and that the modest rise since 1850 is a one-way ticket to boiling the planet alive, they obsess over the 'sources versus sinks' balance in the carbon cycle for no valid reason whatsoever. Actually, the continuously shifting carbon balance of the planet over any reasonable period of time is a big, so what!

Reimagining State Structures In Bangladesh: A Critical Examinatio...	This article examines Bangladesh Nationalist Party's '31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms' through a critical analysis of its proposed democratic transformation agenda. Through systematic examination of the reform proposals, the study explores how these recommendations seek to reconstruct state-society relations, strengthen democratic institutions, and address deep-rooted governance challenges in Bangladesh. The analysis reveals that whilst the Outline presents an ambitious vision for institutional reorganisation—encompassing electoral reforms, judicial autonomy, economic justice, and minority rights—its efficacy ultimately depends on navigating entrenched power structures and institutional inertia. Drawing upon democratic theory and institutional analysis, this research demonstrates that successful implementation requires more than legislative amendments; it necessitates fundamental shifts in political culture, robust accountability mechanisms, and sustained civic engagement. The findings suggest that bridging the gap between reformist aspirations and practical implementation demands careful attention to resource allocation, cross-party consensus building, and the empowerment of historically marginalised groups. This study contributes to scholarly discussions on democratic transformation in developing nations by highlighting the complex interplay between formal institutional reforms and informal power dynamics that shape their implementation. Bangladesh's political landscape has long been shaped by the tension between top-down authority, recurrent electoral disputes, and a populace calling for more democratic accountability. In this context, a document referred to as the '31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms in Bangladesh,' purportedly issued by a major political party, maps a broad agenda for reconfiguring governance, upholding human rights, promoting socio-economic equity, and nurturing a more participatory public sphere. By addressing varied domains—from the consolidation of caretaker governance and constitutional checks to environmental stewardship and economic reorientation—the proposals collectively aim to reset the relationship between the state and its citizens, symbolically transferring the 'lost ownership' of the country back to the people. Yet no reform blueprint can be analysed solely at the level of policy prescriptions. The dynamics of institutional inertia, political culture, economic inequalities, and local power structures profoundly influence whether proclaimed reforms translate into substantive transformations. An in-depth reading of these proposals, therefore, benefits from an array of conceptual perspectives, each illuminating certain dimensions of power, discourse, social justice, or capacity-building. This article critically scrutinises each cluster of recommendations in the Outline—exploring how they might reconfigure the balance of authority, the mechanisms of accountability, and the possibilities for public autonomy. It also highlights structural constraints that might undermine or distort these measures, emphasising the challenges of bridging ideals and entrenched practices. The Context and Ambitions of Reform The Outline was formulated against a background of polarised competition, controversies over voting processes, allegations of widespread corruption, and prevalent concerns about the accountability of state agencies. It enumerates a vision for robust democratic institutions, from caretaker election bodies (Points 3, 8) to stricter limitations on prime ministerial terms (Point 5), a reformed judiciary (Points 9, 10), and local governments free of central overreach (Point 21). The document's impetus for a 'public-welfare government of national consensus' underscores a rhetorical commitment to pluralism and dialogue. However, the structural depth of these proposals varies. Some points focus on constitutional mechanics—such as the reintroduction of referendums or the creation of a second legislative chamber (Point 6)—while others advocate socio-economic reforms, including fair wages for workers (Point 17), universal healthcare (Point 26), and an equitable approach to agricultural markets (Point 27). Additional priorities encompass media freedom (Point 12), respect for minority rights (Point 16), and the eradication of extrajudicial violence (Point 14). By weaving these strands together, the Outline signals a comprehensive attempt to redefine both the architecture of the state and the ethos underpinning its relationship to society. The critical question is whether these intentions can overcome historical tendencies: the concentration of power in a dominant executive, the partisan capture of institutions, deep-rooted hierarchies, and a tradition in which opposing factions often equate governance with partisan consolidation. Any thorough critique requires attention to the tension between rhetorical declarations of radical change and the pragmatic complexities of real politics. Public Dialogue, Communicative Spaces, and Unity A key dimension in democratic theory highlights the importance of an open public sphere that fosters transparent debates and inclusive discourse. Various points in the Outline recognise that social and political polarisation in Bangladesh has compromised open dialogue. The impetus for media liberalisation and the establishment of an independent commission (Point 12) attests to an understanding that free expression and investigative journalism can serve as bulwarks against authoritarian or oligarchic impulses. However, dismantling prior constraints on freedom of expression necessitates more than simply repealing oppressive laws; it demands a systematic cultural shift whereby critical commentary—by journalists, civil society, or opposition figures—is protected both in law and practice. Without robust legal remedies, accountability measures, and the consistent removal of intimidation or violence from the media realm, commissions risk becoming merely ornamental. Equally, references to forging a 'Rainbow Nation' (Point 2) exemplify an ambition to unite diverse ideological, cultural, and religious communities under a reconciliatory ethos. While symbolically appealing, ensuring that different segments of society truly feel recognised and secure in sharing their perspectives demands explicit institutional frameworks—inter-party dialogues, community-based deliberative councils, and impartial adjudication bodies—to replace zero-sum partisanship with a culture of trustful engagement. Thus, if the goal is to reconstitute an environment in which wide-ranging debate flourishes, the success of these measures depends on thorough, practical safeguards. A society historically burdened by repressive or polarised governance structures will not spontaneously shift towards authentic communication. Instead, new policies must root themselves in deeper public education, the introduction of transparent licensing regimes or ownership regulations that prevent monopolistic control of media, and reliable protection against targeted harassment. Power Dynamics, Law Enforcement, and Administrative Reform Another interpretive lens focuses on the hidden interplay of power within institutions, especially in contexts where undisclosed or coercive practices permeate the state's dealings with citizens. Indeed, the Outline directly addresses forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and alleged partisan manipulation of law enforcement agencies (Points 14, 8, 11). It calls for a reorientation that eschews such brutality, expands merit-based recruitment, and establishes impartial oversight commissions. But rhetorical condemnations of state violence are insufficient unless states undertake a fundamental reorganisation of security forces, intelligence units, and paramilitary powers. Institutional cultures that normalise intimidation or extra-legal operations can remain entrenched even if certain laws or directives are rescinded. Achieving meaningful progress means codifying strict procedures, requiring transparent reporting, penalising wrongdoing with seriousness, and ensuring that officials or military personnel implicated in prior abuses face judicial scrutiny. Only with credible accountability will the structural reliance on fear-based control begin to ebb. Administrative reforms, similarly, may remove direct political appointments, as the Outline proposes (Point 21), but if local functionaries, bureaucrats, or military leaders remain embedded within influential networks, the distribution of appointments and promotions could still follow patterns of patronage. Internal reorganisation that fosters a genuine ethic of public service, governed by competence and monitored through independent review, is pivotal. Such transformations often entail protracted battles with factional or personal interests for whom existing structures deliver power and resource benefits. Socio-Economic Capacity and Equitable Outcomes A broader perspective on development underscores that viable democracy and the exercise of public freedoms depend on underlying socio-economic conditions. The text's pledges to empower workers, create unemployment allowances, expand healthcare, and invest in agricultural livelihoods (Points 17, 23, 26, 27) reflect an understanding that political participation and personal dignity are undermined by extreme inequality, impoverishment, and precarious labour arrangements. By emphasising fair wages, child labour elimination, and robust healthcare, the Outline hints at bridging the gap between rhetorical emphasis on democratic ideals and the tangible means by which citizens can engage public life. However, implementing universal coverage in health or comprehensive worker safeguards requires sustainable financing, legislative backing, and cultural acceptance of reformed labour standards. Without an effective administrative apparatus for distribution—unbiased, transparent, and immune to patronage—these socio-economic promises might result in sporadic or politicised allocations. Political elites may resist channelling resources toward large-scale social spending that does not align with immediate electoral incentives. Additionally, the breadth of reforms demanded—covering health, agriculture, energy, and more—calls for long-term strategic planning, cross-party consensus, and institutional stability that can survive electoral cycles. Revisiting Identity, Minorities, and Inclusion While broad statements about reconciling divisions appear in multiple sections, two aspects stand out: the vow to protect minority communities and the focus on women's empowerment. The document commits to upholding the rights of ethnic and religious groups, protecting their assets from seizure or forced occupation (Point 16), and ensuring that women gain stronger representation in governance and national building (Point 24). These measures align with a perspective that any legitimate democratic transformation requires substantive recognition of historical injustices and the inclusion of marginalised groups in policy decisions. Yet rhetorical support for minority or female participation only gains traction if anchored in well-defined statutory frameworks and budgetary commitments. For minority protections to transcend tokenism, legal processes must be transparent, swift, and accessible, enabling redress whenever discrimination arises. Women's political representation, likewise, must go beyond seat reservations or rhetorical commitments; parties need to integrate women systematically into leadership structures, candidate selection, and the broader workings of policymaking committees. Without persistent vigilance—through dedicated commissions, civil society networks, and the empowerment of local communities—dominant groups might revert to established patterns of exclusion and paternalistic control. Constitutional and Electoral Architecture A central thrust of the Outline is restructuring how Bangladesh governs itself at the highest levels. The caretaker government approach to elections, the call for an independent Election Commission, the creation of a second legislative chamber, and constraints on the prime minister's tenure (Points 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) collectively underscore an ambition to prevent hyper-centralised authority and to foster balanced power-sharing. Historically, in contexts where a single party dominates or where the executive exerts overwhelming control, elections often fall under suspicion of partiality, and legislative independence remains symbolic at best. Revising these architectural pillars may indeed mitigate the risks of electoral manipulations or indefinite power accumulation. Still, merely codifying caretaker mechanisms or legislative bicameralism does not guarantee impartial practice. Powerful individuals might continue to sway caretaker arrangements, or legislatures could remain gridlocked along partisan lines. In many countries, second chambers have struggled to deliver the intended benefits of expertise and balanced representation, sometimes turning into elite clubs unresponsive to grassroots voices. The measure's success depends on how membership is chosen, how jurisdiction is assigned, and whether processes are transparent, with broad civic engagement. If these structural changes proceed in a vacuum, divorced from a deeper reformation of party culture or grassroots empowerment, they could replicate the same patterns of centralised, partisan politics in new institutional forms. Transforming Public Expression and Media Freedoms Another prominent motif in the Outline calls for robust press liberties, a repeal of draconian laws controlling expression, and the creation of an independent body to oversee media standards (Point 12). This emphasis acknowledges that any democracy reliant solely on cyclical elections, without sustained public scrutiny and critique, risks sliding into majoritarian or authoritarian habits. By guaranteeing open avenues for critique, investigative reporting, and editorial independence, the proposals gesture towards a more dynamic public sphere. However, reconfiguring the legislative environment around free speech does not alone ensure that journalists, authors, or opposition activists will feel safe. Media owners and corporate interests often coalesce with political actors, shaping editorial lines. Legislative changes must therefore be accompanied by cultural acceptance that invests in the principle of media neutrality, fosters training for journalists, and penalises intimidation from powerful elites. Equally, a commission formed to champion press freedom must be shielded from infiltration by those whose tacit interest is to preserve manipulative or hegemonic media narratives. Law, Accountability, and Judicial Autonomy The Outline frequently stresses the importance of establishing an independent judiciary, reintroducing a mechanism for judicial oversight, and guaranteeing that appointments are free from partisan manipulation (Points 9, 10). It also proposes new disciplinary frameworks for sub-ordinate courts, emphasising that legal independence is constitutionally mandated. Cultivating a strong, impartial judiciary is fundamental to enforcing the broad array of reforms described—otherwise, the entire enterprise of caretaker governance, anti-corruption drives, and human rights protection could dissolve into rhetorical posturing. Even so, forging autonomy for the bench typically contends with tradition-laden practices of clientelistic judicial appointments and a reluctance to investigate alleged misconduct among judges. A reformed judicial system necessitates a broader cultural transformation in which legal professionals themselves, along with political actors, internalise the principle that justice must not be a function of patronage or intimidation. Absent a holistic approach—one linking legislative changes with professional codes, an ethics commission, and transparent procedures for selection, promotion, and discipline—the proposed independence can be undermined by intangible yet powerful influences. Economic Reforms, Environmental Stewardship, and National Resources Large sections of the Outline go beyond governance or electoral matters, delving into economic restructuring: bridging wealth divides, boosting investment, supporting local agriculture and industry, and halting questionable energy sector deals (Points 15, 17, 18, 27). The approach suggests that democracy cannot thrive unless socio-economic disparities are tackled at scale, be that through fair commodity pricing, strong labour laws, or integrated 'Economic Reforms Commissions.' The Outline also references the environment, climate challenges, and resource management (Points 29, 18), acknowledging that ecological well-being intersects intimately with human development. While this broad scope is laudable, its success depends on addressing longstanding complexities. Eliminating corruption in power purchase arrangements or awarding transparent investment incentives means confronting entrenched ties between business elites and government officials. Similarly, bridging regional infrastructure gaps or fostering agro-processing industries requires multi-year investment plans, with consistent policy even through electoral transitions—something difficult to sustain where partisan competition frequently leads to abrupt policy reversals. The proposed shift to 'renewable and mixed energy-based power generation' also calls for capital, technology transfers, and capacity-building for energy governance agencies. Rhetorically, it might be straightforward to declare the termination of 'anti-people quick rental power plants,' but actual implementation involves negotiations with foreign investors, potential legal disputes, and recalibrated national budgets. State-Society Engagement and Local Empowerment Another dimension of the Outline addresses decentralisation (Points 21, 22), the strengthening of local bodies, and new ways of recognising the contributions of diverse societal groups, including participants in the liberation war (Point 22). By devolving power from the centre and providing local councils with budgetary authority and legislative autonomy, the proposals seek to make governance more responsive and less prone to top-down dictates. However, effectively transferring these competencies means reconfiguring intergovernmental relations so that local units can raise revenue, manage service delivery, and maintain accountability to citizens, free from intrusive influence by national or administrative officials. Achieving such a shift also depends on local capacity—do these councils have technically skilled staff, robust accounting, and a measure of independence in policy decisions? If national authorities reserve the right to remove local representatives or appoint administrators in any vaguely defined 'emergency,' the stated principle of local empowerment might be hollow. Additionally, the success of local government reforms depends on bridging the gap between the declared principle of non-partisanship and the reality that local elections in Bangladesh, as in many contexts, can be heavily shaped by national-level party allegiances. Intersections of Justice and Representation Provisions concerning transitional justice (Point 14), anti-corruption measures (Point 13), or widespread structural changes in the judicial, administrative, and security spheres converge around a broader question: how do these proposals address the deep-seated injustices that have accumulated over decades? While the Outline frequently cites removing draconian laws and punishing those who misused power, the continuum from violations to institutional complicity is not straightforwardly undone by prospective statutes. Genuine accountability demands official truth-gathering, transparent legal proceedings, an opportunity for public testimonies, and a shift in the social norms that legitimated or tolerated abuses. The mention of a 'white paper' on corruption or an 'Ombudsman' under the constitution indicates a recognition of the severity of wrongdoing. Implementation, however, could be stifled if the political elites, facing allegations themselves, stifle or sabotage these processes. Without an overarching supportive context, including independent prosecutors and non-partisan investigative agencies, the impetus for accountability can collapse into partial or selective prosecutions used against political foes. Meanwhile, the Outline's endeavour to incorporate women more deeply in national building (Point 24) and protect religious or ethnic minorities (Point 16) resonates with the concept of justice that emphasises redistribution, recognition of difference, and inclusive representation. Yet ensuring that historically excluded groups have a consistent voice in shaping, monitoring, and revising reforms is essential if these points are to transcend rhetorical solidarity. For example, nominal seats allocated to women in local councils might not suffice if patriarchal norms remain embedded in the operational culture. Similarly, rhetorical condemnation of attacks on minorities means little if local law enforcement or judicial structures fail to proactively prevent harassment or land dispossession. Routes to Legitimate and Sustainable Change After evaluating these proposals through various conceptual vantage points, a consistent thread emerges: structural reforms can only thrive if they incorporate enforceable mechanisms that involve the wider society, uproot underlying power asymmetries, and garner a cross-party consensus that outlives electoral cycles. Each domain—the caretaker government, media freedom, judicial independence, economic distribution, local government empowerment—requires stable processes and well-defined accountability structures. Equally, each reform calls for a shift in the political culture, so that the impetus for openness and fairness is institutionalised rather than fleetingly invoked. A second crucial element is resource allocation. Significant expansions in welfare (healthcare, education, or unemployment allowances), infrastructure (roads, ports), or environmental protection (climate resilience, pollution control) demand robust state capacities and consistent fiscal commitments. The Outline references the reallocation of budget percentages to these sectors, but these must be tied to frameworks that reduce corruption, streamline public procurement, and ensure that distribution is needs-based rather than patronage-based. Lastly, real empowerment requires that these processes remain transparent and inclusive. Partnerships with civil society, labour movements, grassroots activists, minority associations, and women's networks can anchor the proposed commissions and oversight bodies in local realities. By embedding strong channels for grievance redress and civic engagement, the reformed structures might stand a greater chance of fulfilling the promise of returning 'lost ownership' to citizens. Absent robust participation and institutional design, top-down reforms risk replicating the paternalistic power they seek to replace. Conclusion The 31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms in Bangladesh articulates an extensive project that spans political, legal, economic, and social arenas, ostensibly aiming to rectify longstanding imbalances and rebuild trust between the government and its people. By explicitly championing caretaker governance, credible elections, accountability for extrajudicial abuses, a freer media environment, and more equitable socio-economic measures, the document reveals a vision for an overhauled system that invests new impetus into rights, transparency, and shared prosperity. However, bridging grand declarations and entrenched political conditions is never straightforward. On the one hand, the Outline's holistic approach—combining institutional reorganisation, human rights provisions, social investment, and anti-corruption commitments—holds the potential to address the multifaceted nature of democratic decline. On the other hand, each proposal stands vulnerable to resistance from vested interests, historical bureaucratic inertia, local power elites, or ingrained partisan antagonisms. The rhetoric of transformation thus demands scrupulous policy frameworks that detail how these commissions, committees, and new laws will be staffed, how they will secure independence, and how they will be protected from co-optation or intimidation. One of the Outline's strengths lies in its repeated mention of participation: from local government empowerment to media freedom, from caretaker elections to new legislative structures, it repeatedly asserts that the people's voices and welfare are central. The transformative potential of such a blueprint will hinge on whether these commitments translate into genuine, democratically governed institutions and transparent, rule-bound processes. If so, Bangladesh might indeed advance towards a reimagined state architecture that fosters participation, confronts privileges, and broadens socio-economic opportunities. If not, the pages of this Outline may join the historical record of ambitious but unrealised reform agendas. It is precisely this juncture—between aspiration and feasibility—that necessitates the forging of consensus across political divides, long-term financial planning, and serious cultural shifts in governance norms. The finishing point to 'hand over the lost ownership of the country back to the people' becomes more than a slogan only if the intricacies of policy, enforcement, and civic engagement genuinely amplify the public's ability to shape their destiny. The next steps thus involve translating these proposals into binding legislation, codifying them in institutional charters, and subjecting them to ongoing democratic oversight. Only through such thorough and sustained follow-up might the vision of structural change achieve its stated mission, inaugurating a future of inclusive democracy and accountable governance in Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5TXUzSm7OO-v	2025-01-11T16:01:06-08:00	
Downsized DOGE – OpEd	Elon Musk stirred up much hope among many small government advocates when he spoke on stage at Donald Trump’s October 27 presidential campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Musk declared then his expectation that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk would go on to run with Vivek Ramaswamy, would reduce yearly United States government spending by 'at least two trillion dollars.' This week, Musk let those small government advocates down, reducing by more than half the spending cuts he predicts DOGE will accomplish. On Wednesday, Musk stated in an interview with host Mark Penn at X that cuts reaching two trillion dollars is now 'like the best-case outcome' and that there is just a 'good shot' at achieving a one trillion dollars reduction in yearly spending. That’s how much expectations have been lowered before Trump is even sworn in as president later this month. A year from now, will Musk have downsized the expected achievement of DOGE so much that he will have given up on projecting any spending reduction? Will he then be talking about how DOGE can limit the increasing of US government spending?

Mercurial Trump’s Gamble In Term 2.0 – Analysis	President-elect Donald Trump is already making news even before assuming the presidency. This is not surprising because he is known for his mercurial and unpredictable stances on many global as well as bilateral issues. Trump has already indicated that he would revisit many of the international agreements that are not serving America’s interests. He has also threatened to increase tariffs in imports from many countries that are against America’s economic interests. Such tough decisions could damage America’s relations with its trading partners. But that is Trump for the world to understand and learn to deal with. Even before taking office on January 20, Trump has threatened to seize the Panama Canal, revived calls to buy Greenland and even joked about annexing Canada, leaving the world guessing once again whether he is serious or not. Experts opine that Trump’s rhetoric could be a ‘message’ for China, which has increased its influence in Latin America and the Arctic. By such pronouncements, Trump even before returning to the Oval office has challenged the sovereignty of some of America’s closest allies, thereby underscoring his credentials as global disrupter-in-chief. Analysts have begun to interpret that Trump would be harsher on US friends than on the adversaries like Russia and China. Greenland issue Trump has floated the idea of the US buying the vast strategic island Greenland, a Danish territory, which he also had stated during his first term in office. Now he repeated the idea when naming PayPal co-founder Ken Howery as his ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark and said 'ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity' for US national security. Even when Howery said he would work to deepen the bonds between the US, Denmark and Greenland, Trump was rebuffed when Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede answered that the resource-rich island was 'not for sale'. Howery was an ambassador to Sweden from 2019 to 2021, under Trump’s first administration. Trump’s proposal to buy Greenland in 2019 had triggered tensions between the US and Denmark. That time Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen too had described Trump’s proposal as absurd and made it clear Greenland was not for sale. There are other considerations behind Trump’s temptation to grab Greenland. Like other resources, such as copper of which Greenland has plenty, countries should be able to transact land, and Trump reasons his stance based on international norms on free and fair terms. In any such land transaction, the consent of the peoples is a must. With a positive intent, such transactions could make the world more peaceable, prosperous and habitable for more of humanity. There are several critical raw materials Europe needs for its industries and the green transition can be found in Greenland. In 2023, EU signed an MoU with Greenland to develop sustainable raw materials value chains. Greenland also has large deposits of rare earth metals key to the production of energy transition tech and batteries. Trump is clearly eyeing on these. At this point Denmark is not willing to make a sale. But it is not like Greenland had been theirs from time immemorial. European invaders occupied many parts of the world and claimed as their own over time. Likewise, when Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the US, the uncivilized tribes were too handed over as objects. Similarly when Napoleon sold Louisiana, he was not concerned about the local population either. But things are perceived and seen differently in the present times. Trump can have his ways if the majority of the Greenland population of which 96 per cent are Inuit endorse such an idea. A transaction in such a way shall be perfectly legitimate in international law. Here, there are some similarity in what Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pursuing and what Trump intends to do. In principle, both are expansionists. While Xi has been doing in total disregard of international law and under duress of threat of use of force, Trump has just floated his ideas which he wants to pursue through diplomacy. Even before assuming the presidency, Trump sent his son to Greenland to sell the idea of Greenland being a part of the US. But the people of Greenland scoffed at the proposal 'Greenland is not for sale and will never be for sale'. While Xi’s long term goal is to restore China’s status of what it was once the Middle Kingdom, Trump seeks a ‘Greater America’ in his pursuit of ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) goal. The MAGA is a geographical and cartographic entity that began to take shape after Trump urged Canada to merge with the US and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark. Panama Canal Issue But what grabbed the headline was Trump’s remarks on Panama when he slammed what he called unfair fees for US ships passing through and threatened to demand control of the Panama Canal be returned to Washington. Trump was categorical that if Panama did not agree to hike the fees, the US can have the right to demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the US 'in full, quickly and without question'. When Jimmy Carter was the US President, he and the leader of Panama Omar Torrijos had signed treaties obliging the US to surrender control of the Panama Canal by 1999, settling a longstanding point of friction between the two countries. Carter saw the move as an overdue show of American resolve to deal with the developing nations of the world, the small nations of the world, on the basis of mutual respect and partnership. Conservatives denounced the treaties as a giveaway. Gallup found that 78 per cent of Americans opposed the treaties. Canal was built by the United States in 1914 to link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It was returned to Panama under a 1977 deal. Adding more to this threat, Trump threatened new anti-drug tariffs on ‘day 1’ for China, Canada, Mexico and hinted at China’s growing influence around the canal. Trump also teased neighbouring Canada that it would be a great idea to become the 51st US state – but against a dark backdrop of threatened tariffs. Trump complains that Canada makes almost $100 billion in trade with the US. Trump is also harsh in his comments and treatments of US allies in stark contrast to his repeated praise for the leaders of US foes, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, despite his invasion of Ukraine created international opprobrium. The big question that puzzles is if Trump’s comments on buying Greenland were a subtle message to China, presently America’s biggest adversary. This is because Trump feels that Beijing has been incrementally spreading its influence in Panama. Trump is equally concerned about China’s growing presence in the Arctic and is worried about China’s growing ties with Russia. Trump may be sending a message to Denmark not to be too cosy with China. However, any US plan to 'buy' Greenland would be unfeasible not just in international law but more broadly in the global order that the US has been trying to uphold. The biggest talking point is Trump has not ruled out military or economic action as part of his avowed desire to have the US take back control of the Panama Canal and acquire the Danish territory of Greenland. Canada, America’s 51st state What was most galling about Trump’s statement on Canada becoming as America’s 51st state caught world’s attention. By floating the idea of what could be a ‘Greater America’ by asking Canada to join his country as the 51st state, Trump reasoned that Canadians would ‘save massively on taxes and military protection’ if their country becomes a part of the US. Trump reasoned that the US can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Trump’s taunt was a shocker to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he was in the midst of a crisis sparked by the sudden departure of a minister who was a bulwark against Trump’s plan to start trade wars with his neighbours. Trump’s comments could be light-hearted but Trudeau must be losing his sleep on Trump’s comments. This could have been another trigger, besides others, for him to step down from office. Renaming Gulf of Mexico another MAGA pitch As mentioned before, Trump’s expansionist pitch does not stop with Greenland and Panama Canal. Now his MAGA pitch covers the Gulf of Mexico, which he wants to rename as Gulf of America. Trump forgets that naming of the sea as the Gulf of Mexico predates the formation of the US. The Times of India rightly editorialised thus: 'Grandstanding that borders on the comic has been a part of Trump’s disruptive style aimed at unsettling political rivals.' The editorial further explained: 'This seemingly isolationist policy now seems to be making way for American exceptionalism and expansionism that threatens to redraw boundaries.' It transpires therefore that Trump in his second term will be disruptive for the world in many ways. Future of Ties with India During the Joe Biden administration, India-US relationship grew strong in many fronts, including strategic, defence and economy. There are fears that some of these will be undermined during the Trump 2.0 presidency as Trump has threatened reciprocal tariffs with many countries, including India, with which the US enjoys trade disadvantage. Trump has called India’s tariffs ‘very high’ on the US imports. Broadly, Trump has hinted that US policy during his second term would be isolationistic. Optimists however opine that the India-US relationship built over the past 25 years is now a cornerstone of both nations’ foreign policy agenda. The breadth of cooperation spans defence, trade, energy, technology, education, and counterterrorism. This is not to say that trade and tariffs could pose an immediate challenge under Trump’s renewed leadership. Trump has been critical of what he perceives as imbalances in trade with India, particularly India’s high tariffs and the trade deficit. This was a priority during Trump’s first term and will likely dominate the agenda in the early days of the second term. For Trump, addressing the tariff issue not only with India but with other trading partners with which the US has an imbalance of trade is a priority. He seeks a level of reciprocity. Trump is likely to focus on sectors like energy, where US exports could meet India’s rising demand, and services, where greater collaboration could enhance trade relations. It would be a challenge to India’s policy makers how to deal with Trump and his negotiators so that mutual economic growth remains sustained and mutual understanding on global issues are not hampered.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5SM1cUzeEsby	2025-01-11T15:53:27-08:00	
North Korean Launch Of ‘New’ Missile Fires Up Guam Security Debat...	By Mar-Vic Cagurangan North Korea’s launch of a 'new' intermediate range ballistic missile earlier this week that 'will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific' has fired up debate about the U.S. military’s ability to defend Guam from potential attack. The Asian country’s first major test launch of the year was a 'new' weapon with a hypersonic warhead that flew about 1,000 miles [1,500 kilometers], North Korean state media reported. Last year China launched its first long-range missile in 40-years into the Pacific and the U.S. has conducted several, including its first successful test missile intercept from Guam last month. 'I have full confidence in the readiness and capabilities of our armed forces and the strategic defenses of our island and the region,' local Republican Sen. Jesse Lujan told BenarNews. While acknowledging that Pyongyang’s 'threat is concerning,' Lujan dismissed it as a 'sideshow.' North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un oversaw Monday’s launch. He was quoted by the state-run Korean Central News Agency as hailing the test for putting the 'country's nuclear war deterrent on an advanced basis' with a 'weapon system to which no one can respond.' 'The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The U.S. and its allies denounced North Korea at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday. North Korea responded that it has the right to self-defence against 'nuclear-based' enemies. In 2017, when then U.S. president Donald Trump threatened to bring 'fire and fury' down on North Korea, Pyongyang responded that it was 'carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam.' The U.S. Department of Defense is proposing to build a US$1.8 billion missile defense system on Guam to counter threats from China and North Korea. 'The real focus must remain on preparing for China’s growing influence and capabilities,' Lujan said. 'By strengthening our defenses and alliances to address that challenge, we will inherently be prepared for anything North Korea does.' Located closer to Beijing than Hawaii, the U.S. territory serves as a key strategic asset and is known as the 'tip of the spear' with 10,000 military personnel on the island, a base for F-35 fighters and B-2 bombers and home port for Virginia-class nuclear submarines. Another 5,000 Marines are due to relocate to Guam from Okinawa in Japan starting this year. A local think tank has warned the arms race in the region exposes Guam to the perils of war, but the civilian sector has been left out of security and survival planning. 'The Missile Defense Agency’s proposal for an [Enhanced integrated Air Missile Defense System] in Guam is overstated in its effectiveness and understated in the real and potential damaging repercussions to the Guam community,' Robert Underwood, chair of the Pacific Center for Island Security, said in a statement. On Wednesday, public submissions closed on the MDA’s draft environmental impact statement for the proposed missile defense architecture. The PCIS submission said 'there remained significant questions about the ability of the system to function as proposed.' It pointed out that the defense department has marked areas in the Pacific region that would serve as 'alternative operating locations' if Guam became incapacitated. 'This indicates that even DoD planners do not anticipate the EIAMDS will defend the entirety of Guam,’' the group said. Residents expressed mixed feelings about the North Korean test. Rubyjane Buhain-Redila told BenarNews she wasn’t scared and it is the 'same old, I’m desensitized already.' Others like Kyle Mandapat are concerned and want the civilian population to be better informed 'in the event of an attack, much like we prepare for tsunamis, typhoons and earthquakes.' Fellow resident Debbie Quinata was critical of elected officials for providing 'no bunkers for the public, we’re sitting ducks.' Guam’s Chamber of Commerce supports the enhancement of the island’s defensive capabilities, which will potentially bring billions of dollars in new investments and economic opportunities. 'We must rely on our military partners ensuring that we have the necessary measures in place to protect our island and the nation’s home front,' Ernie Galito, chair of the GCC board of directors, told BenarNews. China in September test fired an ICBM that flew over Guam to land on the high seas near Kiribati’s territorial waters. Last October, North Korea launched what it claimed was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile - called the Hwasong-19 - with an estimated range of over 9,000 miles and capable of striking the U.S. mainland. Last November, the U.S. fired an unarmed ICBM from its Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that splashed down 4,200 miles away at Republic of Marshall Islands’ Kwajalein Atoll. More than 300 similar U.S. tests have been conducted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Rp5-jD1IEj0	2025-01-11T15:50:33-08:00	
US Hits Russian Oil With Toughest Sanctions Yet In Bid To Give Uk...	(EurActiv) -- US President Joe Biden's administration imposed its broadest package of sanctions so far targeting Russia's oil and gas revenues on 10 January, in an effort to give Kyiv and Donald Trump's incoming team leverage to reach a deal for peace in Ukraine. The move is meant to cut Russia's revenues for continuing the war in Ukraine that has killed more than 12,300 civilians and reduced cities to rubble since Moscow invaded in February, 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that the measures announced on Friday will 'deliver a significant blow' to Moscow. 'The less revenue Russia earns from oil ... the sooner peace will be restored,' Zelenskyy added. Daleep Singh, a top White House economic and national security adviser, said in a statement that the measures were the 'most significant sanctions yet on Russia’s energy sector, by far the largest source of revenue for (President Vladimir) Putin’s war'. The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, which explore for, produce and sell oil as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, many of which are in the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies. The sanctions also include networks that trade the petroleum. Many of those tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 has shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia. Some tankers have shipped both Russian and Iranian oil. The sanctions include the Gazprom subsidiaries in various countries. This includes NIS Novi Sad, the Serbian oil and gas company a pillar of the country's energy system. Its revenues increased to €3.3 billion last year, equivalent to 4.5% of Serbia's GDP. The Treasury also rescinded a provision that had exempted the intermediation of energy payments from sanctions on Russian banks. The sanctions should cost Russia billions of dollars per month if sufficiently enforced, another US official told reporters in a call. 'There is not a step in the production and distribution chain that's untouched and that gives us greater confidence that evasion is going to be even more costly for Russia,' the official said. Gazprom Neft said the sanctions were unjustified and illegitimate and it will continue to operate. US 'no longer constrained’ by tight oil supply The measures allow a wind-down period until 12 March for sanctioned entities to finish energy transactions. Still, sources in Russian oil trade and Indian refining said the sanctions will cause severe disruption of Russian oil exports to its major buyers India and China. Global oil prices jumped more than 3% ahead of the Treasury announcement, with Brent crude nearing $80 a barrel, as a document mapping out the sanctions circulated among traders in Europe and Asia. Geoffrey Pyatt, the US assistant secretary for energy resources at the State Department, said there were new volumes of oil expected to come online this year from the US, Guyana, Canada and Brazil and possibly out of the Middle East will fill in for any lost Russian supply. 'We see ourselves as no longer constrained by tight supply in global markets the way we were when the price cap mechanism was unveiled,' Pyatt told Reuters. The sanctions are part of a broader effort, as the Biden administration has furnished Ukraine with $64 billion in military aid since the invasion, including $500 million this week for air defense missiles and support equipment for fighter jets. Friday's move followed US sanctions in November on banks including Gazprombank, Russia's largest conduit to the global energy business, and earlier last year on dozens of tankers carrying Russian oil. The Biden administration believes that November's sanctions helped drive Russia's rouble to its weakest level since the beginning of the invasion and pushed the Russian central bank to raise its policy rate to a record level of over 20%. 'We expect our direct targeting of the energy sector will aggravate these pressures on the Russian economy that have already pushed up inflation to almost 10% and reinforce a bleak economic outlook for 2025 and beyond,' one of the officials said. Reversal would involve congress One of the Biden officials said it was 'entirely' up to the President-elect Trump, a Republican, who takes office on 20 January, when and on what terms he might lift sanctions imposed during the Biden era. But to do so he would have to notify Congress and give it the ability to take a vote of disapproval, he said. Many Republican members of Congress had urged Biden to impose Friday's sanctions. 'Trump's people can't just come in and quietly lift everything that Biden just did. Congress would have to be involved,' said Jeremy Paner, a partner at the law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed. The return of Trump has sparked hope of a diplomatic resolution to end Moscow's invasion but also fears in Kyiv that a quick peace could come at a high price for Ukraine. Advisers to Trump have floated proposals that would effectively cede large parts of Ukraine to Russia for the foreseeable future. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new sanctions. The military aid and oil sanctions 'provide the next administration a considerable boost to their and Ukraine's leverage in brokering a just and durable peace,' one of the officials said.

Robert Reich: How Trump Seeks To Destroy The Four Major Pillars O...	Trump and his MAGA allies are already targeting the four major pillars of resistance to Trump during his first term. As we prepare for Trump’s second regime — which promises to be far worse than the first — it’s important to do what we can to protect and fortify these four centers of opposition. 1. Universities University faculties are dedicated to finding and exposing the truth — which has often meant calling out Trump’s lies. But Trump has warned that he’ll change the criteria for university accrediting in order to force university faculties into line. In a campaign video, he said, 'Our secret weapon will be the college accreditation system … When I return to the White House, I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist Maniacs.' Authorized by the federal government, these accreditors are essential to college operations. If a college isn’t accredited, it can’t get federal funds. Trump’s Project 2025 calls for replacing the current system of independent, nonpartisan accreditors with more politically pliable state accreditors. This would have disastrous effects. Many of the worst educational gag orders at the state level, along with DEI bans and faculty tenure bans, have been voted down or toned down because state legislators realized they were putting their schools’ accreditation status in jeopardy. If Project 2025’s recommendations are adopted, that guardrail disappears. Trump has also threatened to increase taxes on university endowments. Republicans in Congress believe they were instrumental in getting the presidents of Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard to resign over their alleged failures to stop protests against Israel’s bloodbath in Gaza. Some are eager to resume their attacks on major universities. 2. Nonprofits America’s nonprofits have been at the forefront of efforts to protect the environment, voting rights, and immigrants’ rights. Trump and his allies are seeking to stop nonprofit activism. The Republican House has already passed a bill that would empower the Treasury to eliminate the tax-exempt status of any nonprofit it deems to be supporting terrorism. An identical or similar bill could come across Trump’s desk after being reintroduced in the next Congress. The legislation doesn’t distinguish between foreign and domestic terrorism — whether real or imagined — thereby making it easier for Trump’s authorities to intimidate nonprofit personnel and donors. We’ve already seen something like this at the state level. In Texas, state authorities have attempted to shut down charities that assist immigrants. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita has launched a probe of nonprofits, including the God Is Good Foundation, that have allegedly conspired to bring noncitizens to the state. 3. The media I’ve been a critic of the mainstream media’s tendency to give 'both sides' credence even when one side is clearly in the wrong and to 'sanewash' some of Trump’s and his enablers’ rants. But journalists are an important bulwark against tyranny — which is why Trump and his allies are seeking to intimidate news outlets that have criticized or questioned Trump. The flurry of defamation lawsuits — such as Trump launched against ABC (and ABC caved to) and the Des Moines Register — is the latest sign. Trump and his allies have also discussed revoking networks’ broadcast licenses and eliminating funding for public radio and television. Kash Patel, Trump’s nominee to head the FBI, has threatened to 'take on the most powerful enemy that the United States has ever seen, and no it’s not Washington, D.C., it’s the mainstream media and these people out there in the fake news. That is our mission!' Already social media platforms such as Musk’s X and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have caved to Trump, allowing vicious authoritarian lies to be magnified unimpeded. 4. Organized labor In the 1950s and 1960s, labor unions were viewed as a source of countervailing power because of their activism on behalf of the working class and their significant political clout. In those days, a third of workers in the private sector were union members. But today, only 6 percent of private-sector workers are union members, and it’s far from clear that organized labor will be an active source of resistance to Trump. (If government workers are included, the percentage of American workers who are members of unions is around 10 percent.) Trump has warned organized labor that he will oppose their efforts to organize. The president of the Teamsters Union even appeared at the National Republican Convention in support of Trump. *** Each of these centers of resistance to Trump has been a powerful source of truth-telling in America. It’s no surprise that all have been targeted by Trump and his allies. We need to be vigilant and do what we can to protect and fortify them. Remember: We lose only if we stop fighting.

India: Christians Face Fresh Onslaught In Northeast – OpEd	By John Dayal (UCA News) -- India’s bishops, as much as its civil society, possibly missed an ominous warning in a report in the Kathmandu-based portal Himal Southasian about the growing support within tribal communities in the northeastern states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh for stripping those among them who converted to Christianity of their Scheduled Tribe status. In India, indigenous people are classed as scheduled tribes, which comes with special protections and quotas in educational institutions, legislative bodies, and employment in state-run institutions. The report becomes important with the news that the government of Arunachal Pradesh — once called the NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency) as it borders Bhutan, Myanmar and China through Tibet — will soon enforce the anti-conversion law it passed in 1978 to stop the growth of Christianity in the state. Also likely to be raised is the political demand that those already converted to Christianity be stripped of all privileges given to the members of the scores of big and small tribes inhabiting this Himalayan redoubt. Stripping tribal people, also called Adivasis in North and Central India, of their scheduled status is an important national project of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its parent body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to contain the growth of Christianity among tribal people and Dalits. The Presidential Order of 1950 became the biggest anti-conversion law of the newly independent India, with converts penalized by being denied reservations in government jobs, legislatures, and educational institutions. Tribal people, till now, could retain such rights even if they became Christians, and very rarely, Muslims. These rights were the fuse that lit the conflagration in Kandhamal in eastern Orissa state in 2008, which saw 56,000 people displaced from their homes and seeking safety, first in the nearby forests, and then in government refugee camps for up to a year. Many women, including a Catholic nun, were raped, more than 400 churches and 4,000 houses were burnt, while 400 villages were cleansed of a Christian presence. The subtext was that converts to Christianity should not be given Scheduled Tribe benefits. This was also one of the subtexts of the violence in Manipur which began on May 7, 2023, and continues with the toll mounting every day. Over 70,000 people, mostly tribal people of the Kuki-Zo group, are now homeless. They have also forced Meitei Christians to return to the older Sanamahi faith by making them sign conversion affidavits and burning their bibles in what they described as acts of ghar wapsi, or homecoming — the preferred BJP term for the re-conversion to Hinduism of Indian Christians and Muslims. As in Kandhamal, over 400 churches are reported destroyed. The majority Meitei, who are not tribal people, want the same scheduled status. This would in effect make everyone in the state equal and give the Meitei egress into the hill districts which have mineral deposits, and allegedly now grow contraband poppy, from which many opiate derivatives find their way to the billion-dollar international drug trade in which reportedly politicians are also complicit. Arunachal Pradesh is home to 26 major tribes and over 100 sub-tribes, collectively 68.78 percent of the 1.3 million population per the 2011 national census. The first church in Arunachal was set up in 1957 in Rayang village in the present-day district of East Siang, close to the Assam border. Christians now constitute just over 30 percent, with Hindus close behind at 29.0 percent, the Donyi-Polo at 26.2 percent, and Buddhism, both Theravada and Mahayana, at 11.8 percent. The many indigenous tribal religions, many nature or ancestor worshiping communities, total some 3 percent. The strength of the Hindu population may be significantly more as the Donyi Polo often also so identify themselves. Many of their social, political and religious leaders are also members of the RSS. In such a mixed population, English is a link language, but also Hindi, which many people in the state speak fluently as it was taught in Vivekanand schools, run by an RSS affiliate organization. Hindi also makes it easy for Hindutva activists to emphasize its connectedness with the Hindu-majority Indian mainland. The other tribal states of the northeast region use English as their link language. Over the last three decades which saw Christian evangelization, the RSS was working with equal zeal radicalizing Hindu tribal groups, and ones following various indigenous faiths. The RSS and its affiliates view the state’s indigenous faiths as part of Sanatana Dharma, or Hindu religion. This has now effectively pitted them against the proselytized Christians. The RSS, not working exactly under the radar, set up an education network that parallels the one by Christian missionaries, matching it in expanse and facilities. These Ekal Vidyalayas, or single-teacher schools, are similar to the ones that impart Hindu nationalist philosophy to tribal children from Orissa in the south and Rajasthan in the west. Demonizing Christians is part of the extra-curricular activity. The anti-conversion law was not passed by a BJP government in the state or New Delhi. It was enacted in 1978 when Arunachal was not even a state but a Union Territory administered directly by the federal government. It remained in cold storage till 2024 when a series of steps became harbingers of a toughening of stance against the Church. As with other similar laws in a dozen central and north Indian states, it too does not name Christianity or Islam, while prohibiting conversion 'by use of force or inducement or by fraudulent means.' Many states have now weaponized this law and punishment can range up to 10 years for the pastor engaged in proselytizing, or a Muslim man marrying a Hindu woman and converting her to Islam. Every act of conversion is to be reported to the deputy commissioner of the district concerned. The law was contested even before it received presidential assent. The Christian community formed the Arunachal Christian Forum to ensure the law remained in abeyance all these decades. Forum president Tarh Miri calls it an 'anti-Christian law' and continues to lead the push against it. 'If the law is enforced, there are chances of it being misused by the district administration or police,' Miri said. The number of Christians in the state has grown rapidly over the years, making Christianity the largest religion in the state, even if by a whisker. In 2018, Chief Minister Pema Khandu told a meeting of the Arunachal Pradesh Catholic Association that the state government was considering repealing the Act. But, as in Manipur, the call to stop conversions was routed through a public interest litigation in 2022 by a lawyer, Tambo Tamin, who appealed for judicial intervention over the 'failure' of the state government to frame rules for the Act. On Sept. 30, 2024, the state government told the court that draft rules had been framed and would be finalized in six months. That would mean the law could be enforced by March-end or early April. Preparations apparently had begun last year when the government strengthened the existing Inner Line Permit system that makes it mandatory for non-residents, including foreigners, to apply for a permit to enter the state. Such permits are also required for some other northeastern states, including Manipur. The entry permit system gives the state powers through its police to check any evangelist entering the state. However, the Church in Arunachal no longer needs people from outer areas to reach out to various remote areas to preach. Unlike in the northern Indian states, or even in Rajasthan and Gujarat in the west of the country, where the Christian population is small, Arunachal Pradesh now has a sizeable community that can take care of itself if the state itself does not turn on the people. And so, the RSS-BJP may possibly have met its match in this state. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5WTUo6Khsq2P	2025-01-11T15:43:03-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Pains Of The Afar People – OpEd	They say Africa is splitting along the Great East African Rift valley. The ongoing volcanic activities in the Afar region of Ethiopia is said to be but a precursor of more to come, and this may perhaps create the sea for which Ethiopia has recently been bothering all the neighbouring coastal countries. Ethiopia’s continuing talk of access to a sea appears to have been putting a Hobbesian fear in all the countries around it, not that it will be able to achieve, but that it will cause more damage to the region, economically, politically, and even socially, without achieving any of the illusive goals of the current Ethiopian administration. But worse will be how far it makes the people of the region drift from each other apart and hate each other for no other reason other than the grandiose madness of a leader, who knows no peace and appears to have no intention of creating peace despite being a Nobel Laureate. Perhaps this is God’s design to keep the imperial pretenders of current day Ethiopia from the rest of the Horn of Africa States people, putting in between actual Abyssinia and hence Ethiopia and the Somali country including the part in Ethiopia, a major sea barrier. Who knows? God’s works manifest themselves in many ways! The process of the Somali plate drifting away from the Nubian plate and the Arabian plate has been going for many millions of years and the completion may also probably take many millions more, should the world still continue to exist or maybe shorter, in our current lifetime. A great part of the Afar region of Ethiopia, known as the Danakil Depression, is already below sea level and this may be submerged by floods from the Red sea to create a sea barrier between Somalia and Ethiopia, two countries that could have been friends but where such friendship is always made impossible by the desire of Ethiopia to take over Somali lands. Abyssinia has already taken a large portion of the Somali lands in the Horn of Africa, with the connivance of European colonial powers towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the small king of Shoa, Menelik II, rose to become an emperor of Abyssinia through forceful acquisition of many nations into his empire. This was further consolidated through a change of name to Ethiopia in 1932 by the then Emperor Haile Selassie, Ex- Ras Tafari, son of Ras Makonnen, a Chief Advisor to Emperor Menelik II. With a sea barrier separating the two countries, Abyssinia and Somalia may then become friends after all! However, one thing most pundits ignore, is the fact that there are people who live in the region affected by the volcanic activity today - the Afar people. One does not see many discussing the difficulties these people face, including their own government, which is busy threatening not only its own other nationalities (the Amhara, the Tigrayans, the Benishangul, the Somalis, and others), but also its neighbors. The Afar population is some three million souls, and they would need to move on to other parts of Ethiopia. The Afar State is one of the driest and hottest regions of Ethiopia and continues to affect the lives of many of the population of the region, and the current flare up of the volcanic activity would only cause more problems and difficulties for the population. It is where solidarity among the people of the Horn of Africa States is important and needed beyond the unnecessary antagonistic competition of the governments of the region, where each one is working hard to undermine the other. It is, indeed, one area they could all work together to ease the pains of the Afar people, who face a great disaster, even well-equipped countries would find difficulties managing them. The current fires in the Unites States is but an example where natural disasters can devastate large territories where people lived in peace. It is high time, perhaps, the governments of the Horn of Africa States region dealt with this Hobbesian fear of each other and worked together when natural disasters strike in any part of the region. This would have brought people of the region closer together in the place of worrying that each country is out to get the other, as is going on today between Ethiopia and Somalia. There is a need for a new social contract in the region, just as the United Nations Organization was founded, to address fear of another great war. A Horn of Africa States platform organized as a regional economic block would have addressed many of the contention issues including sovereignty, integrity and unity of each country, without one country taking over or threatening to take over the territory of another. A regional platform would have allowed economic cooperation, development of rail and road connections, airports and seaports to attend the needs of the region both in terms of internal trade and external trade and in investments and attracting more capital to the region from other parts of the world. This would have also allowed the exploitation of the resources of the region in terms of both sub-soil and above soil wealth. The location of the region alone would have attracted many millions of mobile populations to add on to the already bulging population of the region of some 170 million people – a sizeable market and a source of youthful labor force. A concerted effort from the countries and nations of the region to extend help to the Afar people, in their hour of need today, would be a great opener for such closer relations among the countries of the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5V62ZFRs2unL	2025-01-11T15:40:49-08:00	
The Trump Doctrine: How Expansionist Dreams Are Redefining US For...	In a world where geopolitical boundaries are increasingly fluid, Donald Trump's recent assertions about 'taking over' Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal have sparked both intrigue and alarm. These claims, while seemingly audacious, reflect a broader strategic vision that blends economic nationalism with a reassertion of U.S. global influence. Trump's territorial ambitions are rooted in a complex interplay of strategic, economic, and political factors, which are integral to his broader foreign policy framework and hold significant implications for international relations. The Historical Context: U.S. Expansionism Revisited The United States has a storied history of territorial expansion, from the Louisiana Purchase to the annexation of Hawaii. Trump's current proposals, though unprecedented in their scope, draw on this legacy. However, they are also distinctively modern, reflecting a world where economic power and strategic resources are as crucial as land itself. Trump's 'America First' agenda seeks to reposition the U.S. as a dominant global player, leveraging its economic and military might to secure favorable trade terms and strategic assets. Canada: A Complex Dance of Trade and Territory Trump's suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state is more symbolic than serious, but it highlights the complex interplay between trade and territory in U.S.-Canada relations. The U.S. and Canada share one of the world's largest bilateral trade relationships, with Canada being a critical supplier of energy and natural resources. Trump's push for renegotiating trade agreements, such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), reflects a desire to secure more favorable terms for U.S. industries, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. However, this economic integration is also intertwined with territorial politics. Trump's border policies, including the construction of physical barriers and stricter immigration controls, underscore a broader effort to redefine the U.S.-Canada border as a zone of economic and security control. While Canada is unlikely to become part of the U.S., Trump's rhetoric may aim to leverage Canada's economic dependence on the U.S. to achieve strategic trade concessions. Greenland: The Arctic Frontier and Strategic Resources Greenland, with its vast ice sheets and strategic location in the Arctic, represents a unique combination of natural resources and geopolitical significance. Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland reflects a broader U.S. strategy to secure its interests in the Arctic, a region increasingly important due to climate change and the opening of new shipping lanes. Greenland's potential for resource extraction, including rare earth minerals and hydrocarbons, aligns with Trump's emphasis on energy independence and economic self-sufficiency. Moreover, Greenland's strategic position allows for enhanced military surveillance and defense capabilities, crucial in a region where China and Russia are expanding their presence. The Panama Canal: A Critical Chokepoint in Global Trade The Panama Canal, one of the world's most critical shipping routes, has been a focal point of U.S. foreign policy since its construction. Trump's criticism of the current toll structure and his suggestion that the U.S. should reclaim control reflect concerns about economic fairness and strategic security. The Panama Canal is not just an economic asset but a geopolitical chokepoint. Trump's threats to intervene are driven by fears that China could gain undue influence over this critical trade artery, potentially undermining U.S. economic and strategic interests. This concern highlights the ongoing competition between the U.S. and China for global influence, with infrastructure and trade routes becoming key battlegrounds. The Role of Economic and Military Pressure Trump's foreign policy often employs a mix of economic coercion and military deterrence to achieve its objectives. In the case of Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal, economic pressure is likely to be the primary tool. This could involve tariffs, trade restrictions, or other forms of economic leverage designed to influence the decisions of these territories. However, the use of military force remains a backdrop to these negotiations. Trump has not ruled out military action in extreme scenarios, though this is more a rhetorical device than a practical policy option. The real challenge lies in balancing assertive diplomacy with the need to maintain alliances and avoid destabilizing global relations. International Reactions and the Future of Territorial Politics The international community has responded to Trump's proposals with a mix of skepticism and alarm. Denmark has firmly stated that Greenland is not for sale, while Canada has dismissed any notion of becoming part of the U.S.. Panama has also resisted Trump's claims, emphasizing its sovereignty over the canal. These reactions underscore the challenges facing Trump's territorial ambitions. While they may serve as negotiating tools or rhetorical flourishes, they also risk straining U.S. relations with key allies and undermining international cooperation. In a world where territorial boundaries are increasingly fluid, Trump's actions could set a dangerous precedent, encouraging other nations to pursue similar territorial claims. The Trump Doctrine and the Future of Global Politics Donald Trump's territorial ambitions, though controversial, reflect a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more assertive and nationalist stance. As the world navigates the complexities of globalization and rising competition between major powers, Trump's proposals highlight the ongoing evolution of international relations. Whether these ambitions result in significant territorial changes or merely serve as negotiating tools, they underscore the importance of strategic resources, economic leverage, and military power in shaping global politics. As the international community watches these developments unfold, one thing is clear: Trump's territorial ambitions will remain a focal point of global attention and debate in the years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Q7v6L8moPO_	2025-01-11T15:38:31-08:00	
Bangladesh Foreign Policy In Context Of The India-China-US Comple...	Ever since the people of the world learnt the need for homogeneity –be it cultural, linguistic, religion, tribal of for the necessity to band together and felt the need to acknowledge the existence of a world beyond their own diplomacy has been playing a role either as a friend or foe. I would argue that regardless of the size or the economic strength of a country practice of democracy remains the pillar of cohesion. Throughout history the definition has changed in line with the existing situation.Plato argued that democracy was inferior to various forms of monarchy, aristocracy and even oligarchy on the grounds that democracy tends to undermine the expertise necessary to properly governed societies. In a democracy, he argues, those who are expert at winning elections and nothing else will eventually dominate democratic politics. Democracy tends to emphasize this expertise at the expense of the expertise that is necessary to properly governed societies. The reason for this is that most people do not have the kinds of talents that enable (STANFORD ENCYCLOPADIA OF PHILOSOPHY). Modern practice of diplomacy puts emphasis on democracy as the binding force of diplomacy. John Stuart Mill argued that a democratic method of making legislation is better than non-democratic methods in three ways: strategically, epistemically and via the improvement of the characters of democratic citizens. Strategically, democracy has an advantage because it forces decision-makers to take into account the interests, rights and opinions of most people in society. Since democracy gives some political power to each, more people are taken into account than under aristocracy or monarchy. The most forceful contemporary statement of this instrumental argument is provided by Amartya Sen, who argued, for example, that 'no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country with a democratic form of government and a relatively free press' . The basis of this argument is that politicians in a multiparty democracy with free elections and a free press have incentives to respond to the expressions of needs of the poor. A contrary argument is given by China’s XI Jin Ping who argues that totalitarian system is better able to deliver goods to the people than a democratic system is. The foreign debt of China, by June 2015, stood at around US$ 1.68 trillion. China’s debt has grown dramatically over the past decade and is one of the biggest economic challenges confronting the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which turns 100 this week. Beijing identified the ballooning debt pile as a potential threat to economic stability, and in recent years tried to reduce the country’s reliance on debt for growth. But that deleveraging effort came to a pause for much of last year due to Covid-199 (JUNE 2021). This foray into Chinese economy is for two reasons: firstly is because of Bangladesh’s position in South Asia has only 145 kilometers boundary with Myanmar (bedeviled with the Rohynga crisis) and the Bay of Bengal. On all sides Bangladesh is dependent on India. Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia. Bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh has grown steadily over the last decade. India’s exports to Bangladesh in FY 2018-19 stood at $9.21 billion and imports during the same period was at $1.04 billion. The Indian economy expanded 4.1% year-on-year in the first three months of 2022, slightly higher than market forecasts of 4%, but due to rising Omicron infections, elevated energy prices, and ongoing supply chain constraints. On the consumption side, household spending slowed sharply and both exports and imports growth also eased. In contrast, government spending increased more and gross fixed capital formation accelerated. Considering the fiscal year ended in March 2022, the economy advanced 8.7%. Reserve Bank of India estimates the GDP growth rate for FY 2023 at 7.2%. Exports to Bangladesh in China decreased. Bangladesh is world’s second-biggest apparel exporter after China. Garments including knit wear and hosiery account for 80% of exports revenue; others include: jute goods, home textile, footwear and frozen shrimps and fish. The bilateral trade between Bangladesh and China has increased significantly in recent years. Bangladesh has been suffering from historic trade imbalances with China since its economic relationship after 1974. This trade deficit makes Bangladesh dependent on China and raises serious concerns about the economic and financial impact. For increasing exports to China could lead to a decrease in trade deficits. Bangladesh needs ensured access to the Chinese market. . This step of sincere and active cooperation between the two countries is considered significant enough to reduce the trade deficit. An Indian foreign policy expert Brahamy Chellany (China’s Debt-Trap Diplomacy Jan 23, 2017 and no less Donald Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence) warned the emerging econimes of Chinese debt trap policy. Through its $1 trillion 'one belt, one road' initiative, China is supporting infrastructure projects in strategically located developing countries, often by extending huge loans to their governments. As a result, some of these countries are becoming saddled with debt, leaving them even more firmly under China's thumb. Some contrary opinions have been sounded in favor of Chinese loans due to unemployment in those countries and the rising cost of essentials. The people in those countries are pressing their governments to accept Chinese loans that would provide employment and fund infrastructure for which the host country lacks money. Bangladesh is no exception. Sheikh Hasina’s official visit to China ( July 2019) seemingly succeeded in bolstering ties between the countries. During the trip, both sides inked a host of agreements, including two deals to provide loans to the Bangladeshi power sector. The countries also expressed interest in accelerating the work related to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM EC) project, an initiative aimed at expanding the economic ties of the four countries that together are home to nearly 3 billion people. Bangladesh and China turned their relationship into a strategic partnership in 2016, and, in recent years, Chinese investment in the South Asian country has risen rapidly. As part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing and Dhaka signed deals worth $21.5 billion covering a raft of power and infrastructure projects. To date, pledged BRI-related investment in Bangladesh stands at around $38 billion. China has pumped more money into Bangladesh than any other country over the past couple of years. China alone accounts for almost a third of this investment, worth over $1 billion. The Padma Bridge, a major road-rail project across the Padma river, is being built by the China Major Bridge Engineering Company. And China's Exim Bank is providing $3 billion for the construction of the rail link accompanying the bridge. It prompts countries like Japan and India to also come forward and invest. Bangladesh has announced an ambitious plan to set up 100 special economic zones by 2030. Many Chinese companies appear interested in investing in these zones. The question, apart from Indian discomfiture, Bangladesh has to take into consideration whether democracy as a way of life should be abandoned because of XI-Ji-Ping’s promise of quick delivery as he and CCP are able to deliver the goods needed by the people. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that unless equality is shared among citizens in law and policy there may be substantial and conscientious disagreement among them. The basic facts are that individuals are very diverse in terms of their interests. People's interests are diverse because of their different natural talents, because they are raised in different sectors of society and because they are raised in societies where there is a diversity of cultural backgrounds. Partly as a consequence of the fact that people are raised in different sectors of society and in distinct cultural milieus, they are likely to have deep cognitive biases when they attempt to understand other people's interests and how they are compared to their own interests. The question that has to be answered is whether the West now allied with the European Union and other freedom loving countries are to be jettisoned in favor of authoritarian system which promises quick results but no dissention in policy making. Apart from ideological differences Bangladesh risks to be isolated from the West whose assistance is needed at every step of the way. In can, be argued that close relations with China does not have to be at the cost of relations with the West. Throughout history minorities have faced discriminations, of different forms, based on language, clans, tribes, and most importantly religion. Intra-religion conflicts have been known throughout history. Famous are the conflicts among the Christians-the Protestants and the Catholics. Intra-Christians, the most famous one, is the revolt against the Pope by Martin Luther giving rise to Catholics and non-Catholic division. Other factors emerged to divide the Christianity like the annulments sought by King Henry the Eighth from the Pope revolting in the separation of the English branch of Christianity. Linguistic differences also not only led to dissension among the people of the same region but also led to the creation of a new state. Bangladesh was created mainly because Urdu and Bengali were separate languages and had separate script. The languages were so different that one could not the read or write the other. But then politico-economic reasons were there too. Bangladesh felt that this part of the country was being milked for the benefit of the other. Then again linguistic differences are not uncommon in different countries of the world. There are 22 major languages in India, written in 13 different scripts, with over 720 dialects. The official Indian languages are Hindi (with approximately 420 million speakers) and English, which is also widely spoken. In addition, several states in India have their own official languages, which are usually only spoken particular areas. As per 2011 Census of India languages by highest number of speakers are as follows: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, and Malayalam. 22 languages are accepted by Indian Constitution. In Belgium spoken languages are—French and Dutch. In short differences in languages do not constitute a government or a state. Nor does ethnicity. What makes a nation then? Britannica defines a nation state as a territorially bounded sovereign polity—i.e., a state —that is ruled in the name of a community of citizens who identify themselves as a nation. The legitimacy of a nation-state’s rule over a territory and over the population inhabiting it stems from the right of a core national group within the state (which may include all or only some of its citizens) to self-determination. So why was religion the main determinant in the Partition of British ruled Indian sub-continent? What caused was the predominance of Hindus over Muslim population in India? Was the political ambition of the leaders of Indian Congress Party and the Muslim League? Govt of India made first Census in 1951 when India’s population was 361,088,090 an increase of 13.31% in Ten years or an average increase of 1.33126 % per year or 2.986 % between 1941 and 1947. Muslim population was considerably less than the Hindu population leading to a conclusion that Muslims would always be under the rule of Hindus. Congress Party leader Man Shankar Ayar (It was not Nehru who cut Jinnah’s chances of becoming PM—August 17 2020) opined that 'since almost the morrow of Muslim League’s resolution of March 23 1940 the Congress had been attempting to persuade Jinnah and his League not to press for Pakistan. Instead, Mohammed Ali Jinnah told the press, 'Mr. Gandhi's conception of 'Independent India' is basically different from ours'. Given this background of two divisions-Muslim League and Congress- ha d already been created defacto it is pointless to bring about the Hindu-Muslim divide after decades of majority-minority rule practiced throughout the world despite the unfairness it entails. Neil Ferguson (Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Senior Faculty Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University) used the words 'historical evidence of technological innovation, religious effects, and economic differences, among other factors, to explain why the West, and Western Europe especially, was the dominant force in the world for centuries' He added that The West used to be hugely powerful. That was not because of chance. It was because of distinct traits that made the West more innovative and intrepid than the rest of the world'. It is debatable: what factors led to the Narendra Modi’s Victory in the elections: is it his muscularity vis-à-vis China and Pakistan or the benefits the common people got from his domestic reforms or was it his Hindutva philosophy which he has been preaching as a ' pracharak' from his young age or the amalgamation of all these factors. Sashi Tharor Congress Party leader, explains that Hinduism is a rich religion brimming with multifariousness. As opposed to the Semitic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the most well-known faiths in the Western world have some beliefs in common: every one of the three, for instance, accept that there’s just a single God and that he’s an existent and immaterial being. A genuine devotee must acknowledge that basic tenet. Hinduism, with regards to the mentioned tenet, is a totally contrasting religion. In opposition to their monotheistic partners, Hindus affirm the existence of several divine beings. That makes Hinduism a profoundly individual-specific faith that differs from one adherent to another'. The shift in India’s attitude towards Muslims has been there for centuries ever since the Muslims started invading India. This is the first time that Hindu population have voted BJP as a single majority political party with a group of people capable and willing to implement an anti-Muslim agenda. Such activities are in violation on the Constitution contrary to the oath taken by the Council of Ministers, and harmful to the image of India carved out by the predecessors are of little importance when President Trump at Allahabad meeting termed it as the internal affairs of India. Indian Congress Party leader Sashi Tharoor in his book Why I am a Hindu writes 'In 1989, the BJP adopted Hindutva as its official ideology. The BJP or Indian People’s Party has been ruling since 2014. From the beginning of their assuming of power, the nation has seen a flare-up of insularity which would’ve been incomprehensible to its Hindu ancestors. The BJP is focused on Hindutva, signifying 'Hinduness.'' Tharoor traced the thought to a previously developed one of the mid-twentieth century by Vinayak Savarkar, a government official, and essayist who promoted the idea of Hinduness with his 1923 book Essentials of Hindutva. Conclusion Recently President Joe Biden addressing the troops spoke of the threats posed globally but he assured them of the superiority of the US military strength through out the world. Such assurance sidelines the age of multi-polarity that has already arrived. US suzerainty since the end of the World War II does not exist anymore. One may recall President Biden’s statement of November 2020, 'We need to be aligned with the other democracies so that we can set the rules of the road instead of having China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town.' The problem may arise like Thucydides Trap due to inexperience of Xi-Jin Ping in dealing with the likes of Cold War of the US-Soviet era when both parties knew when and how to deal with adversary. One can only hope that the extinction of humanity would be avoided at any cost.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Sms0NF0o9qz	2025-01-11T15:36:16-08:00	
African Union’s Summit Leaves Little Hope To Advance Agricultural...	Perhaps it was the most crucial summit held on January 9th to 11th in 2025 with a focus to raise agricultural productivity, increase public investment in agriculture, and stimulate economic growth through agriculture-led development, and ultimately seeks pathways to support African countries eliminate continent-wide hunger and reduce growing poverty. During these past several years, African governments have taken delight in increasing imports of basic agricultural produce which could be cultivated locally. Import substitution policy is seemingly not part of any discussions during their ministerial meetings, instead devoted time on how to approve huge budgets for agricultural products from foreign sources. It has also taken the African Union (AU) years to initiate an agricultural programme directed at ensuring food security and cutting poverty in the continent. This cutting-edge initiative forms an integral part of the broad AU Agenda 2063. Considered as the most ambitious and comprehensive agricultural reform effort ever undertaken in Africa, it was first launched in 2003 following the Maputo Declaration and reaffirmed in 2014 in Equatorial Guinea with the Malabo Declaration. It has emerged as the cornerstone framework for driving agricultural transformation across Africa and represents a fundamental shift toward development that is supposed to be fully owned and directed by various African governments. That however, the early January Kampala summit, attended by Ministers of Agriculture from the AU's 55-member states, throughly deliberated on implementing aspects of the 10-year programme, primarily to be pursued, in different stages, by stimulating investment, fostering partnerships, and empowering vulnerable smallholder farmers. Notably, the programme is set to run from 2026- 2035. Without a single doubt, the drafting the programme which underwent a rigorous review process, took a full decade to complete. From 2014, in Equatorial Guinea with the Malabo Declaration to Kampala, Uganda, in 2025. And that what is appropriately referred to as an effective continental organization - the African Union. The drafting of the strategy was undertaken by a broad spectrum of stakeholders including the Regional Economic Communities, African experts and researchers, farmers' cooperatives and organizations, development partners, parliamentarians, private sector groups, women in agriculture and youth groups. According to the official release indicated that Africa's food security remains a pressing challenge, exacerbated by climate change, conflicts, rapid population growth, and economic disruptions. Currently, over 280 million Africans suffer from chronic hunger while food systems struggle to meet rising demands. Therefore, the 10-year programme is planned to address these issues by promoting climate-resilient agriculture, improving infrastructure, reducing food waste, and enhancing regional trade in agricultural goods. This is in a bid to equip Africa to feed itself sustainably. At the Kampala ministerial meeting, Prime Minister of the Republic of Uganda, Robinah Nabbanja, while recalling important statistics that point to the richness of African soils, abundance of arable land and fresh water, and a 60% population engaged in agriculture, expressed the highest shame that the continent's food imports cost up to US$100 billion. 'This summit should come up with concrete proposals on how Africa can come out of such an undesirable situation. For us to guarantee our future as Africans, we must feed ourselves,' she told the gathering in a tectonic language. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at the African Union Commission, Ambassador Josefa Sacko, commented on the importance of the strategy, saying it 'aims to boost food production, expand value addition, boost intra-Africa trade, create millions of jobs for the youth and women, build inclusive agrifood value chains, and build resilient and sustainable agrifood systems that will withstand shocks and stressors now and in the future. Furthermore, we are dedicated to strengthening governance through evidence-based decision-making and enhancing accountability among all stakeholders. Inclusivity is a fundamental aspect of our approach; we will ensure that women, youth, and marginalized groups have access to resources, thereby facilitating their equitable participation in the agrifood sector.' Dr. Girma Amente, Minister of Agriculture of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, whose Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed, is the Champion of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) Strategy and Action Plan 2026- 2035, highlighted how Ethiopia has cascaded CAADP into the national agricultural investment plan (NAIP). 'The plan emphasizes the importance of increasing public investment in agriculture, which is crucial for achieving the CAADP target. Ethiopia has significantly increased its agricultural budget allocation and has demonstrated its commitment by meeting the 6 % annual growth target of CAADP. The implementation of the National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) has contributed to consistent improvements in annual agricultural production, elevating both crop yields and overall food and livestock production, and also performed better in addressing the resilience targets of the CAADP,' explained Girma Amente. In his turn, Uganda's Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Frank Tumwebaze, who led the drafting of the CAADP Strategy and Action Plan in his capacity as the Chair of the Specialised Technical Committee of the AU on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment, stressed the need to move into implementation of the strategy, as soon as the summit ends. 'The planning phase of the Kampala CAADP Agenda ends during this Summit. We must, therefore, move into implementation and execution mode. It is by focusing on execution that we can make a meaningful impact to the continent and its people. We must move, not with the times, but ahead of times. This calls for advances in technological research and practices, building agricultural systems that are resilient to climate change and other shocks, agro-industrialization, and the like,' according to Frank Tumwebaze. The three-day Extraordinary Summit in Kampala was organized to adopt the 10-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan to advance agricultural transformation and food systems in Africa. But that was dominated by high-level speeches, with little hope of concretely addressing key questions relating to ensuring food security in the continent. Majority of African countries holds steadfastly to maintain the status quo, ready to allocate large part of their annual budgets to increase imports. There was little hope for any significant results and remarkable change in driving agricultural transformation across Africa after second day of the summit, dedicated to deliberations by Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and the 11th January meeting by Heads of State and Government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5RJBvza5r3Ie	2025-01-11T15:33:43-08:00	
Joseph Aoun To Visit Saudi Arabia On First Official Trip	By Najia Houssari New Lebanese President Joseph Aoun’s first official overseas trip will be to Saudi Arabia, he said on Saturday. It came during during a phone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the president’s office said. The crown prince called to congratulate Aoun and invited him to visit the Kingdom, the Lebanese presidency and Saudi Press Agency said. Aoun said that Saudi Arabia would be his first destination 'in recognition of the Kingdom’s historical role in supporting Lebanon and standing in solidarity with it, and as an affirmation of Lebanon’s deep Arab identity as the foundation of its relations with its regional surroundings,' his office said. During the call, the crown prince conveyed King Salman’s and his congratulations on Aoun’s election and his swearing-in as president. The crown prince wished 'success to Aoun and the brotherly Lebanese people, as well as further progress and prosperity.' Aoun thanked the crown prince for Saudi Arabia’s stances toward Lebanon and its people. In his first statement after assuming office, Aoun told visitors on Saturday that he 'did not come to engage in politics but to build a state that can only be established on justice and equality among all its components, which share one identity.' Speaking to a delegation from Dar Al-Fatwa headed by Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdel Latif Derian, Aoun said: 'The responsibility does not lie solely on me, and this is not just my term; it is the term of every Lebanese, regardless of their position or sect. 'We have great and numerous opportunities, and the world has begun discussing conferences in support of Lebanon, but it depends on us to demonstrate to these countries the extent of our credibility in building the state. 'We are not building a state for sects; Lebanon as a state protects everyone; the state of sects does not ensure protection.' Aoun added: 'There are no winners or losers; rather, we have a great opportunity that we either seize or lose. 'We have seen what has happened recently, and everyone has been affected. This country, its people and future generations have suffered enough.' Aoun expressed his hope that the new government would be formed as quickly as possible, 'allowing us to begin building bridges of trust with the outside world.' He said: 'We must seek the assistance of the outside world, not use it to gain strength against our people. No sect or individual is superior to another.' In his speech, Grand Mufti Derian thanked the Arab and friendly states that helped Lebanon 'emerge from the dark tunnel and end the presidential vacancy.' He said: 'We are an essential component of the state, and what we seek is to achieve a balance between the components of Lebanese society. 'We want to feel that we live in a state governed by justice, law, the constitution and the Taif Agreement,' he added. In Damascus, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati held talks on his first official visit to Syria following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. He held an extensive meeting with the leader of the new administration, Ahmad Al-Sharaa. Al-Sharaa told a press conference at the People’s Palace: 'We are giving ourselves an opportunity to build positive relations in the upcoming stages based on the sovereignty of Lebanon and Syria. 'We will maintain neutrality toward all parties in Lebanon and will try to resolve issues. 'The priority for Syria at this time is to ensure the security of the nation and to confine weapons to the hands of the Syrian state.' He said: 'Our objective is to establish positive relations between the Syrian and Lebanese peoples based on mutual respect, and the sovereignty of both countries, and Syria will strive to address all issues through dialogue.' Al-Sharaa’s meeting with Mikati focused on smuggling and Syrian deposits in Lebanese banks, he added. 'We also raised the issue of demarcating the borders between the two countries.' Mikati called for 'activating the relations between the two countries based on the national sovereignty of each and working to prevent anything that could harm the relationship. 'Syria represents Lebanon’s natural gateway to the Arab world, and as long as it is well, Lebanon will also be well,' he added. The caretaker prime minister also addressed the issue of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, describing it as an 'urgent matter.' Lebanon must 'promptly and facilitate their return to Syria, as this matter exerts significant pressure on Lebanon, and I have sensed an understanding of this situation,' Mikati said. Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri received a phone call from French President Emmanuel Macron, who congratulated him on the election of the president. Macron highlighted France’s commitment to 'continuing its support for Lebanon in all fields, especially the Lebanese army, and to implementing the ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon.' He said that he would visit Lebanon 'very soon.' President Aoun received congratulatory messages on his election from Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who highlighted his 'keenness to strengthen the historic and distinguished relations between the two countries,' as well as UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan; UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum; UAE Vice President Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan; and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In southern Lebanon, the Lebanese army began redeploying in the towns of Al-Qaouzah, the outskirts of Ramyeh, Tayr Harfa, Wadi Ain Al-Zarqa and Al-Batishiyeh in Tyre district after the Israeli army withdrew as part of the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. The army is expected to complete its deployment in the towns of Yaroun, Maroun Al-Ras, Aitaroun, Blida, Mays Al-Jabal, Houla, Markaba and Odaisseh this week. Israeli forces that had infiltrated the area carried out an operation involving the demolition of several houses in the town of Aita Al-Shaab in the Bint Jbeil district.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Zl7ON-xCkAw	2025-01-11T15:31:51-08:00	
How NATO Can Strengthen Its Ties With The Indo–Pacific – Analysis	By Stephen Nagy Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the increased connectivity of war in modern times. Conflict in one part of the world cannot be separated from other regions. In June 2024, North Korea provided at least five million munitions to Russia. And more recently, North Korea sent an estimated 12,000–15,000 troops to fight Ukraine. China has also supported Russia’s illegal war through third countries and by propping up its economy through the purchase of energy. Former Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida voiced similar concerns at the 2022 Shangri-la Dialogue. In his keynote address to the annual security summit, he warned that ‘today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s East Asia’. For NATO and its Indo–Pacific Four (IP4) allies — Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — Russia’s invasion serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for aggression from revisionist powers. It has prompted a re-evaluation of military readiness and collective defence strategies. Countries in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, have become acutely aware of the need to strengthen deterrence capabilities. The situation has also galvanised NATO discussions about the importance of a cohesive response to aggression, emphasising the necessity of solidarity not only in Europe but across the globe. This is based on a convergence in understanding in NATO that ‘unilateral transgressions of the rules-based international order and other unexpected events will have dramatic domino effects all over the world’, requiring a coordinated response. Key questions being asked in NATO–IP4 countries focus on how to properly resource a Taiwan contingency, or multiple contingencies, even without the added burden of supporting Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty against Putin’s Russia. Simply put, members currently have insufficient defence and munition resources due to underinvestment based on the post-Cold War illusion that military power and defence production capabilities were not necessary. This insufficiency refers to the availability of munitions and arms and defence equipment that can be deployed immediately and continually in the case of conflict on multiple fronts. This includes but is not limited to bullets, protective equipment, drones and aircraft needed to deter an adversary in the Indo–Pacific or degrade its offensive and defensive capabilities. In the context of AUKUS, Tom Corben and William Greenwalt from the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre have argued for the inclusion of a third pillar focused on reforming export controls. This would enable faster and more meaningful cooperation among the three countries in legacy munitions manufacturing and exports. Based on the NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge, NATO–IP4 collaboration, alongside potential partners like India, could fill these gaps by taking advantage of production potential in other countries allowing AUKUS members to focus on Pillars One and Two of the agreement. The proposed third pillar of AUKUS, while constructive, presents problems. Embedding legacy munition and other defence equipment into the AUKUS partnership may risk being exclusive rather than inclusive. This approach could alienate potential partners such as India, Southeast Asian states, Canada or EU member states. Strengthening NATO–IP4 cooperation is therefore essential. Maximising hubs for legacy munition manufacturing, storage and timely deployment across multiple contingencies requires a more inclusive partnership. Collaborating with partners in different geographic locations could help alleviate munitions and defence equipment deficiencies in the Indo–Pacific. This will require technology transfer to partners such as India and leveraging the manufacturing expertise of Japan, South Korea and others, ensuring that adequate resources, human capital and technologies are synergised for effective defence production. Considering NATO’s geographic limitations, burden-sharing frameworks must be established to address multiple contingency scenarios. For example, one scenario could entail a simulation of how Japan, the United States and South Korea could coordinate resources during a Taiwan contingency that occurs simultaneously with a Korean Peninsula contingency. Another might be the response to a kinetic conflict in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Burden-sharing, role division and resource allocation need to be systematically tailored to different scenarios to ensure an effective defensive response. While the United States may lead in simultaneous Korean Peninsula and Taiwan Strait contingencies, alternative partnerships — such as an Australia–South Korea–Japan minilateral or other frameworks involving NATO–IP4 — also need to be investigated. These minilateral cooperation frameworks need not be just reactive in addressing multiple contingencies but could also be preventative. Establishing such minilateral cooperation frameworks would allow NATO–IP4 to leverage legacy munitions production and placement throughout the region, ensuring quick access to the tools necessary for deterring revisionist powers. These initiatives contribute to deterrence, maritime domain awareness and shared security understandings. Developing NATO–IP4 coordinated diplomacy blueprints is essential for responding to multiple contingencies. Aligning measures such as financial and economic sanctions, shutting down sea lines of communication and establishing protocols to counter economic coercion and the weaponisation of supply chains are essential for mounting an effective, coordinated resistance. To address the growing challenges associated with the connectivity of war and the possibility of multiple contingencies in the Indo–Pacific, NATO–IP4 members must coordinate defence and munition resource production, burden-sharing planning and diplomacy.

Indonesia Should Repatriate, Deradicalize Families Linked To IS M...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus After the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, Indonesia should repatriate nearly 400 citizens linked to the Islamic State group, otherwise they could be exploited in global conflicts or fall back into militancy, analysts are warning. One of them, Yanuardi Syukur of the University of Indonesia’s Center for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, sees opportunities to work with the new Syrian leadership. Rebel forces captured Damascus on Dec. 8 and toppled the Assad regime, which was accused of human rights abuses including the use of chemical weapons. 'The Indonesian government should proactively engage with this new government for repatriation,' Yanuardi told BenarNews, highlighting the need to safeguard Indonesian citizens while ensuring they no longer pose a security threat because of extremist ideologies. The Syrian conflict, which began in 2011 during the Arab Spring – a groundswell of anti-government uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East – has left a complex legacy including the plight of foreign fighters and their families. Following the defeat of Islamic State (IS) in 2019, many nations have faced the dilemma of repatriating and deradicalizing citizens or prosecuting them for terror-related crimes. In Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, the issue is particularly sensitive because of the country’s history of Islamist militancy and terrorist attacks. The National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) estimates 375 people, including 145 children, are confined to the al-Hol and Roj camps in Syria. The people living at the camps are families of IS fighters. The al-Hol camp alone houses over 70,000 refugees, according to recent figures from the government and rights organizations. Conditions in the camps are dire, with reports of exploitation, indoctrination and deteriorating living standards, analysts said. After the fall of President Assad, a new political landscape is unfolding in Syria with Ahmed al-Sharaa (once known as Abu Muhammad al-Julani) emerging as a key figure in the transitional government. Analysts expect it to take a moderate approach compared to the radical factions under Assad. Still, Yon Machmudi, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Indonesia, warned that the former IS members including Indonesians could become mercenaries. 'They could move from place to place with no other option, surviving by becoming foreign fighters,' he told BenarNews. Shift in policy BNPT is assessing which individuals are safe to repatriate, focusing on deradicalization and reintegration, said Tjandra Sulistiyono, the agency’s head of the general bureau. 'We are in the process of identifying and evaluating how many Indonesian citizens will be repatriated,' Tjandra told BenarNews, adding that rehabilitation facilities have been established in Sentul, near Bogor. Under Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia’s new president, this marks a shift in policy. In 2020, the government of then-President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo announced it would not repatriate citizens who had joined IS in Syria but would consider bringing back some of their children on an individual basis. Repatriating former IS members is fraught with political and security risks, as demonstrated by past cases of returnees reverting to extremist behavior. An Indonesian husband-and-wife suicide bombing team killed 23 people attending Catholic Mass in Jolo, Philippines, in January 2019. At the time, Indonesian authorities said that the couple, Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani Saleh, had been rehabilitated through a government program after they unsuccessfully tried to join IS in Syria. In 2022, BenarNews reported that over 2,150 Indonesians had traveled to Syria and Iraq to join IS between 2013 and 2017, based on figures from the BNPT. Of those, more than 555 were deported before they entered Syria, 194 voluntarily returned home and 127 were confirmed dead. The BNPT classified the remaining 1,250 Indonesians as living in IS refugee camps, being detained in Kurdish prisons, missing or at large in Syria and Iraq. Despite the risks, Haula Noor, a researcher in terrorism and family dynamics, said some action must be taken or those still in Syria could be exploited during the ongoing conflicts in Syria. 'This needs to be done. There’s a fear that if they stay too long, they could be exploited,' she said. Haula, who teaches at the International Islamic University of Indonesia, called for a phased process based on an assessment of radicalization levels. 'Returnees must be classified into those still loyal to IS and those who have renounced its ideology. Repatriation should start with individuals and families deemed low-risk,' Haula said. Legal obstacles complicate the process. Many Indonesians in the camps are children born to mixed-nationality couples and their legal status as citizens is unclear, analysts said. Rakyan Adibrata, a researcher at the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals, stressed the importance of prioritizing children. 'When they went to Syria, they had no choice but to go and did not have an option to argue against their parents,' Rakyan told BenarNews. Adlini Ilma Ghaisany Sjah, a researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, warned that inadequate resources could undermine deradicalization efforts. 'Rehabilitation must be tailored to individual needs and conducted over an extended period,' Adlini told BenarNews. Short-term programs risk failure, especially given the deep psychological trauma and ideological indoctrination many returnees have experienced.' Partnerships with civil society organizations experienced in counterterrorism and deradicalization could play a pivotal role, Adlini said, warning that societal rejection or stigmatization could drive returnees back to extremist networks. 'The community must be prepared to accept and support these individuals. Without societal inclusion, the risk of recidivism remains high,' Adlini said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCCEMvwnUwfEnc2dE9PTi8	2025-01-10T17:02:35-08:00	
Since The 2011 Fukushima Accident, Japan Has Restarted 14 Nuclear...	Japanese utilities restarted two additional nuclear reactors in 2024 that had been suspended from operations in response to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, taking the total number of restarted reactors to 14 since the accident. In November, Tohoku Electric Power Co. restarted its 796-megawatt (MW) Onagawa Unit 2 reactor, and in December Chugoku Electric Power Co. restarted its Shimane Unit 2 (789 MW). Onagawa is the nuclear power plant located closest to the epicenter of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Most of the restarted reactors have been pressurized water reactors (PWR) located in western Japan. Onagawa Unit 2 and Shimane Unit 2, by contrast, are the first boiling water reactors (BWR) to be restarted. Onagawa Unit 2 is also the first reactor in the eastern part of the country to be restarted. Japan’s nuclear regulator prioritized the restart of PWRs due to public safety concerns regarding BWR technology, which is the design of the Fukushima Daiichi units. Japan suspended its nuclear fleet from 2013 to 2015 for mandatory safety checks and upgrades following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident. Before the accident, 54 commercial nuclear reactors were operating in Japan, and nuclear power accounted for approximately 30% of the country’s electricity generation. Nuclear restarts have proceeded slowly since the first two units (Sendai Units 1 and 2) were restarted in 2015. Restarts have been slow due to a significantly more stringent safety inspection and authorization process established after the accident and local court injunctions emerging from ongoing public safety concerns in some regions. Public support for restarts has been growing in Japan recently, however. Under the current restart process, once regulatory approvals have been granted, the local municipality and prefectural governments are consulted prior to restart. In addition to the 14 reactors already restarted, three more units (namely, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 and Unit 7 and the Tokai Daini unit) have received regulatory approval to restart but have yet to do so. Tohoku Electric Power announced in 2018 that Onagawa Unit 1 would be decommissioned rather than upgraded, but the utility plans to seek approval to restart Onagawa Unit 3. Restarting another 10 units is under regulatory review. Screenshot The suspension of Japan's nuclear fleet after the Fukushima accident significantly increased dependence on natural gas, oil, and coal imports to make up for lost domestic nuclear generation. It also significantly increased the installed capacity of solar photovoltaicgeneration in the country, according to data from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Japan has limited domestic fossil fuel resources and imports virtually all the fossil fuels it uses. Consequently, Japan is the world's second-largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after China and the third-largest importer of coal. As part of Japan’s sixth long-term energy plan, last updated in October 2021, the central government called for the nuclear share of the country’s electricity generation to reach 20%–22% by 2030. Nuclear power accounted for about 6% of Japan’s electricity generation in 2023. A draft of Japan’s seventh long-term energy plan was released on December 17, 2024, and says nuclear power should account for 20% of Japan’s energy supply in 2040. Japan’s current policy intends to maximize the use of existing reactors by restarting as many units as possible and extending the licensed operating life beyond the current 60-year limit. The country also plans to develop next-generation reactors in cooperation with the domestic manufacturing industry and electric utilities.

DOGE And Joe Dodge – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed The stark numbers documenting Washington’s shameful profligacy should petrify anyone concerned about financial sanity and America’s future. The shortfall between revenues and spending in the most recent fiscal year exceeded $1.8 trillion, a sum larger than the entire federal budget in Ronald Reagan’s first year as president. Interest on the national debt now consumes more taxpayer dollars than national defense. Total federal debt, which blew through $36 trillion a few months ago, is rising like a rocket. The DOGE project of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy is the first serious attempt in decades—maybe even America’s last chance—to tame the spending monster. This is not the first time that someone called the private sector in to fix a chronic public sector problem. Indeed, Musk and Ramaswamy should take inspiration from an American who fostered necessary fiscal discipline in no fewer than three countries—Germany, Japan, and the United States. His name was Joseph Morrell Dodge. Born in Detroit in 1890, Joe Dodge was a successful Michigan banker nearing retirement when he was tapped to chair the War Contracts Board during World War II. His scrutiny of the deals between the government and armaments firms paid off. He saved taxpayers the equivalent of 200 billion in today’s dollars. With the war’s end in 1945, the devastated German economy required his attention. General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower wired Washington: 'Get Dodge to Germany fast.' Dodge was no friend of big government. He knew that West Germany had to wean itself off socialism as fast as possible or post-war recovery would never get off the ground. Ravaged by hyperinflation, Germans often preferred cigarettes to near-worthless German marks. To begin correcting a desperate situation, Dodge advised spending cuts and a balanced budget. Following the work of the young economist Edward Tenenbaum, who also advised the post-war administration in West Germany and would later be known as the 'Father of the Deutschemark,' Dodge also proposed a 90 percent reduction in paper currency. Germans would receive one new mark for ten old ones. The plan was embraced by a key West German official (and later Chancellor) Ludwig Erhard, who went on to cut taxes by a third and implement free market policies that produced the famed 'German economic miracle.' 'The world’s political problem today,' declared Joe Dodge in 1947, 'is the extent to which Government controls or ownership will replace private enterprise….Underlying these problems and trends is the ultimate fact that the expansion of socialism and Government control and ownership finally leads towards some form of totalitarianism.' Perhaps he had read F. A. Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, published three years earlier (1944) and condensed and popularized by Reader’s Digest in 1945. Dodge’s reforms were just taking root in West Germany when, in early 1949, President Truman dispatched him to Japan to work with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the legendary General Douglas MacArthur. The editors of Time magazine later wrote: [A]s General Douglas MacArthur’s financial troubleshooter, Joe Dodge saved Japan from runaway inflation by imposing a regimen of austerity. He combed the national budget, [and] once caught Japanese officials charging geisha girls to 'miscellaneous' on their expense accounts. Dodge gave Japan its first balanced budget in 10 years. Fixing Japan was at least as tall an order as fixing Germany. Writes James D. Savage: The Second World War shattered Japan’s economy. A quarter of its buildings were destroyed, a third of its industrial machinery ruined, 80% of its ships sunk, and a quarter of total assets simply lost. Three million Japanese had been killed during the war, and on surrender 17% of the population was without work. What became known as 'The Dodge Line' did the trick. By implementing a balanced national budget and shutting down the printing presses, it ended hyperinflation. It drastically reduced government economic intervention across the board. It rationalized an incomprehensible tax code. Dodge’s intention was not to 'plan' the Japanese economy, but rather to finally leave it alone. He killed every subsidy and price control he could get his hands on, and MacArthur cheered him as he did it. 'I think what is most important in rebuilding the Japanese economy is to balance the budget,' Dodge said in his very first meeting with the Japanese Finance Minister. 'In order to balance the budget, you have to cut spending.' When urged by the bureaucracy to spend more on 'infrastructure,' Dodge said no, insisting that such spending historically was 'the least wisely administered and the least productive.' An April 2010 report titled Fiscal and Monetary Policies of Japan in Reconstruction and High-Growth, 1945 to 1971 reflected on Dodge’s impact: The fiscal 1949 budget also attempted to reduce government debt. In an effort to enable the economy to break out of inflation, it held down increases in spending across the board. Dodge Plan budgeting enabled Japan to balance its fiscal spending, restrain government outlays, cut price subsidies and eliminate the rationing system. Postwar inflation died down, and the postwar controls were thrown off. Once inflation was killed, Dodge established a yen-to-dollar exchange rate of 360-to-1, where it remained unchanged for almost a quarter-century. Stable money became a key pillar of the Japanese economic miracle. Gone in Dodge’s first budget for Japan were the Liquor Rationing Public Corporation and the Petroleum Rationing Public Corporation, along with dozens of other departments and bureaucracies. Another notable and deserving casualty was the Reconstruction Finance Bank, which made so many bad loans and fostered so much money printing that its effect was nicknamed 'Reconstruction Finance Bank Inflation' by many Japanese. Dodge closed it down—lock, stock, and barrel. It’s likely that Dodge understood a key fundamental that we must hope DOGE, the Trump administration, and the Congress will understand: If you only nip and tuck, the monster will grow back later. It’s best to rip this nonsense out by its roots and then run the whole thing through a woodchipper. Dodge also trimmed the bloated state-owned railroad and telecommunications systems. It was not painless. James D. Savage notes that Japanese National Railways lost 100,000 workers. About 200,000 were cut from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. (Later in the 1980s under Prime Minister Nakasone, both companies were completely privatized.) By the end of World War II, hardly anybody in Japan knew what a balanced government budget looked like. Deficits had been the norm for half a century. Even before Keynesian economics constructed a dubious rationalization for red ink, the Japanese national budget was chronically underwater. Joe Dodge of Detroit changed that and planted a desire for balanced budgets into the Japanese psyche that lasted for two generations. To cite Savage once again: Japan’s inflation of the immediate postwar years was broken, the budget ran a surplus, and the cutting of subsidies and the revalued yen encouraged economic rationalization. The rapid growth of inflation of the late 1940s was halted, and when the effects of the Dodge Plan were fully felt in 1950, wholesale prices flattened out, whereas consumer prices actually fell. The free-market miracles that transformed West Germany and Japan into economic powerhouses within a decade are so incredibly remarkable that one has to ask, 'Why don’t Americans learn about them in public schools today?' Maybe DOGE should also tackle the non-education and the mis-education rampant in government educational institutions these days. Joe Dodge was back in America well before the Truman administration ended in 1953. But soon thereafter, President Eisenhower named him his Director of the Budget. In barely a year, he cut the US federal deficit in half. If DOGE can accomplish what Dodge accomplished, we too may experience a new American economic miracle. About the author: Lawrence W.

Trump Unveils The Greater America Project – OpEd	On Tuesday, at a press conference at his Florida mansion, President-elect Donald Trump took his gloves off, after showing monumental patience in the face of the shenanigans by the lame duck president Joe Biden and his inner circle to 'do an Obama' on him for a second time by setting the compass for his new term in the White House starting January 20. Trump tore into Biden and his team ('sick groups of people') and signalled he’s had enough of their so-called 'transfer of power.' The proverbial last straw was the clumsy attempt by Biden Administration to release special counsel Jack Smith’s 'final report' on the federal investigation into Trump, which has no other purpose than serving to humiliate him. By the way, Biden has rewarded Smith, an obscure lawyer, for his dog-like loyalty to the master by nominating him for a cushy four-year term as chief prosecutor for the Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague, investigating war crimes in the Kosovo War. Apparently, Smith, in deference to Biden’s wishes, strove to condemn Trump as a national security risk and a renegade who subverted the constitution while as president! Biden’s bizarre attempt to defame Trump just 11 days before he is due to be sworn into as president won’t work. Simply put, Trump’s phenomenal victory in the Nov. 5 election is the new reality. The sordid drama casts Biden Administration in very poor light and discredits the entire transfer of power. So much for the decadent politics in the US and the highly toxic polarisation between the Democrats and Republicans. However, the Biden Administration is only following the footfalls of Barack Obama who in the lame duck period following Trump’s sensational election victory in November 2015 concocted a crisis in diplomatic relations with Russia and fuelled the preposterous 'Russia collusion' hypothesis manufactured by the intelligence agencies of the UK and the US, alleging that Trump was beholden to the Kremlin (which has since been exposed as political witch hunt) that virtually hobbled Trump’s entire presidency and culminated in two impeachment trials. Trump is returning to the White House in an angry, embittered mood. At the press conference, he targeted the FBI and referred to his deliberate choice of Kash Patel as FBI director. Trump is obsessed with the FBI raid on his residence in Florida purportedly searching for top secret documents that jeopardised national security, including in his wife’s bedroom furniture for undergarments! No doubt, retribution is at hand. On the policy front, Trump made it abundantly clear that he intends to discard Biden’s energy / environment /climate change policies as well as on immigration. However, what hogs the media headlines is Trump’s explosive remarks on the US taking control of Panama Canal and Greenland with military action, if need be. In reply to a direct question whether he would rule out using 'military or economic coercion,' Trump responded, 'No, I can’t assure you on either of those two, but I can say this: We need them for economic security.' He warned that if Denmark resisted the US takeover of Greenland (an autonomous territory of Denmark), he will impose steep tariffs. Trump disclosed that he intends to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, 'which has a beautiful ring. That covers a lot of territory, the Gulf of America — what a beautiful name. And it’s appropriate.' But what takes the breath away is that his past remarks about Canada joining the US as its 51st state have become increasingly serious. Trump threatened Canada with 'economic force' and pointed finger at the US’ bilateral trade deficit. 'Why are we supporting a country $200 billion plus a year,' he asked. Meanwhile, talking about NATO, Trump proposed that the contribution by the alliance’s member countries should be scaled up to 5% of GDP on defence instead of the existing 2% spending milestone. He warned that the US will not protect 'delinquents'. Other points of interest are: Trump eschewed any criticism of Russia in the Ukraine war, and instead alluded to the genesis of the conflict being NATO’s eastward expansion toward Russian borders, and remarked at one point, 'I could understand their (Russian) feelings in the matter.' Trump was evasive about current US deployment in Syria, saying it’s a matter of 'military strategy.' Equally, he pinned hopes on Turkish President Recep Erdogan showing restraint in attacking the Kurds (who are aligned with the US in Syria). Trump threatened Hamas with dire consequences unless all hostages are released before his inaugural on Jan. 20. ('If those hostages aren’t back… by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East — and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out. I don’t have to say more anymore, but that’s what it is.') Trump avoided any critical remarks regarding China or Iran. Europeans who are already nervous about the Trump presidency will see in the remarks a certain detachment. He was business-like on NATO and faulted the alliance’s reckless expansion to Russia’s doorstep. He counts on cutting a deal with President Putin. The European Union has cause to worry. (See my blog Ukraine war turns into absurdist fiction, Indian Punchline, January 7, 2024) Panama Canal, Greenland, Canada — Trump’s prioritisation of US control of Western Hemisphere (and the hugely strategic Barents Sea) to perpetuate its hegemonic clout as global power is self-evident. At no point he referred to the Indo-Pacific. That said, the really stunning thing is that both Canada and Denmark are founding members of NATO, but Trump couldn’t care less. He is planning to annex one member country and threatening the other’s territorial integrity. And they cannot even invoke Article V of the NATO Charter in self-defence. On the other hand, the impossibility of getting NATO countries to accept his demand for a whopping 150% hike in the contributions to the alliance’s budget at such a juncture when their economies are in crisis may also give him the perfect excuse to neglect NATO — effectively consigning the archaic alliance to oblivion. In fact, in the first circle of his foreign-policy strategy — the Arctic region, Western Hemisphere and the Middle East — Trump has no use of NATO. In that enterprise, he goes alone — a lone wolf. No doubt, the Greater America project is Trump’s consuming passion and it is integral to his MAGA movement ('Make America Great Again'). His repudiation of Biden’s 11th hour move to block drilling America’s coastal oil in a vast space of 625 million acres of the US ocean is expected to make America by far the biggest oil producing country on the planet. At the same time, the Greater America project is a 21st century Munroe Doctrine whose security and economic implications for China and Russia are apparent, although they will be hard-pressed to challenge it. Trump has buried the 'rules-based order.' If he succeeds, the US will simply outstrip Russia in sheer population and land mass and match or even exceed its resource base. Evidently, Trump has no interest in multipolarity or multi alignment — concepts that foreign policy wonks are animatedly discussing to define a new world order. Associated Press called this whole territorial annexation menu 'a new imperialist agenda,' while for the CNN, it signified a 'push for American expansionism' and 'imperialistic land grabs.' Moscow and Beijing will not disagree with that characterisation by mainstream American media, but will, nonetheless, take note that Trump’s agenda is possibly precedent-setting. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, after all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCCEMvwnUwfMr0OsSzQsSr	2025-01-10T16:56:52-08:00	
Can Trump Save America From Itself? – OpEd	Russian FM Lavrov last week dismissed Team Trump’s floated peace proposals for Ukraine as unsatisfactory. Essentially, the Russian view is that the calls for a frozen conflict precisely miss the point: From the Russian perspective, such ideas – frozen conflicts, ceasefires and peacekeepers – do not begin to qualify as the type of treaty-based, ‘Big Picture’ deal the Russians have been advocating since 2021. Without a sustainable, permanent end to conflict, the Russians will prefer to rely on a battlefield outcome –even at the high risk of their refusal bringing continuing escalatory – even nuclear – U.S. brinkmanship. The question rather is: Sustained peace between the U.S. and Russia – Is it even possible? The death of former President Jimmy Carter recalls to us that the turbulent 1970s policy ‘revolution’ which became encapsulated in the writings of Zbig Brzezinski, Carter’s National Security Adviser – a revolution that bedevils U.S.-Russia relations from then, until today. The Carter era saw a major inflection point with Brzezinski’s invention of weaponised identitarian conflict, and his espousal of the same identitarian tools – as applied more widely – in order to bring western societies under the control of a technocratic élite '[practicing] continuous surveillance over every citizen … [together with élite] manipulation of the behaviour and intellectual functioning of all people …'. Brzezinski’s seminal books, in short, advocated a managed cosmopolitan identitarian sphere, that would swap out communal culture – i.e. national values. It is in the hostile reaction to this technocratic ‘control’ vision that we can root today’s trouble breaking out everywhere, on all global fronts. Put plainly, current events are in many ways a replay of the turbulent 1970s. Today’s march toward anti-democratic norms began with the Trilateral Commission’s seminal The Crisis of Democracy (1975) – the fore-runner to WEF(‘Davos’) and Bilderberg – with, (in Brzezinski’s words), international banks and multinational corporations being crowned as the principal creative force in the place of the 'the nation-state as the fundamental unit of man’s organised life'. Brzezinski’s jaundiced perception of Russia was nothing new. Rather, it reaches back to the Hudson Institute in the 1970s and to Senator Henry 'Scoop' Jackson, twice a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 1972 and 1976 Presidential elections. Jackson (of Norwegian descent) simply hated communism; he hated Russians, and he had had a lot of support within the Democratic Party. Brzezinski, Polish by origin, shared Scoop Jackson’s Russophobia. He persuaded President Carter (in 1979) to insert a radicalised, jihadist identity-culture into Afghanistan to attrite the secular socialist culture of Kabul, which Moscow was supporting. The Afghan war outcome subsequently was portrayed as a huge American victory (which it wasn’t). Yet – and this is the point – the victory claim nonetheless underpinned the notion of Islamic insurgents being the ideal ‘solvents’ in regime change projects (and still is, as we witness in Syria today). But Brzezinski had yet more advice to give President Carter. In his 1997 Grand Chessboard, Brzezinski argued that America and Kiev might potentially leverage ancient cultural and linguistic complexities (as was done in Afghanistan) to form the hinge around which heartland power could be dissolved by denying Russia control of Ukraine: 'Absent Ukraine, Russia would never become the heartland power; but with Ukraine, Russia can and would [be a Heartland power]', he insisted. Russia needed to be enmeshed in a similar Ukrainian cultural-identity quagmire, he advocated. Why was this policy decision so damaging to the prospects of ultimate peace between the U.S. and Russia? It was because Kiev, egged on by the CIA, promoted the entirely false identitarian claim that ‘Europe ends at Ukraine’ – and that beyond it, lie ‘the Slavs’’. This manipulation alone allowed Kiev to morph into an icon for total cultural-identity war on Russia, despite the fact that the Ukrainian language (correctly known as Ruthenian) is not a Germanic language. Nor is there any Viking (Germanic) DNA to be found among modern-day western Ukrainians. In its desire to support Kiev and to please Biden, the EU jumped at this Ukrainian strategic revisionism: ‘Ukraine’ crafted as ‘European values’ defending against ‘Russian’ (Asian) values. It was a pole, albeit a false one, around which European unity could be forged at a time when the reality was that of EU unity dissipating. So, is ‘sustainable peace’ with Russia possible? Were it to be attempted in terms of seeking to sustain a rump Ukraine as a bellicose isthmus of ‘Europe and its values’ ranged against the ‘regressive Slav sphere’, then peace is not possible. For its underpinning premise would be wholly fake and would assuredly lead to renewed conflict in the future. Moscow almost certainly would reject such a deal. Yet, there is growing anxiety amongst the American public that the war in Ukraine seems locked into forever escalation, with palpable public fears that Biden and the ‘hawks’ in Congress are taking the U.S. towards a ‘nuclear holocaust’. Are we – humanity – to continue teetering at the brink of annihilation if a Trump ‘deal’ – narrowly confined to Ukraine – is refused in Moscow? The urgency to halt the slide towards escalation is clear; yet the space for political manoeuvre continuously shrinks, as the compulsion of the Washington-Brussels hawks to land a fatal strike on Russia is not spent. But seen from the perspective of Team Trump, the task of negotiating with Putin is anything but straight forward. The western public simply has never been psychologically conditioned to expect the possibility of a stronger Russia emerging. On the contrary, they have endured western ‘experts’ sneering at the Russian military; denigrating the Russian leadership as incompetent; and its leadership being presented on their TVs as purely evil. Bearing in mind Brzezinski’s seminal contribution on democracy, and its later ‘concentrate’ in an élite techno-managed ‘identarian sphere’, it is not difficult to see how a country as fragmented as America finds itself back footed as the world slips towards a culturally-based multi-polarity. Of course, it’s not exactly true to say that America has no communal culture, given the wide diversity of immigrant cultures in the U.S. But it is true that what is seen as traditional culture has been under siege. This, after all, was at the crux of the recent Presidential election – and of elections in many other nations. The notion that once the Trump envoys have been initially to Moscow, and gone away empty-handed, that Trump will sweep in to conclude an Ukraine deal, does not reflect what Moscow has been endlessly highlighting. What is required is a ‘Big Picture’ treaty-based deal that settles the security architecture and frontiers between Heartland and the Rimland security interests. But will such a deal be seen by many Americans as ‘weakness’; as conceding U.S. ‘leadership’ and ‘Greatness’? Of course, it will be perceived that way – because Trump would be effectively sealing America’s defeat and repositioning the U.S. as one state amongst equals in a new Concert of Powers – i.e. in a multipolar world. It is a big ‘ask’. Can Trump do it – swallow American pride? One viable way forward would be to return to the original Gordian Knot, and to untie it: i.e. to untie the knot of there being no post-WW2 written treaty delimiting NATO’s ever-forward movement, and by so doing, ending the pretence that NATO’s displacement to wheresoever it choses is no one’s business but its own. Unfortunately, the other possible way to ‘balance’ the appearance of American and NATO defeat over Ukraine, might be seen by Trump’s hawkish advisers to be to pulverise Iran – as a signal of American ‘virility’. Negotiations, in the final instance, are about interests, and the nous to solve the riddle of two parties perceiving how ‘the other’ sees itself being perceived – as weakness or as strength. Trump, if stumped in a literal impasse over Ukraine, might simply escalate the metaphysical staircase to simply say that he alone has the vision to save America from WW3. To save America from itself.

Turkey Boosted By The Syrian Coup – OpEd	Afterthe Syrian people themselves, it is Turkey that has emerged as the biggest winner from the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. As soon as Assad fled to Moscow, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan knew that fate had played into his hands. It was as far back as March 2012 that Turkey broke off diplomatic relations with Assad, but within a few days of the regime’s overthrow it had re-established its diplomatic representation in Syria, and the head of Turkish intelligence, Ibrahim Kalin, was in Damascus visiting Abu Mohammed al-Julani, leader of HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham), the victorious rebel movement. Turkey was able to share the joy and elation of the Syrian people because it had long supported HTS, as well as other Syrian opposition forces that aimed to replace Assad's regime. So with the ascent of HTS and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as al-Julani), Erdogan knew that he was well placed to play a pivotal role in shaping Syria's future governance and policies, and – he doubtless hoped – align them with Turkish strategic objectives. Commercial benefits were also in Turkey’s sights. On December 27 Reuters quoted Turkey’s energy minister, Alparslan Bayraktar, as saying that Turkey aims to provide electricity to Syria. Bayraktar added that Turkey may also work with Syria's new leadership on oil and natural gas, developing its energy infrastructure, including potential oil pipelines connecting the two countries. Speakers on the online media network NPR were saying on December 27 that Turkish construction companies are poised to go into Syria, and that Turkish businesses are talking about moving factories across the border. This would certainly create much needed jobs for Syrians, but they pointed out that before initiatives like this could be put in place, an effective infrastructure would be needed, such as consistent water and electricity supplies and efficient internet services, and that these basics are not widely available at present. In the new situation Turkey would appear to have the upper hand over the fraught issue of the large Kurdish occupied region known as Rojava in the north-east of Syria, adjacent to the Turkish-Syrian border. It occupies nearly 30% of the original sovereign Syria. Erdogan views the Kurdish occupied region as a security threat, because of its links with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), widely regarded as a terrorist organization, and believes it could inspire Kurdish separatists inside Turkey. Ever since 2015, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have collaborated with the US-led coalition, leading ground operations that demolished the ISIS caliphate. This military achievement boosted the Kurdish standing in the US and more widely, and revived their aspirations to achieve autonomy in the area they occupy, on the lines of the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) that enjoys a quasi-state status in Iraq. Where Erdogan may miscalculate the extent of his increased influence within Syria is in relation to al-Sharaa’s intentions. Erdogan may be perceiving the HTS achievement as a traditional military coup aimed at projecting its leader to a position of autocratic power. But ever since Assad’s fall, al-Sharaa has presented a moderate face to the world, consistently declaring that he intends to be as inclusive as possible in establishing Syria’s new governance. He has said several times that Kurds are 'part of the Syrian homeland' while assuring the nation that 'there will be no injustice'. How will his sweet words play out against Turkey’s pivotal influence and resistance to Kurdish autonomy in Rojava? On December 17 the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials are growing increasingly worried that Turkey might soon launch a 'full-scale incursion' into territory held by Syrian Kurds. They may have been reacting to Erdogan’s wide-ranging speech that day in which he declared 'As a nation we cannot limit our horizons.' He may be riding high at the moment, but he would do well to take note of the old saying: 'Pride comes before a fall.' For the Kurds will not forget that something akin to the semi-autonomous situation of their compatriots in Iraq was actually offered to them by the Assad regime. In March 2015 the then Syrian information minister announced that the government was considering recognizing Kurdish autonomy 'within the law and constitution.' Later, in September 2017, Syria's then foreign minister stated that Damascus would consider granting Kurds greater autonomy once ISIS was defeated. Events overtook these aspirations, and nothing of the sort materialized. But they might provide al-Sharaa with a template for a future accommodation with the Kurds within the constitution of a unified and restored Syrian state. The pragmatic nature of politics means that Turkey’s augmented political and diplomatic standing has been immediately recognized by world leaders. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have all reached out to Erdogan since the military coup. On December 16 the EU instructed a senior diplomat to engage directly with the provisional government set up by HTS, while von der Leyen traveled to Ankara for a meeting with Erdogan. He came away from the discussion with €1 billion of EU cash to support the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and to assist in their repatriation. The fall of the Syrian regime has been a major blow to Russian interests. President Vladimir Putin​'s vital naval and air bases in Syria, assured under the Assad regime, ​have become vulnerable. He had big plans, both economic and political, for the Middle East, and ​the military bases in Syria were crucial to their achievement. He may need Erdogan’s support​ to retain them, but​ there is always the chance that the Kremlin can conclude a deal with Syria’s new government.​ According to Reuters, Russia has moved its naval vessels out to sea from the Tartus naval base, and drawn down equipment from its Khmeimim air base, but intends to keep both. With no indication that Putin is using Erdogan as a go-between, he is reported to have contacted Syria’s new leader, al-Sharaa, requesting a renewal of the deals made with Assad. An arrangement in 2015 gave Russia full control of the Khmeimim air base, while under the Tartus Naval Agreement of 2017 Russia was granted 49-year access to the Tartus naval base, with an automatic 25-year extension option. According to an unnamed Syrian rebel official quoted by Reuters, the new Syrian government has not made a final decision on Russia’s request. This issue, like so much else about the future of Syria and the Syrian people, has yet to be resolved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCCEMvwnUwfMgqb7eaQHOc	2025-01-10T16:44:37-08:00	
A Trick Question: How Many Times Have Nuclear Weapons Been Used? ...	By Joshua Mawhorter Readers are doubtless familiar with the concept of a trick question, in which the asking of the question is meant to purposely mislead the answerer into a seemingly obvious, but wrong, answer. This can include jokes, puzzles, and riddles. In this case, a trick question is posed in order to prove a point (but the reader is forewarned about the nature of the question): How many times have nuclear weapons been used? Historically, the seemingly obvious answer would be two or twice—twice by the United States against Japan in World War II. This is what a simple Google search would yield also. While that is reasonable, the trick of the trick question is in the meaning of used. If we consider the fact that coercion includes not only direct acts of violence, but credible threats of violence, then nuclear weapons have been used dozens of times since WWII. Indeed, nuclear weapons—being an inescapable aspect of the post-WWII era—are used all the time, by the US and other states. Lest we are tempted to think this is just a matter of overly dramatic or technical wordplay—nuclear weapons were only really used when they were dropped, not every time they were considered or threatened—consider the following example. A man with a gun points it at another man and demands his wallet. The second man—not wanting to be shot—hands over his wallet. The first man runs away, never firing the gun. Later, were the first man to be arrested by the police for robbing the other man at gunpoint, no one would accept the argument that he did not actually use the gun just because he did not ultimately fire the gun. He would rightly be considered a robber and charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Why should we apply a lesser standard to government elites and nuclear weapons? In fact, if we apply such a reasonable standard to the brandishment of a gun, then why in the world would we not apply the same standard to the threat and brandishment of nuclear weapons? This is especially the case with nuclear weapons since—much more than a single robber brandishing a gun he does not fire—these weapons can have worldwide impact in their destructive effects. This 'trick question' is meant to be clever, but to reveal the incredible threat to which state elites constantly subject humanity. This insight is not original to me. It was recorded by Daniel Ellsberg in his 'Introduction: Call to Mutiny' in Protest and Survive(1981). Ellsberg wrote, The notion common to nearly all Americans that 'no nuclear weapons have been used since Nagasaki' is mistaken. It is not the case that U.S. nuclear weapons have simply piled up over the years—we have over 30,000 of them now, after dismantling many thousands of obsolete ones—unused and unusable, save for the single function of deterring their use against us by the Soviets. Again and again, generally in secret from the American public, U.S. nuclear weapons have been used, for quite different purposes: in the precise way that a gun is used when you point it at someone’s head in a direct confrontation, whether or not the trigger is pulled. (emphasis in original) Nuclear weapons have been and are used constantly in the global order. This not only puts us, others, and humanity at risk, but the perpetrators are usually not considered criminals, who commit mass assault with deadly weapons. Furthermore, this is often done in secret. In fact, it only took Harry Truman himself seven months before he again used nuclear weapons again in this more subtle way, In 1946 the Soviets and British agreed to end their World War II occupation of Iran, but the Soviets reneged. They increased their forces and set up autonomous regimes in the northwestern provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. In a little-known episode of nuclear diplomacy that Jackson said he had heard from Harry Truman, the President summoned Soviet Ambassador Andrei Gromyko to the White House. Truman told Gromyko that Soviet troops should evacuate Iran within 48 hours—or the U.S. would use the new superbomb that it alone possessed. 'We’re going to drop it on you,' Jackson quoted Truman as saying. 'They moved in 24 hours.' The post-WWII nuclear situation, in order to avoid actual direct usage of nuclear weapons, we must expect heads of state with command over nuclear weapons (and others, e.g., the people who actually push the button, etc.) to be of such a character that they would be less likely than Harry Truman to use the bomb. This assumes current and future heads of state (and others) will possess an extreme level of careful analysis, cool-headedness, ability to withstand popular and political pressure, awareness of grave consequences, and ethical clarity. Obviously that description matches no past or current political elite, yet many of them use nuclear weapons, putting us all at risk. A short list of examples demonstrates the breadth of this danger. In a 2007 article in the Asia-Pacific Journal, Peter J. Kuznick wrote 'The Decision to Risk the Future: Harry Truman, the Atomic Bomb, and the Apocalyptic Narrative.' In an insightful passage, he writes, Such concerns are reinforced by the fact that use of atomic bombs has been seriously contemplated and/or threatened by almost every postwar president—by Truman during the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948, by Truman and Eisenhower over Korea, by Eisenhower administration officials in support of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, by Eisenhower during the Lebanon crisis in 1958 and in response to a threatened Chinese invasion of Quemoy and Matsu in 1954 and 1958, by Kennedy during the Berlin crisis in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, by Johnson to defend marines at Khe Sanh, Vietnam in 1968, by Nixon and Kissinger against the North Vietnamese between 1969 and 1972, by Nixon to deter Soviet actions on several occasions between 1969 and 1973, by Carter in Iran in 1980, by George H.W. Bush and Clinton in Iraq, and by George W. Bush in wholesale fashion in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review and afterwards. As if this were not enough, Kuznick points out that the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum lists several other occasions. For example, nuclear weapons were considered, against Soviet forces stationed in Iran in 1946, Yugoslavia (1946), Uruguay (1948), Guatemala (1954), North Korea (1968), and during the invasion of Syrian troops into Jordan in 1970. And this does not even take account of the Obama, Trump, and Biden presidencies. In fact, the Biden administration has continued to agitate Russia—one of the world’s largest nuclear powers—after being considered too old and incompetent to perform the duties of the president and after another president has been elected, but has not been installed. Also, keep in mind the fact that we do not just have to worry about the politicians in the US using nuclear weapons; other countries have them too. For some reason, when the stakes are larger, often we put up with the prospect of disastrous possible consequences. In his personal growth book, Atomic Habits, James Clear wrote about the need to make bad habits immediately unsatisfying because we have a tendency to prefer present satisfaction, even at the expense of larger, more significant consequences in the future. He provides an interesting passage about Roger Fisher, a pilot in World War II who later attended Harvard Law School and spent decades specializing in negotiation and conflict management. Regarding the nuclear threat, Fisher developed an interesting strategy to avoid nuclear war. Clear records Fisher’s suggestion to address the fact that one person, at any given time, could kill millions without ever seeing anyone die, therefore, he wrote, My suggestion was quite simple. Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, 'George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.' He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home. When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, 'My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.' About the author: Joshua Mawhorter is assistant editor of Mises.org.

David Vs Goliath: Amish Farmer Prevails Over Feds In Court – OpEd	By John Klar Legal counsel for Amish food rights activist Amos Miller claimed victory in a recent Pennsylvania decision that permits the feisty farmer to continue selling his raw milk outside of the state but not 'within the Commonwealth.' The ruling permits Miller to keep his business afloat to fight for food rights another day, but his war is far from over. Stirring Up the Amish On Jan. 5, 2024, Pennsylvania State Police and Department of Agriculture officials raided Miller’s farm on alleged complaints of illness caused by his raw milk sold in New York and Michigan. Authorities seized milk products and frozen meats, sparking nationwide backlash and seeding an unprecedented wave of pro-Donald Trump Amish votes among an agricultural community known for keeping to themselves. Miller has fought state regulators for years, but the MAHA movement has converged with Americans seeking food liberties. In 2021, Maine became the first state to amend its constitution to enshrine the liberty to buy and eat food of one’s choosing; initiatives are growing in many states to follow suit. Some estimate that Miller’s out-of-state customer base is as high as 4,000 to 5,000. For purposes of the recent Pennsylvania appellate court ruling in his favor, the number of Miller’s customers was more weighty than the number of bacteria in his milk. The arcane legal posture of the case arises from the delicate state and federal boundaries of the US Constitution and resulted in a strange preliminary injunction whereby Miller and his affiliated businesses are free to sell raw milk and other uninspected food products to people in other states but not within the state of Pennsylvania. The decision hinges upon the state’s balancing test for injunctions. A Large Caliber Complaint? After seizing the Millers’ food products and filing a 357-page complaint, the State of Pennsylvania requested a preliminary injunction prohibiting the farm family from selling any raw milk pending the trial’s outcome. The trial court initially granted the state’s request but later amended its ruling to permit Miller and his wife Rebecca to sell raw milk outside the state’s boundaries (but not within) because of concerns that important constitutional rights were impacted. The Millers argued an injunction prohibiting sales to customers outside Pennsylvania would violate the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Right to Travel Clause of the US Constitution. The trial court agreed, fashioning its Solomonic injunction because it 'decline[d] to blur the line between the regulation of raw milk sales in the Commonwealth and interstate commerce.' Historically, the federal government is empowered by the US Constitution and the Supremacy Clause to regulate interstate commerce, including the sale of food. State governments retain authority to oversee the health and safety of food products and other commerce within state boundaries. The Pennsylvania raw milk statute even employs the phrase 'within the Commonwealth,' and so the trial court limited the injunction to that jurisdictional (and geographical) demarcation pending a fuller consideration of the facts and law at trial. Raw Milk Is Safe and Legal The case does not address the safety of raw milk, which is legal in Pennsylvania, so long as a permit is obtained, which Miller asserts violates his religious liberties. Famous for their devout, humble lifestyles and stubborn resilience, the Pennsylvania Amish are also renowned for carving a protective constitutional 'safe space' around their religious observances. In the seminal 1972 case of Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Amish won recognition of the liberty to withdraw their children from compulsory public school education past the eighth grade. The US Supreme Court ruled their fundamental rights to the free exercise of their faith outweighed the state’s interest in educating their children. That precedent bears an interesting parallel to Miller’s current kerfuffle. In its Jan. 3, 2025, ruling, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania balanced the potential economic harms to the Millers’ farming business against the state’s arguments of threats to public safety in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. Agreeing with the lower court that important federal constitutional issues are raised that must be addressed at trial, the appellate court emphasized the Millers’ arguments alleging irrevocable harm: 'The Millers argue a preliminary injunction of their out-of-state raw milk sales would bankrupt them, cause them to lose their family farm, and effectively end the case before the trial court can decide the merits … On this issue, we find persuasive Watson v. Perdue, 410 F. Supp. 3d 122, 131 (D.D.C. 2019), recognizing loss of a family farm constitutes irreparable harm because ‘[i]t involves the loss of generations of family history, sweat-equity, and memories,’ and monetary damages are no substitute … The Department does not dispute a preliminary injunction would bankrupt the Millers, and it presented no evidence to the contrary during the evidentiary hearing.' Amish Amos Fights for Food Rights This is uncharted legal territory, though, for all American farmers and consumers. The infamous 1942 case of Wickard v. Filburn held that the federal government possessed the constitutional power to regulate a farmer’s wheat grown in his own fields and fed to his own livestock under the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture v. Miller is grappling with the issue of whether one state can regulate the commerce of another. Each side argues the other’s position is absurd: The state asserts restricting its authority would allow people from other states to come there to produce uninspected goods to sell outside of Pennsylvania. The Millers posit that permitting the state’s interpretation would allow it to interfere with people traveling through the Commonwealth in possession of raw milk intended for other states, interfering with federal jurisdiction and federal rights to freedom of travel. Miller will continue selling raw milk in other states pending his ongoing Pennsylvania court battles. If he prevails at trial, and the federal government declines to intrude between him and his trusting customers, he might keep selling uninspected raw milk out-of-state long after his cows come home.

Statement By Ralph Nader And Bruce Fein – OpEd	You have just decided that grizzly bears can remain on the endangered species list. Yet, week after week, you have watched Netanyahu target with U.S. F-16s innocent defenseless Palestinian families, killing 50-100 a day, and blocking humanitarian aid trucks with food, medicine and water for the dying and sick people in this encircled, blockaded tiny Gaza enclave. Have you no decency? No willpower to make your master Netanyahu obey? Any final demands by the President of the United States? In your eulogy of Jimmy Carter yesterday at the Washington Cathedral, you said President Carter taught you 'the strength of character.' Where is the strength of character in 16 months of co-belligerency with genocidal Netanyahu massacring innocent civilians in the hundreds of thousands in Gaza? Where is the strength of character in allowing Netanyahu to block thousands of U.S. paid for humanitarian trucks to enter Gaza with lifesaving food, medicine, water, and other critical supplies? Where is the strength of character in allowing Netanyahu to block the entry into Gaza of U.S. reporters to tell the American people about the ghastly, illegal use of U.S. taxpayer-funded weapons of mass destruction against defenseless civilians, babies, mothers and fathers? Where is the strength of character in allowing your State Department to cover up credible evidence about the vast undercount of deaths and serious injuries in Gaza, blocking Freedom of Information requests? And where is your compassion for horribly burned children and amputees not being allowed by Netanyahu to be airlifted to ready and able U.S. hospitals for treatment? Where is your strength of character in your choice not to denounce and stop Netanyahu’s increasing slaughter of Palestinians in the West Bank and Lebanese civilians in Lebanon, and Netanyahu’s killing of over 200 journalists and over 400 UNRWA staff – all war crimes under the Geneva conventions to which the U.S. was an early signatory? Where is your strength of character in capitulating to Netanyahu’s expulsion of UNRWA from any role in humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians on the verge of death? Where is your strength of character in surrendering justice to power? And where is your strength of character in 16 months of violating 6 federal statutes conditioning the shipment of weapons to foreign countries—such as protecting human rights and allowing entry of American humanitarian aid, etc.—violated every hour of every day by the Netanyahu genocidal regime? Among the judgements of history on your cowardly, cruel and brutal record, your hatred of Palestinian Arabs and their right to live, you will be known by the moniker of 'Bibi Biden before, Bibi Biden now, and Bibi Biden forever.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCCEMvwnUwfHV8grC4GBnn	2025-01-10T16:30:25-08:00	
Lebanon’s New President Should Pursue Accountability – OpEd	On January 9, 2025, Lebanon’s parliament elected military commander Joseph Aoun as president, ending a two-year political deadlock in the country that resulted in a leadership and governance vacuum. In his first remarks to parliament, President Aoun said that 'a new phase of Lebanon’s history has begun' and vowed to 'protect the sanctity of individual and collective freedoms.' He pledged to work with the new government to adopt a new law on judicial independence, to develop the work of Lebanon’s Public Prosecution Offices, and implement judicial restructuring procedures based on standards of integrity and merit. Aoun said there would be no interference with the work of the judiciary under his term, 'no immunities given to criminals or corrupt individuals,' and promised to reform Lebanon’s prison system. He also vowed to strengthen Lebanon’s social security program, health infrastructure, and public education, and to respect media freedom and the right to freedom of expression 'within [Lebanon’s] constitutional and legal frameworks.' While the new president presents Lebanon with an opportunity to break from decades of impunity that have entrenched severe violations of people’s rights, Aoun’s election is not without controversy as it is at odds with Lebanon’s constitutional prohibition on electing top-level sitting public servants, including military commanders, to the presidency. Human Rights Watch has long called for accountability in Lebanon, most notably for the August 2020 Beirut port explosion and violations of the laws of war, including war crimes, during the 2024 hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. We have also highlighted the urgent need to adopt a law on the independence of the judiciary that meets international standards, greater government transparency, and an end to corrupt practices that have hallowed out the country’s public institutions and degraded public services like electricityand education. Aoun and Lebanon’s new government will be judged by their actions. A new phase in Lebanon’s history will only begin once it implements a new agenda that prioritizes rights over patronage and cronyism.

Seven Inaccuracies About US Support For Somaliland – OpEd	By Joshua Meservey Amid reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration may consider recognizing the self-governing coastal region of Somaliland as independent from Somalia, Somali Ambassador to the United States Dahir Hassan Abdi wrote an op-ed arguing that the US should support a unified Somali state. But the ambassador’s argument relies on numerous inaccuracies. Those are detailed below. 1. Somalia currently has territorial integrity, and recognizing Somaliland would break that integrity. The Somali government does not currently have territorial integrity. Islamist terror group al-Shabaab still controls parts of the country. Somaliland has not been functionally a part of Somalia for decades. And Puntland and Jubaland frequently defy Mogadishu. Arguments premised on fictions are irretrievably broken. 2. The US-Somalia partnership has 'bolstered regional stability.' The region is as unstable as it has been for decades. 3. 'Clan-based ambitions threaten to fracture Somalia’s national cohesion.' There is no national cohesion to fracture, in part because clans remain the fundamental ordering principle of Somalia’s society. Rather than denying that reality, Somalis should build a highly decentralized order that accounts for their preeminent loyalty to clan. The US and its partners should stop pretending that a strong centralized government can work in Somalia. 4. 'The United States must remain committed to Somalia’s sovereignty within its recognized 1960 borders—an enduring policy that has helped stabilize one of the world’s most strategically vital regions.' This is one of Abdi’s strangest claims. Somalia has consistently been among the least stable countries in the world since 1969, and it has in turn caused massive regional unrest. US policy built on the fiction that Somalia is a unified nation with territorial integrity has demonstrably failed. 5. 'A divided Somalia would distract the central government from counterterrorism operations and disrupt the successes already achieved.' Again, Somalia is already divided. Also, Mogadishu already allows all sorts of things, usually petty political squabbles, to distract it from fighting al-Shabaab. The Somali government’s easily distracted nature has proven time and again that it is not a competent counterterrorism partner for the US. 6. 'A unified Somalia . . . can foster transparency, attract responsible investment, and ensure its people benefit from [the country’s] resources—all while reinforcing the stable environment in which US interests can flourish.' The Somali government cannot achieve these lofty goals because Somalia is not unified. Decades of experience demonstrate the country will continue to be divided for the foreseeable future. And it is not clear that unity in Somalia would lead to transparency or competent governance. Mogadishu currently demonstrates neither of those things. There is no reason to believe it will magically improve, even if Somalia somehow, for the first time in its people’s history, becomes unified. 7. 'By helping Somalia strengthen its institutions, enhance security forces, and foster inclusive political dialogue, the United States ensures that clan affiliations enrich national identity rather than fracture it into competing states.' The US and others have formed policy based on this belief for over a decade. It has not worked. Why should it suddenly begin working now? What has changed? Fundamentally, the ambassador’s arguments—and Washington’s current policy toward Somalia—rest on fictions: (a) that Somalia is united, politically or societally, (b) that the government in its current form contributes to regional stability, and (c) that Mogadishu’s actions are a net positive for the US. Washington cannot achieve its goals in the Horn of Africa without first acknowledging reality and building policies that reflect that reality, rather than comforting fictions.

Presidential Elections In Croatia 2025: A Choice Between ‘Constit...	The first round of the eighth presidential elections in the Republic of Croatia was held on 29 December 2024. There were 3,762,224 eligible voters, who cast their votes at 6,755 polling stations in Croatia and abroad. The voter turnout was 46.03%. The President of the Republic of Croatia is elected based on universal and equal suffrage, in direct elections by secret ballot, for a five-year term. The territory of the Republic of Croatia, including polling stations outside its borders, forms a single electoral constituency. The results of the first round of the presidential elections in the Republic of Croatia are: ● Zoran Milanović49.09% (797,938), ● Dragan Primorac 19.35% (314,663), ● Marija Selak Raspudić 9.25% (150,435), ●Ivana Kekin 8.89% (144,533), ● Tomislav Jonjić 5.09% (82,787), ● Miro Bulj 3.82% (62,127), ● Branka Lozo2.41% (39,321), and ● Niko Tokić Kartelo 0.88% (14,409). In the second round of the elections, scheduled for 12 January 2025, the candidates are Zoran Milanović (Social Democratic Party of Croatia – SDP and partners) and Dragan Primorac (Croatian Democratic Union – HDZ and partners). These presidential elections conclude a super election year that has seen European, parliamentary, and presidential elections. They also serve as the final test of political strength and the (re)positioning of key political actors ahead of the upcoming local elections on 18 May 2025. Milanović remains absent from the campaign, with Primorac sidelined One notable feature of Croatia’s presidential elections is the lack of an election campaign, which is unusual for presidential contests. The incumbent President and candidate, Zoran Milanović, has chosen to ignore HDZ's candidate, Dragan Primorac, viewing Prime Minister and HDZ leader Andrej Plenković as his true opponent. As a result, the campaign lacks gravitas and a statesmanlike tone, instead leaning more towards entertainment. This reinforces claims that Croatia is still not a mature and stable democracy, which is at odds with its status as a member of the EU, NATO, the eurozone, and the Schengen Area. The wave of mass emigration from Croatia has 'taken' more young lives than the Second World War and the Homeland War combined. This is the continuation of a second exodus systematically caused by HDZ. The first targeted Serbs during the final military operations of the war, while the second affects Croats for economic reasons – through the destruction of the national economy and social fabric. Milanović insists on 'constitutional' patriotism and the fight against crime and corruption, while Primorac promotes 'false' patriotism, a hallmark of HDZ's traditional rhetoric. HDZ embodies false patriotism, which has devastated and depopulated Croatia, while creating numerous problems, such as tycoonisation, the privileged status of war veterans and the Roman Catholic Church, and unilateral interference in neighbouring countries, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the pretext of the constitutional clause on protecting Croats living abroad. This approach aligns with Croatia’s misuse of EU membership, leveraging it to address bilateral disputes with neighbouring EU candidate countries. Furthermore, it is important to note Croatian misuse of EU funds, which has prompted investigations by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), headed by Laura Codruța Kövesi. Milanović emphasises that his election platform is centred on the constitution, respect for constitutional principles, and the pursuit of a fairer society. He claims that Andrej Plenković and HDZ have 'stolen' the institutions of the Croatian state and failed to respect the constitution. Milanović enjoys the support of parties and individuals across the ideological spectrum, while Primorac noticeably lacks backing from HDZ and Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. There is a sense that HDZ has sidelined Primorac, distancing itself from him to ensure that his potential defeat in the presidential elections is not perceived as a loss for the party or for Plenković personally, which could signal the beginning of the end of Plenković’s leadership era. Zoran Milanović has faced criticism for his lacklustre leadership of Croatia’s government between 2011 and 2016. As Prime Minister, he frequently demonstrated arrogance, both at home and on the international stage. His rhetoric towards Serbia and his stance on events in Bosnia and Herzegovina were equally harsh. There is an expectation that Milanović has since become more politically mature and will deliver on some of the promises hoped for by progressive forces in Croatia, the region, and Europe. Dragan Primorac’s greatest liability is his participation in the government of Prime Minister Ivo Sanader (HDZ), where he served as Minister of Health. That government was riddled with corruption, with no fewer than seven ministers, including Sanader himself, facing criminal charges. This association weighs heavily on Primorac in the current election campaign, as HDZ is the only political party in Croatia to have been legally convicted of corruption. Ivo Sanader was convicted of multiple criminal offences, initially receiving a six-year prison sentence, which is likely to be consolidated into a 10-year term of imprisonment. Adding to the criticism, Primorac faces scrutiny for owning private medical clinics, earning him the label of a healthcare tycoon in Croatia. He has spent four times more than Milanović in the campaign to date. BiH, Serbia, and Montenegro as perennial threats to Croatia Croatia's foreign policy towards the region is, according to analysts, outdated and misaligned with the principles of the EU. Within the EU, this approach resonates with radical right-wing circles, given Croatia’s position bordering the Western Balkans. In their vision, Croatia should become a staging ground for political and other actions. Good neighbourly relations are key to future progress, as neither Slovenia nor Serbia, let alone Bosnia and Herzegovina or Montenegro, objectively pose a threat to Croatia. The greatest danger to Croatia stems from its own destructive policies, positioning the country as a base for potentially controversial actions. Equally concerning are its internal economic and security challenges. Croatia's internal instability and ongoing crisis are the main factors behind its flawed foreign policy, which relies heavily on Russian money and influence. Russian interference in the region and in the country has brought Croatia into the spotlight of American policy and NATO. Heightened American focus is expected to become the only corrective factor for Croatia’s flawed approach to the Western Balkans. For this reason, reports from Croatia’s security and intelligence sector should be taken with caution and a healthy dose of scepticism. There are no substantial differences between the candidates regarding the region. Both share similar positions and actions towards Serbia, which is still perceived in Croatia as a potential danger and threat, often exploited for domestic political purposes. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague ruled in five cases that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina was international in nature, identified Croatia as an aggressor, and confirmed the existence of a Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE) involving Croatia. There is also no fundamental difference between Milanović and Primorac regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina, as both endorse the creation of a third (Croatian) entity and view the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a Croatian 'province.' While Primorac aligns with HDZ’s policy on Bosnia and Herzegovina, within the SDP there is no majority support for its partition or for the policy advocated by Milanović regarding BiH. Croatia continues to fabricate the threat of migrants and the alleged Islamisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina while attempting to obscure the real danger of 'soft' Russian influence and the very 'hard' billions of euros being absorbed into Croatia’s financial and economic systems. It has been noted that Croatia’s security and intelligence agencies are not sufficiently engaged in tracking Russian influence and financial flows within the country. The Croatian leadership maintains close ties with Russians and Milorad Dodik, adopting a protective stance towards him and consistently shielding him from EU sanctions. Croatia blocked Montenegro’s EU negotiation process and declared certain Montenegrin leaders persona non grata over the adoption of a resolution on Jasenovac, the former concentration camp for Jews, Serbs, Roma, and anti-fascists during the era of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Analysts believe that Croatia needs to revise its policy towards the Western Balkans, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro. The current policy generates resistance, strains regional relations, and hampers the European integration process, creating persistent frustrations that are increasingly recognised in Brussels and within the EU. Croatia still lives off the EU Germany contributes the most money to the EU budget, while depending on the calculation method, the largest recipients are Croatia and Poland. Germany pays over 20 billion euros more into the EU budget than it receives, while France contributes over 10 billion euros more than it gets back. In total, ten EU member states contribute more to the common EU budget than they withdraw, while 17 member states receive more than they pay in. The contributions of EU member states to the EU budget are based on their population size and economic strength. An analysis of the share of gross national income (GNI) each country contributes places Germany firmly in the first place, at 0.58% of its GNI. By this criterion, the largest net recipient is Croatia, which receives as much as 3.08% of its total GNI from the EU, amounting to over five billion euros annually. This vividly illustrates that Croatia continues to depend heavily on EU funds and the contributions of its taxpayers. In 2019, the European Commission ceased publishing statistics on net recipients and contributors, as these figures often provoked debate, with numbers from independent research frequently diverging from official EU reports. This discrepancy underscores a lack of transparency and suggests systematic efforts to obscure how EU taxpayers’ money is spent—an issue that demands a more thorough and detailed investigation. Transparency in the use of EU taxpayers’ money is essential, leaving no room for systematic concealment or the so-called 'European secrets' by the European Commission. An election campaign lacking empathy between candidates The election campaign has been dominated by insults, accusations, disinformation, and a lack of meaningful debates, characterised by personal attacks rather than clearly articulated political content. Only one televised debate has been held, lacking any substantive programmatic confrontation. The candidates have not sufficiently addressed issues of foreign policy and national security, even though foreign affairs, the security-intelligence and defence sectors are important parts of the president’s responsibilities. The public impression is that Milanović and Primorac are running for the position of governor in one of Croatia’s 20 counties, rather than for the presidency of the country. Analysts believe that in the second round of the presidential elections in the Republic of Croatia, the incumbent president Zoran Milanović is likely to achieve a convincing victory, despite largely abstaining from the election campaign. However, his re-election will not ease the burden of Croatia’s complex and strained internal relations, particularly within the state leadership. Milanović must remain steadfast in championing constitutional patriotism and reclaiming the 'stolen' institutions of the Croatian state from HDZ. Any deviation from this course risks steering Croatia towards the 'Latin Americanisation' of the state, with unforeseeable consequences, instead of fostering a modern and prosperous country grounded in the rule of law, civil liberties, and citizens’ rights.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCCEMvwnUwfOTHqhU8ytQd	2025-01-10T16:12:41-08:00	
A Deal With Russia At Ukraine’s Expense Will Not Bring Peace – An...	By Olena Snigyr (FPRI) -- Discussions of possible ceasefire negotiations in the war between Russia and Ukraine focus on the concessions that Ukraine could make to stop the hot phase of the war. At the same time, a realistic assessment of the prospects for a truce or peace should be based primarily on an analysis of Russian policy and the goals that Russia wants to achieve through the war with Ukraine. The conditions for negotiations and a truce, which Russia imposes on the West, suggest that a lasting peace is not currently achievable. Restoring the security of the Euro-Atlantic area requires a revision of the Western strategy towards Russia and taking measures that will deprive the Russian authorities of the resources to wage this war. Misperception Has a Price Despite the West’s declarations of commitment to the defense of liberal values and the rules-based order, Western policy toward Russia has maintained a pragmatic approach of diplomatic flexibility even as Russia’s transformation into an authoritarian revisionist aggressive state has been progressing. When deciding on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russians were counting on a restrained reaction from Western countries, similar to that demonstrated during the occupation and annexation of Crimea and even earlier during Russia’s military aggression against Georgia and during Russia’s war against the Chechen people. In all cases, it was a question of undermining and violating the liberal international order, but not a direct conventional threat to the North Atlantic area. It is likely that if the seizure of Ukraine had happened quickly, as the Russian authorities expected, and had not turned into a long and brutal war with huge media coverage, the West would have shown the same restraint and would have pressed the 'reset' button on relations with Russia after a while for the sake of common security and economic cooperation. The Zeitenwende or 'historic turning point' declared by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz occurred because Russia, in the eyes of many in the West, suddenly turned from a predictable partner into an uncontrolled belligerent state whose actions do not fit into the agreed rules of the game and contradict the established Western perceptions of Russia. The actions of the Russian authorities were then perceived as a threat to the security of the Euro-Atlantic area, and Ukraine suddenly became a crucial element in restoring this security. It is a mistake to believe that the war between Russia and Ukraine can end with compromise and concessions from Ukraine. Such agreements could lead to a temporary de-escalation and transfer of the conflict to a low-intensity level, a tried-and-true Russian method of fixing political reality and normalizing relations with the West. The so-called 'truce' between Russia and Ukraine will not lead to a lasting peace, as Russia will not cease to be an aggressive revisionist state whose stability depends largely on war. Current discussions of concessions that Ukraine could make to Russia often have one major common flaw: They overlook that Russia is not making demands on Ukraine, but on the West, and especially on the United States. Russia has made the war with Ukraine a tool to force the West to revise the European security system and the world order. Russia’s allies, China, Iran, and North Korea, are also beneficiaries of this war. Obviously, these countries are not supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine so that Russian President Vladimir Putin can triumphantly announce the annexation of some or all of Ukraine’s territories. It’s safe to say that the alliance of authoritarian countries has a more ambitious goal—to redivide the world into zones of influence and establish new rules of the game. What Russia Wants Russia does not want to negotiate with Ukraine but with the United States and Western Europe on new agreements on new rules in European security. In this context, US President-elect Donald Trump’s previous statements about his intention to reduce US involvement in European security matters are causing Russians to be cautiously optimistic. Russian conditions for the cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, in addition to the actual transfer of Ukraine under Russian control, will also include conditions for: Decreased US presence in European politics Agreements on a new European security architecture in terms of creating a buffer zone between Russia and Western Europe from NATO countries in Central and Eastern Europe Western countries accepting certain obligations and self-restrictions to Russia Lifting of sanctions, compensation for damages, cancellation of the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants for Putin and Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, and the suspension of investigations into Russian war crimes and crimes against humanity Conceptually, such Russian demands are not new: They can be found in all the draft treaties that Russia has proposed to revise security commitments in Europe and to which the West has not agreed. For example, Russian initiatives to reform European security from 2008 to 2009—the draft European Security Treaty and the proposal to reform the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE, the 'Corfu Process') by making OSCE decisions legally binding—were aimed at establishing Russia’s control over political and security decisions through the possibility of Russia or its allies vetoing any decision regarding security cooperation in the Euro-Atlantic area and any assistance to a third country in the event of armed aggression against it (Article 8 of the EST). Draft security treaties, such as the Agreement on Security Arrangements between the Russian Federation and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Security Assurances Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America, contain the ultimatums that Russia issued to the United States on the eve of its full-scale aggression against Ukraine in December 2021 and also contain requirements for the creation of a buffer zone comprised of NATO countries. The draft Russia-US Treaty required US consent to an exclusively Russian zone of influence within the former Soviet Union, and Article 4 of the draft NATO-Russia Agreement requires the return of the Alliance’s security capabilities to the 1997 borders, expanding Russia’s zone of special interest from post-Soviet countries, including the Baltic states, to Central and Eastern Europe. While Russia’s demands don’t explicitly call for NATO’s dissolution, granting them would effectively dismantle the alliance and the Euro-Atlantic security order. In turn, the draft Treaty on Permanent Neutrality and Security Assurances for Ukraine of 2022 explicitly provides for the obligation of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom to not cooperate with Ukraine in the security sphere and the obligation to obtain Russia’s consent for any assistance to Ukraine in the event of external aggression against it (Article 5). It is worth recalling that in February 2022, Russia’s proposal to 'establish long-term legally binding security guarantees in Europe' was supported by China. If we trace the evolution of Russian proposals, we can see that they did not conceptually change; only the rhetoric became more intense. So, we can say that Russia believed political reality was changing in its favor and allowing it to put forward bolder conditions to the West—if, in the noughties, Russian leadership cautiously insisted on a post-Soviet zone of influence, now the borders of Russia’s special interest zone are being pushed back to those of the former Warsaw Pact. Russia’s demands are being voiced on an increasing scale and are supported by the gradual creation of a new political reality—what was considered impossible five to ten years ago is now becoming a subject of negotiations, and thus new and bolder goals are becoming more achievable for the Russians. Why Russia Succeeded Russia’s success has several prerequisites—some of which include the misinterpretation and misunderstanding of Russia, Russian strategic culture, and Russian behavior by the West. Russia’s strategic culture is composed of authoritarian norms, beliefs, and values, underpinned by historical resentment and revisionism, and views relations with other countries as a zero-sum game in which the limits of what is permissible are determined only by (the balance of) power. It would be true to say that there has never been a democracy in Russia. The game of democracy (with its peculiarities) was necessary for Russian leaders to convince Western countries that rapprochement with Russia was not a threat. It is difficult to say whether perceptual blindness or a choice in favor of promising energy cooperation was more prevalent in Western countries’ assessments of Russia’s behavior and intentions, but it gave Moscow the opportunity to change the political reality in the European security space step by step, first by discrediting and reducing the authority of soft security institutions such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE and then by violating the principle of territorial integrity and unleashing a full-scale war. Another prerequisite for the success of Russian foreign policy on the European security direction is that Western countries preferred to adapt to the new political and security environment created by Russia without changing their approaches to security. The inertia of the defense policy paradigms of some Western countries was stronger than the shock of Russia’s occupation and annexation of Crimea and even the outbreak of a full-scale war in Europe. Even today, NATO member states have different perceptions of the threats posed by Russia, some of which do not consider its actions to be a direct threat to their territorial integrity and security. This differentiation in assessing threats and risks affects NATO’s defense capabilities and creates an atmosphere of uncertainty about the security guarantees of NATO member states. After all, even the famous Article 5 of the treaty is limited in assisting the attacked Party by outlining that NATO should take 'such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.' Despite statements by Western leaders about their strong intentions to protect the security of the Euro-Atlantic area, the difference in defense policy paradigms among NATO member states creates uncertainty about what response NATO Allies would consider appropriate to an act of aggression against one of them. It is also unclear whether protecting the security of the Euro-Atlantic area includes protecting the territorial integrity of NATO member states. Russia also does not know this yet and wants to eliminate this uncertainty. Of the four possible scenarios for stopping the war between Russia and Ukraine analyzed by John Lough in the Chatham House Briefing Report, three, the 'Long War,' the 'Frozen Conflict,' and the 'Defeat for Ukraine,' are winning for Russia. The shock of Russia’s actions has already worn off, and people are getting used to the current political reality. Since some NATO member states do not see the very existence of the Russian political regime as a threat to them, they may look for ways to return to full partnership with Russia and may likely discuss Russia’s conditions for creating a new buffer zone in Central and Eastern Europe. At the same time, there should be no mistaking the meaning of neutrality or a 'buffer zone' of any kind between Russia and the old NATO member states. Any buffer security space will be seen by Russia as an opportunity to expand its zone of control. Other NATO countries will look for additional opportunities to strengthen their own security by concluding additional treaties, such as the Trinity House Agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Differences in assessments of external threats among NATO allies, coupled with a possible decline in US involvement in European security, will create tensions within the Alliance and reduce the already unclear level of joint commitments. In such circumstances, Russia, together with its allies, may decide to launch a direct aggression against a NATO member to confirm the inoperability of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture and create a new political reality in Europe on Russia’s terms. Conditions for Lasting Truce Apparently, Putin believes that Russia is close to a strategic breakthrough in the war with Ukraine and in its confrontation with the West and, therefore, is not interested in ending the war. The model of limited deterrence of Russia chosen by the West proved ineffective and gave Russian authorities time to adapt to the new conditions. Predictions of Russia’s economic and technological collapse due to limited sanction pressure proved irrelevant. The Russian economy has adapted, and it is now dependent on the war while simultaneously being the basis for waging war. The war has also become a necessary condition for the domestic political stability of the Russian regime. Russia is waging a war of attrition in which cheap resources and cheap, mass-produced technology are crucial. China’s support is also an important element of Russia’s resilience. While formally remaining in the shadows, China is supporting Russia politically, economically, and technologically in the war against Ukraine (in fact, against the West) and is studying the conventional experience of this war and the possibilities of adapting to sanctions. The successes Russia is achieving are beneficial to China. To a certain extent, Beijing views Russia as a proxy in its rivalry with the United States because, in the Sino-Russian tandem, Russia does all the 'dirty work' and takes all the risks in confronting the West. The only way to stop Russia’s war against Ukraine and achieve lasting peace is to make this war unprofitable and dangerous for the Russian political regime or to weaken Russia so much that it will be unable to wage war. The Kremlin will see all other compromise options as intermediate achievements in the war with the West and will be converted into an escalation of the confrontation. Today, it is hardly possible to talk about a lasting peace in the war Russia is waging. The prospect of peace is only possible if Russia itself undergoes internal transformations. At the same time, in the short term, states can discuss a lasting truce, provided that the West abandons its comfortable anti-escalation strategy and adopts a strategy of forceful deterrence and depowering Russia. Most discussions about how to stop this war center on the compromise that Ukraine could make. Instead, the discussion should primarily be about how to stop Russia. Western policy toward Russia today is aimed at minimizing the risk of escalation. It is limited by the strategic dilemma of 'not letting Russia win, but not letting Russia fall' and constrained by the narratives that Russians themselves spread. For example, the prospect of weakening and destabilizing Russia has traditionally been rejected by the West because of the risks associated with nuclear weapons. Thus, from the point of view of nuclear security, the stability of the Russian authoritarian regime is considered beneficial and necessary despite the destructive actions of this regime. Russian authorities also skillfully use nuclear-related concerns to contain the West, such as in its military support for Ukraine, and promote the narrative that the West is to blame for the increased risks of a nuclear confrontation. Another narrative that narrows the West’s policy options toward Russia is spread by the so-called Russian opposition in exile and claims that Russia can be transformed into a liberal democratic state while maintaining its territorial integrity. At the same time, critics of this idea say that because Russia is not a homogeneous nation-state, successful liberalization will inevitably lead to the decolonization of Russia—to its disintegration, which, as the experience of the collapse of the Soviet Union shows, can have many stakeholders, be controlled, and carry minimal risks. An argument in favor of the impossibility of liberalizing Russia without a radical transformation is that Russian society has no successful liberal democratic experience, and all attempts at partial liberalization in Russia have led to a loss of political control, protest movements, and, as a result, a return to authoritarianism. Authoritarian Russia pursues an aggressive foreign policy and launches wars as soon as it has sufficient resources to do so. A weak Russia does not wage war. At present, Russia is more effectively using the war with Ukraine to destroy the Euro-Atlantic security architecture than the West is using Ukraine to contain Russia. The Kremlin has enough resources to wage war, both human and financial. A sociological study by the Center for Analysis and Strategies in Europe shows that the Russian government has enough human resources to fight a war for the next few years without declaring mobilization. The analysis of the state and processes in the Russian economy also demonstrates the ability to meet war needs for the next few years. In a war of attrition, Ukraine is depleting faster than Russia, but there is still time and opportunity to change the strategy and stop Russia. To achieve, if not a lasting peace, then at least a lasting truce, it is necessary not only to arm Ukraine sufficiently and remove all political reservations on the use of the provided weapons on Russian territory but also to move to a policy of complete economic isolation of Russia by the West, and most importantly, to stop the flow of oil and gas revenues, which is the main resource for waging war and sustaining Russian authoritarianism.

A Wagner Mercenary Who Crossed US-Mexican Border Was Honored In R...	By Carl Schreck, Mark Krutov, Mike Eckel and Ramazan Alpaut (RFE/RL) -- A self-confessed veteran of Russia's Wagner paramilitary group arrested for crossing into the United States from Mexico appears to have been honored as a combat veteran weeks earlier by an organization established by Russian President Valdimir Putin, RFE/RL has found. Timur Praliev, 31, was detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents on January 4 near the border town of Roma, Texas, after crossing the Rio Grande River into the United States and told the agents he was a citizen of Kazakhstan, U.S. federal court records show. At a January 7 court appearance before a federal judge in McAllen, Texas, a federal prosecutor said Praliev was in possession of both Russian and Kazakh passports, cash, and a drone he carried in his backpack, a local television channel reported. Praliev also admitted to being a member of Wagner, the channel’s website, Valley Central, cited Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda McColgan as saying. Wagner has fought among Russian ranks in the Kremlin’s all-out war on Ukraine and elsewhere in the world. The paramilitary group has been designated a 'transnational criminal organization' by the U.S. Treasury Department. After pleading guilty to unlawful entry into the United States, Praliev was convicted and sentenced to time served. His current whereabouts are unclear. Online records reviewed by RFE/RL show that less than a month before his detention, a man of the same name had been honored at an event held by an official government veterans’ organization in Russia’s Bashkortostan region. An account of the December 12, 2024, event was published on Russian social media by the Bashkortostan branch of Defenders Of The Fatherland Foundation. The group was established by Putin in April 2023 to support combat veterans of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Attempts to reach the foundation for comment were unsuccessful. Photographs from the event show a man identified as Timur Praliev receiving his certification as a combat veteran. The post identified the Timur Praliev shown in the photograph as a 'former employee' of Wagner who has ties to Iglinsky, a municipality east of the regional capital, Ufa. RFE/RL located a profile for a user named Timur Praliev on the Russian social-networking site Vkontakte with a listed birth year -- 1993 -- matching that listed for Praliev in U.S. court records. A Kazakhstan-based acquaintance of the man who received the combat-veteran certification in Bashkortostan confirmed to RFE/RL that the Vkontakte account was that of the man shown being honored at the event. An RFE/RL inquiry sent via direct message to the account went unanswered. During Praliev’s court appearance, McColgan said the U.S. government 'is concerned about [the] safety of the community when this defendant is released' because of his affiliation with Wagner, 'a group associated with political violence,' Valley Central quoted the prosecutor as saying. A U.S. magistrate judge ordered Praliev to remain in federal custody, Valley Central said. Neither the U.S. attorney office for southern Texas nor the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol regional office overseeing that section of the U.S.-Mexican border immediately responded to e-mails or voicemails from RFE/RL seeking further details. Founded by St. Petersburg chef Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin confidant, Wagner grew to be one of Russia’s most notorious private military companies. Its soldiers were deployed in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, and more recently Ukraine, where Wagner fighters played a key role in the capture of the city of Bakhmut. In August 2023, two months after staging a brief, but serious coup attempt, Prigozhin died in a mysterious plane crash north of Moscow. U.S. intelligence officials have said they believe Prigozhin was assassinated.

Slovak Opposition Incensed By Fico’s Moscow Scrutiny ‘Farce’	By Natália Silenská (EurActiv) -- Slovak opposition MPs have lashed out after a parliamentary session on Prime Minister Robert Fico's growing infatuation with Russia's Vladimir Putin was monolpolised by the ruling party. During a session of the parliamentary committee on European affairs, Fico was expected to explain his recent meeting in Moscow with the Russian leader. But the debate instead saw the populist Slovak premier launch fresh attacks on Ukraine and the domestic opposition, who were largely sidelined throughout. The Friday session lasted 90 minutes, with over an hour filled with passionate defences of Fico by members of his Smer-SD party. Opposition MPs, who had convened the meeting yet received little speaking time, expressed intense frustration at the meeting's conduct. 'This entire activity has brought us nothing,' said Michal Šimečka, leader of the country's largest opposition party Progressive Slovakia, adding that the meeting 'turned into a farce'. Juraj Krúpa of the centre-right SaS said he was 'truly furious about how this unfolded' and accused Fico of working to maintain Russian influence in Slovakia. Fico's Moscow visit in December sparked pro-EU public protests across Slovakia, with the newest wave planned for Friday evening. Lack of transparency The opposition criticised Fico’s trip to Moscow as non-transparent – noting that even the president was not informed about it – and harmful to Slovakia’s international standing. Fico did not publicly announce his plan to visit Moscow prior to the trip itself, with the the Slovak public only becoming aware of it after Russian media reports. During Friday's session, Fico told MPs he had informed European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa about the trip days in advance. How long Fico stayed in Moscow and on which plane he travelled there is unclear. The Slovak government has stated it was a private trip not funded by state money, despite Fico initially describing the meeting as work-related. In the days following the Moscow visit, Fico’s whereabouts were unknown until Slovak newspaper Denník N and NGO Nadácia Zastavme Korupciu uncovered that he had been on a luxury vacation in Vietnam. Fico's hot air on gas transit When Fico did field questions about the visit on Friday, he said his discussions with Putin focused on gas transit through Ukraine, ceasefire possibilities, and a potential peace summit in Slovakia. But he also made several anti-Ukrainian statements, claiming that 'unlike Ukraine, Russia has always been a reliable gas supplier,' appearing to absolve Russia of responsibility for their history of cutting gas supplies to Slovakia. Fico has repeatedly criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of 'going around Europe begging for money.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcwlcy1px3ZVAjPzN308STm	2025-01-10T16:00:13-08:00	
Brazil: Official Inflation In 2024 Hits 4.83%, Exceeding Target L...	By Bruno de Freitas Moura With a December result of 0.52 percent, the country's official inflation ended 2024 at 4.83 percent, exceeding the government's target limit. The government's inflation target for 2024 was set at 3 percent, with a tolerance margin of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. This means the 2024 National Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) exceeded the target by 0.33 percentage points. The result marks the highest inflation since 2022, when it reached 5.79 percent. The data, released on Friday (Jan. 10) in Rio de Janeiro by the government´s statistics agency IBGE, also reveal that food and beverages had the greatest impact on Brazilians' expenses throughout 2024. Prices in this category rose by 7.62 percent, contributing 1.63 percentage points to the overall IPCA. Impact of weather conditions According to the survey's manager, Fernando Gonçalves, the increase in food prices is attributed to the 'impact of adverse weather conditions, which occurred at various times throughout the year and across different regions of the country.' The next largest pressures came from the health and personal care (6.09%, contributing 0.81 percentage points) and transportation (3.3%, contributing 0.69 percentage points) categories. Together, these three groups accounted for approximately 65 percent of the inflation in 2024. IBGE tracks the price behavior of 377 products and services. Among them, gasoline had the most significant impact on the cost of living, with a 9.71 percent increase, contributing 0.48 percentage points. It was followed by health insurance, which rose by 7.87 percent, accounting for 0.31 percentage points, and eating out, which became 5.7 percent more expensive, contributing 0.2 percentage points.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcwlcy1px3ZVDipWcsIxzxi	2025-01-10T15:58:28-08:00	
Rakhine Rebels Seize First Police Station In Myanmar’s Heartland	The Arakan Army has seized a police station in the Ayeyarwaddy region, the first in Myanmar’s heartland to fall to the ethnic Rakhine rebels since the 2021 military coup. Until now, the Arakan Army, or AA, has been fighting junta troops in Rakhine state, in Myanmar’s west, where it controls nearly all townships, and other states and regions on the country’s periphery. Now the emboldened rebel army is moving beyond its traditional territory. Thursday’s capture of the police station in Pathein township is the latest sign that the junta is losing ground as the civil war grinds toward its fourth full year. The AA, assisted by fighters with anti-junta People’s Defense Forces, or PDF, took the station in Shwethaungyan sub-township, near the border with Rakhine state on Thursday, despite the military launching several airstrikes to defend it, residents told RFA Burmese. Ma Gyi Zin village and surrounding areas in the northernmost part of Shwethaungyan are now under AA control, the residents said Friday, speaking to RFA on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'Ma Gyi Zin, on the far side of Shwethaungyan, has fallen,' said a resident of the sub-township who is familiar with the military situation there. 'Yesterday, the bombing targeted Pauk Taw Kwin and Ma Gyi Zin Pyar [villages], near Ma Gyi Zin village.' The resident said that the military launched airstrikes on Ma Gyi Zin Pyar, to the east of Ma Gyi Zin, 'because [the junta’s] troops have already withdrawn from Ma Gyi Zin.' 'The village is already on fire, and this is what’s happening in the Ayeyarwaddy region,' he said. The airstrikes caused casualties, the resident said, although exact details remain unclear. The strikes destroyed Ma Gyi Zin village, along with schools and monasteries in nearby Pone Nyat Maw and Ku Lar Chaung villages, other residents told RFA. The junta has stationed troops near Baw Mi village, south of the affected areas, to prepare to defend their position, they said, adding that 'hundreds' of military troop reinforcements are being sent to the area from nearby Thabaung sub-township. The number of people who have fled Ma Gyi Zin and nearby villages to Chaungthar, Shwethaungyan and Thabaung sub-townships is unknown. When contacted, Khin Maung Kyi, the junta’s Ayeyarwaddy regional spokesperson and minister of social affairs, said he was 'unaware of the current situation' regarding the battles. Moving beyond Rakhine state Since early January, the AA, which controls nearly all townships in Rakhine state, has been attacking military bases in the bordering regions of Ayeyarwaddy, Bago and Magway, according to residents. On Dec. 29, AA insurgents captured the west coast town of Gwa from the military, a major step toward their goal of taking the whole of Rakhine state, and then said they were ready for talks with the junta, which seized power in a February 2021 coup d’etat. However, nearly a week later, the military had carried out at least six airstrikes since the proposal in the AA-controlled townships of Ponnagyun, Ann, Gwa and Myebon, killing 10 civilians and injuring more than a dozen others, residents told RFA Burmese.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcwlcy1px3ZVHjMTn9BMub5	2025-01-10T15:56:18-08:00	
Many Reasons For Optimism About Syria And Lebanon – OpEd	By Faisal J. Abbas They say all good things come to an end, and surely the same argument applies to bad things too. At least this is what we have noticed recently in both Syria and Lebanon.In December, Syrians got rid of the brutal Assad regime, which governed with terror, torture, and tyranny for over five decades. The regime was replaced by a transitional government led by Ahmad Al-Sharaa, previously known as Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham.Yesterday, Lebanon — another failed Arab state — elected a president, Gen. Joseph Aoun, after a two-year vacuum, its first freely elected head of state since 1990, with no influence or pressure from the Syrian regime or from Hezbollah.Yes, it could be argued that the rise of both Al-Sharaa and Aoun was a direct result of a weakened Iranian proxy influence in the Levant. However, a power vacuum does not always guarantee the rise of a better alternative. In fact, in many cases throughout history, it has brought chaos and even worse regimes.It is too early to judge the new leaders of Syria and Lebanon by their actions. But at least when it comes to their words, one cannot help but raise one’s hat to the truly refreshing pledges and reassuring promises made by both Al-Sharaa and Aoun.Al-Sharaa, who many feared would turn Syria into an ideological Islamist state given his background, has taken everyone by surprise by pledging inclusivity, guaranteeing minority rights, and saying that the West has nothing to fear from Syria. He even went on to say that the country is in no condition to wage wars and wants to focus on reconstruction and rebuilding. Even though Al-Sharaa technically has absolute power, he was adamant to repeat during several media interviews that he would leave legislation to the legislators, and called for an urgent national dialogue to ensure a new constitution is written.Not too long after that, Aoun was elected as president. Not wasting any time, he immediately made his mandate clear: 'Lebanon will no longer be a country for mafias, drug trafficking, or money laundering.' A reassuring message to Gulf and Arab countries.He also made it clear that he would not negotiate on Lebanese sovereignty. Only the state will bear arms and only the army has the right to protect Lebanese borders, and he will stand up to any Israeli intrusions. This is a direct message to any militants or so-called resistance groups that decide to take the law into their own hands.For the Lebanese themselves, they heard exactly what they needed to hear: 'If one of us falls, we all fall. There will be no immunity for criminals or corrupt individuals. No interference in the judiciary.'Perhaps in the Middle East, we — rightly — believe that actions speak louder than words, considering we have been disappointed many times in the past. However, nobody can deny that, for now, the words from both Al-Sharaa and Aoun are exactly what we have waited a long time to hear.Their actions must follow suit, but if both leaders are sincere and committed to their vision, it is very clear that they will get full support from Riyadh and beyond.What is also reassuring is that in both cases, Syria and Lebanon, it is virtually impossible for what comes next to be worse than what was. For now, we can rejoice that the leaders of both countries are at least sounding like true statesmen, and for that they deserve for us to wish them the best of luck. Faisal J.

US Intelligence Mostly Rejects Links Between ‘Havana Syndrome,’ A...	By Jeff Seldin U.S. intelligence agencies charged with investigating the spate of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of officials remain unconvinced that the illnesses are tied to the work of a foreign adversary. An updated intelligence assessment of what the U.S. government calls anomalous health incidents, or AHIs, released Friday calls the possibility that the health symptoms were caused by a foreign actor or weapon 'very unlikely.' The conclusion, endorsed by five of the seven U.S. intelligence agencies tasked with investigating the ailments, commonly known as Havana Syndrome, match the results of a 2023 assessment that found symptoms 'were probably the result of factors that did not involve a foreign adversary, such as preexisting conditions, conventional illnesses and environmental factors.' New information, described by officials as being 'sensitive' in nature, only served to further support the 2023 findings, they said. 'The intelligence does not link a foreign actor to these events. Indeed, it points away from their involvement,' according to a U.S. intelligence official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the latest findings. 'All IC [intelligence community] components agree that years of history collection, targeting and analytic efforts have not surfaced compelling intelligence reporting that ties a foreign actor to any specific event reported as a possible AHI,' the official said. The new assessment contrasts, however, with a December House Intelligence subcommittee report, which accused U.S. intelligence agencies of sloppy work and attempting to 'create a politically palatable conclusion.' There is reliable evidence to suggest that some anomalous health incidents are the work of foreign adversaries,' CIA Subcommittee Chairman Rick Crawford, a Republican, said at the time. On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Mike Turner, accused the new U.S. intelligence report of again falling short. 'This new intelligence, I believe, should completely change the assessment of our adversaries’ capabilities and the risks to our personnel,' he said. Despite the disagreement, some of the evidence pointing to foreign involvement in Havana Syndrome injuries appears to be finding more credibility with some elements of U.S. intelligence. Two of the seven agencies contributing to the latest assessment, which looked at intelligence gathered as recently as last month, now assess with 'low confidence' that a foreign hand could be involved in a limited number of cases. One of the agencies now judges 'there is ‘roughly even chance’ a foreign actor has used a novel weapon or prototype device to harm a small, undetermined subset of the USG [U.S. government] personnel or dependents,' according to the declassified assessment. The other agency concluded there is a 'roughly even chance' that a U.S. adversary has developed such a weapon, although the report states even if that is the case, 'it is unlikely a foreign actor has deployed such a weapon in any events reported as possible AHIs.' The U.S. intelligence official who spoke with reporters described the change as 'subtle,' arguing, 'they shift from unlikely with low confidence to roughly even chance with low confidence.' But White House officials Friday seemed to see the change as something more significant. 'Today’s updated Intelligence Community Assessment, which is the product of ongoing analytic efforts and includes a shift in key judgments by some intelligence components,' said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett. '[It] only reinforces why it is vital that the U.S. government continue critical research, investigate credible incidents and strengthen efforts to provide timely care and long-term clinical follow-up,' he said. That includes ongoing research into the potential to weaponize pulsed electromatic energy. A February 2022 report by a panel of experts warned that the core symptoms in a small number of Havana Syndrome cases were 'distinctly unusual' and suggested some sort of device must be responsible. 'Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,' the 2022 report said. U.S. officials have, until now, mostly dismissed such claims, arguing that nothing in the available intelligence agencies or in medical studies supports that radiofrequency waves could be weaponized. Medical research has 'historically shown no harmful bioeffects,' according to the latest U.S. assessment. But the new assessment noted, 'more recent, limited studies have produced mixed preliminary results.' 'We have made it a priority to continue research in this area, to understand the effects of directed energy, which is an area that requires much more ongoing work,' a senior administration official told reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. response. 'There's a lot that we do not understand,' the official said. 'We are gaining greater insight over time.' The admission is not enough for some suffering from Havana Syndrome. The new assessment 'disgracefully continues to hide the truth behind a cloak of secrecy,' said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents dozens of victims. Zaid said he has filed a request to declassify the full report and called on President-elect Donald Trump to 'require full disclosure of what the government knows.' 'Evidence of the use of directed energy, particularly by Russia, of some form spans decades,' Zaid said in a statement shared with VOA. 'The CIA has sought to cover up its knowledge through both Democrat and Republican administrations, and classified information exists that we have knowledge of that fundamentally contradicts today’s report.' Others have challenged the U.S. intelligence findings on Havana Syndrome. An investigation in April by CBS's '60 Minutes' show, Germany's Der Spiegel and The Insider said a review of travel documents and mobile phone records, along with eyewitness testimony and interviews with multiple U.S. officials and victims, shows that Russia is likely to blame. Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia's military intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and assassinations. It found that members of GRU Unit 29155 had received awards and promotions for their work on sound or radio frequency-based directed energy weapons. The U.S. intelligence official Friday, however, pushed back against the findings. 'The claims do not hold up to scrutiny,' the official said. Cases of Havana Syndrome were first publicly reported among diplomats and other employees at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. Symptoms range from nausea and dizziness to debilitating headaches and memory problems, with cases having been reported in Russia, China, Poland, Austria and the United States. 'These are our colleagues and friends,' said the U.S. intelligence official, stressing that the assessment’s failure to link to a foreign adversary is not meant to question the suffering of those afflicted. 'These personnel and their dependents experienced genuine, sometimes painful and traumatic, physical symptoms and sensory phenomena, and they honestly and sincerely reported those events as possible,' the official said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcwlcy1px3ZVLy-EUX16IZ5	2025-01-10T15:52:36-08:00	
Article 370 And Kashmir: Navigating A Path To Peace – Analysis	By Ayjaz Wani On 16 October 2024, Omar Abdullah was sworn in as the chief minister of the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), a space marked by significant regional divisions in political preferences. This divide was evidenced by the considerable variance in the area-wise performance of political parties in the three-phase assembly election held during September-October 2024. The National Conference (NC) and Indian National Congress (INC)-led alliance won 40 out of 47 seats in the Kashmir province, securing a vote share of 41.08 percent. Conversely, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dominated in Jammu, winning 29 seats with a vote share of 45.23 percent. Amid this apparent divide in the multi-religious and multi-ethnic UT, political discourse during the election focused on the dilution of Article 370 by New Delhi, showing that seeds of separatism were still prominent within the Kashmiri socio-political mindset. Soon after the first phase of the assembly session on 4 November, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) moved a resolution opposing the revocation of Article 370, and the special status enjoyed by the erstwhile J&K state. Two days later, NC’s Deputy Chief Minister moved a resolution to restore Kashmir’s special status revoked by New Delhi on 5 August 2019. The resolution expressed concern over the unilateral removal of special status passed by the Parliament of India without any debate, amidst noisy scenes from the BJP benches. The NC-led government and the PDP’s reignition of the pre-autonomy revocation politics have not only complicated New Delhi’s policy for the integration of Kashmir into the rest of India but also reinforced a false political rhetoric. Article 370 and separatism Article 370, incorporated into the Indian Constitution in 1949, became a tool for exploitation by political leaders at both the central and regional levels. Regional politicians misused the autonomy granted by this article for misgovernance, corruption, and autocratic rule, while the central government often turned a blind eye to these wrongdoings. This misuse led to Pakistan-supported terrorism, trapping the Valley in a state of unrest for decades. Draconian laws like the Public Safety Law of 1978, which denied fundamental rights to common Kashmiris, further amplified the state’s misgovernance and corruption under its autocratic leadership. The ruling class blatantly usurped central funds for personal gains. The blatant misuse of state funds and a culture of favouritism and nepotism made the erstwhile J&K India’s second-most corrupt state in 2005. The fake arms licenses scam (2012-2016), which impacted six other states in India, became a national security threat and revealed a deep and unhealthy nexus between the state’s police, bureaucracy and its criminals. Mismanagement, autocratic governance, and pervasive corruption eroded the trust of ordinary Kashmiris in democracy. Additionally, political parties exploited Article 370 to manipulate public sentiment and turn the people against the central government in New Delhi. In August 2019, New Delhi decided to change the state’s institutional and constitutional arrangements to align with the people of J&K’s future aspirations for stability, socio-economic advancement, and national integration. The Supreme Court upheld New Delhi's decision to abrogate Article 370 and directed that J&K be restored to statehood as soon as possible. The court clarified that Article 370 was a temporary provision, to facilitate the establishment of a Constituent Assembly, and ease the integration of J&K with the Union of India, following the newly-formed Pakistan’s aggression in 1947. Against this backdrop, the resolutions introduced by the PDP and the ruling NC in the J&K Assembly’s first session raise concerns about sustained regional peace and stability. These actions highlight the regional political parties' parochial focus on petty advantages and indicate their wilful disobedience of the Supreme Court’s judgment. Representing people’s aspirations Soon after the assembly elections, Pakistan and its agencies began to instigate trouble in the Kashmir Valley through a series of terror incidents. On 20 October, an attack by The Resistance Front (TRF), a Pakistan-based terror outfit, killed seven people and injured five in the Ganderbal district. On 2 November, security agencies killed a long-wanted foreign terrorist in the heart of Srinagar. The situation escalated further on 3 November when a grenade attack in Srinagar killed one woman and injured ten people. Many ordinary Kashmiris, particularly the youth, are frustrated with terrorism and have condemned terror incidents while staging protests against Pakistan and its terror organisations. Most educated youth want to sustain peace and normalcy, towards which the UT has gradually moved since 2019. Given Pakistan’s intensified proxy war in J&K, regional political parties must pass a resolution condemning terrorism and violence, instead of supporting historical blunders like Article 370 to keep separatism and centrifugal tendencies alive. The NC-led government should support the youth’s aspirations for a peaceful and prosperous J&K, rather than resorting to political gimmicks and rhetoric. According to reports, over 900,000 people are drug addicts in the UT, and even religious leaders have begun delivering sermons condemning escalating drug abuse in the region, highlighting the urgent need for action. Regional parties must prioritise tackling the alarming rise in drug addiction among the youth. These drugs, brought in from across the border, lay bare Pakistan’s intent to cripple the UT’s social core, as well as its covert support to terrorism and insurgency, demanding immediate action to prevent further social disintegration and protect the future of the region’s youth. Regional political parties must step away from the grip of historical grievances and separatist politics that aid Pakistan's evil designs. Instead, they should focus on the genuine aspirations of the people of J&K, particularly the youth, who deserve a brighter future. Thousands of unemployed youth from the open merit category have sharply criticised the reservation policy, which has reserved more than 60 percent of jobs for weaker sections of society since its enforcement came into force post-2019. Regional political parties must embrace integration by focusing on the needs and aspirations of the people in J&K, promoting social harmony and inclusivity. This approach will foster a brighter future for the region, characterised by peace, prosperity, and inclusive development. If they fail to do so, J&K will relapse into turmoil and terror.

Afghanistan Faces A Complex Set Of Challenges In 2025: Here’s Wha...	The year just ended was a tumultuous one for Afghanistan, marked by many significant events that will continue to challenge the country in 2025. ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) carried out at least 19 terrorist attacks, targeting Hazara and Shia civilians, Sufi adherents, foreign nationals and Taliban officials. One notable incident was the assassination of Khalil Rahman Haqqani, a senior Taliban leader and brother of the late Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani Network. The United Nations (U.N.) reported rising insecurity in 2024, and recorded 8,650 security incidents between November 2023 and November 2024. The U.N. noted that 156 civilians were killed and 426 others injured, many of these incidents attributed to ISIS-K. Hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalated, with Pakistan conducting airstrikes on Afghan territory in response to attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. The Afghan Taliban rounded out the year by attacking'several points' in Pakistan in retaliation for the strikes. The Taliban faced internal divisions and security challenges. Criticism within the Taliban leadership, particularly regarding policies on women’s rights and medical education, highlighted growing fractures within the group, presenting the world with the situation where Sirajuddin Haqqani is now considered moderate. Despite global diplomatic efforts, including summits in Doha, Moscow and Tehran, the Taliban failed to secure global recognition as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The U.N. Security Council meeting in December 2024 revealed sharp differences among permanent members on how to engage with the Taliban. In December 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law allowing the future removal of the Taliban from the official list of terrorist organizations. And in February 2024, Chinese leader Xi Jinping accepted the credentials of the Taliban’s official envoy to Beijing. Though the West expects the Taliban to modify their policies to secure legitimacy, recognition by Russia and China may prompt Afghanistan’s neighbors in Iran and the Central Asian republics to recognize the Taliban, reasoning that they are 'neighbors forever' and must establish a modus vivendi. Armed opposition groups such as the National Resistance Front and the Afghanistan Freedom Front carried out numerous attacks against the Taliban. The U.N. documented multiple instances of human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings of military personnel and officials of the ousted Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan remains one of the most severe in the world, with 28 million people depending on aid to survive. The country’s economy has contracted by almost one-third in the aftermath of August 2021, leading to widespread unemployment, poverty and food insecurity. Despite international efforts, including the U.S. provision of up to $8 billion in aid to Kabul since August 2021, some Taliban policies, including restrictions on girls’ education and women’s employment, continue to exacerbate the crisis. Challenges for Afghanistan in 2025 include continuing human rights violations, economic instability and food insecurity; climate-related natural disasters; and regional political dynamics. Despite improved security, significant challenges persist due to 45 years of conflict. According to the U.N., almost half of the population — around 22.9 million people — will require humanitarian assistance due to limited access to basic services and chronic needs. This includes widespread food insecurity, with 14.8 million people facing acute food insecurity. The economy, which previously subsisted on foreign aid and opium poppy cultivation, has contracted significantly since the Taliban takeover in 2021, with widespread unemployment, underemployment, household debt and poverty affecting around 48 percent of the population. Though the U.N. recently reported 'The Afghan economy showed some signs of recovery,' the financial system remains isolated, and development funding is drastically reduced. Afghanistan is also experiencing its fifth consecutive year of drought, with earthquakes, floods and landslides exacerbating humanitarian needs. A La Niña episode in 2025 could lead to further drought-like conditions, as well as reduced snowfall and rainfall. This will worsen food insecurity, with one-third of the Afghan population acutely food insecure. Drought will affect crop and pasture productivity, leading to higher food prices and increased economic hardship. Years of over-extraction, inadequate water resource management and insufficient groundwater recharge have led to a severe water crisis. This affects agriculture and access to clean water for millions of people. The Qosh Tepa irrigation canal will divert up to 20 percent of the flow of the Amu Darya river, increasing tensions with downstream, water-starved Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the latter of which has pledged to send a technical team to assist with the construction methods that will cause 'excessive water loss and soil salinization,' according to the Center for the National Interest. The Taliban will be challenged to support regional connectivity projects, including the Trans-Afghan Railway Project that will connect Central Asia to Afghanistan to Pakistan; the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-Indianatural gas pipeline; and the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan high-voltage power transmission line. Key to regional integration is improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which means resolving the disputes over the shared border, and the status of 1.45 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. After NATO left Afghanistan in August 2021, Pakistan expected to reap an influential role in Afghanistan’s future, but instead got attacks by the Pakistani Taliban from its bases in Afghanistan. Pakistan retaliated and the Afghan Taliban retaliated back. After the latest round of fighting in December 2024, the Taliban announced it wished to de-escalate but that a Pakistani response would cause 'measured retaliation.' It is time for diplomacy, which will be difficult given the Taliban’s need to manage a complicated internal situation caused by the presence of ISIS-K, al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. And there’s no saying what the incoming Trump administration will do, but it will probably maintain a non-intervention policy. The Taliban appeared to welcome Trump’s return when an Islamic Emirate spokesman said Kabul hoped the incoming administration 'will take realistic steps toward concrete progress in relations between the two countries and both nations will be able to open a new chapter of relations.'

A New Playbook? Russian Interference In Georgia And Moldova Elect...	By Marcus Andreopoulos As 2025 begins, the end of last year saw two significant results in Georgia and Moldova, demonstrating both the strengths and limitations of Russian interference operations. Both former Soviet Republics are high up on Vladimir Putin’s priority list, so much so that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the pair, alongside Bosnia and Herzegovina, were identified as ‘partners at risk’ by the NATO alliance. Expectedly, the Kremlin’s obsession with the two countries was on full display with allegations of interference rife in both elections. Despite the Kremlin’s efforts, the pro-Russian party was only victorious in Georgia, with Georgian Dream securing a parliamentary majority. In Moldova, on the other hand, the pro-EU candidate, and incumbent, Maia Sandu won re-election as president. Limited success notwithstanding, both elections provide an example of the methodology employed by Russia to interfere with democratic elections, as well as providing ominous warnings of Europe’s future should Ukraine be defeated. Russia’s pleasure was on full display following Georgian Dream’s victory on 26 October, as the head of the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, Margarita Simonyan, triumphantly declared that ‘Georgians have won.’ Despite having held power since 2012, Georgian Dream was not widely projected to win; protests against the party had been strong throughout 2024, and turnout on election day was high. Change was expected. However, existential arguments about saving Georgian democracy did not appear to resonate when pitted against Georgian Dream’s assertions that the opposition would take the country to war with Russia. The election itself was marred with irregularities and accusations of foreign interference. The OSCE were quick to denounce the elections for their irregularities, citing evidence of ‘intimidation, coercion, and pressure on voters. Other transgressions included vote-buying and instances of one person voting multiple times. A member of the European Parliament even caught instances of voter intimidation and ballot stuffing on video. Other issues included double-voting, which could only have been facilitated by complicit election officials. It is difficult to imagine that the Kremlin was not involved in influencing this election. This was an accusation leveled by Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili, who is not a member of the Georgian Dream party. Zourabichvili argued that the election was proof of the Russian ‘methodology and the support of most probably Russian FSB types’ to influence the result in a favorable manner. Evidence of this comes from the use of propaganda videos that were, according to Zourabichvili, a ‘copy and paste’ from those used in the run up to Putin’s ‘election’ earlier this year. These included videos of destroyed Ukrainian cities, which, contrasted with peaceful Georgian ones, were used to depict Georgia’s future if it moved closer to the West. Russia’s election interference in Georgia was the result of a long and concerted strategy. Months before the election, Russian state media began suggesting that Georgia would fall victim to another, Ukraine-style, ‘color revolution.’ In doing so, the Russian state pre-empted accusations of their interference, by announcing the U.S.’ preference for one party over another. Once Georgian Dream emerged victorious, the Russians were able to downplay complaints of interference by claiming the U.S. had been doing the same – the only difference was that they were not as successful. Another element of Russia’s interference playbook is to draw upon its network of autocrats to verify fraudulent elections after they happen. This was, once again, on show in Georgia. Following the election, the U.S., the EU, and a range of multilaterals voiced their concerns with the electoral process; however, one EU member did not tow this line. Not only did Hungary’s Viktor Orban praise the elections as ‘free and democratic,’ he also traveled to Tbilisi, alongside his foreign minister, to add further EU legitimacy to the result. In doing so, Orban helped Putin to spread doubts about Western claims that the results had been tampered with. The case of Georgia also demonstrates Russia’s methodology for blurring the lines and polarizing the debate after successful election interference. With accusations building following the election results, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev took to social media to label Zourabichvili a Western ‘puppet.’ Elsewhere, Russian state media alleged that Ukrainian snipers had been deployed to ferment protest, whilst a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of neo-colonialism. Such comments are successful in diminishing Western claims of election interference by passing the blame back to the West and the U.S. in particular. For the Kremlin, the election becoming contested in both directions helps spread uncertainty and, paradoxically, adds an element of legitimacy to the victorious party, who, rather than be seen as having ‘stolen’ an election, are simply viewed as having engaged in similar tactics to the opposition. Much of the same tactics were on display in Moldova, where the presidential election coincided with a referendumon EU accession. Held on the same day as the first round of the Presidential vote, the EU referendum was decided by just 10,000 votes in favor of moving towards accession. The presidential race, on the other hand, was not as close, with the pro-EU candidate Maia Sandu defeating the more Russia aligned option by a wider margin. Just as in Georgia, fears were stoked of a war with Russia, should the pro-EU candidate win. Many similar accusations were made against Russia following the Moldovan election as they were following Georgia’s vote. On top of running disinformation campaigns, the Kremlin also engaged in cyber-attacks and similar vote buying strategies to those observed in Georgia. Aided by Russia, voters of the Russian leaning Alexandr Stoianoglo were flown and bused into polling stations, according to Moldovan government officials, whilst bomb threats were called in to dissuade diaspora voters from voting in Germany and the UK. Ultimately however, such attempts proved unsuccessful, but it is unlikely to be the last time that Russia will meddle in European elections. Far from dissuaded by defeat in Moldova, Putin will have been emboldened by victory in Georgia, and with news of Russian interference in Romanian elections causing a political crisis, it seems the Kremlin has already set its sights on a new target. This is a trend that is certain to continue as the new year progresses.

Vietnam’s High-Speed Rail Hits The Brakes On Foreign Funding – An...	By Nicholas Chapman On 30 November 2024, Vietnam’s National Assembly rubber-stamped a high-speed rail network that will traverse 20 provinces, linking Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City in five and a half hours. Vietnam has announced that, in the ‘spirit of independence and self-reliance’, it will not use foreign loans to fund the US$67 billion project by 2035. Instead, it will use the state budget, low-interest loans and government bonds. This funding strategy represents a departure from Vietnam’s traditional economic hedging strategy — its calculations of the risks and rewards of accepting investment from larger powers. Hanoi will continue shielding itself from Chinese influence and potential debt traps, while building a pathway to greater autonomy and self-sustainability. Chinese-funded projects invoke wider security considerations for Vietnam. Hanoi is wary of providing Beijing with greater clout over sensitive issues, such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and eroding its political and economic autonomy. And Chinese-backed projects such as the Cat Linh–Ha Dong tramline have seen delays, ballooning costs, allegations of poor-quality construction, and lax safety and labour standards. Infrastructure projects funded by other international donors — including the Tran Hoang Na Bridge, the Nhon-Hanoi Station metro project and the North-South Expressway — have similarly encountered problems. This explains why Hanoi has historically turned to Japan to finance major infrastructure projects. Japan provides over half of Vietnam’s official development assistance (ODA), much of which is earmarked for public transport infrastructure. Despite noteworthy successes such as the Nhat Tan Bridge and the Noi Bai International Airport expansion, Japanese-backed projects are not immune from complications. Vietnam’s high-speed rail has evolved in close step with Japan. Though a Japanese-backed high-speed rail project failed in 2010, the Japan International Cooperation Agency provided the funds for the current plan’s pre-feasibility report and Tokyo has remained vocal in its commitment to fund Vietnam’s high-speed rail. Problems associated with ODA and foreign concessional loans have led to bureaucrats lambastingthe complex rules and conditions attached to foreign aid disbursement. While these problems are not solely the donor’s fault, the strict conditions erode Hanoi’s ability to make autonomous decisions. Vietnam has already laid the groundwork for a more self-sustainable funding model. The 2019 law on public investment provides the Ministry of Finance with the responsibility for assessing ODA and concessional loan impacts from foreign donors and determining domestic financial mechanisms. Amendments to the railway law in 2017 also made domestic investment easier, offering easy access to land and funding, cheap loans and tax incentives. In 2020, the Vietnamese government adopted a comprehensive plan to modernise its colonial-era railway network to better handle freight transport. The plan also maintains that passenger fares should be reasonably priced, capping high-speed rail tickets at 75 per cent of airline tickets. Some analysts wonder whether public investment alone can deliver such an ambitious project. These concerns are not unfounded, given administrative paralysis stemming from the intense crack-down on corruption, as well as potential complications from General Secretary To Lam’s plans to merge and eliminate certain state and party agencies. Vietnam can cite the US$13.38 billion Long Thanh Airport as a success story in its emerging, independent approach to infrastructure. The state-owned Airports Corporation of Vietnam is the principal investor in what will be the country’s largest airport, serving as a regional cargo and passenger hub. The project is on track to be completed nearly a year ahead of schedule. For the high-speed rail project, the door is ajar for foreign assistance should the need arise, with provisions to prevent ceding too much autonomy in place. Under the investment plan, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is responsible for issuing government bonds and mobilising ODA and foreign loans in case of delays. Any international bids must include commitments to technology transfer and human resource training to ensure operations, maintenance and long-term management of the high-speed rail stay in Vietnamese hands. Hanoi has already asked Japan to provide railway engineering scholarships for Vietnamese citizens. It is too early to determine the government’s approach. Will it rely solely on domestic sourcing, or will it adopt a hybrid strategy combining domestic and foreign sources? Regardless, the safeguards suggest an intent to shield the project from outside interference and prioritise domestic investors and companies. The Vietnamese Communist Party identifies infrastructure projects as a springboard to become a high-income nation by 2045. Vietnam spends roughly 6 per cent of GDP — the highest in Southeast Asia — on infrastructure development, including the ambitious upgrading of its 1290 kilometres of national highway to 5000 km by 2030. The benefits of high-speed rail are self-evident. It is expected to add an additional 0.97 per cent of GDP growth and give citizens a clean and efficient means of traversing the country. Vietnam’s approach should ensure that it maintains strategic autonomy over the project. Vietnam’s experience with the high-speed rail could also increase its influence in facilitating greater regional railway connection between the Greater Mekong Subregion. Regional partners may look to emulate its self-sustainable model. Vietnam’s high-speed rail project represents more than just infrastructure development – it signals a fundamental shift in the nation’s economic strategy. After three decades of carefully balancing foreign influences, Vietnam is charting a bold new course toward genuine economic independence. Whether this ambitious self-funding model proves sustainable for a US$67 billion project remains an open question, and success is far from guaranteed. Yet if Vietnam does succeed, its approach could reshape how developing nations approach major infrastructure projects, demonstrating a new path to strategic autonomy that sidesteps the traditional constraints of foreign funding.

An Assessment Of China’s Economy In 2025 – Analysis	By Xia Ri There are two prevailing views on China's economy this year: pessimistic and optimistic. Optimists believe that with the government's intensive rollout of policies in the fourth quarter and the frequent release of central government meeting directives, China's economy will continue to improve in 2025. This view believes that the supporting conditions and fundamental trends for the country’s long-term growth have not changed. Li Daokui, Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking at Tsinghua University, echoed this sentiment, stating that 2025 is a year to look forward to for economic and financial development. It is expected that China's economic growth in 2025 will likely be slightly higher than in 2024. In response, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan adopts a pragmatic approach, stating that if the situation is highly optimistic, a more optimistic outlook would be adopted; conversely, if the situation is more pessimistic, a more cautious stance would be taken. From the perspective of GDP, he noted that, in the past, there has been a consistent emphasis on avoiding an exclusive focus on GDP growth rates. This means not to place excessive importance on GDP alone. However, in the coming years, starting from 2025, it appears that the government will place significant emphasis on GDP growth rates. The realization of China's second centenary goal is highly dependent on GDP growth. To achieve this goal, China needs to reach a per capita GDP level comparable to that of moderately developed countries by 2035, and a level comparable to that of developed economies by the middle of this century. This implies that between 2020 and 2035, China's per capita real GDP needs to double, and between 2035 and 2050, per capita real GDP needs to double again. Based on these calculations, the average annual real GDP growth rate over the next 30 years must be around 4.6%. However, after the global financial crisis of 2008, China's economic growth, after an initial rebound, began to show a sustained decline. In 2019, China's GDP growth rate fell to 6.0%, and in 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it further dropped to 2.3%. In 2023, the annual GDP growth rate was 5.2%. Therefore, if China's economic growth rate falls below 5%, it is likely that the second centenary goal will be unattainable. In fact, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) has unusually projected a lower GDP growth rate for 2025. Recently, the CASS held a session in Beijing on China's economic situation in 2025, predicting that the country's GDP growth for the year would be around 4.9%, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by approximately 0.5%. After comprehensively analyzing both short-term and medium-to-long-term factors, the research team forecasted that China's real GDP growth in 2025 would be around 4.7%. On relying on GDP, Kung Chan believes that this issue must be viewed from a holistic, trend-based, and societal development perspective. Currently, there are many shortcomings in China's economic development, such as demographic challenges and poverty alleviation issues, all of which need to be addressed. From a trend perspective, on the one hand, China's GDP growth rate has decreased from a past rate of 12% to the current 5%, and the previous high-growth economic environment inevitably led to issues like inventory accumulation, debt, and inflation. The key now lies in how to address these challenges. On the other hand, during this economic downturn, the country has also been faced with numerous additional factors, such as decoupling and supply chain disruptions, the failure of U.S.-China trade negotiations, sanctions and counter-sanctions, and so on. As a result, there is a significant difference between the conditions of the Chinese market and that in foreign ones. China's economic growth is driven by two engines: one is the land economy, specifically real estate, and the other is foreign trade, including imports and exports. From the perspective of the former, the current Chinese real estate market is widely acknowledged to be persistently weak. According to data from the China Index Academy, in the first eleven months of this year, the total sales of the top 100 real estate companies amounted to RMB 3.85 trillion, a year-on-year decline of 32.9%, though the rate of decline narrowed by 1.8 percentage points compared to October. In November, sales of the top 100 real estate companies decreased by 9.46% year-on-year and by 18.62% month-on-month. Despite the continuous implementation of incremental policies aimed at stimulating the market, the real estate sector showed little signs of recovery in November. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reveals that, based on sales in 40 key cities, the year-on-year decline in both the sales area and sales value of newly constructed commercial housing from January to November was narrower by 1.8 and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, compared to the first ten months of the year. If the real estate sector continues to develop in the same extensive manner as in the past, it will lead to massive debt and could even trigger a financial crisis. Moreover, demographic factors do not support the rapid development of the real estate market as in previous years. Data from the NBS shows that, by the end of 2023, the population aged 60 and above in China exceeded 296 million, with a large elderly population and a rapidly aging society. From the latter perspective, the instability of the world economy has increased due to the intense impact of geopolitics. In addition, we also see international political uncertainties, the intensification of global trade protectionism, and the escalation of the suppression and containment by some countries against China. As things stand, China faces significant challenges and pressure from the external environment, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Red Sea crisis, the Israel-Hamas war, and the U.S.-China trade war. In fact, the country’s Central Economic Work Conference this year also reflects this growing external pressure. The 2023 Central Economic Work Conference stated that 'the complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment have increased', while the 2024 one clearly pointed out that 'the adverse impacts of changes in the external environment have deepened'. With this in mind, China’s future import and export trade will inevitably be greatly affected. According to data released by the General Administration of Customs, in U.S. dollar terms, the export value of goods trade in November 2024 increased by 6.7% year-on-year, which is a decrease of 6 percentage points compared to the year-on-year increase of 12.7% in October. Meanwhile, the import value of goods trade in November decreased by 3.9% year-on-year, with the decline widening further by 2.3% compared to October's year-on-year decline. Both of China’s economic engines are currently facing a state of stalling. Since this is related to the realization of the country's second centenary goal, the next few years there will be more significant emphasis on its GDP growth, which means it is crucial for China to achieve the target of 5% economic growth. If China's economic situation were to be represented by a curve, one end would represent the production side, including the land economy and import-export trade, while the other end would represent the consumption side. Currently, consumption in China mainly relies on savings, meaning it is spending past money, which remains relatively stable. As a result, economic growth is heavily dependent on the production side. Government measures, such as supply-side reforms and the development of new productive forces, focus on enhancing the efficiency of the production side to drive economic growth. However, in numerical terms, the pace of economic growth is expected to slow significantly. The key to addressing this issue lies in whether Chinese enterprises can successfully expand internationally. From the experience of Japan, in the past, Japanese companies expanding overseas aimed to create a 'second Japan' in international markets. In this process, the money earned by Japanese companies abroad would flow back into Japan to be used for purchasing national debt. According to data from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, domestic holders account for 87% of Japan's national debt, while overseas holders only account for 13%. The Japanese government increases fiscal revenue by issuing national bonds, which are used to fund social welfare, basic security, and other areas, ensuring the smooth operation of the national economy. After Chinese companies expand overseas, whether the money they earn can flow back into China largely depends on the mechanisms in place within the country, and whether a positive cycle can be established, similar to what Japanese companies have achieved. In conclusion, if the reform measures proposed at the 20th Party Congress' Third Plenary Session are successfully implemented, China's economy will undergo an upgrade and iteration. Otherwise, it will require a long period of accumulation, similar to Japan's experience of facing decades of stagnation. Final analysis conclusion: This assessment of China’s economy in 2025 from a GDP perspective reveals two key points. First, from 2025 onward, the government will prioritize GDP growth to meet the second centenary goal. Second, it will not solely focus on GDP growth, as the country faces challenges such as demographic issues and geopolitical conflicts. Both economic engines, namely land economy and import-export, are currently stalling, and achieving the 5% GDP growth target will depend on whether Chinese enterprises can establish a positive cycle abroad, similar to Japan's model.

Myanmar’s EV: Driving Change Or Consolidating Regime Power? – Ana...	By Phyo Thura Aung and Tin Shine Aung Myanmar’s electric vehicle (EV) adoption initiative seeks to reduce fuel imports and foreign currency outflows. Still, critics argue it serves as a tool for the military regime’s economic control, with limited focus on equitable or sustainable development. Key Takeaways: EV adoption reduces fuel import dependency, but the policy prioritizes economic stabilization for the military regime rather than sustainability goals. Import regulations and incentives disproportionately benefit military-linked entities, limiting competition and equitable market access. Insufficient charging stations and unreliable electricity supply, especially in rural areas, hinder EV adoption and reflect gaps in long-term planning. Evolution of Electric Vehicles in Myanmar The program to promote Electric Vehicles was launched in late 2022 under a directive from the State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar’s ruling military government, under Ministry of Commerce (MOC) order No.62/2022. Myanmar’s adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is being positioned as a solution to reduce the country’s reliance on imported fuel, a significant source of foreign currency outflows. While this initiative aligns with global trends toward sustainable energy and transportation, it is also deeply intertwined with the political and economic priorities of the military-led government. Critics argue that the policy is less about environmental reform and more about bolstering the regime’s economic control amidst growing international sanctions and a power struggle. By mid-2023, over 2,700 EVs had been registered under the initiative, with most imported from China. The government has framed the policy to reduce fuel dependency and save foreign currency. Still, observers note that the SAC’s primary focus appears to be economic stabilization for political leverage rather than environmental or developmental goals. The environmental benefits of EVs, such as reducing carbon emissions, remain largely absent from the government’s narrative. Regulation on the Import of Electric Vehicles EV import regulations are tightly controlled, with licenses granted predominantly to businesses linked to powerful military-affiliated (SAC) entities. Many of the country’s EV dealerships are owned by individuals close to the junta, raising concerns about market monopolization and lack of transparency. While centralized control ostensibly aims to monitor foreign currency outflows, it has created an uneven playing field, limiting competition and discouraging participation from smaller businesses and international stakeholders. The concentration of wealth and power within a narrow circle exacerbates existing inequities and has drawn criticism for prioritizing regime interests over broader economic benefits. Income Tax Incentives and Exemption on Electric Vehicles Efforts to incentivize EV adoption include customs duty waivers, commercial tax exemptions, and reduced registration fees. Citizens working abroad are also permitted to import one EV annually if they remit 25% of their monthly salary, amounting to over $200,000, through exchange channels under SAC direct control - a move aimed at increasing foreign currency inflows. However, the SAC exchange rate (1 USD ≅ 3000 MMK) set by the junta undervalues these remittances, effectively depleting their actual worth (1 USD ≅ 4500 MMK). These policies reflect the SAC’s broader strategy of leveraging EV adoption to consolidate economic control while the benefits for individual consumers and small businesses remain limited. Challenges in Infrastructure and Electricity Grid Infrastructure challenges further highlight the gaps in the government’s approach. While over 140 EV charging stations have been approved, only 38 stations (equipped with 51 chargers) are operational, primarily in urban areas like Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw or along the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway. Rural regions, where much of the population resides, remain underserved, mirroring the country’s broader inequitable development patterns. Compounding this issue is Myanmar’s unreliable electricity supply, which relies heavily on hydropower and natural gas. Seasonal droughts and fluctuating gas production often lead to power shortages, undermining the feasibility of widespread EV adoption. Additionally, the high cost of setting up charging infrastructure - ranging from $800 for basic home units to $80,000 for advanced public chargers - has deterred private sector investment. Path to Sustainability or Regime Strengthening Myanmar’s transition to electric vehicles (EVs) presents significant opportunities and complex challenges. On the one hand, it could reduce fuel dependency, promote a green economy, and contribute to global sustainability efforts. On the other hand, the initiative is deeply entwined with the political and economic agenda of the military regime, which has used the EV program to consolidate its control over the country’s economy. To unlock the full potential of EV adoption, Myanmar must address critical infrastructure gaps, including expanding reliable charging stations and improving the electricity grid, especially in rural areas. The government must also prioritize renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to power the EV network sustainably. However, the regime’s focus on economic stabilization for political leverage rather than true environmental reform raises concerns about the equitable distribution of the benefits of EV adoption. The current regulatory framework favors military-linked entities, limits competition, exacerbates economic inequality and undermines the program’s potential for broad-based development. Moreover, efforts to incentivize EV adoption - such as tax exemptions and remittance policies - are heavily tilted in favor of the regime, leaving smaller businesses and ordinary citizens at a disadvantage. The government’s focus on economic control, rather than fostering a competitive and transparent market, further hinders the EV initiative’s success. To make meaningful progress, Myanmar must shift its priorities. This includes fostering local production of EV components to reduce import dependency and create jobs while ensuring that incentives benefit all citizens, not just regime-affiliated businesses. Expanding public awareness and providing affordable financing options for consumers can also help boost EV adoption. Conclusion Ultimately, Myanmar’s EV adoption initiative is a critical test of the military regime’s ability to balance its economic goals with broader developmental and environmental objectives. Without an inclusive strategy that addresses infrastructure, regulatory fairness, and renewable energy integration, Myanmar risks reinforcing existing power structures rather than achieving meaningful, sustainable progress. Only by addressing these issues can Myanmar harness the true potential of electric vehicles, securing a more equitable and prosperous future for its people.

Bangladesh At A Crossroads: Will Revolution Bring Democracy Or Re...	Bangladesh is at a crossroads. In the summer of 2024, a student-led revolution unseated Sheikh Hasina, one of South Asia’s most entrenched leaders, marking a potential turning point in the nation’s tumultuous political history. For years, Hasina’s rule epitomised the authoritarian drift of a country that had once aspired to democracy. Prompted by the July Revolution, her resignation offers a rare opportunity to chart a new course. Yet, the violence that erupted between supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami in Gaibandha district in late December—a stark reminder of the volatile political environment—casts doubt on whether Bangladesh can escape its illiberal past. At stake is the survival of democracy itself in a nation where political polarisation, corruption, and patronage have hollowed out democratic institutions. Bangladesh now faces the monumental challenge of rebuilding these institutions while navigating rivalries among entrenched political parties and a burgeoning student-led movement. Whether the country seizes this moment to transition into a genuine democracy or lapses into a new cycle of authoritarianism will depend on the willingness of its political actors to prioritise long-term reforms over short-term gains. A Legacy of Illiberalism Bangladesh’s modern political history is a cautionary tale of unrealised democratic potential. Since the restoration of democracy in 1990, the country has maintained the trappings of democracy—regular elections, vibrant political parties, and an engaged citizenry. Yet, these features have masked a system dominated by patronage, authoritarian tendencies, and systemic violence. Two dynastic parties have long monopolised the political arena: the Awami League (AL) and the BNP. These rivals have traded accusations for decades, often using state power to suppress dissent and consolidate control. Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, beginning in 2009, represented the culmination of this trend. Under her leadership, the AL systematically dismantled institutional independence, politicised the judiciary, and eroded civil liberties. Opposition figures were harassed, imprisoned, or exiled while dissenting voices in civil society and the media were silenced. Elections, including the disputed 2014 and 2018 polls, became exercises in democratic theatre designed to legitimise her grip on power. Bangladesh, once a struggling democracy, slid into outright authoritarianism. The July Revolution disrupted this trajectory. Sparked by protests against a controversial quota system for government jobs, the movement quickly grew into a nationwide uprising demanding democratic reform. The death of student activist Abu Sayed galvanised public outrage, forcing Hasina to resign and flee the country. Her departure has left a political vacuum—and an opportunity to reimagine Bangladesh’s future. Competing Forces in the New Political Order The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, is tasked with shepherding the nation toward stability and reform. However, its mandate is tenuous, caught between the demands of three powerful factions: the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and a revolutionary student movement. The BNP: A Fragile Comeback The BNP, long relegated to opposition, sees the post-Hasina period as its moment of redemption. Public discontent with the AL’s authoritarian excesses has given the BNP a resurgence of popular support. The party’s leaders have called for immediate elections, confident of a decisive victory. Yet, the BNP’s record in governance is checkered. Its time in power was marred by allegations of corruption, mismanagement, and human rights abuses. Moreover, the recent acquittal of Tarique Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in a high-profile grenade attack case has sparked fresh controversy, highlighting the party’s struggles with transparency and accountability. To lead Bangladesh into a new era, the BNP must overcome its past and articulate a credible vision for reform. Failing to do so risks perpetuating the very system it claims to oppose. Jamaat-e-Islami: Revival Amid Controversy Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, has reemerged as a significant political force. Suppressed under Hasina’s regime, Jamaat leveraged its role in the July Revolution to regain a foothold in national politics. The party’s grassroots network and organisational discipline have proven assets in mobilising support. However, Jamaat remains a deeply polarising actor. Its historical alignment with Pakistan during the 1971 Liberation War continues to haunt its reputation. Critics accuse the party of exploiting the current political transition to advance an Islamist agenda. For Jamaat, redefining its identity and broadening its appeal will be crucial to surviving and thriving in the new political landscape. Revolutionary Students: The New Vanguard Perhaps the most intriguing development is the rise of a student-led movement, which has transitioned from protest to political force. Figures like Nahid Islam, a charismatic student leader, have become symbols of a new generation demanding meritocracy, transparency, and an end to entrenched nepotism. Their movement has begun forming a political platform that seeks to disrupt the BNP-AL duopoly. Yet, the students face formidable challenges. Internal divisions, a lack of political experience, and the entrenched nature of Bangladesh’s political system pose significant hurdles. Established parties have already begun co-opting and undermining their efforts, casting doubt on whether the movement can sustain its momentum. The Persistent Threat of Polarization Political polarisation remains one of the greatest obstacles to Bangladesh’s democratic aspirations. Rivalries among the BNP, Jamaat, and the student movement have already devolved into mutual recriminations. The BNP accuses Jamaat of opportunism and complicity in past atrocities. Jamaat, in turn, criticises the BNP for corruption. Meanwhile, student leaders blame both parties for obstructing reform and undermining the interim government. This cycle of blame and hostility threatens to derail the fragile progress made since Hasina’s resignation. Without a commitment to dialogue and compromise, the risk of renewed violence looms large. A Blueprint for Reform Breaking free from this cycle requires systemic change. Bangladesh’s entrenched political culture cannot be dismantled overnight, but targeted reforms can lay the foundation for a more inclusive and democratic future. Depoliticising Institutions: Restoring meritocracy in public appointments, from the judiciary to educational institutions, is essential for rebuilding public trust. Strengthening Electoral Processes: An independent election commission and robust safeguards against voter intimidation are crucial to ensuring free and fair elections. Decentralizing Power: Empowering local governments would dilute the concentration of authority in Dhaka and promote grassroots participation. Transitional Justice: Addressing past atrocities transparently can help heal national divisions and foster reconciliation. Youth Participation: Providing platforms for young leaders to engage in governance can inject fresh perspectives into policymaking. The international community has a vested interest in Bangladesh’s transition. Support for electoral reform, technical assistance, and pressure to uphold democratic norms can bolster the interim government’s efforts. However, foreign actors must tread carefully to avoid inflaming nationalist sentiments or being perceived as meddling in domestic affairs. A Moment of Reckoning Bangladesh’s political future hangs in the balance. The fall of Sheikh Hasina has created a rare opening for reform, but rivalry and polarisation threaten to squander this opportunity. Without systemic change, the country risks repeating its history of illiberal democracy and authoritarianism. This is a moment of reckoning for Bangladesh. The choices made in the coming months will determine whether the nation emerges as a vibrant democracy or remains ensnared by its troubled past. The path forward is fraught with challenges but also ripe with possibility. For Bangladesh, the stakes could not be higher.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJZqTjJgfb5qG	2025-01-09T16:23:57-08:00	
Modern Academe Has Corrupted The Media (And Pretty Much Everythin...	By William L. Anderson In August 2006, I was deeply involved in the infamous Duke Lacrosse Case. It hadn’t taken long to realize that the entire case was built by a prosecutor who was willing to do whatever necessary to take the case to trial to win an election (in large part to be able to pay off his campaign debts and earn another $15,000 a year in pension pay) and mollify the local political radicals. Whether any of the charges were true seemed to be an afterthought, as people were expected to believe them no matter what the evidence might have been. (The accuser, Crystal Gail Mangum, recently went on a podcast and admitted that she fabricated the entire story. While a few conservative outlets reported it, the mainstream media, including the New York Times, which had aggressively promoted the case, ignored Mangum’s admission.) As a criminal case, nothing pointed to guilt, as the forensic evidence, the timelines, and medical examinations of the alleged victim were strong enough to ensure an acquittal in all but Stalin’s infamous Show Trials. Yet, as I checked the New York Timesthe morning of August 25, 2006, there was an article claiming that the prosecution’s evidence was much stronger than most people had admitted and that the players’ defense team had been cherry-picking the evidence. Given what we knew about the evidence at that time, the NYT’s article was stunning. Here was the self-proclaimed 'Newspaper of Record' claiming that, in the final analysis, the kind of evidence that the newspaper historically had championed as proof of innocence suddenly didn’t matter. After the case totally fell apart (as it should have all along) the NYT patted itself on the back for its truly atrocious coverage. That also is not surprising. After all, the newspaper even managed to get Peter Neufeld—founder of the Innocence Project—to insinuate that the lack of DNA evidence in the lacrosse case was irrelevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Fast forward to the aftermath of the recent presidential election, in which the legacy news media almost unanimously had declared Democrat Kamala Harris leading in the polls, something that was a surprise to the Harris campaign itself. The internal polling by her campaign always showed her either behind or briefly tied with Donald Trump. Given the politics driving the modern media these days, the results are not surprising. The Harris campaign had every reason to see things as they really were, given her supporters were trying to help her win. The external polling, on the other hand, was led by modern media types who have been living at best in a fantasy world for much of their lives. People who live their entire lives in bubbles should not be expected to provide anything insightful about those who operate in the real world. The connection between these two situations is modern American higher education, which has influenced journalism for many years and, in the process, has taken a profession made up of hard-nosed realists and turned them into something unrecognizable to anyone who understands basic logic. In the days of Henry Hazlitt and H.L. Mencken, journalists tended to be, at best, high school graduates who had writing skills and a nose for news. Long before there were journalism schools on college campuses, there were newspapers staffed by people who knew something about the underside of life and who were scornful of the fantasy worlds created by elite minds. Today’s 'journalists'—and especially those at entities like the New York Times—are much more likely to be products of higher education, and, in the case of the NYT, graduates from among the most elite institutions in the country like Yale, Harvard, or Duke. Moreover, the vast majority of these writers are likely to be ideologically concentrated on the left and live and work in so-called blue enclaves like New York City and the West Coast where the online journalism flourishes: The online media, liberated from printing presses and local ad bases, has been free to form clusters, piggyback-style, on the industries and government that it covers. New York is home to most business coverage because of the size of the business and banking community there. Likewise, national political reporting has concentrated in Washington and grown apace with the federal government. Entertainment and cultural reporting has bunched in New York and Los Angeles, where those businesses are strong. The result?…you don’t need to be a Republican campaign strategist to grasp just how far the 'media bubble' has drifted from the average American experience. Newspaper jobs are far more evenly scattered across the country, including the deep red parts. But as those vanish, it’s internet jobs that are driving whatever growth there is in media—and those fall almost entirely in places that are dense, blue and right in the bubble. Today’s elite journalists overwhelmingly hold political and social views that are reflective of what is happening in higher education, and it hardly is a new phenomenon. In the Duke case, members of the Duke faculty rushed to judgment, declaring the players to be guilty and calling on the university to make huge changes in how it governed campus culture. Unfortunately, much of the media coverage of that case differed little from the Duke faculty response. Anyone who has spent much time in the academic world knows that most campuses are home to leftist narratives: Capitalism is oppressive and creates poverty; women are always oppressed; America is a hopelessly racist country built on the backs of black slaves; a state-run economy would be more just than private enterprise; if the state controlled healthcare, then we could have unlimited, free medical coverage; and so on. For a long time, people believed that college campuses were bubbles that held to leftist narratives, but that they would be contained there. However, that clearly has not been the case, especially as the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) movement has migrated from higher education to the corporate world, and, of course, government. How it infected the business world should be no surprise. As one who taught in MBA programs for more than 20 years, the anti-business ethos has long been a staple of the academic business curriculum. Students in MBA programs have been taught for decades that businesses need to answer to 'stakeholders,' which really has meant little more than trying to appeal to anti-business activists. Budding entrepreneurs are taught that seeking after profits is the pursuit of greed and that their efforts should be turned toward social goals. Not surprisingly, people who disagree are pushing back against the poisonous ideologies coming from higher education. And—not surprisingly—those in higher education who have been permitted to run amok see this pushback as a national emergency. The American Association of University Professors, in responding to changes in state colleges and universities in Florida (which came about as a result of pushback against DEI), had this hysterical statement: In December, the AAUP released the final report of the Special Committee on Academic Freedom and Florida. Political Interference and Academic Freedom in Florida’s Public Higher Education System provides an in-depth review of a pattern of politically, racially, and ideologically motivated attacks on public higher education in Florida under Governor Ron DeSantis. The report reaffirms and expands on the findings of the committee’s May 2023 preliminary report, chief among them that academic freedom, tenure, and shared governance in Florida’s public colleges and universities face an ideologically driven assault unparalleled in US history, which, if sustained, threatens the very survival of meaningful higher education in the state, with dire implications for the entire country. (emphasis mine) (In reading this statement, one is reminded of Otter’s infamous speech before the Faber College Student Court in the movie 'Animal House.') One doubts seriously that the United States of America faces dire implications because Marxist professors are not given full control of higher education in Florida—or anywhere else. For that matter, as one who has been in higher education for more than 30 years, the bubble that is much of that world is not something we wish to export to our general society, and when those advocates succeed, we get disasters like the Duke Lacrosse Case or 'journalism' that is little more than political propaganda in which advocates try to turn reality upside down. Lest one think I exaggerate about the hysteria that the left has created on college campuses, this account from Brown University should remind us of the idiocy that has become the American university. When libertarian Wendy McElroyparticipated in a debate at Brown on the subject of sexual assault, university officials responded, according to the New York Times, by setting up a 'safe space' for those traumatized by McElroy’s presence at Brown: The safe space, Ms. Byron explained, was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma. Brown, of course, is attended by some of the most privileged young people in the world and it is ridiculous to claim that the presence of a libertarian blogger (who has written for this page) places the lives of young women there in peril. But that is the world that not only exists at Brown and other elite colleges and universities, but also in many of our other institutions such as government, business, and the non-profits that seem to be gaining in influence. There is nothing wrong with pushing back against hard-left agendas and the upside-down world leftist advocates wish to impose upon the rest of us. One hopes we can reverse some of the worst excesses before leftists in higher education are able to corrupt what is left of our body politic. About the author: William L.

Free Speech Win Down Under As Misinformation Bill Is Officially B...	In a win for free speech advocates, the Australian Government formally abandoned its misinformation bill over the weekend, after failing to secure support in the Senate. The proposed laws would have forced social media companies to show that they were preventing the spread of misinformation and disinformation on their platforms, with fines of up to 5% of global revenue for non-compliance. The controversial bill was opposed by the Coalition (conservative Liberal and National Parties) but after several amendments, it sailed through the House of Representatives earlier this month with the support of Labor (centre left) and theTeals (the Greens did not participate in the vote). However, by last week it was clear that Labor’s bill would not enjoy the same success in the Senate, as critical support from independent crossbench senators collapsed. The Greens’ announcement on Friday that the Party would not support the bill was the final nail in the coffin. 'Based on public statements and engagements with Senators, it is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate,' said Communications Minister Michelle Rowland in a statement withdrawing the bill on Sunday, the day before it was to be voted on in the Senate. The bill has been so roundly rejected by the Senate that a motion was passed on Monday to acknowledge the 'shocking flaws' in Labor’s misinformation bill, and for the government to 'categorically rule out reintroducing it.' High Level of Community Concern According to research by the Australian Media Literacy Alliance oft-cited by Rowland, 80% of Australians want the government to do something about misinformation and disinformation online – but this bill was not it. The Senate inquiry into the bill drew more than 30,000 responses, indicating 'significant public interest and community concerns,' according to a report handed down by the committee on Monday. By comparison, fewer than 100 submissions were made during consultation on Digital ID legislation. Just over 8,000 of these submissions were submitted by individuals or organisations, while a further 22,000 were submitted through various campaigns. The committee published only 105 of the submissions it received, tracking a recent trend of Senate committees selectively withholding submissions from the Parliament website (this may in part have been due to the tight turnaround time for the inquiry). Additionally, some senators said they had received 'thousands' of calls and emails asking them to vote against the bill. An earlier version of the bill released by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in 2023 drew a similarly strong response, attracting approximately 23,000 submissions to the consultation. However, the government hoped to win support for its revamped bill this year by strengthening protections for free expression. Carve-outs for satire, parody, news content, academic, artistic, scientific, and religious content were intended to 'carefully balance the public interest in combatting seriously harmful misinformation and disinformation with the freedom of expression that is so fundamental to our democracy,' said Rowland when the bill was reintroduced in September. But the committee noted that concerns over the impact of the proposed laws on freedom of expression had not been allayed, with a plurality of community and professional groups – including human rights groups, religious groups, medical unions, and law societies – worried that speech protections were not adequate. Other criticisms raised during the inquiry included: the overly broad definitions of 'serious harm,' 'misinformation,' and 'disinformation;' the inclusion of 'opinions' in content that would be censored; lack of transparency in the ACMA’s decision-making processes; the prospect of the government’s misuse of powers; and that the exemption of powerful media corporations from the rules would give billionaire oligarchs an unfair advantage over smaller, independent news operations. In additional comments, Liberal Senator Dave Sharma said that while the committee’s report had made a 'valiant attempt to construct support for the legislation,' the truth was that 'almost no witnesses who appeared before the committee were prepared to speak in support of it.' Despite the committee’s view that 'doing something is better than doing nothing when it comes to keeping Australians safe online,' given the lack of support for the bill in the Senate, the sole recommendation of the report is that the bill be 'withdrawn immediately.' ‘Gaping Hole at the Heart of the Bill’ One of the main sticking points during the Senate inquiry into the bill was the fact that it would require social media platforms to arbitrate whether information should be censored or downranked, without clear explanation as to how they were expected to do this. Legal expert James McComish from the Victorian Bar said that the bill didn’t lay out exactly how truth would be determined by social media platforms. 'That is the gaping hole at the heart of the bill. For it to be shown that any content is misinformation or disinformation, the true position has to be identified,' he told the Senate inquiry into the bill. The ACMA said it would play no role in arbitrating the true position, but would rather apply a 'systems-based approach' that would scrutinise the platforms’ processes for handling misinformation and disinformation. Constitutional scholar Anne Twomey said that this arrangement effectively put foreign corporations, like Elon Musk’s X platform or Chinese-owned TikTok, in charge of shaping Australia’s public discourse online. 'As a general principle, outsourcing censorship to foreign corporations is generally not a good idea,' Twomey told senators. Platforms would rely heavily on fact-checkers – as they already do, but this would be enforceable by the ACMA under the new legislation. But Twomey, an expert frequently called upon for fact-checks, said that in her experience, fact-checkers are often 'young kids out of university' who 'misunderstand the experts' and 'often get it wrong.' 'They’re taking on this really important role of making a decision that will lead Meta or Google or whatever to make decisions about what is true and what is false, when the fact-checker themselves hasn’t properly understood what the experts have said,' Twomey told the inquiry. Real Problem, Wrong Solution Senators opposing the bill said that while the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online is a real problem that needs to be addressed, this bill was not the right solution. 'We are concerned this bill doesn’t actually do what it needs to do when it comes to stopping the deliberate mass distribution of false and harmful information,' said Greens spokesperson for communications, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young on Friday. 'It gives media moguls like Murdoch an exemption and hands over responsibility to tech companies and billionaires like Elon Musk to determine what is true or false under ambiguous definitions. It does little to stop non-human actors like bots flooding social media and boosting dangerous algorithms.' The Greens want 'comprehensive reforms that tackle the business models and dangerous algorithms that fuel division and damage democracy, and legislate a duty of care so these platforms prevent harm in the first place,' said Senator Hanson-Young. Independent Senator David Pocock agreed that the bill took 'the wrong approach,' posing a threat to free speech, while at the same time failing to target the underlying issues of algorithm transparency and bot activity. 'I believe that our rights to speech and protest are fundamental to a healthy democracy. As these rights are not legislated, we must be vigilant whenever legislation is put forward that could encroach on these rights,' he said in a newsletter email. Australia has only a constitutionally implied right to freedom of political communication, which is much weaker speech protection than, say, America’s First Amendment. However, 'Bots do not have a right to freedom of speech and are being weaponised to influence views on different topics, including in elections,' he said, calling for tougher action on bots, and for legislation forcing social media companies 'to show us how they are using algorithms to influence users.' What Next? Despite withdrawing its misinformation bill, the Labor Government has not given up on its stated goal of making Australians safer online. 'The Government invites all Parliamentarians to work with us on other proposals to strengthen democratic institutions and keep Australians safe online, while safeguarding values like freedom of expression,' said Rowland over the weekend. Rowland put forward several legislative initiatives, including strengthening offences targeting the sharing of non-consensual and sexually explicit deep fakes; a proposal to enforce truth in political advertising for elections; and progressing reforms on the regulation of Artificial Intelligence. Other legislation in the works that will impact Australian internet and social media users include a move to criminalise doxing, new privacy reforms, and new hate speech laws. As yet, the government has not indicated any plans to tackle social media algorithms and bots, which senators identified as a high priority. The Labor Government is also ramming through a bill to enforce a minimum age of 16 years for social media. Despite allowing only a single day for public submissions and two days for Senate review, Crikey reports that the government’s snap inquiryattracted 15,000 responses. The response to the inquiry was no doubt boosted by Elon Musk’s viral post on X(now viewed over 24 million times) responding to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese with the statement, 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.' The Greens have voiced concerns about the bill, but with support from the Opposition, it is expected to pass in Parliament this week. Perhaps the government should not count its chickens yet though, as the Guardian reports that several Nationals MPs have expressed hesitation in supporting the bill.

Ukraine’s 2025 Challenges For Justice – Interview	By Olga Golovina On January 1, Ukraine became a full member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a landmark moment in its efforts to see senior Russian figures tried for war crimes. At the same time, Ukraine’s judicial system is processing nearly 150,000 further cases. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, executive director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, told IWPR’s Olga Golovina that Kyiv needed to lay out a new strategy for the coming year, given the overwhelming number of cases. 'We need to have a strategic goal - how and whom to prosecute, so that these prosecutions are real, and not just in absentia,' he said. 'It is important to understand that thousands of criminal proceedings can be opened, but if the right strategy is not chosen and real investigations are not carried out, this will not lead to prosecutions.' Olga Golovina: What are the challenges facing Ukraine in 2025 in matters related to war crimes? Oleksandr Pavlichenko: The first is the array of war crimes to date, of which, according to official statistics, there are almost 147,000 since the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. The number of registered crimes that require investigation as well as the identification of victims and perpetrators is a major challenge. Separate challenges are the investigation of categories of crimes that are classified as those directed primarily against human life and health, in areas outside government control. These are cases of murder of civilians, execution of prisoners of war, torture, torture with sexual violence and the identification of specific criminals. Unfortunately, these cases arepoorly investigated due to lack of access. A further large category of criminal proceedings concerns the destruction of facilities andproperty - this is a separate category that requires the development of a system of compensation and restitution, even without taking into account how the crimes will be investigated and those responsible for these crimes determined. The large number of criminal proceedings and the lack of access to the territories where the crimes were committed often make it impossible to investigate and detain the suspects. Therefore, they avoid criminal and judicial prosecution. How should the articles of the Rome Statute be implemented in Ukrainian legislation? Ukraine ratified the Rome Statute on August 21, 2024. From January 1, 2025, Ukraine becomes a full member. But the law on the implementation of this international instrument turned out to be more cosmetic than realistic, because deputies tried to speed up the consideration of the issue of implementing the Rome Statute in parliament. I believe that directly transferring the articles of the Rome Statute to national legislation is not advisable because the legal systems and definitions of crimes are different. It is worth considering the prospects of investigation, the capabilities of the law enforcement and judicial systems aimed at prosecuting war crimes, investigating, collecting evidence and conducting trials in compliance with all standards. The application of the principle of command responsibility for the commission of war crimes and, accordingly, crimes against humanity is not optimal. Also, war crimes investigations are not always conducted properly. In wartime, when there is no access to territories, standards of proof are often used that do not always coincide with the requirements of criminal procedural legislation. Therefore, it is worth thinking about how to improve the relevant investigation procedures and ensure that the trial takes place within the framework of criminal procedural legislation. It is necessary to prepare legislation for the future. It is necessary to involve investigators and prosecutors in cooperation, who must identify weaknesses and understand what is needed to qualitatively investigate a huge array of war crimes. What reforms could be useful? Ukraine does not quite correctly apply the procedure for considering cases using such a method as a trial in absentia, adopting the relevant sentences and believing that these cases are completed and only require the search for those who are considered guilty of committing such crimes. These cases have rather weak evidentiary value due to the one-sided nature of the proceedings with an accusatory bias. As practice shows, the international system of searching for criminals for the purpose of their extradition to Ukraine does not work. These decisions are unfortunately assessed as having a context of political persecution. This is a big problem. The international community should develop standards and rules for considering issues that are not of purely Ukrainian significance. Unfortunately, there is no internationally recognised body whose decisions could lead to the extradition of most war criminals. After all, the ICC only considers cases of high-ranking officials. Therefore, Ukraine finds itself alone with this problem. How can Ukraine’s allies help address these challenges? International support can be effective in accelerating the processes of creating both a special tribunal for aggression and in maintaining the focus of attention at the level of the ICC. We expect that new categories of cases will be added to the two Ukrainian cases currently pending at the ICC – the deportation of Ukrainian children and the shelling of energy infrastructure, for which arrest warrants were issued in 2023 and 2024. These could be cases concerning the conditions of detention in occupied territory of Ukraine and in the Russian Federation. A good signal is that the aggression tribunal [to prosecute the Russian leadership] [should be finalised by 2025 with the support of the Council of Europe and the European Union. The secretary general of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, expects that in April 2025, practical steps will be taken towards its establishment. It is also worth noting the launch of the register of damages and the center for collecting materials on the crime of aggression in The Hague. These are the evidence-gathering tools necessary for future trials and decisions. However, we cannot yet talk about harm reduction and preventing new war crimes. Individual trials in states that can use the principle of universal jurisdiction would be important in order to demonstrate how this tool works at the global level. This could be a prospect for the development of an international system of criminal prosecution of war criminals at the level of individual states. For example, Finland detained a Russian man at Ukraine’s request, although it refused to extradite him, and he went on trial on December 5 on charges of committing war crimes while commanding a far-right paramilitary unit in eastern Ukraine a decade ago. Now there is a trial ongoing in Finland. This can serve as an example for other countries and I would like to see more such cases. What are the most urgent goals for the current system of war crimes investigations? Now, processes are being optimised so that investigators and prosecutors are not overloaded with criminal cases, so that there are enough technical means to effectively conduct war crimes investigations. It is worth building a mechanism for analysing and using data-evidence in the context of a criminal investigation of war crimes – for instance, satellite images or the interception of telephone conversations. A high-quality investigation and a high-quality trial should be the goal of the law enforcement and judicial system. We hear statements that no war criminal will escape investigation and punishment, but unfortunately, it is not even possible to identify war criminals and determine their approximate number. Therefore, we need to have a strategic goal - how and whom to prosecute, so that these prosecutions are real, and not just in absentia. These processes depend very much on the outcome of the war and on what terms peace will be achieved. Prosecution for war crimes will depend on this.

‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ Services May Trap Young Malaysians In Debt –...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Like many young Malaysians, Danial Syarqawi likes to buy things online. It’s easy to make online purchases these days, he says, with the help of popular apps that use the 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) feature. The financing option lets buyers split the cost of a purchase into smaller installments – often free of interest – that are paid over time. 'It’s convenient. I can get what I need without paying everything upfront,' said Danial, a 25-year-old private employee earning 2,900 ringgit (U.S. $646) monthly. Young Malaysians are flocking to BNPL services because of the appeal of interest-free installments, easy transactions, and the immediate gratification they can get from online shopping. But such access to easy money to buy goods may expose them to huge debt, financial experts said. Growing e-commerce market BNPL services started gaining traction in Malaysia in 2019, with platforms such as Atome, Grab PayLater, and Shopee PayLater joining the burgeoning e-commerce market. In 2023, there were 77.3 million BNPL transactions worth 6.2 billion ringgit ($1.38 billion), according to the Consumer Credit Oversight Board Task Force, a government agency. For the past 12 months, the agency also noted a growing number of transactions, although figures for the period were not yet released. There are 2.9 million active BNPL users in the country, the agency reported. Many active users are young working adults, with 44% aged between 21 and 30 years old. People whose ages range from 31 to 45 years old comprise 47%. It’s not surprising that the services are popular among young, tech-savvy users: They’re readily accessible, easy to use, and payment installments are often interest-free. On the other hand, credit cards charge extra fees and require a more rigorous application process. Applicants need to submit various documents, such as pay slips and income tax statements, and the approval process can take days or even weeks. It’s no wonder that for many young people like Danial, BNPL services provide a reliable and quick financial lifeline. But with the easy money BNPL services offer, Danial said he had trouble paying installments on time. 'I’ve missed repayments twice due to financial issues,' Danial told BenarNews. Danial, who purchased electronic items and household items online, currently owes 500 to 800 ringgit ($111-178) from the BNPL services he used. He also had no choice but to pay penalties for the delayed payments, which typically range between 10 and 50 ringgit ($2 and $11) per installment. Most repayment periods BNPL services offer range up to a year. 'They’ll call to remind me about the payments and fees,' he said. And it’s not just Danial. Rising debt As of October last year, some 53,000 Malaysians under the age of 30 were drowning in debt worth nearly 1.9 billion ringgit (U.S. 423.51 million), according to the state-owned Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency. The debt is partly due to the growing reliance of young people on BNPL services as well as credit cards and personal loans, the agency said. Amid the rising debt of young Malaysians, Bank Negara Malaysia – the country’s central bank – last month proposed to the government stricter rules requiring lenders and BNPL providers to evaluate a borrower’s ability to pay before they approve loans to 'curb potential debt risks.' Unlike banks, BNPLs are not regulated in Malaysia. BNPL providers did not respond to BenarNews requests seeking comment on this issue. ‘Allure’ of easy money Doris Liew, an economist with the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs, attributed the surge in BNPL use among young Malaysians to rising living costs and stagnant wages. 'The allure of BNPL is particularly strong among youth, who may use these schemes to finance big-ticket items such as the latest smartphones or laptops – purchases that may otherwise be beyond their immediate means,' she told BenarNews. But unlike traditional credit systems that are under scrutiny of regulatory agencies, BNPL operates in a largely unregulated space, Liew said. 'Many of these schemes offer enticing deals and easy credit access to new users, luring them in with the promise of simple, interest-free installments, although often with hidden costs that many users are unaware of,' she said. This was especially true for Alif Rizal, a 23-year-old marketing specialist, who uses BNPL services for his online purchases, which usually include electronic items, clothing, and room decorations. 'I only found out about the hidden [interest fees] after the 13th time using the services,' Alif said. Alif borrows between 400 and 800 ringgit ($89-$178) from BNPL services. But for purchases below 500 ringgit ($111), Alif said he preferred making lump-sum payments instead of tapping BNPL platforms to avoid incurring additional fees. The trend of many young people having debt could worsen in the months to come, another economist told BenarNews. 'With household debt already at alarming levels, more borrowing increases the risk of financial instability when the next economic downturn hits,' said Carmelo Ferlito, CEO of the Center for Market Education. 'I believe Bank Negara was right to urge BNPL providers to exercise caution when extending their services, particularly to individuals at high financial risk.' Benefits of BNPL services For another economist, BNPL services do offer benefits to consumers but the industry needs to be effectively regulated and there should be stronger financial literacy among its users. 'If properly regulated, BNPL could offer a positive alternative to expensive credit cards or unregulated loan sharks,' said Geoffrey Williams, director of Williams Business Consultancy. 'There must be a clear legal framework to protect both creditors and lenders. Unregistered or unregulated providers should have no place in any BNPL system,' he said. Malaysia is currently working on new legislation to regulate BNPL services. The government hopes the proposed commission to regulate BNPL companies and other credit service providers will start operating this year. For now, Danial tries to be prudent with his BNPL transactions. 'BNPL [services] could be useful if used properly. If you don’t have self-control and spend more than you can pay monthly, they could be a burden.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJS1juCbrhCOq	2025-01-09T16:18:47-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russia Advancing Particularly In Kura...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Assad’s Fall Disrupts Russian Submarine Deployments in the Mediterranean Bashar al-Assad’s fall from power in Syria marks another setback for Russia’s overseas military posture. After the regime’s collapse, the Russian Navy’s last Improved Kilo–class submarine in the Mediterranean Sea departed the Soviet-remnant Tartous naval base. On January 2, the Portuguese Navy spotted the Novorossiysk sailing through Gibraltar en route to the Baltics. Since 2013 the Russian Black Sea Fleet has rotated its Improved Kilos to the Tartous base. In 2015 Russian submarines launched Kalibr naval cruise missiles at targets in Syria, a milestone for Moscow’s nonnuclear long-range strike prowess. And in 2017 Jens Stoltenberg, then the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s secretary general, warned that Russian submarine activity in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean was at its highest level since the Cold War. The Black Sea Fleet has six Improved Kilo–class submarines, four of which remain in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian military has repeatedly struck and disabled one, the Rostov-on-Don, with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. Along with the Novorossiysk, the Krasnodar is forward deployed to the Baltic Sea. This leaves Russia with only three operational Improved Kilos in the Black Sea and none in the Mediterranean, jeopardizing the Kremlin’s ability to project power. Russia’s Tartous and Khmmeimim bases functioned as staging points for Russian combat operations in Syria and logistical hubs for Moscow’s geopolitical ambitions in Africa. 2. Ukraine’s 155th Mechanized Brigade Demonstrates Ukraine’s Force Generation Struggles The Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigation is investigating elements of Kyiv’s French-trained 155th Mechanized Brigade for going absent without official leave (AWOL) or deserting the force. The press reported that the missing elements were deployed to the heavily reinforced yet beleaguered Pokrovsk theater. Nicknamed 'Anne of Kyiv' after a Kyivan Rus princess who became queen of France after marrying King Henry I, the 155th Brigade is a vital demonstration of Europe’s commitment to Ukraine’s defense. The unit is armed with French AMX-10 armored fighting vehicles and CAESAR howitzers, as well as German Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks. It is part of a NATO project whereby alliance members train and equip individual Ukrainian combat formations. The Ukrainian military’s force generation strategy of building new combat brigades rather than reinforcing existing ones has sparked debates among observers. Many wonder whether inexperienced leaders can ensure unit cohesion, discipline, and warfighting capability against mounting Russian pressure. 3. Battlefield Assessment The crucial Kharkiv front has remained relatively calm. But the situationlooks grim for Ukrainian defensive operations in Pokrovsk, Velyka Novosilka, Kurakhove, and Toretsk. Russian forces have advanced steadily, particularly in Toretsk. Kurakhove has been hanging in the balance, with conflicting reports about whether the Russian military has seized the town. Current force-on-force and force-to-terrain ratios and Ukraine’s lack of solid defensive positions suggest that Kurakhove will soon fall. In Kursk, Ukrainian forces have heightened their efforts to capture more Russian territory. Ukraine likely hopes to reverse the momentum on this front and strengthen its position in potential ceasefire talks under the incoming second Trump administration. 4. Drone Warfare Update In a significant drone warfare development, Ukraine scored the first confirmed naval unmanned-on-manned aerial kill in military history. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (GUR) shot down a Russian Mi-8 helicopter with a Magura V5 unmanned surface vehicle in the Black Sea. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s heavy electronic warfare activity has been effective against Russian drone warfare in Kursk. In response, Russia continues to deploy drones controlled through fiber-optic cables.

Moral Responsibility In The Age Of Machine Warfare – OpEd	By Rafael Hernandez de Santiago In the artificial glow of Techville’s neon lights, the city gleams like a polished machine — a utopia of innovation, efficiency and wealth. Yet beneath its metallic sheen, the cracks of its ideals grow wider, exposing the fragile, chaotic reality of ethics in modern warfare. Techville, a self-proclaimed beacon of progress, finds itself grappling with questions it can no longer ignore: What happens when the tools of tomorrow clash with the morality of humanity? How does one create coexistence in a world teetering on the brink of its own destruction? The irony is inescapable. A city built on the promise of a brighter future now finds itself manufacturing instruments of destruction. Samir’s story, though fictional, echoes across the globe — a child in the crosshairs of conflict, caught between the ambition of advanced weaponry and the simplicity of a wooden toy carved by his father. His life is a stark reminder that the cost of progress is often paid in innocence. Techville’s most celebrated industry is its defense technology sector, a juggernaut of artificial intelligence, robotics, and quantum computing. 'Efficiency for security' is its motto, yet the definition of security remains as elusive as ever. For Samir, security is the absence of roaring planes and trembling walls. For the architects of war in Techville, it is the cold, calculated numbers on a risk analysis report. Here lies the crux of the problem: The unpredictability of ethical content in war. Every drone strike and every algorithmic decision carry the weight of moral responsibility. But who bears this burden? The programmers in their glass towers, insulated from the consequences of their code? The policymakers who sign off on missions with sanitized terms like neutralization or collateral damage? Or the society that cheers for the illusion of safety while its humanity erodes? It is not just a question for Techville; it is a question for all of us, as we hurtle into an era where machines can kill, decisions are made at the speed of light, and the consequences of those decisions linger for generations. For Samir, the sky — a symbol of boundless dreams and infinite potential — has become a source of terror. His story is the antithesis of Techville’s vision. While Techville looks upward to the stars with ambition, Samir looks up in fear. His wooden toy, carved with love, stands in quiet defiance against the cold, impersonal machinery that defines his nights. Yet Samir dreams. He dreams of a sky without drones, of walls that do not tremble, of a place where children can sleep without wondering if tomorrow will come. His dreams, fragile yet persistent, hold a lesson for Techville and for the world: Progress without humanity is a hollow victory. Techville prides itself on control — over technology, markets, narratives. But control in warfare is a mirage. The algorithms that power Techville’s defense systems are not immune to bias, nor are they capable of understanding the nuanced moral dilemmas of human conflict. A drone can distinguish between a weapon and a toy, but it cannot comprehend the weight of a child’s fear or the grief of a parent. Moreover, as Techville’s systems grow more sophisticated, they become more opaque. The city’s brightest minds cannot fully explain how their creations make decisions. This unpredictability is not just a flaw; it is also a threat. It is the kind of threat that turns the dream of a safer world into a dystopian nightmare. The story of Techville and Samir calls for a radical rethinking of coexistence. If progress is to mean anything, it must begin with empathy, with the recognition that our lives are interconnected in ways that transcend borders, technologies and ideologies. Techville’s leaders must take a page from the past — a past where respect and understanding were not seen as weaknesses but as strengths. The image of a classroom with a cross and the word 'Allah' hanging side by side is not just a relic of simpler times; it is also a blueprint for a future where differences are celebrated, not exploited. This is not a call to abandon technology but to humanize it: To create systems that prioritize life over efficiency, that consider the long-term consequences of actions, that aim not just to win wars, but also to prevent them. In its quest to build the future, Techville has become a symbol of humanity’s oldest flaw: The belief that power can exist without responsibility. Its neon lights shine bright, but their glare obscures the shadows of the sky — the children like Samir, the families torn apart, the humanity lost in the pursuit of control. The irony is that the solutions Techville seeks are not found in its labs or algorithms but in the simple, enduring values of compassion, respect and humility — in the soft hum of a mother’s lullaby, in the quiet strength of a father standing guard, in the dreams of a child tracing the grooves of a wooden toy. As Techville debates its future, the world must listen to the cry for peace that echoes in Samir’s story. It is a cry that transcends borders, languages and technologies. It is a cry that demands we look beyond the immediacy of our ambitions and consider the legacy we leave behind. The choice is ours: To continue on a path of unpredictability and destruction or to chart a new course — one where coexistence is not just a dream but also a reality, where the sky is a source of wonder, not fear, and where progress is measured not in profits but in the lives we touch and the peace we create. • Rafael Hernandez de Santiago, viscount of Espes, is a Spanish national residing in Saudi Arabia and working at the Gulf Research Center.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJa9UjjLtOOEa	2025-01-09T16:16:28-08:00	
Carter’s Legacy Lives On In Ways People Might Not Expect – OpEd	Jimmy Carter’s recent departure at age 100 has prompted assessments of the man and his presidency. In the default view, Carter is a decent fellow who made crucial blunders, some more visible than others. The Constitution assigns no role for the federal government in education but President Carter created the federal Department of Education, a payoff to the teacher unions who supported his 1976 campaign. The department’s effectiveness can be judged by the 1983 'A Nation at Risk,' contending that 'the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people.' Not exactly a great report card. As economist Milton Friedman noted, bureaucracies are easy to start but practically impossible to eliminate, whatever their level of failure. President Ronald Reagan failed to eliminate the federal education department, which survived other Republican and Democrat administrations. So does another Carter creation, seldom recognized by the people. One of President Carter’s top priorities was the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which created the Senior Executive Service (SES) a corps of more than 8,000 government bosses established to 'ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.' It didn’t exactly work out that way. By 1981, few efficiency gains were evident, but SES bosses were dissatisfied with their pay. Between 2008 and 2011, on top of their hefty salaries and benefits, the elitist bureaucrats bagged more than $340 million in bonuses, which were not subject to budget cuts. True to form, the SES insignia is a gold keystone surrounded with stars, also appearing on the SES flag. In effect, Jimmy Carter aimed to fix government inefficiency by creating a new bureaucracy. This development is not unique to Carter and his political party. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) failed to prevent the massive terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, the worst since Pearl Harbor in 1941, with 3,000 dead and thousands wounded. The response of the Bush administration was to create a new federal agency, the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS failed to prevent terrorist attacks at Fort Hood (2009), the Boston Marathon (2013), San Bernardino (2015) and Orlando in 2016. The vaunted FBI played no role in the takedown of the terrorists. Despite massive failure at their appointed tasks, all three federal agencies lived on. President Carter is also associated with the 'misery index,' a combination of unemployment and inflation, but that measure was created by economist Arthur Okun during the administration of Lyndon Johnson during the 1960s. During the 1976 campaign, Carter wielded it against the Republican Gerald Ford, who lost to the Georgia Democrat. On Carter’s watch, the misery index started at 12.72 percent, peaked at 21.9 percent in June, 1980, and was still higher than 20 percent in November. That played a role in Reagan’s landslide victory, but the people had other factors to consider. As the late Malcolm Muggeridge noted, the twin pitfalls of religious experience are unctuousness and spiritual exhibitionism. Both are on display with Carter, who was also a scold of sorts. On July 15, 1979, Carter told the nation: 'For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world.' And so on, in what became known as the 'malaise speech,' though Carter did not use the word. Judging by their vote in November, 1980, the people held Carter responsible for the surging misery. Jimmy Carter can be remembered as a decent person and the president who launched the Department of Education and Senior Executive Service, still with us after all these years.

Designated US Envoy For Ukraine Says Trump Wants Equitable End To...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s designated envoy for Ukraine and Russia said Trump will take Ukraine’s interests into account when he starts working on a settlement to end the war in Ukraine and will aim to make sure the solution is equitable. 'People need to understand he’s not trying to give something to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin or the Russians,' said Keith Kellogg, the retired lieutenant-general whom Trump has designated as his envoy and tasked with leading negotiations to end the war. 'He’s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,' Kellogg said in the interview with Fox News on January 8. 'He’s going to make sure it’s equitable and it’s fair and he’s said that repeatedly,' including to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump said during last year’s election campaign he could end the conflict in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. He now says he hopes to end the fighting within six months. 'I hope long before six months,' Trump said at a news conference on January 7 when asked if he could solve the war within half a year. Kellogg said he would prefer to set an even shorter time span of 100 days from Trump’s inauguration on January 20. 'I’m on the clock. He’s on the clock as well because he wants to end [the war] as quickly as he can,' Kellogg said. 'He knows it’s tough one…but he’s committed to it.' Kellogg declined to divulge the content of any of his conversations with Trump on the war, saying Trump 'speaks for himself' and more information would be forthcoming after the inauguration. He indicated that the groundwork is being laid for Trump and Putin to talk. 'We’ll set the conditions…and he will eventually get to the position where he’ll be talking with Putin and also President Zelenskiy as well, and I think they are going to come to a…solution in the near term,' Kellogg said. He was not asked about the postponement of a trip that he was expected to make this month to Kyiv and other European capitals. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha announced on January 7 that the trip would be rescheduled. The envoy-designate in the interview criticized President Joe Biden for not talking with Putin, saying it has been more than two years since they spoke. Trump on the other hand speaks with America’s adversaries and allies alike, he said. 'He actually knows that you need to talk to people to get to an end state and that is what we are going to do,' Kellogg said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJTlM4tpF5u0R	2025-01-09T16:14:08-08:00	
China Imported Record Amounts Of Crude Oil In 2023 – Analysis	China, the world’s largest importer of crude oil, imported 11.3 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil in 2023, 10% more than in 2022, according to China customs data. Refiners in China imported record volumes of crude oil in 2023 to supply the country’s increasing refining capacity in order to support the country’s transportation fuel needs and produce feedstocks for its growing petrochemical industry. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were China’s main sources of crude oil imports in 2023. Compared with 2022, China’s 2023 crude oil imports increased the most from Russia, Iran, Brazil, and the United States. China’s largest volumetric increase in crude oil imports in 2023 was from Russia. From 2019 to 2021, China obtained 15% of its crude oil imports from Russia, second only to Saudi Arabia. In 2023, Russia became China’s top source of crude oil imports, supplying 19% of China’s crude oil imports (2.1 million b/d). This increase was the result of discounts related to sanctions and price caps on crude oil from Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The next largest increases in China’s crude oil imports came from Iran, Brazil, and the United States. Customs data indicate that China imported 54% more crude oil (1.1 million b/d) from Malaysia in 2023 than in 2022. However, crude oil imports from Malaysia exceeded Malaysia’s total crude oil production. Industry analysts believe that much of the oil shipped from Iran to China was relabeled as originating from countries such as Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman to avoid U.S. sanctions against countries engaging in petroleum transactions with Iran. In 2023, China increased crude oil imports from Brazil by 52%, from 498,000 b/d to 755,000 b/d, and from the United States by 81%, from 158,000 b/d to 286,000 b/d. Although China’s overall crude oil imports increased, crude oil imports from a few of its largest sources decreased. Notably, after crude oil from Russia became available at a discount when sanctions were imposed, China decreased its crude oil imports from Western Europe, where crude oil prices were relatively high. China’s crude oil imports from Norway decreased 100,000 b/d from 2022 to 2023, and China continued to import much smaller volumes of crude oil from the United Kingdom than before crude oil from Russia was discounted.

The Drought That Felled Assad – OpEd	The meteorological drought that swept through the Fertile Crescent (stretching from the Tigris and Euphrates to the Nile Valley) in the 2000s finally ended up undoing the Assad regime in Syria and forcing Bashar al-Assad to flee to Moscow under the cover of night last month. At first glance, drought or its driver in climate change seems to have little to do with a geopolitical event like the fall of the Assad regime. However, the fall of the regime has been years in the making, and climate-related issues played a large role. The decline of the Assad regime began with a protracted drought in 1998, the likes of which the Middle East had not seen in the past nine centuries. The drought’s severity reached its peak in 2006-2011 in northeastern Syria, which is the country’s breadbasket, comprising the Euphrates and Jazira regions. These regions produce two-thirds of the country’s crop yield, especially Syria’s staple, wheat. At its peak, the drought caused agriculture, the green anchor of the Syrian economy, to collapse. Agricultural production, which generates one-fourth of the country’s GDP, dropped to 17 percent. But this aggregate impact doesn’t capture the devastation it wrought on millions of rural residents, farmers, and herders whose individual farm production fell to zero or near-zero. Syria, which was the only country in the Fertile Crescent (Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine) that was self-sufficient in foodgrain production, became an importer of wheat in 2008. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad’s father, who ruled the country from 1971 to 2000, founded his reign on Baathist socialist ideology. He helped expand agriculture by subsidizing the ever-growing cost of farm inputs and even insuring against the crop failures that were frequent in the dryland agricultural system. State subsidies buffered millions of rural residents, farmers, and herders against unexpected meteorological and market-driven shocks. His son, on the other hand, reversed all that. Introducing neoliberal policies, Bashar al-Assad left everyone on their own. On his watch, capital-rich farmers prospered while the rest kept falling through the cracks. Although dryland agriculture is the mainstay of the Syrian economy, the country has a significant portion of irrigated agriculture that is predominantly drained by the Euphrates, and to a far lesser degree by the Tigris. But with climate change, both waterways were drying up, especially the Khabur, Syria’s main tributary to the Euphrates, which saturates the northeastern region of Hasaka. The Khabur has been the iconic source of Syrian agriculture for millennia, whose significance to farming earned it a mention in the Old Testament as 'Habor.' Desiccated, the Khabur couldn’t now reach the Euphrates, a failure that had long sown suspicions in downstream Iraq, which is the largest beneficiary of Euphrates water. Hit by another drought in the mid-1970s, the Euphrates saw its flow of 15.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) to Iraq in 1973 drop drastically to 9.4 BCM in 1975. Iraq accused Syria of diverting its share of water. Syria blamed Turkey, which is home to the headwaters of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Khabur, for the reduced flow. Unconvinced, Iraq deployed tens of thousands of troops to the Iraq-Syrian border in 1975. Damascus answered in kind. A shooting war between upstream and downstream neighbors nearly erupted before the former Soviet Union disengaged the two thirsty foes. The drought in 2006-11 triggered a mass migration from the rural hinterlands to urban centers. An estimated 1.5 million rural residents were displaced to the fringes of urban centers. Displaced Syrians were all 'climate refugees' who were without jobs, income, and, above all, any hope to begin a new life. The concentration of despair was highly combustible, and it could easily turn into a conflagration. The spark that ignited this highly flammable situation was the influx of even more drought-driven refugees from neighboring Iraq, bringing urban centers and their scarce services under unprecedented strain. The influx of Iraqi refugees peaked in 2007 at 1.5 million, bringing the total along with internally displaced Syrians to 3 million. By 2010, these climate refugees amounted to one-fifth of the Syrian urban population. In 2002-2010, Syria added 50 percent moreto its urban population of $22 million. The drought-driven ecological instability shook the Assad regime to its foundation in 2011, when the urban uprising erupted, and for the first time Assad’s grip on power began to slip. The first major protest occurred in the 'impoverished drought-stricken rural province of Daraa' in March 2011. As protests spread, Homs, Syria’s largest city in terms of territory, became the epicenter of political uprising. In July 2012, Syria’s most populous city of Aleppo fell to the opposition. In 2013, Raqqa on the Euphrates, which sits next to the country’s largest dam (Tabqa Dam) and the biggest reservoir (Lake Assad), was occupied by the Syrian opposition. In January 2014, Raqqa was seized by the Islamic State to become the capital of its caliphate. The Assad regime, completely resourceless and under a ruthless sanctions regime, had few means to help desperate Syrians struggling to survive. Although poor in ecological and economic resources to cope with a natural disaster, Assad still had a monopoly over violence, the defining feature of a Weberian state. Unable to provide any relief to millions of his masses, Assad simply deployed violence to keep a lid on mass eruptions. By 2016, he regained control of major cities including Aleppo. By 2020, the civil war had ended. But Assad’s repressive measures, including the alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people, elicited a global response that left him and his regime further weakened and those arrayed against him even more emboldened. Soon he was losing the one resource that he thought he controlled: the monopoly over violence. His opposition, meanwhile, was receiving support from the United States, Turkey (a NATO member with the largest military in Europe), Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Unbeknownst to him, Assad’s sclerotic regime was fast hollowing out. Four years after regaining control over much of Syria, the Assad regime fell in just 10 days, when a coalition of the opposition in Hayat Tahrir-al-Shaam (HTS) overran it. The opposition’s blitzkrieg began with the fall of the drought-stricken city of Aleppo in the north on November 29. Buoyed by the biggest prize, HTS troops advanced to Hama. The next were Daraa, the cradle of the anti-Assad revolution, and Homs, the crown jewel of Syria’s irrigated farming, which were captured on December 7. Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, and Homs had all been at some point agriculturally well-endowed regions. On December 7, HTS troops reached the peripheries of their ultimate prize, Damascus, the capital. Many of HTS troops defied their command and entered the city, overtaking the main buildings. The next day, the Syrian military practically dissolved itself and Russia whisked Assad away to Moscow. HTS advanced from the north to the south all the way to Damascus and Deir ez-Zor in the east. Can the incoming rulers save Syria from future drought disasters? Fifty-five percent of Syria is desert that burns with aridity. Due to ever-soaring temperatures, two-thirds of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Khabur have evaporated, leaving behind little for irrigated farming. The incoming rulers, whose credentials are anchored in lifelong careers fueling an insurgency, can hardly match the looming existential threats in climate change or its manifestations in meteorological droughts.

Pope’s Peace Diplomacy In Era Of Multiple Wars – Analysis	By Rudolf Gehrig At the height of World War II, as the Allies coordinated their strategy, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested involving the pope in peace negotiations. The proposal drew a mocking response from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin: 'The pope? How many divisions does the pope have?' Decades later, the Soviet empire collapsed — aided, in part, by papal diplomacy. Today, the Holy See’s diplomatic service remains a unique force in international relations. 'The popes have been calling for peace on an international platform since at least the beginning of the 20th century,' EWTN Senior Vatican Analyst Francis X. Rocca said. 'Pope Benedict XV tried and failed to bring a negotiated end to the first World War. Half a century later, St. Paul VI went to the United Nations and famously called for ‘no more war.’ His successors have followed suit.' Modern papal diplomacy Pope Francis’ diplomatic initiatives extend beyond his weekly appeals for peace from St. Peter’s Square. In 2024, he addressed the G7 summit in Italy, calling for new ethical guidelines to govern artificial intelligence development. Rocca noted that Francis’ distinctive contribution has been 'to link military conflict to social justice questions and particularly the environment.' The pope’s diplomatic engagement spans multiple fronts. At his annual meeting with the diplomatic corps in 2023, he advocated for human dignity and condemned surrogacy as 'deplorable.' 'The path to peace calls for respect for life, for every human life, starting with the life of the unborn child in the mother’s womb,' Francis declared, describing surrogacy as 'a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child, based on the exploitation of situations of the mother’s material needs.' Behind-the-scenes diplomacy The Vatican’s diplomatic influence operates through both public statements and private channels. 'The Holy See’s great advantage as a diplomatic actor is that it is neutral, sovereign but not aligned, allowing it to communicate with different sides in a conflict,' Rocca explained. He pointed to Pope Francis’ instrumental role in facilitating the 2014 rapprochement between the United States and Cuba as a notable success. With diplomatic relations spanning more than 180 sovereign states, the Holy See maintains one of the world’s most extensive diplomatic networks. However, some challenges have tested even papal diplomacy’s limits. The China challenge 'One of the biggest diplomatic challenges that Pope Francis has faced has been the Vatican’s dialogue with China,' said Courtney Mares, CNA Rome correspondent. The relationship has been particularly complex since 2013 when Francis’ papacy began concurrently with Xi Jinping’s rise to power. The Catholic Church in China was long divided between the underground Church loyal to Rome and the government-sanctioned Catholic Association. In 2018, the Vatican signed a provisional agreement with Beijing regarding bishop appointments, though the process was not smooth. 'Almost immediately after this agreement was signed, there were reports of increased persecution of the underground Catholic community,' Mares noted. Despite concerns over human rights violations and breaches of the agreement, the Vatican renewed it in 2024 for another four years. Navigating modern conflicts The pope’s approach to current conflicts has drawn both praise and criticism. In the Gaza war, his calls for a ceasefire and hostage release, combined with criticism of Israel, have sparked controversy. Similarly, his stance on Ukraine has sometimes frustrated Catholic leadership there, notably when he appeared reluctant to directly condemn Russian aggression. Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Community of Sant’Egidio, which partners with the Vatican on humanitarian issues, emphasized Francis’ genuine commitment to peace. The pope has backed words with action, dispatching Cardinal Matteo Zuppi on peace missions to Kyiv, Moscow, Washington, and Beijing to address peace initiatives and humanitarian concerns. 'The risk is that we become desensitized to war,' Riccardi warned, comparing the pope’s persistent peace advocacy to 'the rooster crowing and awakening Peter: Humanity has become like Peter, enslaved to violence, accustomed to violence.' As this modern 'rooster,' Pope Francis continues to echo his message in his 2020 encyclical Fratelli Tutti: 'Every war leaves our world worse than it was before. War is a failure of politics and of humanity, a shameful capitulation, a stinging defeat before the forces of evil.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJUUnScAunbRn	2025-01-09T16:07:55-08:00	
Armenia Mulls Talks With Brussels To Launch EU Bid	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Amid a growing rift with former ally Russia, Armenia has passed a bill calling for the country to submit an application to begin EU membership talks with Brussels. The Armenian government on Thursday approved a bill drafted in response to a petition that called for the country to submit an application to join the EU bloc. 'Adopting the law doesn’t literally mean Armenia is joining the EU because that cannot be done through a law or government decision — the decision on that can only be made through a referendum,' Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said after the decision. Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said on Wednesday that the country could sign a 'comprehensive' new partnership agenda with Brussels 'in the coming months', a step that could also include visa liberalisation for its citizens. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move comes as Armenia has increasingly deepened its ties with the West in recent years while reducing its traditionally close relations with Russia, including by freezing its membership of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russian-led military alliance, last year. The landlocked, mountainous country of 2.7 million people has been in conflict with its neighbour Azerbaijan, a major gas supplier to the EU, since the late 1980s. Yerevan has accused Moscow of failing to defend it against long-time rival Azerbaijan, which launched a military campaign in 2023 to regain control of the country's breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh.The separatist enclave had been run by its ethnic Armenian majority with the backing of Yerevan for more than three decades. Earlier this week, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said Armenia posed a 'fascist' threat that had to be destroyed. In response to Pashinyan's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Armenia could not join the EU while remaining a member of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union, a trade bloc of former post-Soviet states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep1_cFWVNxJaPeL2qpKFR1	2025-01-09T16:04:52-08:00	
Sen. Fetterman Claims He’s Puzzled Why Americans Protest His Supp...	In a Wednesday Twitter post, United States Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) expressed his confusion why '[z]ero dopes have shown up at my home or office, or blocked a road to chant and protest over an actual genocide in Sudan.' Proceeding, he questioned why 'South Africa engaged the ICJ over Gaza, but not for an actual genocide on their own continent' — in Sudan. 'ICJ' in Fetterman’s tweet refers to the International Court of Justice that ruled in January of last year that the Israel government may be committing genocide in Gaza and ordered Israel to not engage in acts of genocide. Then, in November, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The decisions of both courts have been disparaged and disregarded by the US and Israel governments. It is in opposition to the US government’s extraordinary and critical support for war efforts of the Israel government in Gaza and beyond that protests have been undertaken against Fetterman. The obvious reason he has been targeted with protests is because he is among the US Congress members most vociferously supporting the US providing military, weapons, money, and intelligence support without which the Israel government could not continue to pursue its large and expanding war effort, including its devastating attack on Gaza that has produced monumental civilian suffering and death. Indeed, in Israel several months into the war and with Fetterman at his side, Netanyahu declared, 'Israel has had no better friend than Senator John Fetterman' during the war. Why no similar protests against Fetterman related to the action in Sudan to which Fetterman refers in his Twitter post? The answer is suggested by Fetterman’s own language. He calls that action in Sudan an 'actual genocide.' It would be bizarre for people to protest him for supporting this 'actual genocide' when he has declared his opposition. Instead, of course, they protest him for being a key supporter of the US government enabling the carnage and destruction wrought by the Israel government. Fetterman linked in his Twitter post a Tuesday New York Times article by Declan Walsh that provides background information regarding the Sudan-related genocide claim: Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group fighting against Sudan’s military had committed acts of genocide, including a fearsome wave of ethnically targeted violence in the western region of Darfur.The Treasury Department backed the determination of genocide with a raft of sanctions targeting the R.S.F.’s leader, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, as well as seven companies in the United Arab Emirates, the group’s main foreign sponsor, that have traded in weapons and gold on his behalf. As with Israel’s war, Fetterman in regard to Sudan — where the US also has a long history of intervention — is fully aligned with the executive branch’s position. In both instances, the position involves pursuing foreign intervention in no way justified to protect America. As is typical, the US flings allegations against the parties it opposes abroad while deflecting accusations against the parties it supports, all the while claiming to be devoutly advancing human rights and a 'rules-based international order.' The message is again and again self-serving hooey. Who again are the dupes?

Global Digital Identity Systems: A Comparison – OpEd	As the world rapidly transits into the digital age, governments across the globe are developing sophisticated digital systems to streamline public services, enhance security, and improve citizens' daily lives. A core component of these initiatives is the establishment of Digital Identity (e-ID) systems, which serve as the cornerstone of digital governance. Countries such as Estonia, the UAE, Singapore, and Denmark are leading the way in adopting and integrating digital identity frameworks that offer citizens, residents, and businesses secure access to a wide range of services. Pakistan in the newest member to this club with its Digital Nation Pakistan (DNP) Act. This article provides an overview of these systems, highlighting their features, benefits, and the global trends they represent and this helps states like Pakistan which are dealing with problem of polarized digital space. Estonia stands as a global leader in digital governance, with its e-ID system at the forefront of the country's digital transformation. Introduced in 2002, the Estonian e-ID has made electronic identification mandatory for all citizens, providing them with a unique personal ID code that allows seamless access to a broad spectrum of public services. These include healthcare, police records, population registers, and telecommunications, among others. The system has progressively digitized critical services such as voting, health records, residency permits, and marriage registrations, ensuring that Estonian citizens can manage their affairs efficiently and securely. The versatility of the Estonian e-ID is one of its most significant advantages. It operates through various mediums, including the traditional ID card, Mobile-ID for smartphones, and the Smart-ID application, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Furthermore, the country’s inclusivity is reflected in the e-Residency program, launched in 2014. This initiative allows global citizens to access Estonian digital services and participate in its digital economy, regardless of their nationality or location. Estonia’s digital identity infrastructure is an excellent example of how a small country can leverage technology to create a highly efficient and secure public service ecosystem. By integrating e-ID into everyday life, Estonia has positioned itself as a model for digital governance worldwide. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has also made significant strides in digital identity with the introduction of UAE PASS, a national digital identity system launched during GITEX 2018. Aligned with the UAE Centennial 2071 plan, UAE PASS enables citizens, residents, and visitors to access services provided by over 12,000 government, semi-government, and private sector entities. This initiative represents a major leap forward in the UAE’s vision for a fully digitalized society. UAE PASS facilitates a wide range of services, including digital document signing, the verification of official documents, and access to digital copies of documents. The system is the first national digital identity in the UAE and serves as a unified solution for both service providers and users. Managed by Digital Dubai, the Regulatory Authority, and the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority, UAE PASS ensures secure and efficient interactions with both public and private entities. Its use is expanding rapidly, helping the UAE achieve its goal of creating a world-class digital infrastructure for the benefit of its citizens and residents. Singapore’s digital public infrastructure has been built around the Singpass system, a comprehensive digital identity platform launched in 2003. Originally a simple username-and-password login system for accessing government websites, Singpass has evolved into a unified digital identity framework integrated with cutting-edge technologies such as biometrics and cryptography. Singpass offers users the ability to securely verify their identity online and access more than 2,000 public and private sector services, including healthcare, banking, taxation, and transportation. Key features of Singpass include digital identity verification for both online and in-person transactions, a digital wallet for storing ID cards, driving licenses, and vaccination certificates, and data-sharing tools like MyInfo, which pre-fills forms using verified government databases. With 97% of eligible Singaporeans using Singpass and over 350 million annual transactions, the system has become integral to the country’s public service ecosystem. Businesses in Singapore report up to 80% faster service times, thanks to the secure data access provided by Singpass. A study by Deloitte has projected that the Singpass suite of products generates an economic impact of $385 million annually, with the potential to exceed $1 billion as its adoption grows. Denmark has also made considerable progress in establishing a robust digital identity system. In 2010, the country introduced NemID, an eID system developed through a collaboration between the government and the banking sector. NemID provided secure access to over 700 private and 180 public services, including banking, healthcare, and taxation. Although NemID was not legally mandatory, it became essential for engaging with Denmark's digital services. NemID employed various authentication methods, including code cards, apps, and hardware tokens, to ensure secure transactions with public and private sectors. It handled over six billion transactions and achieved a high user satisfaction rate of up to 98%. In 2023, NemID was replaced by MitID, which built upon the original infrastructure with enhanced security features, mobile-first usability, and biometric options. MitID is a more scalable and modular system designed to support both public and private sector needs, ensuring that Denmark's digital identity infrastructure remains future-proof. Catching up to the states like Estonia, the UAE, Singapore, and Denmark, Pakistan has embarked on its own digital transformation journey with the introduction of the Digital Nation Pakistan (DNP) Act, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at modernizing the country’s digital infrastructure. The DNP Act is designed to address systemic challenges and create a comprehensive framework for digital governance, societal empowerment, and economic revitalization. By drawing inspiration from global best practices, Pakistan seeks to establish a fully cyber-enabled society that will modernize public administration, improve public services, and foster inclusive growth. At the heart of the DNP Act is the concept of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), which aims to provide secure and efficient access to services, foster innovation, and promote data-driven decision-making. The goal is to create a digital ecosystem that empowers individuals, enhances public administration, and enables Pakistan to compete as a digital economy on the global stage. DNP Act was the need of the hour for Pakistan. The county currently ranks 136th out of 193 countries on the UN E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and 45th out of 52 on the World Internet Development Index, highlighting significant structural challenges in digital governance and infrastructure. These rankings underscore inefficiencies in public sector digital services and a lack of strategic foresight in embracing technology for national development. Without a cohesive digital strategy, Pakistan faces threats such as hindered economic growth, limited innovation, reduced job creation, and difficulties in addressing critical societal issues like poverty, healthcare, and education reform. The barriers to Pakistan’s digital transformation are multifaceted, including fragmented governance with over 15 regulatory bodies working in silos, low digital literacy rates, limited access to technology in rural areas, and a lack of coordinated policymaking and implementation, all of which exacerbate the country’s digital divide and inhibit broad-based participation in the digital economy. In conclusion, the global adoption of digital identity systems highlights the transformative potential of technology in modern governance. Nations like Estonia, the UAE, Singapore, and Denmark have demonstrated how robust digital frameworks can enhance public service delivery, drive economic growth, and position countries as competitive players in the global digital economy. These systems have not only simplified administrative processes but have also fostered inclusivity, improved security, and increased citizen engagement. For Pakistan, the Digital Nation Pakistan (DNP) Act represents a crucial step toward bridging the digital divide and addressing long-standing structural challenges in governance and public service delivery. However, the success of this initiative will depend on overcoming barriers such as fragmented governance, low digital literacy, and unequal access to technology. By learning from the successes of global leaders in digital identity, Pakistan can harness the transformative power of digital governance to unlock its economic potential, empower its citizens, and secure its place in an increasingly interconnected world. The journey ahead is challenging but vital for Pakistan’s future as a modern, inclusive, and thriving digital economy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcByPLOUqhAoLW2axUvXZf9	2025-01-09T15:05:51-08:00	
At The Edge Of A State: Examining Rohingya Marginalization In Mya...	By Fiona Raval As the civil war in Myanmar intensifies, the long-standing brutalities committed against the Rohingya have also seen a surge. This escalation has prompted the UN to state that it fears a repeat of the excesses committed against the group in 2017 and has flagged concerns about their deteriorating condition in the country. These developments call for an examination of the nature of political oppression against the Rohingya in Myanmar. The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, have long endured systematic persecution. Their political oppression has taken various forms—whether through continuous acts of targeted violence or denial of citizenship. The perpetrators, too, can’t be confined to a singular entity. This piece explores the multi-faceted character of the political persecution of the Rohingya. Violent persecution The long history of violence against the Rohingya has come from a variety of state actors. The worst recorded mass violence and human rights violations were committed by the military in 2017, during the democratically elected government’s rule. This attempt at genocide, which forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee the country, was denied by the then State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyii. Myanmar has continually defended the military’s actions by calling it necessary 'clearance operations' against 'terrorists.' Rohingya exclusion in Myanmar’s democratic polity is further evident from the fact that during the 2020 elections, every contesting political party engaged in anti-Rohingya rhetoric as a tool to successfully secure seats. At present, both the military-led junta and resistance forces fighting to overthrow this military regime, are perpetrating mass violence against the Rohingya. Both actors have been accused of extrajudicial killings, abductions, arson, and bombarding entire villages. Political invisibilisation Myanmar has consistently refused to recognise the Rohingya. The Burma Citizenship Law of 1982, introduced after the military assumed power through a coup, privileged state-recognised ethnic groups but by excluding the Rohingya, denied them citizenship, effectively rendering them stateless. Their status remained unchanged even after the restoration of democracy. The 1982 law borrows from the 1948 Citizenship Act which was also an exclusionary legislation. In fact, race as the basis of citizenship was derived from the 1948 Act. Segregative legislation, systemic barriers, and bureaucratic complexities have ensured that the Rohingya can’t become citizens. Attempts at invisibilisation are not just restricted to citizenship denial and the consequent loss of rights and privileges but also the erasure of identity. For example, during the 2014 national census, the Rohingya were only enumerated if they identified as ‘Bengali’. Internationally, Myanmar’s leadership refuse to use the term ‘Rohingya’ and have even urged other nations to refrain using the term. Forced recruitment and labour Two other distinct facets of political oppression against the Rohingya are forced labour and conscription. Rohingya enslavement through forced labour is a long-standing but under-reported issue. It can be year-round or occasional, and usually entails activities like construction of roads or bridges, agricultural labour, and labour in military facilities. It is usually perpetrated through government or military entities who record these contributions as ‘voluntary’. This dehumanisation is ironic since the Rohingya are expected to contribute to nation-building endeavours that they themselves are denied to participate in as citizens. The Rohingya being forced into military combat as tools of war-fighting while being disallowed any stakeholdership in the country’s evolving political landscape highlights their extreme vulnerability. As fighting intensifies, the junta as well as resisting Ethnically Armed Organisations (EAOs) have taken to forcibly recruiting the Rohingya to boost their ranks. The conscription laws that Myanmar reactivated earlier in 2024 are only applicable to citizens, which should exempt the Rohingya by default. The junta has, however, become desperate and resorted to forcibly inducting the Rohingya through abduction, abuse, coercion, and even falsely promising citizenship and freedoms in exchange for enlistment. Since February this year, over 1,000Rohingya have been recruited by the junta. This forcible recruitment into the junta ranks makes them a target of killings by EAOs like the Arakan Army (AA). Conversely, the junta targets the Rohingya if they join the EAOs for local protection. This catch-22 makes the community's security a near-impossibility. Uncertain support The persecution of the Rohingya also reflects the unavailability of sustained and trustworthy political representation. The very groups that have offered support and represent Rohingya interests have themselves contributed to their distress. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) is an insurgent group that claims to act on behalf of Myanmar's Rohingya. However, in an attempt to counterbalance AA's gains in Rakhine State, ARSA has joined hands with the junta forces. This alliance is ideologically inconsistent given the military's longstanding labelling of ARSA as a terrorist group. The alliance has heightened Rohingya vulnerability by facilitating the junta's forcible recruitment endeavours. In another example, as the AA takes control of Rakhine, its political wing, United League of Arakan, is working towards establishing a system of ‘inclusive administration’ in the AA occupied areas. To that end, some restrictions on Rohingya travel have been eased; they have been allowed to access some public services like healthcare and a Muslim Affairs Committee has also been set up. While these steps are welcome, the atrocity crimes unleashed by the AA on the Rohingya earlier this year are still fresh in everyone’s memory. This, coupled with the history of mistrust between both communities, makes the Rohingya’s future uncertain at best. Conclusion The Rohingya have had to endure a long history of oppression and mistreatment in Myanmar. While the UN is right to raise the alarm about the rise in anti-Rohingya violence, it is also time to acknowledge the various forms and perpetrators of said violence. This helps not only accurately encapsulate the Rohingya experience, but also offers the global community a more transparent picture of the issue at hand.

Is The World Ending War, Despite Ukraine? – OpEd	By Jonathan Power An ugly cloud of pessimism hands over many parts of the world. War that seemed to be in retreat, has returned with a vengeance with the second largest military in world, Russia’s, battling a very under-resourced neighbour, Ukraine. It’s getting a lot of people down. Yet there are many more grounds for optimism. 'We need jaw-jaw not war-war', said Winston Churchill, albeit hypocritically. Still, he would be glad to see that because of his pithy advice the number of wars around the world has fallen dramatically since the end of World War 2. This is despite the wars in Korea, Africa (many), Afghanistan, Libya, Lebanon, Pakistan versus India, Myanmar, Central America, Cyprus, ex-Yugoslavia, Syria, Yemen and now Ukraine. Compared with centuries past this has been a remarkable era, yet one not often acknowledged. Interstate armed conflicts, apart from India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Israel and Gaza, Israel and Lebanon, Iran and Israel, Yemen and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine, have vanished off the map. Most conflicts are civil wars, as in Sudan, Syria, Congo Relative to the size of their populations these wars involve a very small percentage of humanity. Civil wars The wars that remain are civil wars. Indeed, the Ukrainian war is seen from Moscow as a civil war since Ukraine was part of Russia for 500 continuous years compared with the only 30 years of independence since the end of the Cold War, when the Soviet Unions’ president Boris Yeltsin decided if the Ukrainians wanted independence, they could have it. Not a shot was fired. Democracies do not go to war with each other, as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher long ago observed. Academic research at Harvard University backs her up. The Economist weekly magazine has made a detailed study which analysed all international wars since 1900, along with the belligerents’ wealth and degree of development. It counted all conflicts in which at least 100 people per year were killed, excluding deaths from terrorism, massacres of civilians outside combat, starvation or disease. The data showed a strong correlation between democracy and peace, with the exception of the US. The countries most prone to war these days are not democracies nor autocracies, they are countries in between. A similar finding applies to prosperity. Middle-income countries are more warlike than very poor or rich ones. Why? Wars are expensive, and citizens in tyrannies struggle to organize uprisings. Perhaps a little political competition or wealth makes it easier to take up arms. Outlaw war? The development and growth of international law has undoubtedly had a cooling impact. Grotius, the great Dutch philosopher, wrote in the early 17th century: 'Where judicial settlement ends, war begins'. To wage war was not a criminal act. It was what states did to uphold the law. Grotius was a clever man but in fact his writings sanctioned the two terrible world wars. We now realize that 'legalizing war legitimized violence and blocked routes to peace', as write Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro in their seminal book, 'The Internationalists'. It was a successful Chicago corporate lawyer, Salmon Levinson, who wrote in 1917, 'The only real way to bring an end to war is to outlaw war'. All the plans made before assumed the legality of war. Levinson drew up a plan to outlaw war unlike any other peace plan then under discussion. Levinson organized a global social movement around the idea of 'outlawry'. He made an impact. At a special conference in Paris of major countries on August 27th, 1928, the French foreign minister, Aristide Briand, declared that the day would mark 'a new date in the history of mankind' and the end of 'selfish and wilful warfare'. By signing a treaty, soon to be known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the nations of the world would no longer treat war as a lawful means to resolve disputes. Briand said the treaty would 'attack the evil at its very root' by depriving war of 'its legitimacy'. That day 15 nations signed the Peace Pact, and within a year nearly every nation in the world did the same. For the first time in history war was considered to be illegal. Tragically, the Pact didn’t survive the pressure of events and the selfish, nationalistic, views of antagonistic countries. The first challenge came from Japan when it invaded Manchuria in 1931. The League of Nations was paralyzed. The other important institution, the International Court of Justice, whose charter said that disputes had to be submitted to it, was ignored. The American secretary of state, Henry Stimson, started to think about sanctions- 'sanctions of peace' to replace the 'sanctions of war'. In January 1932 Stimson delivered diplomatic notes to Japan and China, saying, 'The US government does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and the obligations of the Pact of Paris (Kellogg-Briand Pact).' Later, other signatories of the Pact- Germany, Japan and Italy- ignored it. At the end of the Second World War, the United Nations Charter included the words of the Pact verbatim: 'All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.' There was one exception- if the Security Council authorized force to keep the peace. Territorial conquest has all but disappeared? Today we look at a world where territorial conquest has all but disappeared. Immunity for heads of state no longer exists. The International Criminal Court (ICC) can prosecute those accused of war crimes- President Vladimir Putin of Russia is considered by many as a leader who should end up in the ICC’s dock. Before 1928 the average state could be expected to be conquered once in a person’s lifetime. Now it is once or twice in a millennium. Progress? Yes, a lot of it. Most people, especially journalists and politicians, even historians, are blind to this momentous achievement. In his new, path setting, book, the former foreign minister Sweden and head UN arms inspector in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, continues the discussion with an outline of how future wars can be avoided. The best example of wars avoided was the creation of the European Union, bringing together countries which had fought each other for centuries. The creation of modern India is another where hundreds of different language groups have been sewn together. (Although in 1947 India split in two in a carnage that left India and the newly created Pakistan very badly bruised.) The UN Security Council, although often ignored, does bring some dampener of conflict by mediation and by holding conflicts up to the light of day. It is fair to say, writes Blix, that 'rare cases excepted (Ukraine and Russia) states have said farewell to direct interstate wars and are in the process of taking farewell to the use of force in interventions. In their continued competition they are taking to other means of exerting pressure and influence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49EChxFkACzhMr4z	2025-01-08T16:35:41-08:00	
Indonesia’s Admission To BRICS Raises Concerns About Impact On Ja...	By Tria Dianti Indonesia’s induction into the BRICS economic bloc may give it access to more markets, but some analysts are concerned about whether this is worth putting Jakarta’s relationship with a new Trump administration in the U.S. at risk. The bloc, which began with four members – Brazil, Russia, India and China, and later, South Africa – has expanded to 10 countries by including Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, but many in the West still see it as a Beijing- and Moscow-led bloc, international relations experts noted. Brazil, the current BRICS’s chair, announced on Monday that Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous nation, had been officially admitted as its tenth member. Some Southeast Asian experts, such as Vinsensio Dugis from Airlangga University, said they didn’t see any new economic advantages to joining BRICS, although they could see potential pitfalls for Indonesia. Western nations’ negative perception of BRICS as an organization that exists to counter their political and economic power may cause them to withhold investment into Indonesia, he said. '[T]he ‘Global South’ group could be seen as a challenge to the ‘Global Lords’ of the West,' he told BenarNews.‘Foster collaboration’ A lawmaker from Gerindra, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s party, said the country’s presence in BRICS was not meant as a challenge to Western dominance. 'Indonesia participates in various international forums such as APEC, G20, and OIC,' said Budisatrio Djiwandono. He was referring to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Group of 20 of the world’s top economies, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. '[I]n order to strengthen Indonesia’s role in global geopolitics, our foreign policy must foster collaboration, not confrontation,' the Gerindra lawmaker said. An Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday said that joining BRICS was a tactical move. 'Indonesia views its BRICS membership as a strategic step to strengthen collaboration and cooperation with other developing nations, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development,' spokesperson Roy Rolliansyah Soemirat said in a written statement. Still, Dugis, the analyst, noted that Indonesia already has strong economic ties with major BRICS members such as China and India. For instance, China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and source of foreign investment. 'What’s the benefit of joining [BRICS] now? There’s nothing tangible for Indonesia,' Dugis said. As it is, Donald Trump, who is returning to office as president of the United States, has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imports from BRICS nations, if he sees them threatening the U.S. dollar. If that happens China’s already dominant position in Indonesia’s economy could grow even stronger, noted Muhammad Andri Perdana, director of research at the Bright Institute, a Jakarta think-tank. With Indonesia already in BRICS now, Galau D. Muhammad, an economist, said it should focus on how the bloc could benefit the country economically, and not on global politics. 'Indonesia must have a clear domestic agenda to bring to the forum,' Galau, from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), told BenarNews. It’s not all gloom and doom, with some political economy experts saying that being part of BRICS gives Indonesia opportunities to expand its access to non-traditional markets. Indonesia’s foreign policy has emphasized expanding markets where it has less access, noted Bagus Ismujati from Griffith University. 'Through BRICS membership, Indonesia can increase its presence in other BRICS countries’ markets,' Bagus told BenarNews. ‘A new world has been taking shape’ News of Indonesia being granted BRICS membership was barely noted in the West, some international observers noted on social media. Philip Pilkington, an economist and author of the book 'The Collapse of Global Liberalism,' was one of them, and he was harsh on Western media as well. '[The] 8th largest economy in the world, Indonesia has a larger economy than France. Big win for BRICS at the start of 2025. Not much attention paid in the West because the media now just lies about key global events,' he said on the platform X. A professor of global history at Oxford University, Peter Frankopan, also observed on X that the news about Indonesia and BRICS was 'barely reported anywhere in the U.K., Europe, U.S., etc.).' It should have been, he said, in a thread of comments, because 'Indonesia’s status as full member is significant for many reasons,' such as that it is Southeast Asia’s largest economy and most populous nation. Indonesia’s entry 'takes BRICS GDP to +/- 40% of global economy by PPP [Purchasing Power Parity] Add in the 8 ‘partner states’ and it’s closer to 45%,' he wrote on X. 'There are lots of ways that BRICS gets over-hyped, misinterpreted and (sometimes) under-egged. And lots of challenges from within too, with plenty of differing views about what BRICS is, could or should be,' he said. 'But a new world has been taking shape that follows and interprets things … in very different ways to how many in the ‘West’ see things.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh4PqLIm06F-w	2025-01-08T16:30:59-08:00	
Cross-Border Challenges: The Impact Of Illegal Bangladeshi Migrat...	Migration has always been a significant aspect of human history, driven by the search for food, shelter, freedom, security, and better living conditions. This movement of people often influences the socio-economic, cultural, and political frameworks of the host country. While migration can lead to positive outcomes, it can also generate resentment among local populations due to cultural, ideological, and resource-based differences. The Indian strategic thinker Kautilya warned against the indiscriminate acceptance of foreigners, predicting eventual conflict over local culture and resources, potentially destabilizing the internal security of the host nation. Historical Context of Bangladeshi Migration to India India's geographical proximity, relatively stable economy compared to its neighbors, and liberal democratic ethos have made it an attractive destination for migrants and refugees from the region. People fleeing persecution and adverse conditions in Tibet, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have sought refuge in India. Among these groups, illegal immigrants from Bangladesh constitute the largest share, significantly impacting India's border states and Indian security at large. The partition of British India in 1947 marked the beginning of successive waves of migration from East Bengal, now Bangladesh, into India. During the Liberation War of 1971, around 10 million Bengalis fled East Pakistan to escape religious and political persecution, seeking shelter in India. However, the migration did not stop with the end of the war. Economic hardship, political instability, and population pressure continued to drive illegal immigration from Bangladesh into India in the following decades. Demographics and Magnitude of the Issue Bangladesh shares a 4,096-kilometer border with the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Over the years, reports and statistics have highlighted the scale of this issue: In 1997, Home Minister Inderjit Gupta informed Parliament that 10 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants were residing in India. The Task Force on Border Management in 2001 estimated the number at 15 million. According to a 2004 statement by Sriprakash Jaiswal, then Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, approximately 12 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants were in India, with West Bengal alone hosting 5.7 million. Sanjeev Tiwari's 2016 report for Carnegie suggested that illegal Bangladeshi migrants in India exceed 15 million, concentrated primarily in border states but also dispersing to distant regions. This unchecked influx has altered the demographic landscape, particularly in the northeastern states, fueling socio-political tensions and insurgency. The Supreme Court of India has declared all Bangladeshis who entered India after March 25, 1971, as illegal migrants, urging the government to accelerate their identification, detection, and deportation. However, enforcement remains a challenge due to political, logistical, and humanitarian concerns. India has repeatedly raised the issue of illegal migration with Bangladesh at diplomatic levels. However, Dhaka has neither acknowledged the problem's magnitude nor taken effective measures to curb the flow of migrants. A bilateral agreement that facilitates the repatriation of illegal migrants after due verification could be a pragmatic step toward resolving the issue. In recent weeks, there have been frequent reports of Indian authorities deporting illegal Bangladeshi migrants, with news of such actions appearing almost daily. Notably, between December 31, 2024, and January 2, 2025, 30 individuals were deported. Additionally, India has established several detention centers to house individuals identified as illegal immigrants, including those from Bangladesh. The state of Assam, which shares a border with Bangladesh, has been particularly proactive in this regard. Currently, detention centers in Assam are located within district jails in Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Silchar, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, and Tezpur. These facilities detain individuals declared as illegal foreigners by the Foreigners’ Tribunals. Reports indicate that new detention centers are under construction, such as one in Matia, Goalpara district. In Delhi, there are three detention centers, two of which are managed by the Department of Social Welfare. These include a center at Nirmal Chhaya in West Delhi for women and another at the Lampur Complex in North Delhi for men. These centers accommodate trafficked individuals, irregular economic migrants, and refugees. Similar detention facilities also exist in other states, including Karnataka and Goa. Socio-Economic and Cultural Impact Illegal Bangladeshi migration has strained resources, altered cultural dynamics, and created economic competition in India's border states. In Assam and Tripura, local communities have expressed concerns over cultural dominance by Bengali migrants, leading to widespread resentment. The 'Assam Movement' (1979-1985) was a landmark protest against illegal immigration, culminating in the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985. However, even after the accord, the problem persisted, with ongoing agitation and demands for stricter immigration controls. The demographic changes have also affected local livelihoods. Migrants often provide cheaper labor, undermining local workers' economic opportunities. Cultural friction arises as migrants sometimes fail to assimilate into local traditions, exacerbating tensions. The northeastern states of India, characterized by their predominantly tribal populations, are known for their rich cultural diversity, unique lifestyles, faith systems, and values. These communities, however, are sparsely populated and live in scattered settlements across the hilly terrain. The influx of illegal migrants has led to a situation where the native populations are being outnumbered, with the newcomers attempting to impose their own way of life on these regions. This has raised existential concerns among the indigenous communities. The limited availability of land and resources in these hilly areas, already a challenge for the native population, has been further exacerbated by the arrival of illegal migrants. Sharing these scarce resources has placed an additional burden on the local inhabitants, intensifying struggles over access to essential needs. Moreover, the arrival of large groups of migrants in these small, resource-constrained regions has created significant challenges in terms of employment. Migrants are increasingly taking over jobs and business opportunities, leaving the local population at a disadvantage. These dynamics are fostering tensions and heightening the potential for conflict between the local communities and the outsiders, as competition for resources and livelihoods becomes more acute. Security Implications Illegal migration poses serious threats to India's internal and external security. Reports indicate that illegal migrants have facilitated anti-national and terrorist activities by providing local support and logistics to insurgents. Two major dimensions of the security threat include: Conflict over Resources and Political Instability: Competition for resources and jobs fuels resentment among local populations, which is often exploited by political elites for electoral gains. In Assam, socio-economic and cultural grievances were mobilized politically, leading to ethnic tensions and violence. Undermining Rule of Law: Illegal migrants frequently acquire fraudulent identification documents, exercise voting rights, and engage in smuggling and other criminal activities. Such actions erode the integrity of India's democratic processes and legal systems. Insurgency and Radicalization The persistence of illegal migration has contributed to the rise of insurgent movements in border states. Organizations like the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) initially targeted illegal Bangladeshi migrants but later shifted focus as their cadres sought refuge in Bangladesh. Conversely, the attacks on migrants in Assam led to the radicalization of sections of the Muslim community, resulting in the formation of militant groups like the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam (MULTA) and the Muslim United Liberation Front of Assam (MULFA). Investigations revealed these groups' links with international terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The establishment of al-Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent, which includes Assam among its target areas, underscores the gravity of the security threat posed by illegal migration. Political Patronage and West Bengal's Case West Bengal's response to illegal migration differs from that of Assam due to cultural and linguistic similarities between migrants and locals. This has allowed migrants to integrate more seamlessly. However, political patronage has played a significant role in facilitating migration. Reports from intelligence agencies cited in an IDSA monograph indicate that local political leaders in West Bengal provided citizenship documents to migrants, creating a captive vote bank. This patronage enabled successive waves of migrants to settle easily, intensifying demographic shifts and posing long-term security risks. Migrants often settle in border areas, displacing Hindu populations and creating potential vulnerabilities for national security. The construction of mosques and madrasas in these areas has further fueled concerns about anti-national activities. The Vulnerability of ‘Chicken Neck’ The Siliguri Corridor, also referred to as the Chicken’s Neck, is a narrow strip of land near the city of Siliguri in West Bengal, India. At its narrowest point, the corridor measures 20–22 kilometers (12–14 miles) in width and serves as a critical geo-political and geo-economic link between the seven northeastern states of India and the rest of the country. The corridor is flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh on either side, with Bhutan at its northern end. Previously, the Kingdom of Sikkim was situated to the north of the corridor until its integration into India in 1975. In recent decades, a significant demographic shift has occurred along the corridor due to the influx of Bangladeshi migrants, raising security concerns. This demographic transformation poses a major challenge for Indian security forces, as the corridor’s strategic importance makes it a potential target for extremist activities. Radical Islamist groups have long harbored ambitions of severing Northeast India from the rest of the country by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the Siliguri Corridor. This stretch—spanning the northern part of Uttar Dinajpur district and the southern part of Darjeeling district in Bengal—lies adjacent to Bangladesh to the east and the Muslim-majority districts of Kishanganj and Purnea in Bihar to the west, making it highly susceptible to security threats. On December 20, 2024, the West Bengal Police revealed that suspected members of the global terror group Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), arrested for operating a sleeper cell in India, had specifically targeted the Siliguri Corridor. The eight individuals apprehended were allegedly involved in sleeper cell operations across Kerala, Assam, and West Bengal. According to police reports, ABT is a splinter group of the Bangladesh-based terrorist organization Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen and is banned in India, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The political instability following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh has exacerbated the security situation. Rising violence against minorities and concerning developments in defense and terrorism have heightened threats for India, with the Siliguri Corridor emerging as a primary target for extremist organizations based in Bangladesh. The concentrated population of Bangladeshi migrants along the corridor provides a robust support base for these extremist groups, amplifying the challenges faced by Indian security forces in protecting this vital region. Conclusion Illegal migration from Bangladesh has far-reaching implications for India's socio-economic fabric, cultural identity, and national security. It has strained resources, altered demographics, fueled insurgency, and created political instability in border regions. Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach, including stringent border management, legal reforms, and diplomatic engagement with Bangladesh. Failure to tackle the problem could jeopardize India's internal stability and undermine its long-term strategic interests. The northeastern region of India poses a significant security challenge, and the situation has become increasingly precarious following the recent regime change in Bangladesh. Radical anti-India elements are targeting pro-India individuals within Bangladesh while simultaneously conducting covert operations across the border in India. In this context, illegal Bangladeshi migrants have emerged as valuable assets for these elements, as they often harbor sympathies for their compatriots. Addressing this issue requires a resolute approach from the Indian government, given the critical implications for national security. It is imperative for the political leadership across party lines to exhibit maturity and prioritize national interests over narrow political considerations. Unfortunately, certain opposition parties have consistently opposed government measures aimed at tackling the problem, framing such actions as being directed against the Muslim community. Reports indicate that some political groups have facilitated the provision of essential residency documents to illegal Bangladeshi migrants and even registered them as voters for electoral advantages. Such actions not only undermine India’s security apparatus but also hinder efforts to resolve the issue. A united and pragmatic approach by the political class, prioritizing national security over political gains, is essential to mitigate this growing threat.

5-7 Nm Possibly The Long-Term Technological Ceiling For China’s S...	By Zhou Chao Since the beginning of Donald Trump's first term, the U.S. government has continuously ramped up pressure on China's advanced technology sector, with the chip industry becoming a major target. Recently, before leaving office, President Joe Biden intensified sanctions and technological blockades against China's semiconductor sector. The U.S. government has explicitly prohibited TSMC and Samsung from exporting chips below 7nm to China and has added 140 Chinese chip companies to its blacklist. From mid to late December 2023, the focus shifted to China’s mature-process chip industry. In response to the persistent pressure from the U.S., China’s chip industry has actively worked to counter external challenges, and eventually achieved a series of breakthroughs. In terms of advanced processes, Huawei's Mate60, launched in 2023, was confirmed to utilize 7 nm process technology, marking a significant breakthrough in Chinese-produced high-end chips. Regarding mature processes, data from international consulting firm Knometa Research showed that by 2022, there were 167 12-inch wafer fabs worldwide, with 13 new fabs coming online in 2023, bringing the total to 180. In terms of quantity, nearly half of the world's 12-inch wafer fabs are located in China. Due to its complete industrial chain, robust production capacity, and cost advantages, China holds a clear comparative advantage in the production of mature-process chips. In late November 2023, European chip giant STMicroelectronics announced during its Investor Day event that it will cooperate with China's second-largest wafer foundry, Hua Hong Semiconductor, to produce 40 nm microcontroller units (MCUs) in China by the end of 2025. Recently, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo publicly stated that a series of measures aimed at restricting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies have been a 'fool’s errand'. It seems that, whether in advanced or standard processes, China's semiconductor industry has made significant achievements and progress. However, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan recently pointed out that while China's chip industry is already quite powerful, in terms of advanced processes, 5-7 nm may represent the long-term technological ceiling, with breakthroughs being extremely difficult. Firstly, the technological bottleneck for 7 nm and below has already emerged. Huawei's latest smartphone was once rumored to use 5 nm chip technology. However, a recent teardown analysis by the authoritative research firm Tech Insights (TI) of the Kirin chip in the Mate 70 series revealed that the previously rumored Chinese-made 5 nm chip does not exist. The Mate 70 series is equipped with the Kirin 9020, which is an upgraded version of the previous-generation Kirin 9010. The chip’s manufacturing process is the same as its predecessor, still at the 7 nm level. Compared to the Kirin 9010, the main improvement in the Kirin 9020 is a slight increase in the frequency of the large cores, optimizations in the middle cores, and a reconfiguration of the small cores. Compared to previous generations, the Kirin 9020 can only be considered an incremental upgrade, not a major design overhaul. Since the release of the Mate 60, there have been numerous rumors about Chinese chip technology reaching the 7 nm level and making progress toward 5 nm. However, in the case of 7 nm technology, existing analyses have pointed out that due to the lack of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, production can only be achieved through multi-patterning techniques using the n+2 or n+3 process to achieve higher transistor density. Industry analysts have noted that if 5 nm chips are produced using deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography and multi-patterning techniques, the overall manufacturing cost will be 50% higher than that of EUV-based processes, and the yield rate remains an uncontrollable factor. Information from the Financial Times shows that China's 7 nm and 5 nm process technologies are 40-50% more expensive than TSMC’s, but the yield rate is less than one-third of TSMC’s. This level of technological cost is considered a relatively risky approach in the wafer manufacturing industry. All in all, China has encountered a clear technological bottleneck in chip technologies at 7 nm and below. Secondly, can Chinese companies rely on their own capabilities for R&D and product commercialization to effectively break through this bottleneck? The answer is unlikely. Semiconductors are among the most internationalized and hierarchical manufactured products. They are fundamentally based on technology, cost, and efficiency, with manufacturing realized through the global division of labor. This global division can be seen through the three key stages of semiconductor fabrication. In fact, the world has established a complete supply chain for semiconductor production. The first step involves the U.S. providing EDA design tools and Japan supplying semiconductor materials. The second step is the design phase, where the U.S. provides the primary design, while other countries also contribute designs as needed. The third step is chip packaging in the U.S., mainland China, South Korea, and Taiwan. The fourth step involves testing, done in South Korea, mainland China, and Taiwan. The fifth step is shipping the chips. A global industrial chain, along with the flow of talent and knowledge, is an essential prerequisite for the smooth operation and development of any country's semiconductor industry. Over the past two decades, China has seen a large number of students studying advanced semiconductor technologies in the West every year, gaining substantial technical input that has greatly contributed to the growth of China's semiconductor sector. Data shows that in 2019 alone, approximately 3,000 Taiwanese semiconductor engineers were working in mainland China, accounting for nearly 10% of the 40,000 core engineers in the industry that year. A few high-level executives also joined mainland Chinese companies, with the most notable example being Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). After former TSMC executive Mong-Song Liang joined SMIC, he led a team of engineers to successfully develop SMIC's 7 nm chip technology. However, in recent years, with the increasing Western sanctions led by the U.S., the influx of international talent and technology into China has become much more difficult, and the situation has changed significantly compared to the past. In fact, according to research from multiple media outlets, since 2021, many Taiwanese technicians have started to distance themselves from mainland Chinese companies. China still faces significant import dependency on key semiconductor raw materials. For example, AlSiC alloys, which feature high thermal conductivity, a thermal expansion coefficient matching that of chips, low density, lightweight, high hardness, and strong bending resistance, are mainly used in communication components. However, no Chinese companies have achieved large-scale industrialization of this product. Another example is interface thermal interface materials, which are commonly used in IC packaging and electronic heat dissipation. In China, the production companies for interface thermal materials are small in scale and lack high-end products. For both of these product types, U.S. and Japanese companies are the primary sources of imports. Existing analyses have pointed out that in the three main stages of the semiconductor industry, i.e., design, manufacturing, and packaging/testing, Chinese companies' main comparative advantage lies in the packaging and testing area. However, even within this domain, Chinese companies are highly dependent on imported raw materials. If Western sanctions continue to intensify, the challenges in this area are likely to increase. In the mature process technology field, Chinese companies are likely to find it difficult to provide effective support for the development of advanced process technologies. First, the achievements of Chinese companies in the mature process domain are still far from satisfactory. Data from research organizations such as Knometa Research, Yole Group, and IC Insights show that although the overall production capacity share of mature process chips in mainland China has rapidly increased in recent years, Taiwan still holds the largest share of capacity. Looking at the leading mature process chip manufacturers, European companies dominate, followed by the U.S. and Japan. Take Texas Instruments (TI), a leading company in the automotive chip sector, as an example. As a dominant player in analog chips with annual revenues close to USD 20 billion, TI has substantial cash reserves to handle price wars. Despite the intense competition in the Chinese market, it still enjoys solid profits in the U.S. and European markets. In 2023, even with a decline in profits, TI's net income still reached USD 6.5 billion. At the same time, it has strong cost-control capabilities to launch price wars. Although the process technology for analog chips no longer evolves toward smaller line widths, TI, operating under the integrated device manufacturer (IDM) model, which combines chip design, manufacturing, and packaging/testing, has continuously upgraded its chip production processes. To date, TI's analog chip processes have evolved to the industry-leading LBC10. With each generation of advancement, TI achieves improvements in yield rates, reductions in chip area, and savings in raw material consumption, ultimately leading to lower costs. Moreover, TI has adopted a new strategy in China, employing the strategy of 'universal price cuts to strike all competitors, and targeted pricing to contain major Chinese manufacturers'. For some products, TI's pricing in the Chinese market is 50% lower than in international markets. Although over the past two years, due to chip shortages, many Chinese manufacturers have turned to domestic chip suppliers for procurement, the increasing competitive pressure from international giants suggests that the ability of Chinese companies to resist in the future may not look bright. Second, within the industry, it is generally believed that profits from mature process technologies should support the R&D of advanced process technologies. However, on a global scale, in recent years, as consumer trends for general industrial and consumer goods have gradually weakened, the demand for mature process chips has effectively been declining. The main sources of profit for chip giants are increasingly concentrated in advanced process products and equipment. Recently, warning statements from companies like Micron, Broadcom, and Marvell have highlighted this trend. As for the domestic Chinese market, although a series of consumption stimulus policies, such as those boosting electric vehicle sales, have objectively driven up chip demand, the sustainability of these policy-induced effects remains in question. Additionally, due to intense internal competition, as of December 5, Wind Information’s statistics show that 14,648 chip-related companies in China have gone bankrupt. In terms of industry sectors, bankruptcies have been relatively high among companies in consumer electronics and trade, and the business outlook for companies in the analog chip sector is also not optimistic. Although this trend may enhance the market dominance of leading companies, the profitability and financing capabilities of domestic top-tier companies still struggle to effectively support the development of advanced process chips, especially under increasing isolation. The international macro environment also suggests that even if Chinese production advantages in mature process chips are further enhanced and international markets are opened, these markets may not necessarily provide truly ideal returns. Third, it should also be noted that, in terms of advanced process chips, there is no objective and strong market demand domestically in China. In recent years, the construction of smart computing centers in the country has been booming. By the first half of 2024, its domestic computing power scale reached 246 EFLOPS, with the growth rate of smart computing power exceeding 65% year-on-year. More than 13,000 computing power application projects have been implemented in various sectors such as industry, education, healthcare, and energy. However, industry research has found that the average occupancy rate of these smart computing centers remains around 20%-30%, with some enterprise-level centers seeing occupancy rates as low as 10%. Due to the severe oversupply, the rental price for an NVIDIA H100 server (8 GPUs) has dropped from RMB 120,000 – RMB 180,000 per month at the beginning of the year to RMB 75,000 per month, a reduction of around 50%. A smart computing center with a thousand-card cluster based on NVIDIA H100 GPUs would have an initial investment of around RMB 350 million, with annual maintenance costs of about RMB 50 million. Yet, with an average occupancy rate of 20%, the revenue from renting out the center cannot even cover half of the normal operating costs. In other words, there is no strong demand for advanced process chips in the Chinese market, and the demand needed to support their effective operation is quite limited. Under such a situation, even if advanced process chips with independent intellectual property rights are developed, the market demand to support them is unlikely to be substantial. It is also important to note that the construction of intelligent computing centers in recent years has been supported by a series of local policies, such as financial subsidies, tax incentives, and land supply. With local government finances increasingly strained, it is unlikely that such strong policy measures will continue to be available to actively create demand. Final analysis conclusion: Despite years of sustained pressure from the West, China's semiconductor industry has still made significant progress and gradually accumulated strong capabilities, especially in the mature process field. However, with changes in both the internal and external environment, as well as the evolving trends in the industry, such technological capabilities are increasingly limited when it comes to breakthroughs in advanced processes. It also faces difficulties in providing continuous financial and demand support. For the foreseeable future, 5-7 nm will essentially be the technological ceiling for China's semiconductor industry.

Technocracy, Fear-Mongers, And The Conspiracy – OpEd	The term, ‘conspiracy theory’ became part of common parlance during the ‘Covid era,’ but although all of us know what it refers to – and who are supposed to be the ‘conspiracy theorists’ in question, namely those people who saw through the ‘pandemic’ scam and everything it entailed – the precise nature of the ‘conspiracy’ is probably less clear. When I ask individuals what they understand by it, they usually answer in more or less vague terms. So what is it? In his book, HAARP: The Ultimate Weapon of the Conspiracy (2003) – followed in 2006 by Weather Warfare – Jerry Smith indicates the importance he attributes to the concept by capitalising it throughout. Smith relates it to what he regards as a weapon for warfare; to wit, the ‘High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP),’ and uncovers what the powers behind this project would have preferred to remain undisclosed, for obvious reasons, once one is apprised of the reasons for its establishment by the ‘Conspiracy.’ Here I do not wish to delve into the specifics of HAARP, but merely focus on Smith’s illuminating insights as far as the ‘Conspiracy’ is concerned. His answer to the question about its ‘what?’ is scattered throughout the first of the two books mentioned earlier. Here are some excerpts (Smith, 2003, p. 22-24): Some people believe that there is one over-arching conspiracy, a cadre of incredibly powerful people who want to rule the world. Most of us dismiss such people as paranoid kooks. Still, there is no denying that for over a hundred years a movement has been developing among the world’s top intellectuals, industrialists and ‘global villagers’ to end war and solve societal problems (like overpopulation, trade imbalances and environmental degradation) through the creation of a single world government. Whether this globalist movement is a diabolic ‘conspiracy’ of the evil few or a broad ‘consensus’ of the well-intentioned many, in fact matters little. It is as real as AIDS and potentially just as deadly, at least to our individual freedom, if not our very lives… To grasp why Smith employs the term ‘deadly’ with regard to the Conspiracy, one has to read the book, but here it is sufficient to point out that, if nations were to surrender their own sovereign right to deal with overpopulation, environmental problems, and so on, as they see fit – even if this were to be done in cooperation with international agencies – a ‘one solution for all’ system would mean that policies would be imposed on them which are not suitable, or acceptable, for their own needs. The idea of a ‘League of Nations’ that was floated after World War I was but one embodiment of this movement. Today’s United Nations (UN) was built on the League of Nations concept. The UN was created primarily to end war—by ending nations. The logic is that if there are no nations, then there can be no wars between nations. This was clearly stated in the United Nations’ ‘World Constitution’ with these words: ‘The age of nations must end. The governments of the nations have decided to order their separate sovereignties into one government to which they will surrender their arms.’ While 18th-century thinker Immanuel Kant, would have applauded the aim of terminating wars between nations, he would certainly have been less enamoured of the idea that sovereign nations would have to relinquish their sovereignty in favour of a wholesale assimilation into an encompassing world government. His reasons were clearly stated in the second of the ‘Definitive Articles’ formulated in his essay on ‘Perpetual Peace:’ ‘The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states.’ For Kant this is essential for lasting peace, insofar as such a federation, where states would be subject to federal laws, is comparable to a state with a republican constitution, which is governed according to laws that are external to the (often disorderly) will(s) of citizens themselves. Unless such a federation of nations (as opposed to a ‘state’ of nations, where all member states would comprise only one ‘nation of states’) were to be established, the rights of every member state would not be guaranteed, parallel to the way citizens’ rights are guaranteed in a republican state. In other words, every member state, together with its citizens, would be at the mercy of what the overall ‘world government’ decides. Particularly the words (in the excerpt, above), ‘to order their separate sovereignties into one government to which they will surrender their arms,’ sound outright ominous. The New World Order (NWO) is but one name given to this push to create a true world government. Many supporters of the NWO espouse a philosophy called technocracy, which is rule by experts, scientists or technicians. It is not democratic in any sense by which Americans understand the term. One very famous advocate of the New World Order is Zbigniew Brzezinski. He was a National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter and other presidents. He called his version of technocracy ‘technetronics.’ In his book, ‘Between Two Ages,’ Brzezinski wrote: ‘The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values.’ This ‘technetronic’ union of nations would call for the desovereignization of all existing countries. This new ordering would reduce the United States of America to a mere regional government—perhaps the ‘United States of North America.’ The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is widely seen as one stepping stone to the NWO. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was quoted by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate in 1993 as saying: ‘NAFTA represents the single most creative step towards a New World Order.’ The Common Market in Europe and the European Union (EU) are similarly seen as bridges to an eventual United States of Europe, which in turn would be just another region of the United Nations’ global state (or ‘global plantation’ as some detractors have called it). It is an understatement to claim that technocracy is ‘not democratic in any sense by which Americans [or anyone else; B.O.] understand the term.’ Strictly speaking, technocracy would go further than merely using technical means to govern people, such as surveillance equipment, water cannons, or armoured cars for crowd control, or tasers to neutralise resistance; in the true sense of the word technocracy, technical devices, such as AI-robots, would be the means of governance. Even this does not go far enough, because it suggests that some other agents, presumably human, would be the true power behind the robots, whereas technocracy in the extreme or ‘pure’ sense would entail the autonomous power to rule of the robots themselves, such as the machines in James Cameron’s Terminatorfilms, or the Cylons in Ronald D. Moore’s Battlestar Galactica. I need not point out that the valorisation of AI by members of the globalist cabal puts them squarely in the company of those who would welcome technocracy; in what capacity it is difficult to say. Would they go as far as to surrender human oversight and control to the machines? Sometimes Noah Juval Harari – Klaus Schwab’s advisor – seems to suggest that they would. Seen in this light, it makes complete sense that Brzezinski is quoted as saying that the ‘technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society,’ which ‘would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values.’ This is possibly the most important reason for ordinary people to resist the Conspiracy as characterised by Smith. Why? His use of the term ‘unrestrained’ to qualify ‘traditional values’ is symptomatic of an implicit belief that voluntary restraint on the part of people living in society is somehow undesirable, in contrast with which ‘restraint through being controlled’ by others – the so-called elites – is desirable. Keeping in mind that these ‘elites,’ minus any traditional values that function as guardrails within which civilisation develops, could foist just about any whim on people, who would presumably be ‘controlled’ in such a manner that they would have no say in the matter. Does that sound familiar? Isn’t that precisely what one witnessed during the Covid era, and could justifiably expect to occur again if another event, not ‘restrained by traditional values,’ should be (ab)used to implement the same kind of controls as before? That this is no idle speculation is evident from a recent warning, issued by the high priest of the supposed ‘elites,’ Klaus Schwab himself, that climate changewill be the ‘next big virus,’ accompanied by ‘restrictions worse than Covid.’ From the article one may gather that Smith’s depiction of the ‘Conspiracy’ – although in a different context – rings true where Schwab and the WEF are concerned: they prioritise control of ordinary mortals above everything else. Hence the usual pattern of disruption followed by severe measures of restriction. Moreover, again as the article in question avers, Schwab habitually uses ‘veiled threats’ and ‘apocalyptic rhetoric to emphasize the need for global coordination, often promoting the centralization of power under elite institutions including the World Economic Forum.’ Unsurprisingly, the ‘crises’ that the ‘elites’ – that is, the Conspiracy – conjure up, are utilised as openings for them to strengthen and consolidate their control over the rest of us, predictably employing ‘fear-based programming, while reshaping society according to their vision.’ Another instance of the same old saw is encountered in the recent report of a WEF doctor – yes, they never stop, do they? – warning that avian flu, an outbreak of which is perceived as being imminent, has been estimated as capable of killing ‘52% of the population,’ simultaneously calling on the Biden administration to commence ‘a mass vaccination ‘campaign before President Donald Trump is sworn in next month.’ The most interesting thing here is the estimate, by the WHO, according to the doctor concerned, that ‘the mortality rate is 52%,’ reflecting a precision that boggles the mind, considering that the strain of bird flu regarded as being dangerous to humans has, as far as I can ascertain, not ever killed the number of people that allowed such a judgment to be made. This does not mean that avian flu does not hold a significant threat for human beings, as I have argued before, but it is imperative to distinguish between deliberate fear-mongering and the real McCoy, lest one fall for precisely the kind of ruse they need to get lethal needles into arms. As may be gathered from the above – Smith’s observations about the ‘Conspiracy’ as well as the instances I have adduced to validate these – it is not at all far-fetched to claim that there are persuasive indications of the growth of organisations hellbent on the construction of a one-world government. Calling these, collectively speaking, the ‘Conspiracy’ – while perhaps sounding paranoid – makes sense to the degree that (as some of Smith’s observations show) such a projected government would not be willing to share democratic power with ordinary citizens; on the contrary, it would rule in a totalitarian fashion. This has already been abundantly demonstrated by events over the last five years, as well as ongoing occurrences of the kind I have referred to.

Annexing Canada Would Be Like Adding A Second California – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken Donald Trump wants an open border with Canada. At least, that’s what would happen if Trump were to execute his stated preference for annexing Canada as the fifty-first state. In recent days, president-elect Donald Trump has made a number of comments suggesting that Canada should be annexed by the United States as a new state. For example, on Tuesday, Donald Trump told reporters at a press conference that the U.S. and Canada combined into a single country 'would really be something.' This followed an earlier X/Twitter post in which Trump listed a number of benefits to Canada and concluded that 'if Canada merged with the US' the resulting union would be 'a great nation' This depends on what one means by 'great nation.' If the goal is to move the United States further to the left ideologically, and to make the US more like California, then yes, adding Canada as a new state would certainly be a good thing. For people who like freedom, on the other hand, it’s not a great idea. The sort of MAGA voter who thinks this is a good idea is not exactly strong on critical thinking. Those who are capable of thinking things through, on the other hand, might notice that adding Canada as a new state would create an open border with a country of 40 million Canadians, most of whom hold political views well to the left of the average American. It appears that some of the same conservatives who complain about Californians moving to their states also want to open the border to a new California-sized state to the north. How is Canada different politically from the United States? Generally speaking, it is far to the Left. For example, a recent poll of Canadians showed that 70 percent of Canadians support banning all new handgun purchases. 80 percent support bans of 'assault weapons' variously defined. These numbers are typically ten to twenty percent higher than the numbers found in the United States. Similarly, 80 percent of Canadians polled typically support abortion on demand. In the United States, the number is closer to 60 percent. In the United States, 43 percent of Americans polled say the health care system should be run by the government. In Canada, 86 percent prefer government-run healthcare. In fact, as Ronald Hamowy has noted, support for government health care is near to being a religious dogma in Canada. Moreover, a voting majority of Canadians have long opposed freedom of speech, having adopted draconian 'hate speech' laws since the 1970s. This would surprise no one who is familiar with Canadian politics. As Peter St Onge has put it, Canadian 'conservatives' are essentially what we would identify as centrist Democrats in America. The people we might call conservatives or libertarians in America are a tiny minority in Canada. Apparently, The Trump plan—enthusiastically applauded by many of his loyal MAGA supporters—is to add to the United States millions of voters who want government health care, bans on all hand guns, more abortion, and hate speech laws. Moreover, Canada would enter the US as the largest or second-largest state ensuring dozens of new electoral college votes for Democrats. Put another way, with Canada as the fifty-first state, the only way the Republicans could ever win another national election would be to move even further to the left than they already have. With a 'second California,' added to the mix, Congress would move significantly to the Left as Canadian voters sent dozens of new members of Congress—members with a Canadian political ideology—to Washington, DC. Some defenders of annexation might claim that this would not be a problem if each Canadian province becomes its own new state. This wouldn’t help much, however. A majority of Canadians live in either Ontario or Quebec, and those provinces lean well to the Left, The Liberal Party routinely trounces the Conservatives in the largest provinces. The 'conservative' provinces of Canada, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan would be among the smallest states if added to the United States, and we’d likely soon be reminded that Canadian conservatives are centrists by American standards. Here, for example, are the 2019 election results for Parliament. (In Canada, blue is the color for the Conservative party.): Sure, the GOP might pick up a handful of new seats in the smaller 'states' of central Canada. Most new, post-annexation members of Congress, however, would be left-leaning Quebecois and Ontarians. So, yes, if the goal is to add a second California to the United States, or at least one or two new copies of Illinois or Washington State, then annexing Canada is a great idea. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to assume that Canadians would stay in Canada if Trump succeeds in creating an open border on the north. Many would elect to move south and fill up American cities and suburbs with new center-left or far-left voters. The migration is likely to be larger than anything we now see out of California. The scale of California out-migration is limited by the fact that California weather and geography is very nice. On the other hand, Canada has all the high taxes, overregulation, and high cost of living of California, but with a terrible climate. The Canada exodus will make the California exodus look like a minor affair in comparison. If Trump gets his way, get ready to be regularly harangued by your new Canadian neighbors who just moved south and will now lecture you about the need for single-payer healthcare and gun bans. Indeed, the prospect of annexing Canada exposes some interesting new angles on the problem of open borders. Conservatives usually frame the open-borders debate as a problem of letting in too many supposedly undesirable 'third world' immigrants. Rather, we are told, the US should seek to import more 'first world' migrants. Importing millions of (mostly) white, 'first world' Canadians might not go quite the way that many conservatives think it would.

The Global Significance Of South Korea’s Leadership Crisis – OpEd	Democracy isn’t doing so well around the world. One poignant sign of democracy’s decline is that it’s cherished most fervently in places where it effectively doesn’t exist— in Venezuela, for example, among voters protesting a stolen election. In existing democracies, meanwhile, voters don’t hold their defining political institutions in high regard. In the United States, less than 20 percent of Americans think Congress is doing a good job. In the European Union, only one-third of citizens on average trust their national governments and only one-fifth trust their political parties. Familiarity breeds contempt, which explains why voters have elected anti-democratic candidates to high office in country after country. Viktor Orban has won four straight elections in Hungary. Narendra Modi has been consolidating power in his own hands for over a decade as India’s prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu has somehow survived at the top of the Israeli political system for 17 out of the last 28 years. A chainsaw-wielding rogue economist, Javier Milei, now presides as president of Argentina. And, of course, the profoundly anti-democratic Donald Trump is returning to the White House. Many of these right-wing leaders used the ladder of democracy to reach office, and they’ve been trying ever since to knock down that ladder so that no one can follow them into power. These autocrats in democratic clothing have met with political opposition, some of it quite intense. In the most extreme cases, like Russia, that opposition has been jailed, exiled, and assassinated. Elsewhere, autocrats have simply declared martial law. In Tunisia, Kais Saied suspended the constitution in 2021 and put an end to the only example of democratic governance produced by the Arab Spring. Then there are the leaders who over-reach. Donald Trump tried to find a way to stay in office after he lost the 2020 election. He attempted to overturn the results in the courts. He marshalled a crowd of agitators to pressure the vice president and Congress to withhold certification of the election. There was even talk of martial law inside the Trump White House in December 2020. Ultimately, without the U.S. military on his side, Trump grudgingly vacated the White House. The decision by South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to declare martial law on December 3 was, by comparison, a shock. To be sure, Yoon was frustrated by the considerable opposition he faced in the South Korean parliament. He promoted figures from the New Right Movement, which telegraphed his own more favorable views of the Japanese colonial period and the authoritarian modernizers of the post-Korean War era. But few expected such a brazen power grab. Yoon probably figured that, unlike Trump, he could succeed with his martial law declaration because he had the military on his side. Indeed, Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun confessed that martial law was all his idea. But Yoon and Kim had probably been discussing the timing of such a declaration since the summer. Fortunately, South Korean democracy has proven remarkably durable. Perhaps because the last martial law period is still in the living memory of many people, including a generation of parliamentarians, Yoon’s opposition moved quickly to block his attempted seizure of total power. The guardrails of democracy—political institutions, courts, civil society—held firm. Yoon was impeached less than two weeks after he declared martial law. Another key guardrail is cultural. Shame is an integral part of Korean society. A number of Korean politicians—former president Roh Moo Hyun, former Seoul mayor Park Won Soon—have committed suicide because of what they perceived to be their own shameful conduct. Defense Minister Kim also tried to commit suicide in his jail cell. Short of killing themselves, Korean politicians will also make elaborate apologies, as Yoon has done. Compare that with politicians like Donald Trump, who never admits wrongdoing or ever apologizes. It is impossible to shame Trump, no matter what he has done, from sexual misconduct to flagrant violations of the law. Indeed, his campaign to regain the White House was largely an effort to prove to the American people that he was innocent of all charges, legal and otherwise. Right-wing politicians generally lack shame. Putin has destroyed Ukrainian society, ruined the lives of millions of Russians, and hobbled his economy for generations to come, but he would never admit that he ever did anything wrong. Even in a country like India, where shame is an integral part of the culture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pushed an anti-Muslim agenda, fumbled its response to the COVID crisis, and criminalized dissent—but he sees no reason to apologize for any of his actions. This absence of shame is real and troubling, but the issue here is not cultural. Rather, it’s the refusal of leaders in putatively democratic countries to engage with their opposition, respect political institutions, and take responsibility for their mistakes. Yoon did what many right-wing leaders have done—Trump, Putin, Modi—but he wasn’t clever enough to figure out a way to concentrate power in his hands without declaring martial law, which is an obvious red line in Korea. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index, which rates democracies according to their relative strength, democratic standards have been eroding over the last decade. Less than 8 percent of the world’s population now live in 'full democracies.' Another 50 countries, including the United States, are 'flawed democracies.' South Korea ranks as a 'full democracy,' but just barely. Its overall score is dragged down by poor marks for 'political culture,' the worst of any other full democracy. Indeed, its grade is exactly the same as the United States. In the Economist’s next report, the ability of South Korean to defend against Yoon’s declaration of martial law and the failure of U.S. voters to prevent Donald Trump from lying and bullying his way back into office will surely produce more divergent results for the two countries in the Democracy Index. The sad truth is that South Korean efforts to save the country’s democracy—which, of course, is still an ongoing procress—is increasingly anomalous in the world today. Political polarization, growing economic inequality, persistent military conflict, the stresses of climate change, and periodic shocks like the COVID pandemic have left the institutions of democracy much weaker. In some places, like South Korea, cultural attributes like shame still exert some kind of restraint. But shame, as Donald Trump is proving, is fast becoming anachronistic. People power in the form of right-wing appeals to populism is destroying democracy. But people power like what South Koreans have done after Yoon’s declaration of martial law can still save democracy.

Making The Dollar Great Again: The Enduring Challenges Facing The...	Appointing Scott Bessent as the incoming Secretary of the Treasury, President Donald Trump recently pointed out that this choice was part of his global strategy to, amongst other aims, '[…] fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy, […] Destination for Capital, while always, and without a question, maintaining the US Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World,' reinforcing the belief that the US dollar remains one of the world's most powerful and widely recognized currencies, both in its physical and emerging digital forms. This dominance, while increasingly challenged, continues to provide the American government with unparalleled leverage on the global economic stage. Aligned with the campaign's direction and the early appointments in the new administration, the dollar—whether physical or digital—must be strategically positioned as a tool of power to advance the MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda. While the rise of cryptocurrencies presents new opportunities and considerations, the enduring challenges tied to the physical dollar remain consistent. These challenges now warrant even greater political focus, emphasizing the greenback's role as both a sovereign instrument and a symbol of American strength and authority. It remains a powerful tool on the international stage, with some independent countries using it as a national currency, while many others happily employ it as an alternative currency of exchange, while others are considering restricting cash dollar transactions, which only underlines the range of the dollar’s influence. As for Americans themselves, they attach a significant importance to their beloved bill as well. Indeed, with Trump threatening tariff hikes on imported goods from neighboring and adversarial countries, a robust dollar could put the US in a strong position. This was outlined by incoming Treasury Secretary, who stated that '[tariffs] are a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.' This amplitude of social, political and economic values helps the nation use its currency as a powerful instrument – and presents the dollar printing works, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), and its current chief Patricia 'Patty' S. Collins with great responsibility for the symbol of economic power and a certain American dream. Being one of the most high-tech national enterprises, the Bureau translates the above 'intangible' responsibility into very concrete physical actions, namely ensuring the highest degree of quality and operational excellence. For this purpose, the BEP entire production system includes not only manufacturing and distribution, but also support processes such as supply chain management, engineering, facilities management and many others. Only when these operations work in concert can the BEP best respond to the needs of its customers: just imagine what a joy opponents would derive from an insufficient dollar supply, or the effects of the increased importance of cryptocurrencies in the American economy. But for the BEP, every cog counts – from components like paper or ink, to the meticulous work of a multitude of in-house and external hands aided by high-precision machines to guarantee accuracy and consistently high quality, without production stops or mistypes. For all their differences, they have a point of similarity: their homogeneity, which is critical to ensuring a constant life cycle, yet another challenge that is always achieved, yet never becomes obsolete. Here's the thing: banknotes, being an integral part of the financial system, circulate within an almost endless environment of highly sensitive ATMs, cash registers, detectors and other things. A batch of lower quality bills caused by a failure at one of the production stages may go unnoticed by an average user, but will raise an alarm at a bank or ATM. An example is not far to seek. In 2010, the Treasury was forced to delay the debut of the new-series $100 bill due to manufacturing errors. Some notes were creased during printing, making them unusable, and it was found later that the glitch resulted from 'a production failure that potentially could have been avoided.' It turned out that the government spent about $120 million to produce bills it couldn’t use, not even considering costs of dealing with the mass of printed but unusable notes. The risk of a similar occurrence is now minimized as the homogeneity of the high-tech equipment optimizes the performance of the man-machine pairing, and ad hoc support and long-standing cooperation between in-house staff and supplier counterparts assist the bureau in performing the task quickly and efficiently. Overall, this system remains highly efficient and expertly deals with the quality issue – but there’s more to the Bureau’s discreet work than just ensuring the bills come out neat and crisp. The next challenge concerns constant work on improving the quality and security of banknotes, achieved through ongoing updates and close cooperation. Counterfeiters keep inventing new ways to do their business, while the Fed, the BEP and even the Secret Service work together to find fake items and to prevent them from ever being accepted. The security of banknotes and the possibility of their quick identification play a major role here, and so the Bureau introduces new series and monitors production processes and equipment to ensure that no mistake is made: for instance, BEP Strategic Plan 2022-2026 includes developing 'next family of manufacturable banknotes', which should be 'secure, manufacturable, accessible and functions in commerce'. Should this go well, it will add to the BEP’s production base and boost the security of the paper dollar as a store of value – but it’s not so easy to do. The addition of new processes and equipment is a demanding step for the teams to take. And as if this was not enough, the Bureau is currently facing a handover between a retiring generation and new entrants to the profession. The transfer of know-how and the start-up of new operations taken together will require an out-of-ordinary operational performance and cooperation not only from the Bureau, but from all upstream and downstream supply chain stakeholders. Speaking about the latter – in contrast to other industries, security printing suppliers aren’t just sellers of things. Managing the production of a highly secure and constantly improving product is no mean feat, and suppliers need to keep up to date: the resistance of security features to counterfeiting is regularly eroded by technological advances that enable them to be imitated or approximated. Consequently, currency printing equipment has over time evolved from simple printing presses to high-tech machines fully integrated into the production process. Others can afford a like-for-like equipment change, but this wouldn’t work in security printing: the designs and security features are developed in strict secrecy, patented, and are primarily designed to ensure expert quality, technological continuity and smoothness of operations while a facility has to be modernized regularly. The practical sense of such a feature reveals itself especially clear in solving unusually complex tasks, such as the one the Bureau is facing right now. The printer is set to replace its facility in D.C. with a new one located in Maryland. Once the new site opens its doors, there will be a transitional period of a working overlap, that might potentially create difficulties in ensuring operational continuity and production quality at the end of the process in three different locations (the third being located in Texas) – if not for the similarity of the production processes at the two sites. The administration’s plans take into account the entirety of challenges ahead of the BEP, but it may change overnight, and it is clear that the printer must be well prepared for new waves of demand. The Bureau has already shown its flexibility in ebbs and flows of the COVID-19 pandemic, but its capacity to respond to future challenges will depend on its ability to cope with the potential entropy generated by such a range of existing challenges. It is now possible to assume that the routine and out-of-ordinary tasks will be successfully accomplished with the well-established production system. In an interview not long after her nomination back in April, Patty Collins noted that the printer copes with change using several factors, including subordination to the Treasury department, close and long-term relationships with material and equipment suppliers, and successful human capital/talent management. While her background inspires confidence—particularly her proven ability to optimize and maintain operational processes in both routine and crisis situations—the future may bring challenges. The Bureau and its recently appointed Director will have to deliver on the plan, while potentially being flexible to shifts in leadership or priorities decided by the incoming head of the Treasury, Scott Bessent. While the overall outlook for the Bureau and the paper dollar remains cautiously optimistic, it is tempered by decisions yet to be made.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh-HkcjPNb2VG	2025-01-08T16:17:25-08:00	
How The Death Of Qasem Soleimani Weakened The Foundations Of Iran...	The death of Qassem Soleimani on January 3, 2020, was one of the most significant political and military events with far-reaching impacts on Iran, the region, and the world. As the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Soleimani played a central role in exporting terrorism and regional warmongering. Due to his extensive actions in the region and systematic crimes, he was one of the most detested figures of the regime after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. On the fifth anniversary of this event and following the domino-like collapse of the strategic depth of the Iranian regime, it is clearer how the death of this criminal significantly weakened the foundation of the religious fascism. Khamenei’s Arm for Repression and Terrorism In the 1990s, Soleimani was appointed as the commander of the IRGC Quds Force, a terrorist force specifically tasked with advancing the regional goals of religious fascism by supporting militas such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Iraqi terrorist groups. He played an active role in orchestrating proxy wars in Syria and Iraq and was recognized as the architect of the regime’s expansionist terrorism in the region. His suppression of uprisings inside Iran and the mass killings of civilians in countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Yemen branded him as a war criminal. Additionally, he played a direct role in attacks on the bases of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) in Ashraf and Liberty. Reactions and Consequences of Soleimani’s Death in the Region and the World The death of Soleimani sparked mixed reactions across the region. Groups supported by the Islamic Republic, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, viewed it as an attack on the 'Axis of Resistance.' However, in Iraq and Syria, many people, especially young people, welcomed the event with joy. His elimination provided an opportunity to reduce the influence of religious fascism in these countries. Even when the infamous Assad family was in power, the Syrian people celebrated Soleimani’s death by distributing sweets. They were among the victims of the regime’s cross-border terrorism. On January 3, 2021, Mohammad-Reza Naqdi, a coordinator of the IRGC, admitted that the regime had spent $17 billion in 'the region,' by which he meant Syria. He stated:'There was a situation where we couldn’t say our forces were killed in Syria. We said they were killed in the West. Everyone condemned us and said you’re supporting a dictator. Khamenei saw the depth of the front. Soleimani, with a plane loaded with tens of tons of explosives, weapons, and ammunition, landed in the middle of an airport under enemy siege.' On an international level, Soleimani’s death elicited reactions from the United States, Europe, and the United Nations. The global community regarded the event as a serious blow to Khamenei’s interventionist policies. Psychological Impacts and Demoralization Within the Regime The death of Soleimani is considered a significant turning point. As mentioned, he was not only a criminal leader of the IRGC Quds Force but also a driving force behind the terrorist policies of Iran’s regime in the region and the world. His death created a major void in the structure of the regime and the IRGC. On January 1, 2022, Khamenei expressed his bitterness over the widespread social and online reaction to Soleimani’s death, saying: 'You probably know more than I do what reactions there are to his name in cyberspace. This is another lesson, a further warning for us and the country’s cyberspace authorities to understand what they need to do! The enemy shouldn’t be able to act however it wants, anywhere it wants. And, of course, global cyberspace is under the control of oppressors.' On December 30, 2021, Speaker of Majlis (Parliament) Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf admitted, 'His absence is felt everywhere on the front and in the region.' On July 21, 2022, foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said, 'If Qassem Soleimani and the armed forces had not been deployed in the region, we definitely would not have had security in Tehran.' On January 5, 2023, Ahmad Alamolhoda, Khamenei’s representative in Mashhad, citing Khamenei, acknowledged that Qassem Soleimani advanced the regional terrorism strategy and designed the October 7 attack, 'Indeed, the Al-Aqsa Storm operation is a product of the sacrifices, leadership, and planning of Martyr Haj Qassem Soleimani. This martyr, Al-Arouri, who was martyred a few days ago and was the head of Hamas’s office in Beirut, reportedly said a week before his martyrdom that Martyr Haj Qassem Soleimani went to Gaza three times, and no one noticed his comings and goings. He said Soleimani went to Gaza three times. The tunnels in Gaza were created with the suggestion of Martyr Imad Mughniyeh and the design of Martyr Haj Qassem Soleimani. The vision of this man, his leadership, created the Al-Aqsa Storm operation. He formulated the plan for the Al-Aqsa Storm and dictated it to the Palestinian resistance, which bore fruit today. When I say Al-Aqsa Storm is the legacy of Martyr Haj Qassem, this is not an exaggeration or just my claim.' On January 7, 2022, Morteza Movahedi-Pour, the Friday Prayer Leader of Bojnurd, said, 'If General Soleimani and his comrades had not been there, today in our great Iran, as the Supreme Leader said, we might have faced significant losses in cities like Kermanshah and Hamadan. The pressures they exert are immense; they push so hard to test [us].' Distribution of Sweets in Iran The death of Soleimani triggered widespread reactions in Iran. In the streets, people mocked and celebrated the event, expressing their disdain for the regime’s policies. Some videos and images of people distributing sweets in various parts of Iran captured this public sentiment. On social media, hashtags related to his death trended globally. The Blood of the PMOI on Qassem Soleimani’s Hands Alongside advancing Khamenei’s terrorist policies in the region, Qassem Soleimani was responsible for orchestrating the massacres of residents in Ashraf and Liberty. On September 4, 2013, a member of the Assembly of Experts admitted during a session that Soleimani had 'addressed the issue of Iraq and Camp Ashraf, where over 50 individuals were killed, many of whom were PMOI leaders, and 10 others went missing. This incident was even more significant than the Mersad operation.' This was echoed by IRGC commander Hossein Salami, who also referred to the massacre of 52 Ashraf residents. The daughter of Hassan Irloo, a former Iranian ambassador to Yemen and senior Quds Force commander, revealed that the force was responsible for the massacre of the PMOI members on September 1, 2013: 'Many of my father’s actions were not disclosed due to security considerations, and even we were unaware until after his [death] that he was among the key figures in the operation to evacuate PMOI from Camp Ashraf' (IRAM, October 28, 2021). The daughter of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Soleimani’s right-hand man in Iraq, openly stated that her father participated in the attack on the Habib base of the PMOI’s National Liberation Army of Iran: 'In the 1990s, his methods changed after the war ended, and he began operations inside Iraq. He conducted numerous operations, some known to the public, others not. At that time, he was one of their commanders and part of the Badr Corps. Among the operations he personally carried out was the attack on the Habib base. The Habib base belonged to the PMOI in Iraq. In the late 1990s, he became the commander of the Badr Corps, which facilitated direct contact with Haj Qassem Soleimani. Such success would not have been possible without support from the Islamic Republic of Iran and assistance from Hezbollah teams in Lebanon. Without the Islamic Republic’s backing, Hashd al-Shaabi (PMF) would not have been formed or expanded.' A photo published by the Long War Journal, associated with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in the U.S., shows Qassem Soleimani inspecting militias responsible for killings in Tikrit. He is sipping tea from a flask labeled 'Ceremony Warehouse,' which reportedly came from looted PMOI properties after the September 1, 2013, massacre at Ashraf. The label, blatantly indicative of the PMOI’s stolen belongings, was not even removed, perhaps as a show of power by Soleimani. The series of missile attacks on Camp Liberty were also directly conducted under Soleimani’s supervision, as noted in statements by the National Council of Resistance of Iran at the time. The Regime’s Defeat in Iran’s Cities The death of Soleimani not only dealt a blow to the regime and its regional policies but also boosted the fighting spirit of the Iranian people. Now, as the regime faces numerous internal and external challenges, the crushing impacts of this strategic blow are increasingly evident in the regime’s warmongering and terrorist policies. As the regime has lost its strategic depth, it is now the turn of Iran’s youth to bring defeat to religious fascism in the cities of Iran. This time, no obstacle, not even the malevolent legacy of Soleimani or the regime’s hollow myth-making about him, can stand in their way.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49EChwaIfTt6XUj0	2025-01-08T16:15:12-08:00	
Can Centralised Control In Pakistan Sustain Economic Growth Witho...	The past year in Pakistan was marked by turbulence and instability. While the political stalemate continued, the country saw some promising economic developments, with inflation and interest rates declining in 2024. The key question now is: where will these trends lead in 2025? In a bid to drive economic progress, Pakistan's hybrid regime has centralised control, sacrificing democratic principles by effectively caging the opposition. This authoritarian approach, adopted in 2022, raises a critical question: will it deliver sustainable economic growth, or will it stifle the country's democratic development? Moreover, this path echoes failed strategies followed by past dictatorships in the country, begging the question of whether it offers a viable roadmap for the future. Supporters of political stability imposed by force often argue that it is a necessary step, particularly in countries with weak institutions or histories of instability like Pakistan. When a country is experiencing political chaos, economic decline, or civil unrest, some believe that a strong, centralised government—whether through military rule, technocratic control, or authoritarian leadership—is essential to bring order and set the stage for development. While such stability can lead to short-term economic progress, it also comes with significant costs. History shows that forced political stability often leads to significant social and political risks that can undermine long-term economic development. Reverting to the starting point through another failed attempt could prove counterproductive. In many cases, centralised control leads to the erosion of democratic institutions, including the judiciary, the media, and civil society. This can create a governance system where decision-making is not transparent or accountable, which can eventually lead to corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of trust in the state. As seen in many authoritarian regimes, once the grip on power becomes entrenched, it can be difficult to reform or move towards a more inclusive and participatory political system. Attempting to impose stability through force often suppresses dissent, leading to long-term social unrest. Countries that resort to political repression may face growing inequality, poverty, and public discontent. While this approach may spur economic growth in the short term, the benefits can be unevenly distributed, with wealth concentrated among a small elite, further fueling public discontent. The example of the Ayub dictatorship in Pakistan demonstrates this dynamic - the regime delivered economic growth but also entrenched social inequalities, ultimately contributing to its collapse. Relying on a single leader or small elite group to enforce political stability often proves perilous. When these authoritarian regimes collapse, the country is left grappling with instability and turmoil. The downfall of dictatorships like Pinochet's Chile and Ceausescu's Romania illustrates the dangers of centralised control based on personal authority. Once these leaders were removed from power, the countries faced immense challenges in transitioning to more democratic forms of governance. Without a robust system of checks and balances, the abrupt loss of a dominant ruler can plunge a nation into political and economic upheaval. In terms of economic progress, forced political stability might create favorable conditions in the early years of a regime (such as attracting foreign investment, implementing structural reforms, or stabilising inflation), but whether that progress is sustainable depends on several factors: Robust, transparent, and accountable institutions are the foundation for long-term, inclusive economic progress. Countries that transition from authoritarian regimes to democratic governance, such as South Korea and Taiwan, tend to experience more sustainable economic development. In our globalised world, countries must align with international standards governing trade, investment, and human rights. Authoritarian governments that resist these norms may find their economic growth hampered by isolation or pressure from global actors demanding greater political freedoms and reforms. Investing in education, healthcare, and human rights is crucial for economic development. Conversely, regimes that suppress freedom of expression, civil liberties, and educational progress risk stifling innovation and the empowerment of the population - both of which are vital for long-term growth. As rationalist Baruch Spinoza aptly said 'The object of government is not to change men from rational beings into puppets, but to enable them to develop their minds and bodies in security, and to employ their reason unshackled. … The true aim of government is liberty. In conclusion, political stability imposed by force can catalyse rapid economic progress in the short term, particularly in countries with weak institutions or histories of political instability. The centralised control provided by authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes can allow for decisive action, long-term planning, and the implementation of ambitious economic policies. However, the sustainability of such growth is highly contingent on the development of strong institutions, the promotion of human capital, and the eventual integration of democratic principles. Ultimately, while force-imposed stability can provide a foundation for economic progress, it often comes at the cost of human rights and political freedoms. The question is not just whether economic progress can be achieved, but whether it can be sustained without addressing the deeper political issues that may emerge when governance is centralised, and democratic values are compromised. Without careful management, the long-term effects may undermine both economic development and the stability itself, potentially leading to future political and economic crises.

How Trump Threatens The World Trading System – OpEd	By Robert Staiger If the United States wanted to break the world trading system it could not have done better than to re-elect Donald Trump to the US Presidency. Not that Trump is alone among recent US presidents in his disregard for the current system of global trade rules. The Biden administration maintained and even extended a number of high-profile trade policy initiatives from the first Trump administration and paid little heed to how these policies squared with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). And the unwillingness of the first Trump Administration to fill vacancies created by the expiring terms of WTO judges continued a practice adopted by the Obama Administration. But Trump’s words and actions have made it uniquely clear that his vision for a world trading system is antithetical to the rules-based multilateral global trade order that the United States helped to create 75 years ago. The current global trading system was established through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the WTO. GATT’s rules-based global trade order was built on the twin pillars of non-discrimination and reciprocity. The ‘most-favoured-nation’ (MFN) rule of non-discrimination ensures that exports of the same product originating from any country enjoy equal tariff treatment in a given destination market. Reciprocity means that tariff bargains aim to balance the changes in import and export volumes that each country experiences as a result of the negotiations. These pillars created a system that constrains large trading countries’ ability to dominate negotiations. The MFN principle dilutes the ability of large countries to extract disproportionate advantages from smaller bargaining partners by ensuring that any gains are also shared by third-country exporters. Reciprocity further neutralises the exercise of power in tariff bargains because it establishes an expectation of balanced terms for the bargain. This system of rules encouraged smaller countries to invest in globalisation without fear of exploitation at the bargaining table, and the more inclusive globalisation that resulted benefited large countries as well. By discouraging the bluff and bluster accompanying the exercise of power in negotiations, the rules delivered a streamlined method for tariff bargaining that dramatically reduced trade barriers over the latter half of the twentieth century, helping to usher in decades of trade growth and poverty reduction. Importantly, these rules created a ‘member-driven’ system, where countries have the flexibility to decide what trade policies are right for them, provided they do not aim to shift their policies’ costs onto trading partners. Eliminating these cost-shifting incentives is the primary goal of the rules, and a world trading system built on MFN and reciprocity is well-designed to help governments achieve this goal. As trading partners often bear costs when a country imposes tariffs, achieving this goal naturally leads to lower tariffs around the world. But how much lower is a matter for each country to determine for itself through voluntary rules-based negotiation. Built-in flexibilities within the system allow countries to rethink their preferred level of trade openness if they so desire. As such, being a free trader is not a prerequisite for supporting the rules-based global trade order administered by the GATT and WTO. And a country does not have to escape from these rules in order to rethink its commitment to a level of openness. Rather, the rules provide a ready-made and orderly avenue for the country to do just that while maintaining a measure of predictability and stability in trading relations that is itself an important benefit of the rules-based system. The incoming Trump administration plans to take a sledgehammer to the pillars of the rules-based global trade order. Under the first Trump administration, then commerce secretary Wilbur Ross outlined an alternative trading system wherein countries with the lowest tariffs would match the tariffs of those with the highest, country by country and product by product, automatically adjusting as other countries lower their barriers. Under this system, MFN would be abandoned, as exporters from a high-tariff country would face high tariffs in a given market while exporters of the same good from a low-tariff country would face low tariffs in that market. This system would also introduce an unprecedented notion of reciprocity — matching tariff levels across countries rather than negotiated tariff changes — that is antithetical to the member-driven logic of the WTO. In short, the vision for a global trade order articulated under the first Trump administration would replace the rules-based multilateral trading system with something more like a power-based system for tariff bargaining where large countries are no longer constrained by the rules of behaviour that have shaped the system for the past 75 years. President-elect Trump’s recent statements reflect this vision of power-based tariff bargaining and broaden it to include the use of tariffs as bargaining chips for a host of settings beyond traditional tariff bargaining. These include non-tariff issues ranging from the regulation of immigration to the production of fentanyl precursors to the role of the US dollar in the global economy. There are also indications that Trump will seize the opportunity to engage in bargaining with domestic interests in the United States over exceptions to his tariff policies, all of which fits with his view that tariffs are a bargaining chip to extract concessions from others. The rules-based system administered by the WTO is far from perfect. But its creation 75 years ago was built on lessons learned from earlier failed attempts at power-based trade bargaining and there is good reason to think that the core features of this system remain valuable today relative to a power-based alternative. Viewed in this light, the incoming Trump administration’s evident intent to tear down the rules-based multilateral trading system and replace it with a power-based system will likely end in disappointment — if not disaster.

Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening In The Western Pacific – Analysi...	By Timothy A. Walton and Thomas H. Shugart The United States’ airfields face a threat of severe Chinese military attack. People’s Liberation Army (PLA) strike forces of aircraft, ground-based missile launchers, surface and subsurface vessels, and special forces can attack US aircraft and their supporting systems at airfields globally, including in the continental United States. The US Department of Defense (DoD) has consistently expressed concern regarding threats to airfields in the Indo-Pacific, and military analyses of potential conflicts involving China and the United States demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of US aircraft losses would likely occur on the ground at airfields (and that the losses could be ruinous). But the US military has devoted relatively little attention, and few resources, to countering these threats compared to developing modern aircraft. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) expects airfields to come under heavy attack in a potential conflict and has made major investments to defend, expand, and fortify them.1 Since the early 2010s, the PLA has more than doubled its hardened aircraft shelters (HASs) and unhardened individual aircraft shelters (IASs) at military airfields, giving China more than 3,000 total aircraft shelters—not including civil or commercial airfields. This constitutes enough shelters to house and hide the vast majority of China’s combat aircraft. China has also added 20 runways and more than 40 runway-length taxiways, and increased its ramp area nationwide by almost 75 percent. In fact, by our calculations, the amount of concrete used by China to improve the resilience of its air base network could pave a four-lane interstate highway from Washington, DC, to Chicago. As a result, China now has 134 air bases within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait—airfields that boast more than 650 HASs and almost 2,000 non-hardened IASs. In contrast, US airfield expansion and fortification efforts have been modest compared to US activities during the Cold War—and compared to the contemporary actions of the PRC. Since the early 2010s, examining airfields within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait, and outside of South Korea, the US military has added only two HASs and 41 IASs, one runway and one taxiway, and 17 percent more ramp area. Including ramp area at allied and partner airfields outside Taiwan, combined US, allied, and partner military airfield capacity within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait is roughly one-third of the PRC’s. Without airfields in the Republic of Korea, this ratio drops to one-quarter, and without airfields in the Philippines, it falls further, to 15 percent. Overall, this creates an imbalance in which PLA forces would need to fire far fewer 'shots' to suppress or destroy US, allied, and partner airfields than the converse (see figure 1). This imbalance ranges from approximately 25 percent if the US employed military airfields in Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan to as great as 88 percent if it employed only military airfields in Japan.2 Operationally, this could make air operations in a conflict significantly easier to sustain for the PRC than for the United States; strategically, this destabilizing asymmetry risks incentivizing the PRC to exercise a first-mover advantage. China could initiate a conflict if it sees an opportunity to nullify adversary airpower on the ramp. Figure 1. Estimated Munitions Required to Neutralize Airfields, by Location. Source: Authors. The US Department of Defense can organize and resource its forces and infrastructure to sustain air operations while under attack. But to regain an advantage and deter conflict, the United States, as well as allies and partners to varying degrees, should pursue the following three lines of effort. 1. Induce Continued PRC Defensive Investments The United States should continue to improve its ability to strike PLA forces and key elements of critical infrastructure at depth and en masse despite the presence of dense, unsuppressed air defenses. In response, the already hardened PLA would likely continue to spend funds on additional costly passive and active defense measures and in turn would have less to devote to alternative investments, including strike and other power projection capabilities. 2. Field Resilient Infrastructure The United States should enhance the resilience of its military infrastructure, including but not limited to expanding the capacity and hardening of airfields in the continental United States, the Indo-Pacific, and beyond. Although funds spent on active and passive defenses detract from funds available for offensive capabilities, without a currently missing baseline level of infrastructure resilience, it is reasonable to expect that the DoD’s offensive capabilities will be suppressed in a conflict. Resilient infrastructure is needed to allow US air forces to fight effectively. Resilient architectures should include passive defenses (such as redundancy, geographic distribution and tactical dispersal, hardening, reconstitution, and camouflage, concealment, and deception capabilities) and active defenses. As concluded by Christopher Lynch and other analysts of the RAND Corporation, which has conducted the bulk of US analysis on airfield resilience, 'the most-cost-effective ways to improve air base resilience are robust, passive defenses.'3 To comprehensively harden airfields, the DoD will need to shift from treating each construction project individually to conducting a campaign of construction.4 A major, multi-year campaign of bundled construction at airfields inside and outside the United States—especially in the Indo-Pacific—would create a sustained push for military construction activities at bases, allow the creation of consortia of commercial contractors, and reduce construction costs. As an element of this campaign, the United States could execute joint contracts with those allies that are also hardening their infrastructure. Additionally, the DoD should adopt appropriate hardening measures, especially when undertaking new military construction activities. For example, its current plan to forgo the construction of approximately $30 million hardened aircraft shelters for new over-$600 million B-21 bombers is a foolish decision that endangers the US’s ability to strike globally.5Similarly, in response to a recent spate of likely foreign drones flying over key military bases and installations, the DoD should harden key airfields, including by building HASs. To sustain operations, airfields will also need protection via active defense designs that are lethal, adaptable, and resilient in the face of continued enemy action.6 This requires the US Army to reallocate funding from maneuver forces to grow the Air Defense Artillery branch and deepen its capacity to defend airfields, ports, and other critical assets. It also requires more, survivable air and missile defense systems and effectors capable of sustaining calibrated, protracted defenses. 3. Evolve the Force The DoD should develop and accelerate the fielding of forces that are less susceptible to the PLA’s airfield attacks. Elements of this shift in force design should include long-range and -endurance aircraft, such as B-21 bombers and Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS) tankers that can operate from more distant airfields or spend more time in the air rather than on the ramp—where they are easier targets. The Pentagon should also deploy forces such as missiles and some types of autonomous collaborative platforms that can operate from short or damaged runways or independently of airfields—if they are logistically supported. However, the US military will not field these types of forces in large numbers until the 2030s, and the DoD will still require passive and active defenses at airfields regardless of these changes in force design. It cannot hope future military forces will address its current airfield weaknesses. In summary, US airfields face a severe threat of attack. The current DoD approach of largely ignoring this menace invites PRC aggression and risks losing a war. Executing an urgent and effective campaign to enhance the resilience of US airfield operations will require informed decisions and sustained funding. Passive defenses, including hardening, are essential; China, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries have invested heavily in them to sustain airfield operations amidst attack—as has the United States in the past. It is past time for the United States to do so again. About the authors: Timothy A.

By Velina Tchakarova The global system is at a crossroads, caught in a paradox, where established rules continue to govern the world, but yield outcomes that defy traditional expectations. This dichotomy reflects a world in flux, where geopolitics resembles a Rubik’s Cube—any attempt to solve one dimension inevitably disrupts others. As uncertainty becomes the defining characteristic of this era, nations must transition from strategies of dominance to those of adaptability and sustainable development, emphasising resilience over rigidity. Once Donald Trump returns to the White House in 2025, it will likely mark a period of recalibration rather than a rupture in the transatlantic relationship. Trump’s presidency would not break the Western alliance but expose its inherent strains, acting as a stress test for both the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and broader United States-European Union relations. Europe, already navigating a trilemma of deindustrialisation, faltering decarbonisation, and worsening geopolitical tensions, will intensify its reliance on Washington. Trump’s 'America First' rhetoric and transactional diplomacy might shift the tone of US-EU relations, compelling the EU to shoulder more responsibility for its defence, while seeking assurances from Washington as a security provider, industrial partner, and energy supplier. This dynamic would force Europe to adopt a more pragmatic approach, balancing its strategic autonomy aspirations with a recognition of its dependence on US capabilities. The drivers of the emerging global order will extend beyond state actors to encompass narratives. Trump’s focus on reshaping America’s global role could further highlight the power of storytelling in geopolitics, where shaping perceptions and controlling information can redefine alliances and influence outcomes. However, in a hyper-connected world, every action—from sanctions to alliances—will have unintended consequences, making policymaking a double-edged sword. Europe and the US will need to tread carefully, ensuring that policy initiatives do not exacerbate mutual vulnerabilities. Reconciling the competing demands of climate change, trade, and security will require a paradoxical mindset: global thinking, regional action, and local communication. As the EU and US navigate a post-globalisation era, they will need to embrace complexity and manage interdependencies. For Europe, this will mean continuing its decarbonisation and industrial revitalisation efforts, even as it leans on the US for energy and security. For the US, a Trump 2.0 administration would have to balance its inward-focused agenda with the need to maintain leadership in a fractured global order.

The Ghost Of Jimmy Carter – OpEd	Hagiography is inevitable when presidents and other prominent people die. The unwillingness to ‘speak ill of the dead’ and the propaganda that would have us believe in American exceptionalism must be rejected. Jimmy Carter was always devoted to protecting the interests of the U.S. state. -- 'All US Presidents, Living and Dead, Are War Criminals,' Glen Ford The late Jimmy Carter lived longer than any other U.S. president, passing away at the age of 100 on December 30, 2024. Like all presidents who only serve one term, Carter is generally considered to have been a failure after being defeated by Ronald Reagan in 1980. What is less well known is that ample evidence indicates Reagan and his associates planned what is known as the 'October Surprise ,' which kept U.S. hostages in Iran and sealed Carter’s electoral defeat. Carter’s hapless ending was largely forgotten because of his good works with Habitat for Humanity and his eschewing of the typical post-presidential cashing in with corporate speeches and other forms of money grubbing among the elite. He wrote books and spoke out against Israeli apartheid . Unlike other U.S. officials he referred to it as such, naming the crime and doing a service to humanity in the process. But the warm feelings engendered by Carter’s life after he left the white house should not be a license for amnesia. While in office, he acted as other presidents did and that means his actions must be closely examined. In December 2024, the U.S. succeeded in deposing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after years of backing foreign jihadist fighters against that government. The coup was not without historical precedent. This dynamic began with Jimmy Carter in Afghanistan, where the U.S. waged a proxy war with the help of Osama Bin Laden and others against a government that asked the Soviet Union for support. Carter’s National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski , was the architect of this policy. He spoke quite proudly of his role. 'According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahidin began in 1980, that is to say after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan on December 24, 1979. But the reality, closely guarded until now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, it was on July 3, 1979, that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that, in my opinion, this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.'The U.S. public was never informed that president Najibullah requested Soviet assistance. Instead, the narrative of an evil invasion was created and is still disseminated and widely accepted to this very day. U.S. culpability in arming al-Qaeda is also a topic that has been declared off limits by the corporate media. The attacks of September 11, 2001, would have been a perfect opportunity to discuss U.S. culpability in empowering al-Qaeda. Twenty years late,r the vow of silence continues, as does the U.S. proxy relationship with al-Qaeda, ISIS, and now Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the al-Qaeda off-shoot now in control of Syria. Carter may have failed to be re-elected, but like every other white house occupant, he created a new paradigm for his successors to follow. Islamist proxies were U.S. foot soldiers in Bosnia, Chechnya, Libya, and later Syria. U.S. backing was a marriage of convenience with these groups. In a 1993 interview bin Laden bragged about sending 'not hundreds, but thousands' to Afghanistan. He could not have done so without U.S. support. Jimmy Carter did more than build homes for the needy. He established the Carter Center . 'It seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.' Yet even cursory scrutiny reveals that the Carter Center did not act as an independent entity but instead worked hand in hand with the U.S. Interference in Haiti is but one example. Elections were scheduled to be held in Haiti on December 16, 1990, and Jean-Bertrand Aristide was favored to win. Carter was on hand as an election observer, but he also held meetings at the U.S. embassy, after which he asked Aristide to stand down and to concede before all votes were counted, but he refused and won 67% of the vote. Carter certainly didn’t resolve any conflicts in Haiti. His goal was to get the U.S. backed candidate, Marc Bazin, elected. Carter interfered in Haitian affairs again in 1994 in coordination with Bill Clinton’s administration. Aristide’s administration was short-lived, and he was overthrown by a CIA-backed coup d’etat in 1991. In 1994 ,Clinton acted in part at the request of the Congressional Black Caucus, who wanted Aristide restored to power. Carter’s negotiation ended military rule but sent U.S. troops to Haiti. Occupation was the price for so-called democracy. Aristide was forced to accept World Bank and IMF 'structural adjustments,' which forced austerity on the country and reversed his plans to bring economic justice to his people. Ten years later, in 2004, the George W. Bush administration kidnapped Haiti’s democratically elected president and sent him to the Central African Republic, despite protest from the Congressional Black Caucus and others. The Carter Center showed its true colors again in 2024 after Venezuela’s presidential election , declaring, 'Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic.' The Carter Center is funded by the U.S. State Department, Agency for International Development (USAID), and foreign governments of the UK, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar in addition to the George Soros funded Open Society and the Gates Foundation. While the Carter Center cast aspersions even before all votes in Venezuela were counted and audited, other international observers pointed out that the process was, in fact, one that is accepted as being democratic and fair. Jimmy Carter proves that there really aren’t any former presidents of the United States. They continue to uphold U.S. self-declared prerogatives. Even when faced with evidence that his presidency was undone by Ronald Reagan, Carter demurred and feigned confusion about what to believe. He never gave up that stance of serving U.S. interests. That is, after all, how one becomes president. And after having served in that office, upholding U.S. interests is a position that is unlikely to change. It is all to the good that Carter built homes for poor people, but no one should forget his service to the maintenance of U.S. hegemony.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh61SJkUpma6S	2025-01-08T15:53:43-08:00	
Europe Reacts To Trump’s Threat To Greenland	By Magnus Lund Nielsen (EurActiv) -- The European Commission on Wednesday did not condemn US President-elect Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland through military means, while France and Germany issued stronger rebukes. In an eclectic press conference on Tuesday, Trump refused to rule out military coercion to solidify US control of Greenland, having repeated his previous interest in 'ownership of the island'. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark, making Greenlanders EU citizens. It is de facto part of NATO, and any use of military force on its territory by another NATO ally would be an historic first. 'The sovereignty of states has to be respected,' a Commission spokesperson said on Wednesday addressing Trump's remarks. But pushed to elaborate, incuding to clarify if the EU was 'waiting for American marines to land in Greenland' before taking a firmer position, the spokeperson said that 'there have been many threats which did not materialise.' Germany and France, meanwhile, have been more unequivocal. 'Borders must not be moved by force,' a spokesperson for the German government said on Wednesday. Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he had consulted with several European leaders and European Council President Antonio Costa to reaffirm the inviolability of international law. 'A certain lack of understanding was evident among European partners regarding recent statements from the United States,' he told journalists in an impromptu statement on Wednesday. 'The principle of the inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east of us or to the west,' he said. 'This cannot and must not be shaken.' Similarly, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told national radio that EU would not tolerate US military intervention. 'There is no question of the EU letting other nations in the world, whoever they may be, attack its sovereign borders,' he said. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged caution on Tuesday night. 'As a very close ally of the United States, I think there is reason to welcome the growing American interest. But it must be done in a way that respects the Greenlandic people,' she told Danish media TV2. The Greenlandic Prime Minister, Múte Egede, is in Copenhagen on Wednesday to meet with the Danish King Frederik X, Reuters reported. Local media had said on Monday – the day of Donald Trump Jr's surprise visit to Nuuk, the country’s capital – that the meeting was cancelled due to scheduling issues. Egede has expressed a desire to lead Greenland towards independence from Denmark. Last week, the Danish Royal House announced a new version of the king's coat of arms, giving the polar bear, a symbol of the Greenlandic nation, a more central position. Greenland has been part of the Kingdom of Denmark since the 18th century, gradually gaining more autonomy after World War Two. Nick Alipour in Berlin contributed reporting.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh4_WJTM0D8x6	2025-01-08T15:50:52-08:00	
Georgia’s Two Parallel Realities	By Giorgi Lomsadze (Eurasianet) -- Warbling carols, carrying candles and sharing sweets, revelers marched through the gorgeously illuminated streets of Tbilisi late on January 6. It was that time of the year again in Georgia – the nation celebrated Christmas on January 7 – except this time it was part parade, part protest rally. 'We wish everyone a merry Christmas and we demand snap elections,' a student, who identified herself only as Maka, told Eurasianet as she marched together with her classmates and teachers. Close to midnight, thousands gathered around the city’s emblematic Kashveti Church to sing, pray and take a stand. 'We want Georgia to join the European Union and we won’t let a bunch of rich guys who call themselves the government get in the way,' said a young man draped in the EU flag, pointing at the parliament building across the street. As midnight struck, someone started singing a classic carol in a soprano. Holding candles and posters, others in the crowd immediately lent the alto and bass lines – vocal harmonizing is a second nature to many Georgians – and the courtyard filled with dulcet, resounding polyphony. With candles, string lights and smiles sparkling all over the downtown, the night was as beautiful as it could be, but it also served as an illustration of the surreal situation Georgia finds itself in. The nation is split into two parallel worlds, with the protesters being on one side, and the government on the other, with neither recognizing the legitimacy of the other. It is unclear who is the law and who is the authority, and the end to the crisis is nowhere in sight. The Christmas gathering in Tbilisi and others like it elsewhere in the country marked the 40th day of protests that were triggered by the governing Georgia Dream party’s decision to take a rain check on plans to join the European Union. Sometimes numbering in tens of thousands, crowds have been gathering every night in front of the parliament to defy the authority of the Georgian Dream, the only party left inside the legislative walls since last fall’s disputed parliamentary vote. After failing to crush the protests by force, Georgian Dream decided to let the protest movement run its course, hoping that the demonstrations were going to lose steam over winter holidays. Some pro-Georgian Dream commentators banked on what they called the satsivi effect. A turkey in a spicy walnut sauce, satsivi is the main New Year dinner course that also serves as a euphemism for zoning out during winter holiday season. But that has not happened. Tens of thousands gathered in the streets of main cities on New Year’s Eve to protest and party. People brought homemade meals, including the traditional satsivi dish, to the center of Tbilisi, where almost a mile-long dinner table was set up. 'I made satsivi and brought it here to share with everyone,' Ketevan Khmaladze, a retired schoolteacher told Eurasianet, as she helped set up the table in the middle of Rustaveli Avenue. 'Georgian Dream is wrong to think that people will be distracted by anything,' she added. 'We will be coming here no matter what until they go away.' With the streets taken over by the protesters, Georgian Dream held New Year festivities in a government building. Depending on their political affiliations, television networks covered either the protest gathering or the government concert, providing diametrically opposing pictures of how the nation celebrates holidays and, more generally, where the nation stands. Adding to this Kafkaesque picture, the nation now effectively has two presidents, Salome Zourabichvili and Mikheil Kavelashvili. The protest-inclined part of Georgian society considers Zourabichvili as the only legitimate governing figure, as she was elected by popular vote in 2018 and is an ardent champion of Georgia’s future in the EU – the future most Georgians desire. Rejecting the results of last year’s parliamentary polls and subsequent presidential election as illegitimate, protesters don’t recognize the authority of Kavelashvili, an ex footballer whom Georgian Dream plucked from its radical fringes and installed as Zourabichvili’s successor via a disputed electoral college process. In an odd permutation of diarchy, Zourabichvili effectively rules the streets – she joined the Christmas night protest to cheers from the crowds – and Kavelashvili sits in the presidential palace, rubber-stamping Georgian Dream’s legislative ideas. Georgian Dream leaders, including its ultimate boss, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, practically make no public appearances beyond interviews and briefings aired by loyal news stations, creating a feeling that they only exist on TV. Many foreign governments, including those of the UK and US, effectively challenge the authority of Georgian Dream, referring to Georgian officials as 'Georgian Dream’s prime minister' or 'Georgian Dream’s foreign minister,' rather than the Georgian prime minister, etc. Ivanishvili and Georgian Dream are also increasingly shunned and sanctioned by western governments for violent crackdowns on the protesters. There is no clear estimate of where the majority of Georgians stand in the simmering political struggle. Data gleaned from several opinion polls (Eurasianet gained access to polls that are not yet public) suggest that bigger cities mostly reject the authority of Georgian Dream and favor snap parliamentary elections, but there is a more mixed picture in rural areas. Even as it is outnumbered by protesters in the capital city, Georgian Dream leaders still have riot police and mercenary gangs at their disposal, and they have shown they are not afraid to use force against peaceful protesters. With neither side willing to back down, it is difficult to foresee how the stalemate will be broken, analysts say. Georgian Institute for Politics (GIP), a prominent think-tank, prognosticated three possible developments: Georgian Dream steps up repressions and arrests, leading to 'Belarusization' of Georgia; Georgian Dream breaks under domestic and international pressure, and agrees to snap elections; and last, a compromise is reached, where Georgian Dream reverses its most controversial policies and meets protesters halfway. 'So far everything is up in the air and it is next to impossible to predict which of these scenarios is more likely to happen,' commented Kornely Kakachia, the director of GIP. 'What is certain is that the current situation cannot continue indefinitely.' Giorgi Lomsadze is a journalist based in Tbilisi, and author of Tamada Tales.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh_Lr4n4uf8L2	2025-01-08T15:48:49-08:00	
Romania Sets New Date For Presidential Polls After Vote Controver...	By Marian Chiriac The centrist and centre-left parties in Romania’s ruling coalition agreed on Wednesday to hold the country’s presidential election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. The date is later than initially expected, with analysts suggesting that the governing parties aim to use the additional time to identify and prepare a strong joint candidate to fight off a far-right challenge for the presidency. The ruling coalition, which brings together leftist Social Democrats (PSD), centrist National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), have agreed to support a single candidate in a unified effort to block a representative of the radical right from securing victory. Right-wing parties, which control around a third of the seats in parliament, together with the centrist, pro-EU Save Romania Union party, are not supporting the current government. This upcoming vote follows the unprecedented annulment of the previous presidential election by the Constitutional Court. The move came after Calin Georgescu, a populist politician known for his NATO-sceptic and pro-Russia stance, won the first round on November 24. His victory signalled that EU member Romania was joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. Georgescu’s surprise win led Romania’s top court, on December 3, to order a complete re-run of the election, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', probably referring to Russia. The Constitutional Court said it was annulling 'the entire electoral process concerning the election of the president of Romania', as the procedures for a free vote had not been upheld. Georgescu ran as an independent with little mainstream media coverage and a campaign focused almost exclusively on TikTok, yet he defied opinion polls to come out on top with 23 per cent of the vote. Had the court not annulled the vote, Georgescu would have contested a run-off with Elena Lasconi, leader of the centrist, pro-EU Save Romania Unity party. Had he won the presidency – which has oversight of foreign and defence policy – it would have thrown into doubt Romania’s continued support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and marked a significant shift in the country’s geopolitical trajectory. Georgescu is now contesting the Constitutional Court’s decision by taking legal action at the European Court of Human Rights, seeking to suspend the annulment and restore the process. He is demanding a second-round run-off election against his opponent, Elena Lasconi, claiming his right to free elections was violated. The situation has stirred up significant controversy in Romania, raising questions about electoral integrity and foreign influence in national politics.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh1NDSXleTGtb	2025-01-08T15:43:47-08:00	
Taliban Refute Trump’s Claims On US Financial Aid To Afghanistan	By Ayaz Gul Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday denied President-elect Donald Trump’s assertions that they have received billions of dollars in U.S. financial aid since regaining control of the country. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, responded to Trump’s claims by asserting that the Kabul administration neither anticipates nor seeks any assistance from the United States. 'In reality, the United States has not provided a single penny to the Islamic Emirate,' Fitrat stated, referring to Afghanistan’s official name under Taliban rule. 'Instead, it has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan.' The Taliban’s sharp response followed Trump’s news conference in Florida on Tuesday, when he was asked to comment on the alleged monthly payments of millions of dollars by the Biden administration to the de facto Afghan rulers. 'It’s not even believable. Billions of dollars, not millions — billions. We pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban Afghanistan,' Trump stated. 'This can’t be allowed to happen.' Fitrat claimed that the U.S. funds in question were primarily utilized for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the relocation and resettlement of their Afghan allies. 'A portion of this money may have also been used under the pretext of ‘humanitarian aid’ by international organizations. … [The] U.S. directed all this money to Afghanistan, primarily for its own interests, and now exploits it as propaganda against the Islamic Emirate,' the Taliban spokesperson alleged. The controversy surrounding provision of financial aid to the Taliban intensified following a Jan. 2 letter by Congressman Tim Burchett to President-elect Trump, which expressed concern over foreign aid being directed to the de facto Afghan authorities. 'These cash shipments are auctioned off, and after that, they are nearly impossible to track. This is how the Taliban is being funded and plans to fund terrorism around the world,' warned Burchett. 'The United States of America should not fund its enemies abroad.' He cited U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as having confirmed that non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan had paid nearly $10 million in foreign aid to the Taliban in taxes. The Taliban swept back to power in August 2021, prompting Washington and the West at large to suspend development aid to the country and effectively isolate the Afghan banking sector, freezing billions of dollars of central bank assets in the United States. The flow of humanitarian assistance, however, has primarily remained intact under the United Nations' supervision. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) refutes allegations that some of the funds it receives for humanitarian operations are being diverted to the Taliban. UNAMA has maintained that it transports cash into the country for the use of U.N. agencies and 'approved and vetted' humanitarian partners to assist millions of Afghans needing support. The mission has emphasized that all cash is deposited in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank before being distributed directly to the United Nations and other entities. It has also clarified that none of the cash brought into the country is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan or provided to de facto Taliban authorities by the U.N.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49ECh2ujYfenX-tt	2025-01-08T15:40:51-08:00	
Turkmenistan: First Conscientious Objector Punishment Since 2021 ...	By Felix Corley On 7 January, Mary Regional Court on appeal punished 21-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Arslan Wepayew with two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. Also, 51-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow is in poor health in a strict-regime labour camp. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate,' Forum 18 has been told. His family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored.' On 18 December 2024, the regime imposed a punishment on a conscientious objector to compulsory military service for the first known time since 2021, when 16 jailed conscientious objectors were freed under amnesty. On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed down the maximum two-year jail term to 21-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Arslan Wepayew, a court official told Forum 18. On 7 January 2025, a panel of three judges at Mary Regional Court heard Wepayew's appeal, a court official told Forum 18 the same day. In a decision announced the following day, the appeal court changed his sentence to two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. This is the maximum corrective labour punishment under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Wepayew has now been released from the detention centre (see below) Wepayew explained to the Military Conscription Office in writing his conscientious objection to serving in the military and his readiness to perform an alternative civilian service (see below). Wepayew's family have been concerned about his health. His mother was able to visit him in November 2024, soon after his arrest. 'She reported that he is in poor health, suffering from seizure-like attacks, unstable blood pressure, severe headaches, and stabbing chest pains,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18 (see below). 'We are deeply concerned about the treatment of this sincere believer and the violation of his human rights,' Jehovah's Witnesses noted. 'Wepayew's conscientious beliefs are central to his identity and actions. His detention, the charges, and the prison sentence, are in direct conflict with international human rights standards, including the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion' (see below). The 51-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow is in poor health in strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is one of five readers of the works of the late Muslim theologian Said Nursi jailed for 12 years in 2017. Three of the group are also held in the same labour camp (see below). 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' His family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored' (see below). When Forum 18 asked an official at Labour Camp MR-E/16 – who did not give his name – about Shamyradow's poor health, the official put the phone down (see below). The 42-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Bahram Saparow is also held in Labour Camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is being punished for leading a Muslim study group in the eastern city of Turkmenabat. The regime arrested and jailed more than 60 of the group's participants from 2013. At least three are known to have died in prison of torture or neglect. At least four others are known to have been freed after completing their sentences (see below). 'Bahram is in good condition,' an individual who knows him told Forum 18. He is being held in a cell with more than 10 other prisoners. A camera in the cell allows the prison administration to keep them 'under constant surveillance', the individual added. Prison staff do not stop prisoners praying visibly and they have a Koran also (see below). When relatives visit, the prisoner can talk to them only through a window with holes in to allow the sound through. No physical contact is allowed, even with a prisoner's wife. The prison administration records every meeting with relatives (see below). Forum 18 asked the office of the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa on 7 January who it could talk to about:- why the regime is again punishing a conscientious objector to military service;- why people are jailed as prisoners of conscience for exercising freedom of religion or belief; and- why prisoner of conscience Shamyradow and others are given inadequate health care, violating the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as the Mandela Rules – A/C.3/70/L.3). The official who answered the phone at the Ombudsperson's Office said she would find out and asked Forum 18 to call back. All subsequent calls went unanswered (see below). The person who answered the phone on 7 January of Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, put the phone down without saying anything. All subsequent calls went unanswered. No alternative to compulsory military service Turkmenistan offers no alternative to its compulsory military service. Military service for men between the ages of 18 and 27 is generally two years. Article 58 of the 2016 Constitution describes defence as a 'sacred duty' of everyone and states that military service is compulsory for men. Young men who refuse military service on grounds of conscience generally face prosecution under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. (Article 241 replaced the almost identically-worded Article 219 when the new Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2023.) Turkmenistan has ignored repeated international calls, for example by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, to introduce a genuine civilian alternative to compulsory military service, to stop prosecuting and punishing conscientious objectors, and to compensate those it has punished. The UN Human Rights Committee has published 14 Decisions in favour of 16 conscientious objectors from Turkmenistan, all of them Jehovah's Witnesses. The most recent – in March 2022 – was in the case of Arslan Begenchow (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in May 2020 on behalf of 19 then-current or former jailed conscientious objectors. Legally-binding international human rights obligations The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted that conscientious objection to military service comes under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 18 ('Freedom of thought, conscience and religion') and has recognised 'the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.' The OHCHR has also noted in its Conscientious Objection to Military Service guide that Article 18 is 'a non-derogable right .. even during times of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.' In 2022 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated (WGAD-HRC50) that 'the right to conscientious objection to military service is part of the absolutely protected right to hold a belief under article 18 (1) of the Covenant [the ICCPR], which cannot be restricted by States.' The Working Group also stated: 'States should refrain from imprisoning individuals solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service, and should release those that have been so imprisoned.' It added: 'All States should adopt appropriate legislative or other measures to ensure that conscientious objector status is recognized.' Court jails conscientious objector for two years Arslan Wepayew (born 7 February 2003) is a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector from Bayramaly, Mary Region, east of the capital Ashgabat. Jehovah's Witnesses are conscientious objectors to military service and do not undertake any kind of activity supporting any country's military. But they are willing to undertake an alternative, totally civilian form of service, as is the right of all conscientious objectors to military service under international human rights law. In October 2024, the Military Conscription Office ordered Wepayew to report for military service on 19 December 2024. On 17 October, he submitted a written statement of conscientious objection to military service 'based on sincere religious beliefs', Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. He made clear to the Military Conscription Office that he was prepared to undertake alternative civilian service. On 19 October, prosecutors opened a criminal case against Wepayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. Formal charges were laid on 31 October 2024, but prosecutors did not inform Wepayew. Officials took him into custody on 13 November. On 19 November, Wepayew's mother was able to visit him. 'She reported that he is in poor health, suffering from seizure-like attacks, unstable blood pressure, severe headaches, and stabbing chest pains', Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. Only on 27 November did the Prosecutor's Office give formal confirmation of the criminal case against Wepayew. At Wepayew's trial on 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed him the maximum two-year jail term under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'), a court official told Forum 18 on 7 January. The official refused to identify the judge in the case. Wepayew appealed against his conviction. Sentence changed to corrective labour On 7 January 2025, a panel of three judges at Mary Regional Court heard his appeal, a court official told Forum 18 the same day. In a decision announced the following day, the appeal court changed Wepayew's sentence to two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. This is the maximum corrective labour punishment under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service') Forum 18 is unaware of any previous cases where a conscientious objector's jail sentence was changed on appeal to corrective labour, However, from 2014 courts punished conscientious objectors with corrective labour or suspended prison terms, rather than imprisonment. However, jailings resumed in January 2018. In May 2021, the regime freed all the 16 then-jailed known conscientious objectors. Wepayew has now been released from the detention centre, where he had been held since November 2024. 'Wepayew's conscientious beliefs are central to his identity and actions' 'We are deeply concerned about the treatment of this sincere believer and the violation of his human rights,' Jehovah's Witnesses noted. 'Arslan Wepayew's conscientious beliefs are central to his identity and actions. His detention, the charges, and the prison sentence, are in direct conflict with international human rights standards, including the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion as guaranteed by Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Turkmenistan acceded on 1 May 1997.' This is the first known criminal conviction of a conscientious objector in Turkmenistan since May 2021, when the last 16 imprisoned conscientious objectors – all of them Jehovah's Witness young men - were released under a general amnesty. Forum 18 asked the office of the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa on 7 January who it could talk to about why the regime is again criminally convicting a conscientious objector to military service. The official who answered the phone said she would find out and asked Forum 18 to call back. All subsequent calls went unanswered. Gurbannazarowa's annual report for 2023 – her most recent available – makes no mention of any attempts to introduce an alternative civilian service for those who cannot serve in the military on grounds of conscience. UN Committee notes regime's failure to implement 2022 decision On 4 November 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed implementation of its March 2022 decision in the case of another former jailed Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector, Arslan Begenchow. The Committee had found that the regime had violated his human rights (CCPR/C/134/D/3272/2018). In February 2023, Begenchow's lawyer had noted that neither he nor Begenchow 'were aware of any steps taken by the State party to implement the Committee's Views'. The UN Committee's November 2024 progress report on individual communications (CCPR/C/142/2) reviewed how the regime had responded to the Committee's three key recommendations:- Expunging Begenchow's criminal record;- Providing Begenchow with adequate compensation, including by reimbursing any legal costs he has incurred;- Non-repetition, including by reviewing the legislation of the State party with a view to ensuring the effective guarantee of the right to conscientious objection under Article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 'for instance by providing for the possibility of alternative service of a civilian nature'. In all three provisions, the UN Committee found: 'Information or measures taken are contrary to or reflect rejection of the recommendation.' The Committee noted: 'One Expert noted there was no convincing evidence that the State party had contemplated compensation of any kind to [Begenchow].' The Committee decided: 'Close the follow-up dialogue, with a note of unsatisfactory implementation of the Committee's recommendation.' 'Almost paralysed' religious prisoner of conscience's care 'inadequate' Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow (born 7 May 1973) is one of five Sunni Muslims punished for meeting with others to pray and study their faith using the works of the late Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi. The authorities arrested the group in May and June 2017. On 15 August 2017, Balkan Regional Court in the regional capital Balkanabat in western Turkmenistan sentenced the five men to 12-year jail terms each in strict regime labour camps. The court ordered that religious literature, mobile phones and cash be seized from them. The Supreme Court in Ashgabat refused on 11 July 2018 to overturn the 12-year strict-regime jail terms imposed on the five prisoners of conscience. Four of the five - Shamyradow, Meret Hydyrowich Owezow, Ahmet Bayramberdiyewich Mammetdurdyyew and Begejik Begejikow – initially served their sentences in the isolated top-security prison at Ovadan-Depe (Picturesque Hill) in the Karakum desert 70 kms (45 miles) north of Ashgabat. They were transferred in mid-2022 to the strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 on the north-eastern edge of Bayramaly in Mary Region, where they remain. The fifth member of the group, Jumanazar Yuldashowich Hojambetow, is being held in the labour camp BL-E/6 in Balkan Region. The camp houses former police officers and other former officials. 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' In view of his poor health, Shamyradow's family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored,' the individual told Forum 18. The duty officer at Labour Camp MR-E/16 put Forum 18 through on 8 January to a colleague. When Forum 18 asked about Shamyradow's poor health, the official – who did not give his name – put the phone down. Forum 18 asked the office of the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa on 7 January who it who it could talk to about:- why the regime is again criminally convicting a conscientious objector to military service;- why people are jailed as prisoners of conscience for exercising freedom of religion or belief; and- why prisoner of conscience Shamyradow and others are given inadequate health care, violating the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as the Mandela Rules – A/C.3/70/L.3). The official who answered the phone at the Ombudsperson's Office said she would find out and asked Forum 18 to call back. All subsequent calls went unanswered. The address of Bayramaly Labour Camp is: Mary velayatBayramalyMR-E/16Turkmenistan Bayramaly Labour Camp: 'Rampant corruption and inhumane treatment' Prisoners, their relatives, and prison guards told Radio Liberty's Turkmen Service of 'rampant corruption and inhumane treatment' at strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. 'When necessary, prisoners are beaten and held in solitary confinement. Prisoners say they are deprived of protection and cannot express their grievances to anyone or anywhere,' an individual told Radio Liberty for the 11 June 2024 report. 'People deprived of their liberty say they are not treated as human beings in prisons, and that any prison guard is unofficially authorised to humiliate and beat prisoners,' another added. Relatives say they have to bribe prison staff to be allowed visits and to send food parcels. Prison staff often seize food parcels and sell them to other prisoners. Regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa's annual report for 2023 – her most recent available – mentions no inspections of conditions for prisoners at MR-E/16. It claims that an inspection of nearby labour camp MR-E/15 found that legal requirements for treating sick prisoners were 'generally observed'. It also claimed that conditions for 'religious practices' were in accordance with the law. It added that Gurbannazarowa had written to the Interior Ministry (which runs prisons) with recommendations on improving care. Jailed Muslim prisoner of conscience 'under constant surveillance' More than 60 Muslims from in and around the eastern city of Turkmenabat were imprisoned in 2013 and after to punish them for their involvement in a Muslim study group. The leader of the group, Bahram Jumanazarowich Saparow (born 31 May 1982), received his first 15-year sentence in May 2013, his second in July 2014 and his third in June 2016. Saparow was held for about the first year of his sentence in the labour camp in Tejen. He and at least several of the others sentenced with him were then transferred to the isolated top-security prison at Ovadan-Depe (Picturesque Hill) in the Karakum desert 70 kms (45 miles) north of Ashgabat. Saparow was transferred from Ovadan-Depe high security prison to the strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 at Bayramaly in Mary Region in 2021. He has been held there ever since. 'Bahram is in good condition,' an individual who knows him told Forum 18. He is being held in a cell with more than 10 other prisoners. A camera in the cell allows the prison administration to keep them 'under constant surveillance', the individual added. Prison staff do not stop prisoners praying visibly and they have a Koran also. Some of those held in Saparow's cell are hafizes (those who can recite the Koran by heart). Relatives have been able to hand over simple cooking equipment – including a hot plate and saucepan - for those in Saparow's cell. When they visit, relatives can bring parcels of any size, the individual noted. The prison administration allows inmates – including Saparow – visits from relatives once a month. However, the prisoner can talk to visitors only through a window with holes in to allow the sound through. No physical contact is allowed, even with a prisoner's wife. The prison administration records every meeting with relatives. Forum 18 asked the office of the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa on 7 January who it could talk to about why people are jailed as prisoners of conscience for exercising freedom of religion or belief. The official who answered the phone said she would find out and asked Forum 18 to call back. All subsequent calls went unanswered. How many of Turkmenabat Muslim group still held? Of the more than 60 Muslims from in and around Turkmenabat imprisoned in 2013 and after to punish them for their involvement in a Muslim study group, only four are known to have been freed. Ahmet Ergeshevich Mirzayev was released in late 2017 after completing his full five-year sentence. Atajan Imitjanovich Reyimow and Sultan Ahmetovich Bebitov were freed in summer 2022 after completing their full original prison terms and extra terms of five years added later. A fourth was freed some time after summer 2022. At least three of the group – all of them in their thirties - have died in prison. In its 27 March 2020 report to the UN Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/TKM/3), Turkmenistan admitted that two of the Muslims from Turkmenabat had died in prison. Lukman Yaylanov died in 2016, possibly as a result of torture, as did Narkuly Baltayev. Another of the Muslim prisoners, Aziz Gafurov, died in summer 2017. Gafurov's thin body was covered in bruises when returned to relatives. The regime's report to the UN mentions only the deaths of Yaylanov and Baltayev, two of the Muslims both born in 1980. It claimed that Baltayev had died in March 2016 – nine months after his conviction - 'of a chronic illness, as was confirmed in the findings of a forensic examination'. It insisted that he had not been subjected to torture. It similarly claimed that Yaylanov had died in October 2016 'of a chronic illness, as confirmed by the findings of a forensic examination'. It made no mention of why the two young men had been jailed. It also made no mention of Gafurov's death in prison.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfsGU8B49EChx4bg70trmc9	2025-01-08T15:37:48-08:00	
Realigning International Approaches To Myanmar’s Crisis: Supporti...	As Myanmar's struggle for democracy enters its fourth-year post-coup, it is crucial to reassess international diplomatic efforts to ensure they align with ground realities and the aspirations of the Myanmar people. While recent joint press statements from democratic nations reflect genuine concern, a more nuanced and proactive approach is needed to effectively support Myanmar's path to democratic transformation. Recognizing the Complexity of the Conflict The common diplomatic language urging 'all armed actors' to de-escalate violence unintentionally creates a false equivalence between the military junta and resistance forces. A more accurate framing would acknowledge that the People's Defense Forces (PDFs), Ethnic Revolutionary Organizations (EROs), and other resistance groups are primarily engaged in defending civilians against the junta's widespread atrocities. While emphasizing the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law, diplomatic language should reflect this crucial distinction. Amplifying the People's Mandate for Systemic Change It is vital to recognize that the people of Myanmar are striving for fundamental systemic change, not a return to the pre-coup status quo. Their aspirations include: Establishing genuine civilian control over the military Drafting a new constitution enshrining democratic principles and ethnic rights Ensuring accountability for human rights violations Implementing comprehensive security sector reform International statements and policies should reflect an understanding of and support for these deep-rooted desires for change. Reevaluating Regional and International Approaches While ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus was initiated with good intentions, its effectiveness has been limited. It may be time to consider a more robust framework that includes enforceable mechanisms for compliance and broader international support. This could involve: Enhancing engagement with multiple stakeholders, including the National Unity Government (NUG), ethnic political organizations, and civil society groups Implementing more targeted economic measures that impact military-owned enterprises while minimizing harm to the general population Providing diplomatic and material support to initiatives working towards democratic governance Addressing Root Causes and Humanitarian Needs While calls for humanitarian access remain crucial, they should be coupled with efforts to address the root causes of the crisis. Long-term solutions require tackling the underlying political and economic structures that perpetuate conflict and deprivation. Diplomatic Deterrence of Foreign Interference A critical aspect often overlooked in diplomatic statements is the need to deter foreign interference that goes against the will of the Myanmar people. This includes not only countries supporting the military junta but also lobbying efforts by international activists, particularly those advocating for the Rohingya, who may seek to isolate the NUG or EROs without fully considering the complex realities on the ground. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) 2024 report, for instance, has been criticized for potentially oversimplifying the situation and inadvertently contributing to the isolation of key actors in Myanmar's democratic struggle. There have been escalated efforts to isolate and disparage the Arakan Army (AA) in particular, a group that many in Myanmar hold in high esteem for their resistance against the military junta. These well-intentioned but potentially misguided efforts can complicate the path to a peaceful resolution and democratic transition in Myanmar. It is crucial for international actors to engage in a more nuanced understanding of the situation, recognizing the complexities of ethnic relations and the evolving political landscape in Myanmar. Conclusion: A Path Forward The courage and resilience demonstrated by the people of Myanmar in their pursuit of democracy deserve robust, principled support from the international community. By aligning diplomatic efforts more closely with the aspirations of Myanmar's diverse population and actively deterring harmful foreign interference, there is potential to foster a path towards lasting peace and genuine democratic transformation. As we move forward, it is crucial to recognize that sustainable solutions must address the fundamental issues that have long plagued Myanmar's political landscape. Only through supporting systemic change, as envisioned by the people of Myanmar, and safeguarding their right to self-determination free from external interference, can we hope to see the emergence of a truly democratic Myanmar where the military is subordinate to civilian rule and all ethnic nationalities enjoy equal rights and representation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf12TUo6Khsq2P	2025-01-07T17:18:15-08:00	
Keeping The Spotlight On Africa’s Child Soldiers – Analysis	By Naomi Haupt As violence and instability rise, African countries must reaffirm their commitment to protecting children and support DDR initiatives. Roughly 21 000 children have been recruited as soldiers by government forces and armed groups across Africa in the past five years. In 2020, around 337 million children lived within 50 km of active conflicts worldwide, with 118 million in Africa, where one in six risked being recruited. Africa’s youthful population (40% are under 16 years) has seen rising violence, particularly in the Sahel, where Islamist insurgencies are expanding. A 2021 United Nations (UN) report highlighted West and Central Africa as the regions with the highest verified child soldier recruitment from 2016-20. Globally, in 2021 alone, 6 310 children were drawn into conflict zones, with Africa accounting for 40% of the global child soldier population. And from 2005-22, over 105 000 children were documented as recruited by armed forces and non-state actors in conflict zones worldwide. Minors typically join armed groups through abduction or coercion – recruited as soldiers, lookouts, porters, spies, cooks or sex slaves. Girls are especially vulnerable, compelled to work as spies, cooks and fighters. Some are forced to marry combatants. In 2022, the UN Children’s Fund provided reintegration or protection support to nearly 12 500 former child soldiers and informed over nine million children about avoiding explosive remnants of war. It is estimated that over a billion US dollars were needed to meet the protection requirements of children in armed conflict by 2024, increasing to US$1.37 billion by 2026. The economic impact of using child soldiers significantly hampers national development. Missing out on schooling results in lost human capital and reduced productivity, contributing to long-term economic stagnation, decreased workforce participation, higher poverty rates, and reduced foreign investment due to ongoing instability. Countries also incur increased social service costs related to the healthcare and legal needs of former child soldiers, along with the social instability arising from reintegration challenges. Child recruitment by armed groups and government forces remains a major problem despite international commitments. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by 196 countries, and 173 have ratified the convention’s optional protocol that prohibits recruitment of children under 18 years into armed conflict. The economic impact of using child soldiers significantly hampers national development The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has taken steps to combat the problem by focusing on prevention, protection and reintegration. The ECOWAS Child Policy (2019-30) aims to prevent recruitment by promoting community awareness, legal reform, and tackling social and economic factors. ECOWAS stands out for its regional approach, its Child Protection Unit and comprehensive disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes. Other regions also implement robust DDR initiatives but face hurdles such as logistical and security challenges, often relying on international support. ECOWAS also promotes the enforcement of policies and laws, ensuring that violators face significant consequences. It has established monitoring and reporting mechanisms to collect data on child recruitment and hold perpetrators accountable. However, recent coups and the withdrawal of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from the regional bloc have weakened the Child Policy’s effectiveness. Over the past 20 years, there have been DDR programmes in over 30 countries globally – with about two-thirds of these in Africa. These programmes have provided access to education, vocational training and psychological support, enabling former child soldiers to reintegrate into their communities, reducing stigma and re-recruitment risks. Effective DDR is complex – requiring long-term funding and collaboration among governments, non-governmental organisations and international organisations. ECOWAS stands out for its regional approach, Child Protection Unit and comprehensive DDR programmes ECOWAS promotes community-based reintegration that engages local leaders, schools and civil society to ensure former youth fighters are accepted and supported. This involvement is crucial for fostering social cohesion and stability. But ongoing challenges include financial constraints, political instability and cultural norms, which can reinforce child recruitment. Specialised care for trauma and mental health is limited, with few programmes offering combined education, vocational training and mental health support. A lack of accurate data hampers the monitoring and evaluation of DDR programmes. Corruption also undermines child protection, diverting resources from essential services and eroding public trust, which deters communities from reporting abuses. In such environments, legal accountability is weak, allowing child exploitation to go unpunished. To safeguard children, child protection systems must be strengthened at all levels of government and society. National laws prohibiting the recruitment of child soldiers must be prioritised across Africa. High-risk countries must provide comprehensive services for former youth fighters, and help local communities to effectively reintegrate former child soldiers and prevent their re-enlistment. UN Security Council decisions on the issue should be reinvigorated to pressure member states to take greater proactive action. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s conviction by the International Criminal Court for using child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows how the international legal system can help curb the problem.

Critical Minerals, Waning Western Influence A Focus Of Chinese FM...	By Kate Bartlett Critical minerals and oil, a renewed focus on the Atlantic coast, and the West’s loss of influence in the Sahel are some of the reasons analysts believe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has chosen the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Chad and Namibia as the stops on his visit to Africa this week. For decades it has been tradition that Beijing’s top diplomat makes his first foreign foray of the year to the African continent, and each time experts try to analyse the reasons behind the specific itinerary. 'It’s always a mix of big states and small ones. The main point of all of this is to show that China is a non-discriminatory partner; that it doesn’t have 'important countries,’ the way Western powers would tend to cherry pick,' Cobus van Staden, an editor at the China Global South Project, told VOA in a WhatsApp voice message. During his first stop in Namibia on Monday, Wang said the 35-year-old tradition of starting the year with an Africa trip shows the world that 'China remains Africa’s most reliable friend' and its 'strongest supporter…on the global stage,' Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Namibia and minerals Namibia is Wang’s southern African pit-stop this year. The country 'is China’s major maritime partner on Africa’s Atlantic seaboard, where the largest concentration of China’s port developments are located,' Paul Nantulya, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., told VOA. Van Staden echoed this, noting that 'the last year or two there seems to have been an emphasis on the Indian Ocean, this year they seem to be rebalancing towards the Atlantic.' Namibia is also rich in uranium and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and manganese. Namibia’s president, Nangolo Mbumba, said at his meeting with Wang this week that Chinese investment 'continues to play a significant role in developing Namibia’s uranium sector as one of the biggest global uranium producers.' Mbumba and Wang also spoke about Chinese investments in infrastructure such as a planned desalination plant. Chinese companies are also starting to build Namibia’s largest solar power plant this year. Republic of Congo and oil After Namibia, Wang heads next to the Republic of Congo, another Atlantic seaboard country and the incoming African co-chair of the Forum for China Africa Cooperation or FOCAC. The country, which is next to mineral-rich Congo, has untapped mineral deposits, but its economy is mainly based around oil, which accounts for some 80 percent of its exports, according to the World Bank. Van Staden said 'the diversification of Chinese oil imports' could be part of the reason for Wang’s visit to the country, as well as to the other two oil producers on the agenda: Chad and Nigeria. 'The Republic of Congo used to be a big oil exporter to China, but over the years China’s diversified its oil supplies,' he said. However, the Republic of Congo is trying to increase production and last year Cogo, the Congolese subsidiary of China Oil Natural Gas Overseas, announced a $150 million investment in two oil fields there. A Chinese company also holds a controversial permit to conduct oil exploration near a national park. In a September meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso in Beijing last year, the Chinese foreign ministry readout stated, 'China supports the Republic of the Congo in developing a diversified economy, and encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in the construction of major infrastructure and regional connectivity projects in the country.' Over the years, China and its companies have been investing in major infrastructure projects in the Republic of Congo, building roads and modernizing the airport. It has gifted the country a new parliament building and construction is set to begin on a $9 billion hydropower dam this month. Chad and security Another country Wang will visit this week is Chad, the Central African nation that saw relations with Bejing elevated to a 'strategic partnership' during last year’s FOCAC. 'Chad and its immediate neighbors play a key role in China’s effort to secure global supply chains of critical minerals in the high-tech and clean energy sectors, including the EV industry which China dominates so far,' said Nantulya. Situated in the volatile Sahel region, which has seen a spate of coups in recent years, oil-rich Chad has been under military rule since a 2021 putsch. Chad is also one of several regional countries that have asked troops belonging to former colonial power France to leave amid rising anti-French sentiment. In December, Chad ordered France to withdraw about 1,000 troops from the country, where it had long been helping to fight jihadist insurgents. The void left by the West could be China’s gain, analysts said. 'It is the fifth former African French colony to remove French forces from its territory,' said Nantulya of Chad. 'China has been showing great interest in ramping up its strategic security engagements with these countries as seen by the sharp increase in Chinese military engagement in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal in particular, as well as Ivory Coast.' Nigeria and trade Analysts say one of the more obvious stops on Wang’s 2025 tour is Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and one of its biggest economies. Cliff Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg, said trade would be a major item on the agenda. 'Looking at Nigeria, one of the issues that also came out strongly during the last FOCAC was market access for African products into China, and Nigeria was one of the leading countries pushing for this idea,' he told VOA. 'So that will feature more prominently during Wang Yi’s visit to Nigeria.' Security is also a factor, said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. 'If you also look at the things that bind Nigeria and Chad together, one of them is the counter insurgency operations that both countries have been involved in for a while now,' he told VOA. 'Maybe the Chinese foreign affairs minister is also going to talk about security partnerships.' Filling the void Ojewale added that the stops on Wang’s trip can also be seen through the lens of regional geopolitical competition. 'Where the Western alliance and establishment have vacated in Africa, we’re seeing in equal proportion China or Russia in particular occupying those places — supplanting the Western alliance,' he said. And while such trips happen every year, Van Staden said this year’s trip is especially significant given that on Jan. 20th the U.S. will see a change of government when president-elect Donald Trump starts his 2nd term in office. 'I think the main message that [the Chinese are] trying to send is that they’re a constant partner, that they’re not fickle,' he said. 'This message is of course reinforced right ahead of the Trump inauguration, you know, where a lot of people expect a low level of interest in Washington in relation to Africa.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf17J1C6BVB_gm	2025-01-07T16:42:12-08:00	
How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Asia’s Economies – Analys...	Asia-Pacific’s economies are likely to experience labor market shifts because of artificial intelligence, with advanced economies being affected more. About half of all jobs in the region’s advanced economies are exposed to AI, compared to only about a quarter in emerging market and developing economies. However, as we show in our latest Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook, there are also more jobs in the region’s advanced economies that can be complemented by AI, meaning that the technology will likely enhance productivity rather than replace these roles altogether. The concentration of such jobs in Asia’s advanced economies could worsen inequality between countries over time. While about 40 percent of jobs in Singapore are rated as highly complementary to AI, the share is just 3 percent in Laos. AI could also increase inequality within countries. Most workers at risk of displacement in the Asia-Pacific region work in service, sales, and clerical support roles. Meanwhile, workers who are more likely to benefit from AI typically work in managerial, professional, and technician roles that already tend to be among the better paid professions. As the Chart of the Week shows, we also find that women are more likely to be at risk of disruption from AI because they are more often in service, sales, and clerical roles. Men, by contrast, are more represented in occupations that are unlikely to be impacted by AI at this stage, like farm workers, machine operators, and low-skill elementary workers. How could policymakers address the threat of worsening inequality? First, effective social safety nets combined with reskilling programs for affected workers will be critical to achieve an inclusive AI transition. Second, education and training to help the workforce leverage what AI makes possible will be especially relevant in Asia’s emerging economies, given that they have relatively few jobs in which AI could make workers more productive. It will also help displaced workers transition to new roles and support research and development that enhances innovation. In addition, governments should set regulations that promote ethical AI use and data protection. Doing so can mitigate the risks of AI-induced disruptions and better capitalize on the opportunities for economic growth and improved productivity. —This article is based on Box 1 of the analytical note included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. For more on AI and jobs, see IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva’s blog on labor market implications and the Chart of the Week showing which economies are better equipped for AI adoption.

Europe Isn’t The Real Threat To Ukraine Peace But UK – OpEd	The Biden Administration has not given up on Ukraine war. A meeting of the Ramstein Format Meeting is scheduled to take place in Germany on Thursday, chaired by the outgoing US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, to address Ukraine’s defence needs, which the Ukrainian President Zelensky will also address. Meanwhile, Kiev launched an attack in the Kursk region on the eve of the Ramstein Format event as the 'curtain-raiser'. The operation, although played up in the British press, is spearheaded by just 2 tanks and fifteen armoured carriers and will no doubt be crushed by the Russian drones and its highly lethal Ka high-performance combat helicopters with day and night capability, high survivability and fire power. Typically, Zelensky won’t give up on any occasion for grandstanding in front of Western audience. He hopes to display on Thursday that there is still some spunk left in the Ukrainian armed forces. Tragically, he is sacrificing a few dozen Ukrainian soldiers in this melodrama which may distract some attention from the front-line as Russian forces have entered Chasiv Yar and reached the suburbs of Pokrovsk in an operation to surround that city. With the fall of Chasiv Yar and Pokorovsk, the Battle of Donbass is nearing home stretch. It sets the stage for a massive Russian push to the Dnieper River if the Kremlin is left with no other option but to end the war on its terms. (See a recent article on the future map of Ukraine by the top Moscow strategic analyst Dmitry Trenin titled What Ukraine should look like after Russia’s victory.) Indeed, the hopes of Donald Trump bringing the war to an end in the first day of his presidency on January 20 have withered away. The Ramstein meeting is a defiant act by Zelensky and his European associates, as Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon. On December 18, Zelensky met in Brussels with NATO chief Mark Rutte and huddled with several European leaders to discuss war strategy. His European interlocutors are also seeking to develop their own plans if Trump, who has pledged to bring a swift end to the war, pulls the plug on the Kiev regime or forces it to make concessions. The key topic of the Brussels meeting was security guarantees, Zelensky’s office said. Zelensky highlighted his 'detailed one-on-one discussion' with French President Emmanuel Macron that focused on priorities to further strengthen Ukraine’s position 'regarding the presence of forces in Ukraine that could contribute to stabilising the path to peace.' Prior to the Brussels meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters that the priority was to secure the 'sovereignty of Ukraine and that it will not be forced to submit to a dictated peace.' But, he cautioned, any discussion of boots on the ground would be premature. Rutte himself counselled that Kiev’s allies should focus on ramping up arms supplies to ensure Ukraine is in a position of strength. Rutte estimated that Ukraine needs 19 additional air-defence systems to protect the country’s energy infrastructure. Interestingly, Rutte announced that the proposed new NATO command in the German city of Wiesbaden is now 'up and running' which will henceforth coordinate Western military aid for Ukraine as well as provide training for Ukraine’s military. Trump is unlikely to preserve the Ramstein Format. Simply put, Europe, including the U.K., lack the capacity to replace the US military assistance to Ukraine. For the EU to replace the US, it would need to double its military aid to Ukraine. But the current political situation in Europe, along with the real military capabilities of individual European countries, makes this an impossible objective. (See an analysis, here, by Samantha de Bendern at the Chatham House.) Germany, Europe’s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Scholz-led coalition. Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine, has lost control over France’s domestic politics since the June parliamentary elections, where he lost his majority. Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right and far left, with pro-Russian sympathies, are rising. Europeans are running around like headless chicken. The surprise visit of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to Florida to meet Trump and watch a movie with him at this critical juncture of the Ukraine war shows that the smart lady has no confidence in the likes of Macron. Meloni has a warm equation with Trump’s close aide Elon Musk and is seeking to strengthen business ties with the US. 'This is very exciting. I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy,' Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd and added expansively, 'She’s really taken Europe by storm.' Italy, an important NATO power that overlooks the Mediterranean is a vociferous supporter of trans-atlanticism, and pursues a nuanced policy on the Ukraine war that may be of use to Trump to build bridges with Europe. Meloni is positioning herself. Italy resolutely condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s subsequent involvement in Eastern Ukraine and joined the EU sanctions against Russia. It demonstrated its military support for Ukraine with significant military aid packages within the framework of an agreement on security cooperation (under previous government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi). That said, Rome has often sought to balance EU responses with its national interests towards Russia. Thus, Meloni’s foreign minister reaffirmed recently, even as Biden authorised Ukraine to deploy long-range American missiles against military targets inside Russia, 'Our position on Ukraine’s use of (Italian) weapons has not changed. They can only be used within Ukrainian territory.' In the final analysis, it is the course of the war that will decide the terms of peace in Ukraine. Europe’s swing toward right-wing governments — Austria is the latest example — may help Russia. However, the crux of the matter is that so long as the spy agencies of Britain and US work in tandem to manipulate the governments in power in White Hall — Labour and Conservative alike — the Trump administration has a serious problem on its hands. Of course, Trump is well aware of the UK’s pivotal role in hatching the 'Russia collusion' plot, which hobbled his presidency. Downsizing Britain’s role can be a game changer for peace in Ukraine. But the MI6’s capacity to influence the Kiev regime is not to be underestimated. Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson played a seminal role in torpedoing the Russia-Ukraine deal negotiated at the peace talks hosted by Turkey in March-April 2022 just weeks into the conflict. Even if Trump strikes a deal with Putin, which in itself is highly problematic as things stand, London is sure to undermine it one way or another at the first available opportunity, given its Russophobic obsession with inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia. Possibly, Trump is savouring Elon Musk’s relentless assault on the British government. 'America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,' Musk wrote on X. But British politicians have the skin of rhino. Sir Keir Starmer is giving as good as he gets. Trump’s challenge lies in mothballing the special relationship with the UK.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf15l7ON-xCkAw	2025-01-07T16:38:15-08:00	
Joe Biden: America’s Worst President? – OpEd	US President Joe Biden had the opportunity to leave a positive impact on America and the world. Unfortunately he was not made of the same stuff as Jimmy Carter. As the clock runs down on Biden's presidency, independent analysis has emerged to examine his record of office, his achievements and failures. One way of assessing Biden's impact is through American feedback following his attempt to run for another term of office. He was rejected by large segments of the American citizenry as unworthy of being reelected. This judgement was not only because of his cognitive decline visible to all, including the most die-hard Democratic party supporters. It was also because of his failure to build a better future for Americans which, in turn, could have had positive ripple effects on the rest of the world. What Biden will be most remembered for by non-Americans around the world is his handling of the war in Gaza. Biden: 'I am a Zionist' In Gaza. and its spillover war in Lebanon, a largely innocent population continues to be subject to the horrors of war beyond anyone’s imagination. Journalists, doctors and nurses, United Nations and neutral NGO workers and volunteers have also been victims of Israel’s killing spree, leading UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk to say in a statement that 'this unprecedented level of killing, and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law'. Biden and his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, have not only been complicit in the illegal and genocidal war in Gaza by providing Israel with unconditional diplomatic and military support for a scorched earth policy. They have also refused to use the clout of the US to bring about a peace settlement. What the world has seen from Biden and Blinken has been pretense, hypocrisy and double talk to give the impression that they have objected to Israeli military action aimed at the collective punishment of the Palestinians. And that they are opposed to the atrocities taking place on a daily basis. The reality has been different. As president, Biden provided Netanyahu with protection and impunity from any international punishment. He has also been responsible for channelling enormous amounts of weaponry and military assistance without which Israel would find it impossible to engage in a prolonged war. It is US influence and pressure that can push Israel to accept a Palestinian state - the primary concern of the Palestinian population and most countries of the world, including in Asia. It is an objective that Biden claims he is in favour of but which his actions indicate to the contrary. According to the Costs of War project at Brown University, the United States provided $17.9 billion in military aid to Israel from October 2023 to October 2024, a record for a single year. Western media reports on this have conveniently omitted to point out that most of this military assistance money has gone back to American companies that make weapons and military equipment for the wars which the US and its proxies have instigated and sustained since the last world war. Not to be forgotten is that a year after the initial Hamas provocative attack, and immediately following Israel's horrific rocket attack on a Gaza strip hospital that killed hundreds of medical staff, patients and visitors, Biden traveled halfway around the world to Tel Aviv to meet with Netanyahu and reiterate his unwavering support for Israel. His supplicatory action and words on the hospital attack carnage serves as a reminder of Biden's moral failings and void when it comes to non American and non Israeli lives. 'I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.' How Will History Remember Biden’s Presidency As President, Biden has tried to impress on Americans that he is a man of peace, decency, integrity and honour. However many will remember him as a war merchant extraordinary and a leader woefully deficient in the positive character attributes that his media machine has advertised. There are two other ways to remember Joe Biden, the 44th US president. One is his recent flip flop after repeatedly pronouncing that he would not stand in the way of his son's conviction on tax and gun charges. The full and unconditional presidential pardon he granted for crimes that Hunter Biden committed between January 1, 2014 and December 1, 2024 is unprecedented in US judicial history as it covers offences committed well before Biden's term of office began. It has left an indelible stain on Biden's honor and integrity, and provided critics with ammunition to refute Biden's claim that he has advanced effective and accountable justice and democracy in America. The other way to remember Biden's place in history is by the outpouring of tributes and eulogies from Americans and non-Americans remembering Jimmy Carter following his death. The influential Arab media leader, Arab News, had this commendation: 'The Palestinian people have this week lost one of the most outspoken champions of their cause. Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the US, died on Sunday at the age of 100. Carter will be remembered as a man of integrity and courage. His readiness to move away from the more orthodox foreign policy line adopted by both Democrats and Republicans back in the 1970s over the Arab-Israeli conflict triggered fundamental shifts in how the world later approached that conflict, with the plight of the Palestinians as its core. 'Carter’s life embodied the American dream, while transcending it through his dedication to global service. His one term as president (1977-1981), even though he was often criticized during his tenure, yielded lasting diplomatic triumphs, most notably the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt — an achievement that earned him respect as a peacemaker long after he left office. …. 'His 2002 Nobel Peace Prize recognized his diplomatic achievements and his lifelong dedication to advancing human dignity and peace. Throughout his life, Carter maintained a reputation for integrity that stood as a beacon in American public life. His plainspoken manner and modest lifestyle reflected his belief that true greatness lies in serving others. Even as he faced criticism for his political positions, few questioned his sincerity or commitment to his principles.' Biden had the opportunity to leave a similar positive impact on America and the world. Unfortunately he was not made of the same stuff as Jimmy Carter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1x2gyrfXWndR	2025-01-07T16:36:20-08:00	
The Cost Of Facebook’s Now-Repudiated Censorship – OpEd	History will remember this era as the moment when America’s most sacred principles collided with unprecedented institutional power – and lost. The systematic dismantling of fundamental rights didn’t happen through military force or executive decree, but through the quiet cooperation of tech platforms, media gatekeepers, and government agencies, all claiming to protect us from 'misinformation.' Meta’s sudden dismantling of its fact-checking program – announced by Zuckerberg as a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech' – reads like a quiet footnote to what history may record as one of the most staggering violations of fundamental rights in recent memory. After eight years of increasingly aggressive content moderation, including nearly 100 fact-checking organizations operating in over 60 languages, Meta is now pivoting to a community-driven system similar to X’s model. In his announcement, Zuckerberg first suggests that the censorship was purely a technical mistake, and then changes his tune near the end and admits what has long been litigated: 'The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government. And that’s why it’s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship. By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further.' In many court cases costing millions, involving vast FOIA requests, depositions, and discoveries, the truth of this has been documented in 100,000 pages of evidence. The Murthy v. Missouri case alone uncovered substantial communications through FOIA and depositions, revealing the depth of government coordination with social media platforms. The Supreme Court considered it all but several justices simply could not comprehend the substance and scale, and thus reversed a lower court injunction to stop it all. Now we have Zuckerberg openly admitting precisely what was in dispute: the US government’s involvement in aggressive violation of the First Amendment. This should, at least, make it easier to find redress as the cases proceed. Still, it is frustrating. Tens of millions have been spent to prove what he could have admitted years ago. But back then, the censors were still in charge, and Facebook was guarding its relationship with the powers that be. The timing of the shift is telling: a Trump ally joining the board, Meta’s president of global affairs being replaced by a prominent Republican, and a new administration preparing to take control. But while Zuckerberg frames this as a return to free speech principles, the damage of their experiment in mass censorship can’t be undone with a simple policy change. The irony runs deep: private companies claiming independence while acting as extensions of state power. Consider our own experience: posting Mussolini’s definition of fascism as 'the merger of state and corporate power' – only to have Meta remove it as 'misinformation.' This wasn’t just censorship; it was meta-censorship – silencing discussion about the very mechanisms of control being deployed. While tech platforms maintained the facade of private enterprise, their synchronized actions with government agencies revealed a more troubling reality: the emergence of exactly the kind of state-corporate fusion they were trying to prevent us from discussing. As we’ve covered before, we didn’t just cross lines – we crossed sacred Rubicons created after humanity’s darkest chapters. The First Amendment, born from revolution against tyranny, and the Nuremberg Code, established after World War II’s horrors, were meant to be unbreakable guardians of human rights. Both were systematically dismantled in the name of 'safety.' The same tactics of misinformation, fear, and government overreach that our ancestors warned against were deployed with frightening efficiency. This systematic dismantling left no topic untouched: from discussions of vaccine effects to debates about virus origins to questions about mandate policies. Scientific discourse was replaced with approved narratives. Medical researchers couldn’t share findings that diverged from institutional positions, as seen in the removal of credible discussions of Covid-19 data and policy. Even personal experiences were labeled 'misinformation' if they didn’t align with official messaging – a pattern that reached absurd heights when even discussing the nature of censorship itself became grounds for censorship. The damage rippled through every layer of society. At the individual level, careers were destroyed and professional licenses revoked simply for sharing genuine experiences. Scientists and doctors who questioned prevailing narratives found themselves professionally ostracized. Many were made to feel isolated or irrational for trusting their own eyes and experiences when platforms labeled their firsthand accounts as 'misinformation.' The destruction of family bonds may prove even more lasting. Holiday tables emptied. Grandparents missed irreplaceable moments with grandchildren. Siblings who had been close for decades stopped speaking. Years of family connections shattered not over disagreements about facts, but over the very right to discuss them. Perhaps most insidious was the community-level damage. Local groups splintered. Neighbors turned against neighbors. Small businesses faced blacklisting. Churches divided. School board meetings devolved into battlegrounds. The social fabric that enables civil society began unraveling – not because people held different views, but because the very possibility of dialogue was deemed dangerous. The censors won. They showed that with enough institutional power, they could break apart the social fabric that makes free discourse possible. Now that this infrastructure for suppression exists, it stands ready to be deployed again for whatever cause seems urgent enough. The absence of a public reckoning sends a chilling message: there is no line that cannot be crossed, no principle that cannot be ignored. True reconciliation demands more than Meta’s casual policy reversal. We need a full, transparent investigation documenting every instance of censorship – from suppressed vaccine injury reports to blocked scientific debates about virus origins to silenced voices questioning mandate policies. This isn’t about vindication – it’s about creating an unassailable public record ensuring these tactics can never be deployed again. Our Constitution’s First Amendment wasn’t a suggestion – it was a sacred covenant written in the blood of those who fought tyranny. Its principles aren’t outdated relics but vital protections against the very overreach we just witnessed. When institutions treat these foundational rights as flexible guidelines rather than inviolable boundaries, the damage ripples far beyond any single platform or policy. Like many in our circles, we witnessed this firsthand. But personal vindication isn’t the goal. Every voice silenced, every debate suppressed, every relationship fractured in service of 'approved narratives' represents a tear in our social fabric that makes us all poorer. Without a full accounting and concrete safeguards against future overreach, we’re leaving future generations vulnerable to the same autocratic impulses wearing different masks. The question isn’t whether we can restore what was lost – we can’t. The question is whether we’ll finally recognize these rights as truly inviolable, or continue treating them as inconvenient obstacles to be swept aside whenever fear and urgency demand it. Benjamin Franklin warned that those who would surrender essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Our answer to this challenge will determine whether we leave our children a society that defends essential liberties or one that casually discards them in the name of safety. Here is the full transcript of Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement, January 7, 2024: Hey, everyone. I wanna talk about something important today because it’s time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown 5 years ago about the importance of protecting free expression, and I still believe this today. But a lot has happened over the last several years. There’s been widespread debate about potential harms from online content, governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there’s also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously and I wanna make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content, but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes. Even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts, that’s millions of people. And we’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech. So we’re gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, here’s what we’re gonna do. First, we’re gonna get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the US. So over the next couple of months, we’re gonna phase in a more comprehensive community note system. Second, we’re gonna simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far. So I wanna make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms. Third, we’re changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms. We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now we’re gonna focus those filters on tackling illegal and high severity violations. And for lower severity violations, we’re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action. The problem is that the filters make mistakes and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn’t. So by dialing them back, we’re gonna dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms. We’re also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content. The reality is that this is a trade-off. It means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff, but we’ll also reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down. Fourth, we’re bringing back civic content. For a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed. So we stopped recommending these posts, but it feels like we’re in a new era now and we’re starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again. So we’re gonna start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. Fifth, Fifth, we’re gonna move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California and our US-based content review is going to be based in Texas. As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams. Finally, we’re gonna work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world. Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there. Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down. China has censored our apps from even working in the country. The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government. And that’s why it’s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship. By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further. But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take it. It’ll take time to get this right. And these are complex systems. They’re never gonna be perfect. There’s also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove. But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content, it is time to focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our systems, and getting back to our roots about giving people voice. I’m looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there and more to come soon.' About the authors: Joshua Stylman has been an entrepreneur and investor for over 30 years.

Ireland And The Housing Crisis – OpEd	By Sergio Fernández Redondo The recent general election in Ireland has left a rather divided political scenario wherein no party has reached the required majority to form government. While the pertinent talks and negotiations to make a coalition take place, voters gaze on helplessly and ponder what kinds of policies their votes will eventually enable. Amid the whole spectacle, special attention is given to proposed policies for housing, given the current crisis the sector is experiencing. Not without reason, since this is one of the main concerns in Ireland at present. Soaring prices have made accommodation unfeasible for most young (and not-so-young) people, be it rented, purchased or built. And the cries for so-called 'fair prices,' both from voters and politicians, evidence a lack of understanding of what a price is. Perhaps still crippled by the labor theory of value and its derivations, some tend to think of a price as an a priori characteristic of an asset that depends on the work necessitated for its manufacture. (Surely, a house now is the same as a house five years ago, and they should cost the same.) In reality, a price is a signal that informs us of the scarcity or abundance of an asset. Simply put, if prices go down, that informs us that there is a greater abundance of that asset and/or less demand for that asset (all things being equal). Likewise, when prices go up, there is a scarcity and/or increased demand and resources should be attracted to produce that asset, which would likewise tend to push prices down. Imposing a price on a good by legislation which is artificially below its actual market value always involves someone else paying for the difference, as well as misallocation of resources and consequent scarcity. Essentially it all comes down to the basic supply and demand curve, and there are multiple reasons why demand is skyrocketing whilst supply is somewhat stagnant. Cultural shift plays an undeniable role; as the Irish institution of the traditional family is gradually eroded, more people need to be housed individually. Still, on the cultural note, there seems to be an underlying popular animosity towards owners who have the vision to adapt their rented properties to meet increased demand ('slum landlord' is a moniker I heard frequently in Dublin). This is hardly a clever strategy at a time when we need more creative entrepreneurs to bring new ideas into the market. The government’s peculiar policy of state-subsidizing hotels to host refugees is also creating a shortage of tourist accommodation that drives many private properties to fill in that niche, shifting houses from the long-term rental market to the more profitable short-term tourist one. Rent caps always cripple the rate of entry of new properties into the rental market. The most defining factor, however, is the dramatic demographic surge that Ireland is experiencing recently, with a net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) of some 80,000 people over the last year alone and between 40,000 and 50,000 annually over the previous years (with a population of over five million). These are trends that the government expects to maintain or even increase. Immigration as a method of population increase normally entails more commotion than the natural method of natality, where people join the market in a more gradual and organized manner, and they can rely on support from their families. This ever-tense market rendered recent interest rate hikes ineffectual (whereas their effect was felt in other countries) and it does not offer much hope of stabilization any time soon. To maintain somewhat stable prices we need to either try to reduce soaring demand for houses or match it with an increased supply. The Irish government seems hellbent on continuing inflating artificially that demand by importing legions of new entrants in the market (the reasons I leave for others to elucidate), so the solution has to come from the other side. Ireland will, therefore, have to up her game and propitiate construction of new homes, both from individuals and property developers. As anyone who has tried to build a house in Ireland will know, however, the sheer number of regulations one must comply with and strict planning permission rules, coupled with rising building costs due to price inflation, taxation, and other nefarious measures (like green policies or minimum wage), makes this endeavor nigh unattainable for the majority. Not to mention the irrational phobia of regulators against affordable alternatives like timber houses. As a Spaniard living in Ireland, one of the things that first strikes me when I go back home is the imposing urban architecture of Spanish towns and cities. After gently strolling through the streets of Dublin or Cork—with their Georgian houses of no more than three or four stories, terraced houses and housing estates—I feel overwhelmed by the towering blocks of flats that constitute the backbone of Spanish urban architecture. Spain underwent a rapid industrial and economic development in the 1960s that necessitated a quick turnaround of new and affordable accommodation for the multitudes of rural dwellers seeking better opportunities in towns. And so, aesthetics were sacrificed for the sake of functionality, and unsightly apartments gradually replaced traditional dwellings throughout most of the national geography. Much as I abhor these brutalist monstrosities, they are one of the main reasons why—compared to Ireland—housing accommodations in Spain has managed to remain more or less affordable throughout the ups and downs of crises, recessions, property bubbles, and other vicissitudes (bar high-pressure zones in some big cities). Rapidly-growing cities invariably have to start growing vertically rather than laterally at some point. If Irish people want the population of their country to continue increasing inordinately—much to my chagrin—traditional quaint architecture will have to yield to more functional and economic flats. In any event, Irish people need to be given freedom to resolve their housing issues without coercion. The market should be deregulated and money being given back to them by tax cutting. A freer environment and less government intervention would propitiate new houses built where and when needed by developers, new properties entering the rental market, and many more people being able to afford building their own house on their own terms. The calls from Sinn Féin and other luminaries for public housing and government plans to deliver houses are nothing short of a bad joke. Pretending that the government—the main culprit of our current predicament—should intervene to solve the very problem they initially created bespeaks an unfathomable level of naivety in the best case, or malevolence in the worst. Obliterating the hotel industry, while penalizing Airbnb lettings, or pushing up the cost of self-building with relentless regulations and taxes while prohibiting inexpensive alternatives provided by the market, are but a mere sample of the kind of ignominy we can expect from the political class. No, Ireland does not need more state intervention to tackle this crisis; they have had enough of it. What they need is more liberty and respect for private property rights and less public intervention in societal affairs.

New Orleans Attack: ISIS’s Lone Wolf Terror May Take An Alarming ...	By Srijan Sharma Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old United States Army veteran, crashed a Ford F-150 pickup truck into a crowd of New Orleans residents celebrating New Year’s Day. He then exited the vehicle and opened fire on the crowd, killing 15 people and injuring 30 more. This kind of lone wolf attack on US soil came after almost eight quiet years — the last similar incident was the October 31, 2017, New York City truck attack, which killed eight people and injured another 12. The ISIS terror group took responsibility for the latter. However, in 2025, the terror dynamics have changed. This recent attack perhaps has indicated a dangerous shift in ISIS’s striking patterns. ISIS lone wolf attacks ISIS has a classic pair of striking patterns: Suicide bombings and lone-wolf attacks. The former has been the most frequent type since January 2024, as it was used in the January 3 bombings in Kerman, Iran, and the March 22 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow, Russia. ISIS has used high-intensity bombings ever since their capabilities began dwindling. The last reported lone wolf attack in a metropolitan city took place last year in Solingen, Germany, where a Syrian ISIS member stabbed three men during a festival. Similarly, two lone wolf attacks took place on October 16 and December 2, 2023 in Brussels, Belgium and Paris, France, respectively. The assessment shows ISIS was not able to execute a deadly lone wolf attack in the West as it did in Nice, France on July 14, 2016, when a truck rammed a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring 434 more. Most ISIS strikes have been recorded in Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East; these have mostly been suicide bombings or coordinated mass shootings. ISIS attacks in Western countries were fewer and limited to stabbing incidents; these can be viewed as multiple attempts to execute a lone wolf attack or coordinated lone wolf attacks on a large scale, like they did in Paris in the November 13, 2015 strike and Nice in the aforementioned 2016 attack. Capabilities are limited, but resurgence is possible Since 2017, ISIS’s capabilities started declining after the US intensified its counterterror operations. The nation’s ongoing Operation Inherent Resolve has led to some notable success against ISIS, causing the group’s terrorist presence to dip substantially from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, ISIS was defeated in Syria and Libya. That October, US forces killed ISIS Chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Operation Kayla Mueller. In 2023, the US killed several senior leaders of ISIS and detained around 79 of its terrorists. The greatest blow came when US forces killed Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the head of ISIS’s intelligence/foreign branch, Emni, on August 30, 2016. Adnani’s death crippled ISIS’s striking and recruitment capabilities. The terror group is now scrambled, with its capability to strike the West destroyed. ISIS’s presence is now limited to Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. For the past two years, high-intensity attacks have only been recorded in those regions. ISIS is weakened, but perhaps its potential for resurgence has not been meaningfully considered. The patterns also suggest that whenever its influence is seen to be dwindling, it tries to send a message to the West by carrying out major attacks in West African or Middle Eastern countries. The US-led coalition has intensified its operations against ISIS’s limited and fragmented presence for one year, leading to 200 missionsagainst the group since January 2024. According to reports, the US-led forces have killed 44 terrorists and detained around 166 others. Despite an intensified operation, the outfit still holds a tight grip over its fragmented network and has attempted to capitalize on various opportunities to make a comeback. There are arguably three primary reasons why ISIS could see a strong revival: The first is the US’s shifting focus on Iran due to the Israel–Hamas conflict. The second is the increased destabilization in Syria and West Africa, and now the fall of the Syrian government. The third is the increasing freedom ISIS’s Khorāsānis — residents of the Greater Khorāsān area of the Iranian Plateau — are finding to operate in South and Central Asia, especially in Afghanistan. These have facilitated ISIS’s regrouping at the regional level, which has given the outfit occasional opportunities to carry out low-intensity terror strikes across the globe. The fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad government and the mobilization of various Islamic coalitions there have given ISIS, especially Khorāsānis, a window to further resurge and increase their striking capabilities. However, the resurgence factor is not the only thing to worry about; a possible shift in the ISIS striking pattern could help ISIS showcase its capabilities as well. A shift in striking pattern ISIS terror strikes can be classified into three patterns. The first is direct: ISIS directly carries out its strikes. The second is indirect: ISIS enables an attack and indirectly carries out its strikes by connecting to attackers through the Internet. An example of this was the Curtis Culwell Center attack in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015 — one of the attackers who opened fire at the community center was in contact with ISIS through encrypted texts. The third pattern is inspired: Using online propaganda, ISIS inspires self-radicalized individuals to carry out lone wolf attacks on their own. An example is the 2016 Nice attack. Though the perpetrator, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, acted on his own, ISIS later took credit for his actions. Conversely, there is the April 7, 2017 truck attack in Stockholm, Sweden, where a similar vehicle ramming incident took place. In this case, ISIS did not take credit for the self-radicalized man’s attack. The organization was under intense pressure at that time, and its presence and capabilities had been significantly damaged by US-led coalition forces; by the end of the year, ISIS was defeated in Iraq. ISIS is once again under pressure, this time in Syria, thanks to US airstrikes. As it weaves an opportunity to resurge, some believe the group has resorted to enhancing online propaganda and carrying out inspired attacks without direct involvement. The reason for this possible change to its striking pattern is to ensure resurgence and keep limited striking capabilities intact without exposing itself. Additionally, it seeks to avoid instant retaliatory and offensive responses from the US, which could severely damage ISIS’s chances of resurgence in Syria and elsewhere. If left unchecked, a new, lethal wave of inspired ISIS terror could emerge. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Narva Becomes Cultural Capital Of Finno-Ugric World – OpEd	Narva has become the cultural capital of the Finno-Ugric world for 2025 and because of its own ethnic heritage has given that title a new and expanded meaning, one likely to encourage the smallest Finno-Ugric peoples in the region and spark Russian anger about what Moscow will seek to present as evidence of Western interference. When people discuss ethnic relations in Estonia, they typically focus on the relative size of the Estonians and the ethnic Russians, ignoring the fact that there are also small percentages of Finno-Ugric peoples (other than Estonians) including Vods, Izhors, Ingermanland Finns and Narva Finns, Ekaterina Kuznetsova says (region.expert/narva2025/). But the designation of Narva as the cultural capital of Finno-Ugric nations this year has the effect of throwing into high relief their role, dispelling myths about them and giving them hope for survival, the head of the Ingria House and director of the Vod Cultural Center in that eastern Estonian border city says 'Many know that in 1641 to 1654, that city was the administrative center of the Swedish province of Ingermandland; some even call Narva the historical ‘capital’ of Ingria; but unfortunately, few recall what took place there before and afer that period, Kuznetsova continues. Few know that the Ida-Virumaa region is 'the historic motherland at one and the same time of five Finno-Ugric peoples' or that there existed in the 20th century both an Estonian Ingermanland and a Soviet version of that region as well, histories that have every chance to affect the future. 'Estonian Ingermanland – Eesti Ingeri in Estonian – is part of the historical district of Ingria located in the western section of present-day Kingisepp Districtof Leningrad Oblast in the valley of the Narva River.' It became part of Estonia as a result of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty and included Ivangorod, the Rosson River and 13 villages where some 1800 people lived. The Soviet government annexed it in 1944; but even before that, there had been what may be called Soviet Ingermanland, although many today are convinced that Moscow always denied the existence of such a place. But during korenizatiya in the 1920s, the Soviet authorities promoted Finnish and even Ingrian languages, although they suppressed them in the 1930s. The fact that so few people know about all this, Kuznetsova says, is the result of Stalnist repressions against these minorities and Moscow’s unceasing Russification campaign that led many Ingrians and others to reidentify as Russians and forget their national pasts, even though they would quickly discover it if they could look back a generation or two. Indeed, Kunetsova argues, such people who think they are Russians would soon learn that 'in the first third of the 20th century, the majority of the population of present-day Leningrad Oblast did not know Russian and that the native languages for them were Vod, Izhor, Karelian, Vepsy, and Ingermanland-Finnish.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf19iqvhxE--L4	2025-01-07T16:20:19-08:00	
Trudeau Announces He Plans To Resign – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll In a subdued press conference on Monday morning, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he plans to step down from his role. The date he would actually leave office was not specified, but it would be before the next election, which is set to take place in the coming months. The announcement comes in the midst of dismal polling for Trudeau’s Liberal Party, with recent numbers putting the party’s support at a mere 16 percent, the lowest it’s been in over ten years. While calls for his resignation have been mounting for months now, the pressure ticked up considerably when Chrystia Freeland—Trudeau’s Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister—unexpectedly resigned from the Cabinet back in December. 'It has become obvious to me with the internal battles that I cannot be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election,' Trudeau said. '…Removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarization we’re seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics.' For many, this decision is long overdue. Whether it’s the 'costly political gimmicks' Freeland complained about in her resignation letter, the numerous scandals, or simply the economic slumpCanada finds itself in, almost everyone is ready to begin a new chapter in Canadian politics. Canada vs US real GDP per capita via @globeandmail pic.twitter.com/pO9NWiHPBE— Jon Hartley (@Jon_Hartley_) January 16, 2024 But before we leave the past behind completely, we should take a moment to reflect on Trudeau’s nearly 10 years in office and the lessons we can learn from it. Unfit to Lead From the very beginning, both Trudeau’s competence and his character have been called into question. He sailed into power with a thin CV, but a cool haircut and a well-known surname (his father was Pierre Trudeau, Canadian PM from 1968 to 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984). When asked why he selected a gender-balanced Cabinet in his first term—with 15 of 31 posts held by women—he famously answered, 'Because it’s 2015.' That may have played well with his progressive base, but it was a flimsy case for his personnel choices. Many other cabinet and policy decisions have likewise raised eyebrows regarding his aptitude. Trudeau’s character flaws have been even more apparent. 'Trudeau clearly has narcissistic personality characteristics,' said Jordan Peterson in a recent podcast episode, echoing criticisms he has been making for years. '[He] runs the country, what, as a testament to his own grandeur, it’s something like that…The Trudeau government has skated through at least half a dozen scandals that under normal circumstances would have provoked an honorable government to resign.' Whether it was appearing in blackface at parties, or accepting gifts from a foreign magnate, his judgement seemed poor, to say the least. In addition to the scandals, Trudeau and his wife Sophie separated in August 2023, after 18 years of marriage. This isn’t to say that was entirely his fault, of course, but it does tarnish his 'family man' image in the public eye. Why the Worst Get on Top All of this is reminiscent of F. A. Hayek’s chapter in The Road to Serfdom titled 'Why the Worst Get on Top.' In the chapter, Hayek explains that positions of power in totalitarian regimes tend to attract the worst kinds of people because of the very nature of the system. Others have pointed out that a similar problem exists with non-totalitarian governments as well. As Trudeau’s tenure illustrates, the kind of people who tend to gain power are precisely those who shouldn’t have it. '…[I]t is a well-known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it,' writes Douglas Adams. '…anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.' Or as Frank Herbert put it, 'All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.' The propensity of people like Trudeau to acquire and maintain positions of power underscores the importance of limiting government power in every possible way. And this goes far beyond 'checks and balances.' This means asking serious questions—at a constitutional level—about how much authority the government should have to tax us and interfere with our lives and businesses. Imagine a world where the government had so little power that no one even particularly cared who the Prime Minister was. Maybe, instead of putting our hopes in a new ruler, that would be a better path for Canadians to pursue.

India’s Expanding Footprint In Africa: Naval Diplomacy And Mariti...	India and Africa share a deeply rooted historical connection, forged through their mutual struggles against colonialism and a shared vision for independence. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, who began his activism in South Africa, and African luminaries like Julius Nyerere highlighted the importance of solidarity between the two regions. This bond laid the groundwork for India’s long-standing partnership with Africa, spanning political, economic, and cultural dimensions. In the modern era, this relationship has evolved into one of shared aspirations for a multipolar world order. India’s consistent advocacy for African representation on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and its successful push to include the African Union in the G-20 during its presidency in 2023 exemplifies this commitment. These achievements highlight India’s role as a champion of the Global South and its desire to elevate Africa’s voice in global governance structures. India’s Naval Strategy and Its Role in Africa The Indian Navy plays a central role in India’s engagement with Africa, acting as a critical tool of the country’s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) policy. This policy emphasises India’s commitment to ensuring maritime security, promoting economic growth, and fostering stability across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). In 2024, the Indian Navy significantly expanded its footprint in Africa. Ships like INS Sunayna, INS Talwar, and INS Gharial conducted extensive deployments, showcasing India’s maritime capabilities and strengthening partnerships with African nations. These engagements included professional exchanges with African navies, joint exercises to improve interoperability, and the transfer of naval technology, such as Fast Interceptor Crafts to Mozambique, to bolster regional security. Moreover, India’s support for regional Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) has been instrumental in empowering African nations. Through the establishment of radar networks in Mauritius and Seychelles, India has enhanced the capacity of these countries to monitor and secure their maritime zones. The Role of the Indian Navy in Maritime Security Maritime security is a cornerstone of India’s African strategy, with the Indian Navy addressing key challenges such as piracy and armed robbery at sea. The Gulf of Guinea, a notorious hotspot for maritime crime, has been a focal point of these efforts. Indian naval patrols in the region have provided critical security for international shipping lanes and ensured the safety of vital trade routes. In addition to counter-piracy operations, the Indian Navy has conducted joint surveillance missions with African navies, offering expertise in managing large maritime zones. Training programs for African naval officers have further strengthened regional capacity, focusing on areas such as anti-piracy, search and rescue (SAR) operations, and maritime law enforcement. These initiatives demonstrate India’s commitment to serving as a net-security provider in the Indian Ocean and a preferred partner for African nations seeking to safeguard their maritime interests. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief: India’s Soft Power in Action The Indian Navy’s ability to deliver swift and effective humanitarian assistance has cemented India’s reputation as a reliable partner in Africa. A recent example is the response to Cyclone Hidaya in Kenya in 2024. The devastating floods caused by the cyclone left thousands displaced and in urgent need of aid. INS Sumedha, initially deployed for anti-piracy operations off Somalia, was redirected to deliver food, medical supplies, and other relief materials to affected regions. Such missions highlight the versatility and responsiveness of the Indian Navy. Beyond immediate relief, these efforts build long-term goodwill, positioning India as a humane and dependable partner for African nations in times of crisis. The Geopolitical Context of India’s Engagement with Africa Africa’s growing geopolitical significance makes it a strategic priority for global powers, and India is no exception. The continent’s abundant natural resources, youthful population, and rapidly expanding markets offer immense opportunities for economic and strategic partnerships. India has leveraged these opportunities by increasing its investments in Africa, which averaged $26.39 billion annually between 2018 and 2022, making India one of the continent’s top investors. However, India faces competition from other global powers, particularly China. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has established a dominant presence in Africa, building infrastructure, securing natural resources, and hosting regular high-level summits with African leaders. While India’s approach emphasises sustainability and local empowerment, its limited resources and administrative constraints have often hindered its ability to match China’s scale and speed of engagement. Challenges in Strengthening India-Africa Relations Despite the progress made, several challenges impede the realisation of the full potential of India-Africa relations. One of the most significant issues is the long delay in hosting the India-Africa Forum Summit, last held in 2015. Although logistical challenges like the Ebola outbreak in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this delay, the absence of this flagship event has created a perception that Africa is not a priority for New Delhi. Additionally, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), despite receiving consistent budget increases, remains understaffed and overstretched. With its focus divided among South Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and partnerships with Western powers, the MEA often struggles to allocate sufficient resources to Africa. This lack of capacity limits India’s ability to launch new initiatives, deliver on existing commitments, and sustain high-level political engagement with African nations. The Way Forward: Leveraging Naval Diplomacy India’s naval diplomacy offers a unique opportunity to address these challenges and deepen its engagement with Africa. By building on the successes of the SAGAR policy, India can pursue several key strategies: Expanding Naval Cooperation: Increasing the frequency and scope of joint exercises with African navies will enhance interoperability and trust. This could include trilateral and multilateral exercises involving other regional partners. Enhancing Capacity Building: Providing advanced training and technology transfers to African naval forces can strengthen their ability to tackle maritime threats independently. Reinvigorating Political Engagement: Hosting the fourth India-Africa Forum Summit, accompanied by substantive deliverables, would signal a renewed commitment to the partnership. High-level visits by Indian leaders to African countries would further reinforce this message. Additionally, India can leverage its private sector to complement government-led initiatives. Indian companies, particularly in technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, have shown significant interest in Africa, offering a pathway to sustainable development and economic growth. A Brave New World India’s relationship with Africa is a testament to its vision of a multipolar world where partnerships are built on mutual respect and shared aspirations. The Indian Navy, as a cornerstone of this engagement, exemplifies India’s commitment to fostering security, stability, and prosperity across the continent. By addressing capacity constraints, enhancing diplomatic efforts, and leveraging its naval strengths, India can transform its aspirations for Africa into tangible outcomes, ensuring that this partnership becomes a defining feature of its global strategy in the years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1_st5oEluJtX	2025-01-07T16:05:35-08:00	
Trump Says Ukraine Peace Talks Could Begin Soon After Taking Offi...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said again that he is eager to see negotiations with Russia on ending the war in Ukraine begin soon after he returns to the White House but gave no specifics on when they would take place. Trump said he wants to see negotiations soon because 'Russia is losing a lot of young people and so is Ukraine.' Trump, who spoke with reporters at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, didn’t say whether or how soon he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said such a meeting would not be appropriate until after he is inaugurated on January 20. 'I can't tell you that, but I know Putin would like to meet,' Trump said. At the end of December, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were no preconditions for a meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents. The president-elect said during his election campaign he could end the conflict in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. At the news conference Trump said he hoped to end the fighting within six months. 'I hope long before six months,' Trump said, when asked if he could solve the war within half a year. Trump’s return to the White House brings with it uncertainty on what impact it will have on the nearly three-year-old conflict and whether negotiations can take place. But Trump told the news conference he is determined to get it 'straightened out,' adding that it is 'a tough one.' Ukrainian officials are concerned that any hastily arranged negotiations could allow Russia to hold on to Ukrainian territory it has seized and would also give Russian forces time to rest and reorganize. The Ukrainians also want to encourage Trump to continue U.S. military support for their country. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha announced on January 7 that a trip to Ukraine by Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia had been canceled and would have to be rescheduled. The envoy, Keith Kellogg, has been tasked with leading negotiations to end the war. Kellogg has said that potential cease-fire talks could begin once Trump takes office and, in a December interview with Fox News, said the war could 'be resolved in the next few months.' The planned meetings between Kellogg and Ukrainian officials are 'extremely important,' Sybiha said during a news conference with his visiting Icelandic counterpart. 'I am confident that this meeting will take place in due course,' he told reporters in Kyiv. 'We are in contact to clearly define the timeline for its organization and to ensure that the meeting is as meaningful as possible.' Ramstein Meeting Trump was not asked about a report that the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce a massive final military aid package for Ukraine as part of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s visit to Germany on January 9. Austin is scheduled to meet with representatives of about 50 partner nations in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at an air base in Ramstein, Germany. The package is expected to be 'substantial,' according to two officials who briefed reporters on Austin’s trip. The officials did not provide an exact dollar amount. Austin's trip will be his final meeting with the contact group, which he organized after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Together those nations have provided more than $126 billion in weapons, military training, and assistance since the war started. The U.S. portion of the total is $66 billion. The package to be announced later this week will draw from existing U.S. stockpiles with a goal of getting most of the weapons to Ukraine by the time Trump is sworn in, one of the officials said. Trump also urged NATO members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, up from the current 2 percent target, reinforcing his long-held claim that they are not paying enough for U.S. protection.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1w1P34nwDl3k	2025-01-07T16:03:36-08:00	
Tibet: Dozens Killed After 7.1-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes	By Tashi Wangchuk, Dolkar, Tenzin Pema, and Taejun Kang At least 126 people were killed and 188 others were injured after a powerful earthquake hit Tibet on Tuesday morning, according to Chinese state media, with the tremors felt in multiple regions in neighboring countries of India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck at 9:05 a.m. local time in Dingri county of Shigatse prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, located close to the border with Nepal, according to the United States Geological Survey. The China Earthquake Networks Center recorded a magnitude 6.8 quake. Multiple aftershocks of magnitudes of more than 4 struck the region, the most powerful of which was 4.4. magnitude. More than 3,000 buildings were destroyed in one county alone, Chinese state media reported. Rescue teams have been deployed, Chinese media reported earlier. Many Tibetans from around Tibet are rallying together to provide aid to the hundreds of affected Tibetans in Dingri, with videos as seen by Radio Free Asia showing individuals leading donation drives for shoes, blankets, food, water and other basic necessities such as tissue rolls, and loading these in trucks for distribution. Sources told RFA that freezing temperatures in the region have exacerbated challenges, after the earthquake destroyed homes and forced people out in the open. Temperatures in January in the region plunge as low as minus-16 degrees Celsius (3 degrees Fahrenheit). Dalai Lama offers prayers Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is currently in South India, expressed deep sadness over loss of lives, property and homes in the earthquake. 'I offer my prayers for those who have lost their lives and extend my wishes for a swift recovery to all who have been injured,' he said in an official announcement. In video footage sourced by RFA, significant damage can be seen, with many buildings reduced to rubble. In one video, a Tibetan woman can be heard crying out for trapped family members. Dingri County has a population of about 60,000, according to a 2020 census. Within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter are the villages of Tangren, Xuezhu, Garegoji, and Meiduo, while Tsosang and Chulho townships are within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the impact zone, Chinese state media reported. The earthquake was felt strongly in Cogo, Chulho, and Chamco townships, said a source in India who has family members in Chamco. 'I was able to connect with my family this morning and got to know they were all safe at the time but was not able to connect in the afternoon,' he told RFA. Tremors were also felt in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu some 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, where residents ran from their houses, Reuters news agency reported. 'We felt a very strong earthquake. So far we have not received any report of injuries or physical loss,' said Anoj Raj Ghimire, chief district officer of Solukhumbu district in Nepal, quoted by Reuters. The earthquake also hit Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal, Reuters said. CTA extends condolences Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, expressed his condolences and announced a prayer service to be held on Wednesday at the Thekchen Choeling Tsuglakhang complex in Dharamsala, India. 'The Central Tibetan Administration deeply mourns the devastating 6.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the Dingri region and surrounding areas in Tibet this morning,' he told RFA. 'The CTA, along with Tibetans around the world, extends our heartfelt condolences and prayers to all those affected by this tragedy. …We will continue to monitor the situation inside Tibet.' China’s official Xinhua news agency said the Chinese government dispatched a rescue team of 198 people and 35 ambulances, and that President Xi Jinping ordered authorities to ensure that those affected by the quake were protected from the harsh winter. 'However, the locals were left with no sign of help at the site even about three hours after the earthquake,' said a Tibetan resident in Nepal, who has been in touch with those affected since the earthquake struck in Dingri. An unusually large number of photos and videos about the earthquake have surfaced online, including one in which a Tibetan woman can be heard taking the name of the Dalai Lama, referring to him as 'Gyalwa Rinpoche' in Tibetan. 'May His Holiness bless us,' her prayer can be heard in the WeChat video. Many Tibetans inside and outside Tibet have also taken to social media to express their solidarity. 'Dingri, may you recover soon from the effects of the earthquake and stand tall like a mountain once again,' said a social media user named Phakchen. 'May all brothers and sisters be free from the sufferings caused by the earthquake.' Another user, named Tsowo, expressed solidarity with Tibetans affected by the disaster with a post of a traditional Tibetan butter lamp, a symbol of driving away darker times. Frequent earthquakes Southwestern parts of China and Nepal have been hit frequently by earthquakes. A huge earthquake in China’s Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people, while in 2015, a magnitude 7.8 quake, Nepal’s worst, hit near Kathmandu, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake can cause extensive structural damage, severe ground shaking, landslides and fatalities, particularly in densely populated or poorly constructed areas, with risks of power outages, gas leaks, and tsunamis if near the coast. There have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of the epicenter of Tingri in the past five years, according to China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an earthquake of a magnitude 6 or higher has struck only 10 times in the last 100 years within 250 kilometers (155 miles) of the epicenter in Dingri county.

Robert Reich: Advice And Consent Or Total Submission? – OpEd	The cast of characters Trump has chosen to populate his second term are a Star Wars cantina of fanatics, extremists, conspiracy theorists, sexual harassers, and disreputable no-goods. They have little or no experience running government, let alone expertise in the issues confronting the agencies and departments Trump wants them to lead. Over the next two weeks, the Senate will hold confirmation hearings on them. As soon as they’re completed and Trump takes the oath of office on January 20, the Senate will vote on them. Most if not all Senate Democrats will vote against them, so Trump can afford to lose the votes of only three Senate Republicans. The question, therefore, is whether at least four Senate Republicans have enough integrity to refuse to confirm the worst of them. The worst of the worst are: Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick for secretary of defense. Hegseth has a reputation for sexual harassment, including an allegation of assault in 2017. (His own mother accused him in writing of repeatedly abusing women but subsequently disavowed the statement.) According to a recent report, Hegseth was ousted from leadership roles in two military veterans organizations following allegations of financial mismanagement, aggressive drunkenness, and sexist behavior. Nonetheless, Hegseth has appeared to win over key Senate Republicans. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, an Armed Services Committee member and the Senate’s first female combat veteran, has been deeply concerned about sexual harassment and assault in the military (where she says she was assaulted). But Trump Republicans have threatened to run a primary challenger against her if she doesn’t support Hegseth —which seems to have changed her attitude toward him. Of all Trump’s nominations, Hegseth is probably closest to Trump in character and temperament, which should be damning enough to stop his confirmation. He’s scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing on January 14. Stay tuned. Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to direct the FBI. He has called for firing the top ranks of the FBI, prosecuting leakers and journalists, and replacing the national security workforce with 'people who won’t undermine the president’s agenda.' Patel has even created a list of whom he dubs 'government gangsters' — headlined by outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland — who he says 'must be held accountable and exposed in 2024.' He has pledged to investigate Trump’s political opponents and 'come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election.' Of all Trump’s picks, Patel may be the most dangerous. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence. She has publicly called for the U.S. to allow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to remain in power and traveled to Syria to meet with him. She even challenged U.S. intelligence that found Assad’s forces had used chemical weapons. Gabbard is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a favorite on Russian propaganda. In 2022, she used her platform to amplify a Russian talking point that the U.S. had somehow provoked Putin to invade Ukraine. Why in the world would Trump want her to head national intelligence — unless, of course, Trump himself is compromised? Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for heading the Department of Health and Human Resources. Kennedy Jr. is a well-known anti-vaxxer who has made the baseless claims that COVID-19 was 'targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people' and that 'the people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.' Kennedy Jr. keeps repeating the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism in kids, along with his insistence that the COVID vaccine has killed more people than it’s saved, which is another lie. He’s a wacko. Nonetheless, his critiques of corporate influence over food and drugs might possibly gain the votes of two Democrats: Bernie Sanders and John Fetterman. ** The Constitution (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2), gives the Senate the power of 'advice and consent' over a president’s key appointments. Advice and consent requires careful screening, not outright submission to the will of an incoming president. If you live in a state with Republican senators (or in Sanders’s Vermont or Fetterman’s Pennsylvania), you might remind them that they have a constitutional duty to not allow the U.S. government to fall into the hands of unqualified and potentially dangerous people like the four mentioned above.

Understanding The Vatican’s Novel Leadership Structure Of A Pro-P...	By Andrea Gagliarducci In a move that raised eyebrows among Vatican observers, Pope Francis on Monday created an unprecedented leadership structure at the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life by appointing both a nun as prefect and a cardinal as pro-prefect — a solution that begs clarity in law and theology. The unusual decision to appoint Sister Simona Brambilla as prefect and Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime as pro-prefect has sparked discussion about the intersection of traditional Church hierarchy and Pope Francis’ vision for reform. Understanding the pro-prefect role The office of pro-prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life is not provided for in the constitution Praedicate Evangelium, which regulates the functions of the Roman Curia. However, Pope Francis instituted the office ad hoc when he appointed the cardinal as pro-prefect and the nun — the secretary until now — as prefect of the dicastery. It has not been stated how there will be a balance of power between the new prefect and the pro-prefect. However, speaking of a relationship of subordination with a cardinal who would be the 'second in rank' to the prefect does not seem to be a correct reading. What is the logic that pushed Pope Francis to make this choice? Power and authority in the Church Throughout history, there has been a broad, complex, and sometimes controversial reflection on the relationship between the power of orders, which is received with ordination and which enables one to administer certain sacraments — such as presiding over the Eucharist — and the power of governance, which gives authority over a part of the people of God, such as a diocese, a religious order, or even a parish. For a long time, it was believed that the two powers were distinct and that it was possible to exercise them separately — St. Thomas Aquinas shared this position, too. As regards the Roman Curia, it was believed that all those who carried out their service in it received their power directly from the pope, who conferred authority on them regardless of whether or not they were ordained. This also applied to cardinals, whose authority derived from papal creation — ​​which is not a sacrament. The pope chooses the cardinals as collaborators and advisers of the pope in the government of the Church. This approach has characterized the history of the Church for a long time, so much so that there have been cardinals who were not priests — for example, Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, Vatican secretary of state from 1848 to 1876, was ordained deacon but was not a priest. Further back in time, there were cardinals appointed at a young age who only received orders after a long time, and even popes who were only deacons at the time of their election to the papal throne. In the past, some abbots had not even been ordained priests and governed an ecclesiastical district, or there were figures who seem strange to us but who responded to this logic, such as the so-called bishops-elect, who governed dioceses without receiving episcopal consecration but did so because of their election. Other examples include the so-called mitered abbesses, 'women with the pastoral staff,' who exercised their authority over a territory and the faithful. Vatican II’s impact on Church governance Over time, however, another approach has emerged that goes back to the Church of the first millennium: The power of government is closely linked to the sacrament of holy orders, so it is not possible to exercise one without the other except within certain limits, which are rather narrow. Hence, Pope John XXIII in 1962 decided that all cardinals should be ordained archbishops with the motu proprio Cum Gravissima. This is the approach of the Second Vatican Council, which is found, for example, in Lumen Gentium, No. 21, in the Explanatory Note at No. 2, and in the two Codes of Canon Law, the Latin and the Eastern one. Vatican II authoritatively reiterated that the episcopate is a sacrament and that by episcopal consecration, one becomes part of the College of Bishops, which, together with and under the authority of the pope, is the subject of supreme power over the entire Church. This approach was followed in the two Curia reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council: Pope Paul VI’s constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae (1967) and Pope John Paul II’s Pastor Bonus (1988). John Paul II delineated the Curia into congregations and pontifical councils, which in lay terms might be defined as 'ministries with portfolio' and 'ministries without portfolio.' The congregations had to be governed by cardinals because they participated in the decisions of the universal Church with the pope and, therefore, their heads had to have the rank of first advisers to the pope. The pontifical councils, on the other hand, could also be led by archbishops, but in any case, by ordained ministers because they still had to be in collegiality with the bishop of Rome — that is, the pope. Francis’ Curia reform: breaking new ground The apostolic constitution Praedicate Evangelium, with which Pope Francis reformed the Curia in 2022, departed from this approach. There was no longer a distinction between congregations and pontifical councils, which were all defined as dicasteries. Therefore, there was no longer a difference in who could be the head of the dicastery, a position that could also go to a layperson. However, when presenting the reform of the Curia on March 21, 2022, the then-Father Gianfranco Ghirlanda — created cardinal by Pope Francis in the consistory of Aug. 27, 2022 — explained that there were still some dicasteries in which it was appropriate for a cardinal to lead and noted that the 'constitution does not abrogate the Code of Canon Law, which establishes that in matters that concern clerics, clerics are the ones to judge.' In practice, the canonical mission was no longer given by order but by the pope’s decision. This is why a layman like Paolo Ruffini could be at the head of the Vatican Dicastery for Communication. This is the heart of the debate: Are there offices that can be exercised only by papal appointment, or are there offices that, despite papal appointment, can be exercised only if one is ordained? The question arises when a pro-prefect supports Sister Brambilla. The Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life has various competencies, but all competencies are generic acts of government that can be exercised without priestly ordination. There are situations of clerics’ judgment, though, and likely it was thought that these decisions cannot be managed without an ordination. Thus, the figure of the pro-prefect was created. The definition of pro-prefect seems, however, to be used improperly. The document Praedicate Evangelium describes two pro-prefects who are the heads of the two sections of the Dicastery for Evangelization. That is because these two pro-prefects lead the sections of the dicastery 'in place of' (i.e., pro-) pope, who is considered the prefect of the dicastery. In other cases, a prelate who did not yet have the rank to hold the office formally was appointed pro-prefect. For example, when Angelo Sodano was appointed Vatican secretary of state on Dec. 1, 1990, he was still an archbishop. He was thus appointed pro-secretary of state because the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus provided that the secretary of state was always to be a cardinal. Sodano retained the title of pro-secretary of state until the consistory of June 28, 1991, when he was created cardinal and formally took the title of secretary of state starting July 1, 1991. Pro-prefect Artime, however, is already a cardinal and does not exercise jurisdiction in place of the pope. If anything, he works alongside the prefect, Sister Brambilla. His role is more co-prefect, and it remains to be seen whether the pope will appoint a secretary for the dicastery to understand the organizational chart. A Jesuit model for Church governance? The choice to place an ecclesiastic alongside the prefect reflects some religious orders, which have 'brothers' (consecrated laypeople) at their helm but are appointed alongside figures with sacramental authority. Therefore, Pope Francis would have chosen to follow a path already followed by religious congregations for the governance of the Church. This is not new. Pope Francis, for example, also intervened in the governance crisis of the Order of Malta precisely by operating on the order as if it were only a religious and monastic entity, authoritatively imposing the new constitutions in September 2022 and establishing that the Holy Father needs to confirm the election of the grand master of the order. Even the Council of Cardinals, established by Pope Francis at the beginning of his pontificate in 2013, resembles the general council that supports the government of the Jesuit General. Many of these settings are given by Pope Francis’ main legal adviser, Cardinal Ghirlanda, also a Jesuit, who personally followed the reformof the Order of Malta and the reform of the Curia — as well as various other reforms, such as that of the statutes of the Legionaries of Christ. Looking ahead: implications and questions Pope Francis established an innovation in the Roman Curia without outlining it with a precise law, leaving the management of the competencies to subsequent decisions, not using the criteria of the government of the Curia but rather those of the religious congregations. It seems 'inside baseball.' However, it speaks of a small revolution — or potentially a misuse of terms that could cause some confusion in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf169UjjLtOOEa	2025-01-07T15:49:00-08:00	
Future Of Jobs Report 2025: 78 Million New Job Opportunities By 2...	The Future of Jobs Report 2025, published by the World Economic Forum, reveals that job disruption will equate to 22% of jobs by 2030, with 170 million new roles set to be created and 92 million displaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological advancements, demographic shifts, geoeconomic tensions and economic pressures are the key drivers of these changes, reshaping industries and professions worldwide. Drawing on data from over 1,000 companies, the report finds that the skills gap continues to be the most significant barrier to business transformation today, with nearly 40% of skills required on the job set to change and 63% of employers already citing it as the key barrier they face. Technology skills in AI, big data and cybersecurity are expected to see rapid growth in demand, but human skills, such as creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility, will remain critical. A combination of both skill types will be increasingly crucial in a fast-shifting job market. Frontline roles and essential sectors like care and education are set for the highest job growth by 2030, while advances in AI and renewable energy are reshaping the market – driving an increase in demand for many technology or specialist roles while driving a decline for others, such as graphic designers. 'Trends such as generative AI and rapid technological shifts are upending industries and labour markets, creating both unprecedented opportunities and profound risks,' said Till Leopold, Head of Work, Wages and Job Creation at the World Economic Forum. 'The time is now for businesses and governments to work together, invest in skills and build an equitable and resilient global workforce.' The Job Market in 2030 Frontline roles, including farmworkers, delivery drivers and construction workers, are poised to see the largest job growth in absolute terms by 2030. Significant increases are also projected for care jobs, such as nursing professionals, and education roles, such as secondary school teachers, with demographic trends driving growth in demand across essential sectors. Meanwhile, advances in AI, robotics and energy systems – notably in renewable energy and environmental engineering – are expected to increase demand for specialist roles in these fields. Meanwhile, roles such as cashiers and administrative assistants remain among the fastest declining but are now joined by roles including graphic designers as generative AI rapidly reshapes the labour market. The Skills Gap The skills gap continues to be the most significant obstacle to business transformation in response to global macrotrends, cited by 63% of employers as a main barrier to future-proofing their operations. If the global workforce were represented by a group of 100 people, 59 are projected to require reskilling or upskilling by 2030 – 11 of whom are unlikely to receive it; this translates to over 120 million workers at medium-term risk of redundancy. While technology skills in AI, big data and networks and cybersecurity are expected to see the fastest growth in demand, human skills such as analytical thinking, cognitive skills, resilience, leadership and collaboration will remain critical core skills. A combination of both skillsets will increasingly be required by many growing jobs. AI and Upskilling AI is reshaping business models, with half of employers globally planning to reorient their business to target new opportunities resulting from the technology. The most common workforce response to these changes is expected to be upskilling workers, with 77% of employers planning to do so. However, 41% plan to reduce their workforce as AI automates certain tasks. Almost half of employers expect to transition staff from roles exposed to AI disruption into other parts of their business, an opportunity to alleviate skills shortages while reducing the human cost of technological transformation. Given the rapid growth of emerging technologies, business leaders, policy-makers and workers will need to work together to ensure workforces are ready while reducing risks of unemployment across sectors and geographies. Beyond technology: Economic, demographic and geoeconomic shifts The rising cost of living is another key factor driving labour market change, with half of employers expecting it to transform business models. While global inflation has eased, price pressures and slower economic growth are projected to displace 6 million jobs globally by 2030. These challenges are increasing demand for resilience, agility, flexibility and creative thinking skills. Demographic shifts are reshaping labour markets, with ageing populations predominantly in higher-income countries driving demand for healthcare roles and expanding working-age populations in lower-income regions fuelling growth in education professions. Workforce strategies focused on improving talent management, teaching and mentoring skills are essential to bridging these gaps. Geopolitical tensions are a top concern for 34% of businesses, while trade restrictions and industrial policy shifts transform many more, with some companies planning to adapt through offshoring and reshoring strategies. These pressures are also increasing demand for skills such as cybersecurity. A need for urgent action Addressing the sweeping changes outlined in the report requires urgent and collective action across government, business and education. Key priority areas include bridging skills gaps, investing in reskilling and upskilling initiatives and creating accessible pathways into fast-growing jobs and skills that are seeing fast growth in demand. By prioritizing equitable and inclusive workforce transitions and strategies – and supporting workers through these transformations – stakeholders can build a resilient and adaptable global workforce that is prepared to thrive in the jobs of tomorrow.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf199yvk1jmlyp	2025-01-07T15:47:19-08:00	
The Festivus Airing Of 2024’s Federal Spending Grievances – OpEd	If you were a fan of the Seinfeld television show in the 1990s or the reruns that still air and stream today, you know that Festivus is an alternative holiday celebrated by George Costanza’s father with some unique traditions. Perhaps the most notable tradition is the 'airing of grievances' during the Festivus meal, in which each person tells the others all the ways they disappointed them during the past year. (Below is the clip featuring Jerry Stiller’s immortal performance introducing the practice) One of the joys of covering the federal spending beat comes during the year-end holidays when Senator Rand Paul embodies the spirit of Festivus and catalogs examples of wasteful spending so you can hear about them in his annual Festivus report. It’s a lot of fun to read, and the 2024 report captures over $1 trillion worth of taxpayer dollars that U.S. government bureaucrats badly spent. Here are my favorite three wasteful spending examples from this year’s report: A Florida man named Patrick Parker Walsh scammed $8 million in COVID-19 Relief funds from the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. While that alone makes him one of many thousands of fraudsters who exploited these programs in a huge failure of government oversight, what makes him special is he used the money to buy himself an island. That’s almost supervillain stuff! The IRS blew $15 million when it tried to get into the business of preparing and filing tax returns for Americans without congressional approval, duplicating a service that already exists in the private sector and is even free of charge for many to use. This one stands out to me because of personal experience. The IRS tried to do my taxes in 2022, bungled the job by hallucinating income I never earned, and then demanded I pay tens of thousands of extra income taxes for the make-believe money they claimed I made. It took months to get them to realize their mistake and drop their claim. What I learned from the experience is that they are simply not up to the job of preparing and filing anybody’s tax returns. You can always tell when supposedly creative people have run out of any good ideas. They will take the titles of their intellectual property and add words like 'on ice' to the end. Because doing whatever it is they’ve been doing, but now on ice skates, offers that one chance for a last cash grab. The only thing that’s worse is when the government subsidizes the cash grab, as happened with the Bearded Ladies Cabaret’s performance of Beards on Ice. The National Endowment for the Arts gave up $10,000 to the Bearded Ladies Cabaret because they pledged to call attention to climate change through the ice-skating performance of cabaret’s drag queens. There are dozens of more examples in the 2024 Festivus Report. What other examples of wasteful government spending do you suppose it’s time to hear more about?

Jean-Marie Le Pen, Former Leader Of French Far-Right, Dead At 96	By Laurent Geslin and Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right French politician who founded the Front National and led it for almost four decades, died on Tuesday at the age of 96. Le Pen was succeeded as leader of the nationalist party in 2011 by his daughter, Marine. Four years later she expelled him for being too extreme, and rebranded the party as the Rassemblement National. In 1999, a German court convicted him of minimising the Holocaust, having in 1987 dismissed the use of gas chambers as 'a detail' in the history of World War Two. He was later convicted in France of incitement to hatred, discrimination and violence for comments he made about Muslims. The far-right leader was also accused of torture during his time as a French army officer in the Algerian war of 1954-1962. Le Pen's obstinance earned him the nickname of 'The Menhir' in France, a reference to ancient standing stones built by Celtic cultures – including in the French region of Brittany, where he was from. AFP first reported Le Pen had died on Tuesday, citing a statement from his family. 'A kind of UFO' in Brussels Before facing Jacques Chirac in the second round of the 2002 presidential election, Le Pen built the foundations of his political career in the European Parliament. In 1984's European elections, the Front National achieved 11% of the vote, enabling the party to send ten MEPs to Strasbourg for the first time. Le Pen would remain an MEP for almost 35 years, with some interruptions, until 2019. Still marginalised in France in the 1980s, the far-right party – founded in 1972 by former Waffen-SS members, neo-Nazi sympathisers, and nostalgic supporters of French Algeria –took advantage of the powerful platform provided by the European institutions its broaden its electoral base. From the parliamentary rostrum, Le Pen frequently launched attacks and insults. Accused of antisemitism by a German socialist in September 1988, the National Front leader retorted that his accsuser 'is a pro-Arab paedophile with sadistic tendencies.' 'For European parliamentarians, Jean-Marie Le Pen was long seen as a kind of UFO, a nationalist from the early 20th century who occasionally shouted in the corridors,' remarked sociologist Erwann Lecoeur, a specialist in the far right. 'He was rarely present in Strasbourg, never worked on any projects, didn’t understand English, and refused to speak it. He merely used European institutions to keep his party alive.' Unable to make electoral gains in France due to the majority voting system, the Front National's successes on the European stage in the 1980s enabled to establish a cadre of professional politicians and secure financial resources. In his early years in Strasbourg, Le Pen was far from a critic of what was then called the European Economic Community (EEC). He supported a 'Europe of nations' and the defence of 'European civilisation' against the Soviet threat. As Libération points out, Le Pen even advocated in his first presidential manifesto in 1974, for the 'Europeanisation of armed forces,' writing that 'the Soviet threat makes isolated French defence unrealistic and an unconvincing disparate coalition.' The ideological shift of the far-right leader occurred with France's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union and the political integration of its member states. On the evening of the results in 1992, he declared that the 'proponents of the foreign party' had won. From then on, he consistently criticised the 'European contraption,' attacking Brussels’ bureaucracy for allegedly seeking to 'destroy the nations' of the continent. Le Pen’s time in the European Parliament was also marked by numerous financial scandals. Indicted in the parliamentary assistants’ case alongside his daughter Marine – whose verdict is expected on 31 March – he was also accused by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of misusing €300,000 in parliamentary funds between 2009 and 2018. 'An historic figure of the far right, he... played a role in our country’s public life for nearly seventy years, a role that now falls under the judgment of history,' stated the Élysée in a communiqué, noting that President Macron extended 'his condolences to his family and loved ones.' Le Pen is survived by his three daughters, Marine, Marie-Caroline and Yann, and his second wife Jany.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf10XW-_SfuINs	2025-01-07T15:45:02-08:00	
What To Know About HMPV, The Virus Causing An Outbreak In China	China has reported a rise in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases in its northern region in recent weeks, raising concerns on social media that there could be another outbreak like COVID-19. Beijing has acknowledged the rise in HMPV cases and attributed it to the winter season, but the spike should not raise fears or worries about a bigger, more fatal, global health threat, according to international health experts. 'China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the usual range for the winter season,' Dr. Margaret Harris, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Tuesday. 'It is not a new virus.' Other health experts agree. 'There’s no need to be panicky. But for those folks who are in higher-risk groups, this is a time to be careful, [to] be cautious,' William Schaffner, an infectious disease physician and a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the Scientific American on Monday. What is HMPV? A common respiratory virus, HMPV is known to spike every winter and spring, health officials said. The virus has circulated among humans for at least six decades, experts added. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and nasal congestion. In severe cases, symptoms may result in bronchitis and pneumonia. HMPV usually spreads among people through coughing, sneezing, shaking hands, or touching virus-laden objects. After being exposed from the virus, a person usually falls ill within three to six days. Young children, adults who are over 65 and those that have weakened immune systems are considered to have a higher risk for serious illness. Currently, there are no vaccines to treat HMPV. Doctors usually recommend fever or pain relievers for those sick with the virus. Preventive steps include following basic hygiene measures such as washing hands with soap and water, according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC also advised the public against touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. As of Tuesday, here were how various governments across Asia have responded to the HMPV situation. MALAYSIA Malaysian health officials said HMPV cases were not new and that they were monitoring the developments. Last year, the country recorded 327 HMPV cases compared with 225 the previous year. 'The increase in acute respiratory tract infections at the end and beginning of the year is a phenomenon that is fully expected, in line with the rise in respiratory infections that have also been reported in other countries, especially those with cold seasons such as China,' the health ministry said on Saturday. INDONESIA Indonesia has HMPV cases, all involving children, according to the health ministry on Monday, without specifying a figure. 'HMPV has been in Indonesia for a long time,' health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in a statement on Monday. Although the HMPV is not a deadly virus, he advised the public to maintain a healthy lifestyle and seek medical help if needed. THAILAND Thailand has no HMPV cases present, health minister Somsak Thepsuthin said on Tuesday. But he said the ministry is ready to identify and respond to any cases should the virus be detected in the country. He urged the public to take preventive measures. PHILIPPINES Manila health officials said they were also monitoring the situation. 'Reliable sources currently do not support circulating posts on social media about an alleged international health concern. There is no confirmation from either the cited country or the [WHO],' the health department said on Jan. 3. BANGLADESH Bangladesh has not yet recorded any HMPV cases at present, news outlets quoted local health officials as saying. But the virus has always been present in the country, public health expert Mushtuq Husain told news portal bdnews24.com.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf18oUOrk3WyH_	2025-01-07T15:41:34-08:00	
Take Your Money And Shove It: The Second Long Telegram, US Aid, A...	It was as if the West’s central philosophical commitment to limited government was extirpated by a crude economic determinism that insisted on no government in Russia.' -- Peter J. Stavrakis, Kennan Institute Occasional Papers, 1993 Diplomatic advisors and analysts are a funny breed. They can be lauded as sages, called upon to clarify the complex and offer the odd lapidary statement. Such advice is often ignored and, if implemented, done selectively. The politicians back home are bound to foul things up. The National Security Archive of George Washington University, as it so often does, performed a fabulous service for historians of diplomatic history prior to Christmas by publishing an insightful cable on US-Russian relations. The 70-paragraph telegram from the US Embassy in Moscow, which has assumed the status of legend, came from analyst E. Wayne Merry in March 1994. Critical of Washington’s obsession with shock economic reform for a post-Communist Russia, the cable is now publicly available because of the Archive’s successful lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). When authored, its content was deemed so hot it had to be sent via the Dissent Channel, limiting circulation within government circles. One historical parallel regarding Merry’s cable stands out, up to a point. As the Briefing Book put together by Svetlana Savranskaya and Tom Blanton suggests, George F. Kennan’s Long Telegram authored in April 1946 is an obvious contender. Then the chief of mission to the Secretary of State in Moscow, Kennan’s assessment ('without yielding to what I feel would be dangerous degree of oversimplification') came to shape Cold War policy. From his suggestions spawned a costly, expansive global machinery based as much on astrological whim as on ideological delusion. While some of this can be laid at the feet, and mind of Kennan, it would be churlish to avoid the more tempered assessments he offered to superiors who simply picked what was expedient and useful at the time. In terms of 'practical deductions' for US policy, Kennan underlined the perceived threat: Washington faced 'a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the US there can be no permanent modus vivendi'. Soviet power, to be secure, would disrupt, destroy 'our traditional way of life' and break 'the international authority of our state'. To combat this, Kennan offered a menu list. Soviet power would, for instance, retreat when faced with 'the logic of force'. The Soviets remained, vis-à-vis the West, 'by far the weaker force.' The durability of the Soviet system had yet to prove itself. Soviet propaganda would be 'relatively easy to combat' by means of 'any intelligent and really constructive program.' In full swing as lecturing sage, Kennan urged understanding with 'courage, detachment, objectivity' of what the US was facing; educate the public about Russia while placing US dealings 'entirely on realistic and matter-of-fact basis'; ensure societal health and vigour on the home front, seeing as communism fed, 'like a malignant parasite […] on diseased tissue'; guide other nations rather than impose responsibilities; and avoid allowing 'ourselves to become like those whom we are coping.' The end of the Soviet Union, which did show parts of the Kennan assessment to have been accurate, presented an opportunity for addressing the new post-Cold War realities. The Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a political entity, with communism in harried retreat. Merry’s long telegram of March 28, 1994 echoes Kennan’s guiding tone, though it has a rather gamey taste and would never receive the tutored readership it deserved. The title is instructive: 'Whose Russia is it Anyway? Toward a Policy of Benign Respect.' It enabled Merry to furnish own warnings about US policy till that point, which had failed to consider the effects economic shock therapy was having, fed and encouraged by the swarm of US aid specialists indifferent to necessary, accompanying political reforms. Terms such as 'democracy' and 'the market', treated as synonymous, if not 'mutually dependent' terms in American rhetoric, resisted replication in the Russian context. 'Russians (and most non-Americans) are simply baffled by this vision of a societal double helix of political and economic decisions leading to a higher moral and material state of being.' It was a central contention of Merry that what was contributing to an increasingly cooling relationship between Moscow and Washington at that point was the role of foreign aid and an increasing suspicion in the country of the radical 'marketeers'. Russia had been turned into a gargantuan charity case, flooded by ignorant charity workers – of the highly specialised sort – described by local officials as 'assistance tourists'. This also meant an utter neglect in terms of reforming the civil institutions necessary for stability, including training a new civil service to supplant the command economy bureaucrats. Unlike the post-Second World War Marshall Plan that directed aid into clearly stipulated channels to stimulate growth in a devastated Western Europe, these 'assistance tourists' rarely thought of asking 'their hosts for an appraisal of Russian needs'. US assistance, he warned, had become 'a net detriment to the bilateral relationship'. Three reasons were offered: the overselling of assistance comprised primarily of 'financial intangibles and technical assistance'; the failure of much of the assistance to ever leave US shores or enter Russian hands; and the 'friction' caused by the intrusiveness of the programs and 'linking assistance with Russian actions in other spheres.' On a tart note, Merry suggests that the point had been reached 'where it is arguable that the best service our aid program could now serve could be to permit [Russian President] Boris Yeltsin publicly to tell America to take its money and shove it.' US policy towards an ailing, then moribund, and eventually extinct Soviet Union, is not a glorious tale. Promises, to be frequently broken, were made to placate and sooth the Russian psyche that eastward expansion on the spear of NATO, incorporating former Warsaw Pact states, would not take place. Russia, as vulnerable economic patient, was assured that capitalist fed prosperity was just around the corner, even as communism’s hammer and sickle, with its proletarian promise, repaired to the historical museum. While historical forces, local conditions and cultural idiosyncrasies will always guide the development of any state and community, there is something to be said that post-Cold War Russia might have taken something of a different path had Merry’s sharp words found their mark. But a hubristic atmosphere had infected Washington, heated by such neoliberal dogmatists as Larry Summers, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs between 1993 and 1995. Officials in his department went so far as to shield him from Merry’s observations, claiming they would give him 'a heart attack.' Far better to let the Russian economy suffer a cardiac arrest instead and wait for the consequences we see today.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDttIDDLdLiH_m	2025-01-07T09:20:50-08:00	
Plenitude Doubles Installed Capacity In Spain Thanks To Organic G...	Plenitude has expanded its installed capacity from renewable sources in Spain by 400 MW, reaching nearly 950 MW of photovoltaic and wind power projects, more than double compared with 2023. In particular, Plenitude has recently completed the installation of 150 MW of the Caparacena project in Granada, consisting of three photovoltaic plants nearly accounting for 50 MW capacity each. The electricity connection to the national transmission grid is ensured by a 400 kV substation, the construction of which has just been completed, and another 200 kV substation and line shared with other operators. Moreover, Plenitude also completed the construction of other plants totalling nearly 250 MW in the solar parks of Renopool, in Extremadura, and Guillena, in Andalusia. Thanks also to these operations, the company has reached its target of 4GW of installed capacity globally in 2024. 'During 2024 Plenitude has registered significant organic growth in Spain with the completion of several renewable projects realized also thanks to the good relationships we have developed locally. Spain is a strategic country for our company and we want to have a positive impact in the areas where we operate, not only economically, but also on the communities that host us' said Mariangiola Mollicone, Head of Western Europe Renewables and Managing Director of Plenitude in Spain. In addition, Plenitude in Spain has a pipeline of further nearly 820MW of plants already under construction. It is expected that this portfolio of projects will be completed between 2025 and 2026, in line with the company's long-term strategy in the renewable business and in the country. Plenitude, a company controlled by Eni, is present in more than 15 countries around the world with a business model that integrates the production of electricity from 4 GW of renewable capacity, the sale of energy and energy solutions to 10 million European customers, and an extensive network of nearly 22,000 charging points for electric vehicles. By 2027, the company has the objective to reach 8 GW of installed renewable capacity globally.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtpBoB-mSaVzK	2025-01-07T09:19:11-08:00	
Global Cooperation At A Crossroads: Possibility Amid Rising Geopo...	The World Economic Forum's Global Cooperation Barometer offers a critical assessment of the state of global cooperation, showing a world grappling with heightened competition and conflict, while also identifying various areas where leaders can drive progress through innovative collaboration. Released amid geopolitical, technological and sociopolitical upheaval, the Forum's flagship annual report underscores the urgency of addressing shared challenges and offers leaders guidance on what cooperation can look like in a shifting world. The Global Cooperation Barometer 2025, developed in collaboration with McKinsey & Company, uses 41 indicators to measure the current state of global cooperation. The aim is to offer leaders a tool to better understand the contours of cooperation broadly and along five pillars: trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. Now in its second edition, the Barometer draws on new data to provide an updated picture of the global cooperation landscape, with a particular focus on the impact of the new technological age. 'The Barometer is being released at a moment of great global instability and at a time when many new governments are developing agendas for the year, and their terms, ahead,' said Børge Brende, President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. 'What the Barometer shows is that cooperation is not only essential to address crucial economic, environmental and technological challenges, it is possible within today's more turbulent context.' 'This second edition of the Global Cooperation Barometer focuses on where cooperation stands today and what it can look like in the new technological age,' said Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner, McKinsey & Company. 'Advancing global innovation, health, prosperity and resilience cannot be done alone. Leaders will need new mechanisms for working together on key priorities, even as they disagree on others, and the past several years have shown this balance is possible.' The latest edition of the Barometer highlights that global cooperation is at a critical juncture. The report's analysis reveals that after trending positively for a decade and surpassing pre-pandemic levels, overall cooperation has stagnated. This has been driven by a sharp decline of the peace and security pillar of the Barometer over the past seven years, caused by mounting geopolitical tensions and competition which have significantly eroded global collective security. Levels of conflict and attendant humanitarian crises have increased in the past year to record levels, driven by crises including, but not limited to, the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. As the largely stable cooperative order that defined the post-Cold War period is giving way to a more fragmented landscape, solutions to pressing challenges – from climate action to technological governance – require collaboration. And despite the global security crises, the new findings indicate that collaboration has continued in various areas including vaccine distribution, scientific research, renewable energy development, and more – offering models for future cooperation. Notably, peace and security have declined sharply in recent years, but other pillars of the Barometer have remained resilient and reveal emerging opportunities for international cooperation: Innovation and technology: While geopolitical competition is rising in regard to certain frontier technologies such as semiconductors, overall global cooperation on technology and innovation advanced in 2023, in part due to digitization of the global economy. This helped drive the adoption of new technologies, a strong ramp-up in the supply of critical minerals – and a related drop in price of lithium batteries – and a rebound in student mobility. However, rapid disruption from emerging technologies such as AI is reshaping the global landscape, raising the possibility of a new frontline of geostrategic competition or even an 'AI arms race'. Cooperative leadership and inclusive strategies will be key to harness its vast potential while tackling risks. Climate and natural capital: Cooperation on climate goals improved over the past year, with increased finance flows and higher trade in low-carbon technologies such as solar, wind and electric vehicles. Yet, urgent action is required to meet net-zero targets as global emissions continue to rise. Greater global cooperation will be essential to scale up technologies and secure the financing needed to meet climate goals by 2030. Health and wellness: Some health outcomes, including life expectancy, continued to improve post-pandemic, but overall progress is slowing compared to pre-2020. While cross-border assistance and pharmaceutical R&D have declined, and cooperation on trade in health goods and international regulations stalled, various health metrics including child and maternal mortality remain strong. Given rising health risks and ageing populations, leaders should invest in global cooperation to bolster public health and sustainable health systems. Trade and capital flows: Metrics related to the flow of goods and services, trade, capital and people had mixed outcomes in 2023. Goods trade declined by 5%, driven largely by slower growth in China and other developing economies, while global fragmentation continued to reduce trade between Western and Eastern-aligned blocs. Despite this, global flows of services, capital and people showed resilience. Foreign direct investment surged, particularly in strategic sectors like semiconductors and green energy, while labour migration and remittances rebounded strongly, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, leaders will need to find ways to work together, even as competition increases, as tangible results will be crucial to maintain public trust and support. The report concludes by underscoring the urgent need for adaptive, solutions-driven leadership to navigate a turbulent global landscape. By pivoting towards cooperative solutions, leaders can rebuild trust, drive meaningful change and unlock new opportunities for shared progress and resilience in the complex years ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtlJB1Dgb_-Yx	2025-01-07T09:17:50-08:00	
Armageddon 2025: Fear Vs. Tawhid Hope – OpEd	People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of very dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024. The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 years since record-keeping began. The fearful news is that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said: 'Even if CO2 emissions were to be drastically cut down starting today, the world economy is already committed to an income reduction of 19% until 2050 due to climate change. These damages are six times larger than the mitigation costs needed to limit global warming to two degrees. And health and economic costs from three toxic chemicals used in plastics is estimated at $1.5 trillion for a single year. The study, published December 16, 2024 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed data from 38 different countries, representing one-third of the total global population. Bisphenol A (BPA), commonly found in food packaging, is an endocrine disruptor associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and reproductive disorders. BPA exposure was associated with 5.4 million cases of heart disease and 346,000 strokes, leading to 431,000 deaths. But the good news is that the 'world's largest' vacuum to suck climate pollution out of the air just opened. The challenging news is even when air pollutant concentrations decrease, health risks posed by these pollutants remain consistently high. A global research network examined data from 380 cities to assess how the effects of air pollution on mortality have changed between 1995 and 2016. The central finding: although concentrations of air pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide have decreased, the associated health risks have hardly changed. The study was published in The Lancet. The majority of Christians, Jews, and Muslims do not believe that all of humanity is moving closer and closer to a catastrophic Judgement Day. The minority who do think that Judgement Day is coming soon share the usual negative, fear-filled views of most end-times thinkers: Christians, Jews and especially Muslims, who do believe that: 'The hour (of Judgement) is near' (Qur'an 54:1); and ˹The time of˺ people's judgment has drawn near, yet they heedlessly turn away.' (Qur'an 21:1) According to a 2012 poll by the Pew Research Center, at least half of Muslims in nine Muslim-majority countries believe that the coming of the Mahdi is 'imminent,' and could happen in their lifetime. Sadly these end-times thinkers always see pre-ordained threats of cataclysmic world wide doom; and not just warning of the consequences if we humans do not repent and change our behavior. The Greek word Armageddon is a transliteration of the Hebrew har məgiddô which means a mountain near Megiddo, a hilltop fortification built by King Ahab, that dominated the Plain of Jezreel. Har Magedon is the symbol of a battle in which, when the need is greatest and believers are most oppressed, God suddenly reveals His power to distressed peoples and the evil enemies are destroyed. Armageddon is a warning of humanity's need to change to avoid Armageddon. Because temperatures in the Middle East have risen far faster than the world's average in the past three decades. Precipitation has been decreasing, and experts predict droughts will come with greater frequency and severity. And major wildfires in Europe are starting earlier in the year, becoming more frequent, doing more damage and getting harder to stop. In Africa, where 70% of livelihoods rely on nature in some form, the report showed a two-thirds fall in wildlife populations. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strain. It anticipates the end to the world as we know it; a final historical confrontation between good and evil (Armageddon); after which, with God's help, human life will be rewarded and transformed. As the Qur'an states: 'Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews, Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous good deeds, shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.' (2:62 and 5:69) Notice that the Qur'an specifically stresses religious pluralism applies on God's judgment day. And Pope Francis said: 'All Religions Are Paths To God' This is a new and very strong support for religious pluralism. Yet a Pew Research Center poll found that in South and Southeast Asia 55-60% of all Muslims believe in the Madhi's imminent return; and in the Middle East and North Africa 51% do. A hadith says that Jesus will return to a place east of Damascus and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against the false messiah, the one eyed Dajjal, Armilos in Jewish tradition. As ibn Babuya writes in Thawab ul-A'mal, 'The Apostle of God said: `There will come a time for my people when there will remain nothing of the Qur'an except its outward form, and nothing of Islam except its name, and they will call themselves by this name even though they are the people furthest from it. The mosques will be full of people but they will be empty of right guidance. 'The religious leaders (Fuqaha) of that day will be the most evil religious leaders under the heavens; sedition and dissension will go out from them and to them will it return.' This sounds, and indeed is, terrible. But, those who trust in God know that the night is coldest in the last hours before sunrise. Secularists believe that these apocalyptic visions of a future (Armageddon) are absurd, although many secularists themselves fervently believe that runaway genetic modification of food and/or extreme climate change is going to doom human civilization in future generations. The basic difference between the pessimistic, humanist secularists and the religious optimists is that those who believe in the God of Abraham also believe that God's inspiration and guidance guarantees that the spiritual forces of good, will overcome all the world's evils at the end of days; and justice, peace and religious pluralism will prevail. Or as Prophet Micah envisions it: (4:1-5) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'Torah will go out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. God will judge between many (not all) peoples and will settle disputes among powerful nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into ploughs, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war any more. 'Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the Lord Almighty has spoken. All the nations will walk in the name of their gods, and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' Thus, the Bible and the Qur'an's final judgement is the self-destruction of violent, hate filled, religion twisted terrorism and narrow 'my way or death' philosophy (Armageddon); and the victory of kindness, love, democracy and religious pluralism. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we can help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.' (Isaiah 19:23-5) Finally, if one believes that God inspired prophets are able to describe scenarios of various developments in the distant future then one has to accept that the understanding of these passages should change and improve as we come closer and closer to the times they describe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtu4Ciss7nVo3	2025-01-07T09:15:09-08:00	
Pakistan’s Christian Voices Of Suffering: Debt, Sexual Abuse, And...	Despite Pakistan outlawing bonded labor decades ago, the practice continues, hidden in the shadows and exacerbated by economic crises and poor enforcement. For hundreds of thousands of families, brick kilns have become places of generational enslavement, where debts are passed from parent to child, binding them to a life of harsh labor. In Pakistan, approximately 4.5 million workers in around 20,000 kilns remain unheard. The debt cycle in these brick kilns is crushing. Workers often borrow small amounts for urgent needs, but these loans, compounded by corruption and unforeseen illnesses, spiral into lifelong bondage. Sexual abuse, trafficking, and severe human rights violations further compound the injustices faced by these workers. In response to this crisis, permanent minority rights activist Joseph Janssen recently embarked on a mission to Pakistan, aiming to free Christian families trapped in brick kiln slavery and to seek justice for young girls and women who had been abducted and forcibly converted. Collaborating with local organizations, the team successfully rescued 100 individuals, including children, elderly family members, and five women who had endured over a decade of sexual enslavement. Among those rescued are individuals whose stories reveal unimaginable torment. One such survivor, Safia Khuram, endured over a decade of sexual enslavement. Born into a life of hardship at a brick kiln, Safia began working alongside her parents as a young child. Her family was bound to the kiln by her father's debt of approximately 100,000 rupees (around 800–900 euros), a burden that kept them enslaved. After marrying a fellow worker, she continued the relentless labor, enduring scorching temperatures each day while producing bricks. However, her hardships didn't end with physical labor. The brick kiln owner, Haji Abdul Gafoor, along with others, began sexually abusing her from the age of 12 years old. The sexual abuse continued after her marriage, exploiting moments when her husband was away. This abuse, which lasted 10 to 12 years, came with threats of violence if she resisted. The physical and emotional scars were deepened by the daily demands to produce 2,000 bricks in temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius. When she couldn't meet these demands, beatings and withheld wages became routine. Another rescued woman, Mehwish Shouqat, recalls a similarly harrowing experience. Born in Faisalabad and married into kiln labor, she and her husband, burdened by debt, were forced to work beyond their physical capacities. The owner demanded she terminate a pregnancy to remain in the labor force, and she ultimately lost one child under his pressure. For years, her family faced violence, and she endured repeated assaults, trapped by debt and unable to escape. Following these rescues, Joseph Janssen is providing legal aid to establish identity documents for the survivors, as many, including children, had no official identification. Additionally, the campaign is offering shelter, food, and skills training to help them start anew. This support brings hope for a life free from enslavement, a life in which they can work toward independence and regain control of their destinies. However, the stories of Safia, Mehwish, and others highlight a deeper issue—the urgent need for Pakistan to enforce its laws, end sexual abuse and exploitation in these industries, and protect its most vulnerable workers, Janssen added. Pakistan is a signatory to several international treaties and conventions that obligate it to eliminate bonded labor and human trafficking. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Pakistan is required to ensure the protection of fundamental rights, including the right to freedom from forced labor. Pakistan must not only strengthen the enforcement of its domestic laws but also fulfill its international obligations, provide adequate protection and rehabilitation for victims, and take concrete steps to meet these commitments while upholding the dignity and rights of its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDttORlbs475ok	2025-01-07T09:14:14-08:00	
Biden Succumbs To Pressure On Moral Issues – OpEd	For the past four years, the Catholic League has been fighting an array of public policies initiated by the Biden administration that touch on serious moral issues. We are happy to report that they have finally succumbed to pressure and are dropping four of their most morally bankrupt policies. On December 23, Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it has withdrawn a rule change that would have barred religious non-profits from claiming an exemption to the HHS mandate that was initiated by the Obama administration; it would require employers to provide abortion and contraceptive coverage in their healthcare plans. This means that the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other religious social service agencies, have cleared another bar in their pursuit of maintaining fidelity to their mission. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court twice granted religious exemptions to the HHS mandate, the Biden team still sought to deny them; they have finally backed off. We have been fighting the HHS mandate from the get-go. It was added to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in August 2011 (it became law one year later). On September 19, 2011, a month after it was announced, we registered the first of a long series of objections. We noted that the HHS mandate 'made an exception for religious employers,' but we hastened to add that 'when looked at closer, it became apparent that the exception was flatulent. To wit: a religious employer was defined, in part, as one that primarily employs, and serves, persons who share its religious tenets.' This was meant to cover houses of worship, but would extend no further. For example, it would punish the Little Sisters, and Catholic schools and hospitals, because they serve non-Catholics. But they wouldn’t be Catholic if they were forced to discriminate on the basis of religion! Over the next four months, we issued six additional public statements on the flawed HHS mandate. Then, on January 23, 2012, we made our first comment noting that the mandate was meant to force these Catholic agencies to provide for abortion-inducing drugs in their healthcare plan. Though the HHS mandate does not mention these drugs, per se, it was cleverly inserted in the provision that said 'contraceptives' covered 'emergency contraception (ulipristal acetate), and any additional contraceptives approved, granted, or cleared by the FDA.' In other words, abortion-inducing drugs such as ulipristal (known as 'Ella')—which is similar to the abortion pill RU-486—was to be included in Catholic employee healthcare plans. We subsequently issued more than a dozen public statements condemning the HHS mandate. Now, finally, this intolerant policy has been scrapped. The second policy change made by the Biden administration prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from covering transgender drug prescriptions of minors. But it was not done for principled reasons. This provision was part of the huge defense spending bill that Biden wanted, but due to Republican resistance on including transgender drug coverage for minors, he had to nix it. In Biden’s first year in office, we released a three-part series on the physical and psychological damage that transgender health procedures can cause; we also addressed how young people are being indoctrinated into thinking this is normal. So we are delighted that Biden had to kill the drug prescription provision in the DOD budget. The third policy change that Biden made at the end of December was its decision to withdraw a rule that would force schools that receive federal funds to allow boys and young men to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. On his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order saying that children 'will not be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports' on the basis of their declared sex. This was a perverse reading of Title IX, the 1972 law that mandated that women could not be discriminated against in sports. It has nothing to do with males competing against females. From 2019 to the present, we issued nearly 50 public statements and reports warning of the dangers of men crashing girls’ and women’s spaces, including sports. We also published over 40 articles on this subject in our monthly journal, Catalyst, and I included a chapter on transgenderism in my 2024 book, Cultural Meltdown. To say we are delighted with this outcome would be an understatement. We are most proud of our role in getting the Biden administration to withdraw a proposed rule that would have rescinded a rule initiated when Trump was president that secured the right of religious student organizations at public colleges and universities to maintain their beliefs and practices, free from administrative interference. The Department of Education said it made the change because during the period when public comment was allowed, it received 58,000 comments, and many expressed opposition to rescinding the Trump rule. On February 28, 2023, we detailed how the rights of religious students were being decimated on campus. More important, we called for Catholics to register their objections, providing them with directions on how to make their voice heard. Resistance matters, and we are happy to have participated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtpksEsZ2uwv0	2025-01-07T09:12:40-08:00	
2025 Declared As The ‘International Year Of Peace And Trust’ In T...	2025 has been declared as the 'International Year of Peace and Trust' in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is a Turkic state located in Central Asia. It is bordered by Uzbekistan to the north, Iran to the south, and Afghanistan to the southeast. Turkmenistan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Afghanistan was in a critical situation. Therefore, Turkmenistan made a smart move and declared its permanent neutrality. The United Nations recognized this on December 12, 1995. Since then, Turkmenistan has become a symbol of peace and is celebrating the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality this year. The Embassy of Turkmenistan in Brussels, thanks to the support of Ambassador Sapar Palvanov and diplomat Maral Rahymova, preparatifs are organized for the year 2025. A speech was given by Derya Soysal, Central Asia expert and graduate of the Free University of Brussels, highlighting Turkmenistan's significant achievements in ensuring stability in the region and world peace. Turkmenistan has become an exemplary country in international relations with its policy of permanent neutrality. December 12 is celebrated as 'Neutrality Day' in Turkmenistan, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of the United Nations' official recognition of this Central Asian country's neutral status. This neutrality status is tightly integrated into Turkmenistan's constitutional order. For example, Article 2 of the Constitution states, 'The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan forms the basis of its national and foreign policy.' Additionally, Article 68 states that the president is 'the guarantor of Turkmenistan's independence and permanent neutrality status.' UN Secretary-General António Guterres has highlighted Turkmenistan's significant role in international relations, praising the country's contributions, especially in cooperation with the UN and regional integration. Guterres expressed his satisfaction with the deepening cooperation among Central Asian countries and noted that Turkmenistan plays a central role in this process. He also mentioned that Turkmenistan has made significant progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that the UN will continue to support the country's development processes. Turkmenistan adopted the concept of neutrality as a fundamental element of its political culture and used it as a strategic tool both in the process of breaking away from Russian influence and in its integration into the international community as a post-Soviet state. Although neutrality is generally a policy adopted to avoid wars, Turkmenistan stands out as the only country to choose this status during peacetime. This policy has been shaped in line with the country's goals of strengthening its national identity and making a positive contribution to the international community. Former Turkmenistan leader Saparmurat Niyazov defined the main principles of the neutrality policy as follows: The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be preserved. There should be no interference in the internal affairs of other states. The use of force in interstate conflicts should be prevented. The role of the UN in maintaining global peace should be recognized. National interests should be fairly protected… Turkmenistan's neutrality policy has been appreciated by the international community with many concrete examples, such as its mediation role in the Tajikistan civil war and its contribution to providing humanitarian aid corridors in Afghanistan. According to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the country has been 'a turning point in the process of producing peaceful solutions.' In conclusion, Turkmenistan's neutrality policy has allowed the country to effectively defend its national, regional, and global interests and has played an important role in maintaining stability in Central Asia. The neutrality status has further strengthened the country's constructive role in regional peace, international cooperation, and economic development. Thanks to this policy, Turkmenistan is recognized as a strong advocate of peace and cooperation on the world stage.

Fall Of Syrian Regime And Regional Implications – Analysis	By Amb. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Arben P. Cici While the world's eyes and attention were focused on the new Trump administration, the consequences of its policies after January 21 in Ukraine, and the raging fires of the Middle East, a new fire flared up and died down in the blink of an eye in Syria. A pending issue took suddenly an unexpected turn. On December 8, 2024, the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime marked a historic and decisive turning point in the Syrian civil war, after nearly 14 years of conflict. This sudden defeat, despite the regime's growing difficulties, was accelerated by the rapid and coordinated advance of rebel groups, in particular Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which launched a determined offensive from Idlib province, in the northwest of the country. The offensive, which began on November 27, 2024, benefited from the strategic and military support of Turkey, a regional power directly involved in the Syrian dynamic for several years. A. A POST-ASSAD SYRIA The offensive enabled the rebels to quickly take control of the main cities and strategic urban centers of 'useful Syria' – including Aleppo, Hama, Homs and eventually Damascus. The capture of the Syrian capital was the final blow to the regime, which had been weakened by years of bloody fighting, international sanctions and significant military and economic exhaustion. Assad's overthrow was further facilitated by the gradual withdrawal of his main international supporters: Russia and Iran. These two powers, which had actively supported the regime since 2015, notably through military interventions and financial aid, gradually reduced their support for various political, strategic and economic reasons, including their reorientation towards other regional or international priorities. 1. A fragile hope for the Syrian population The fall of the regime offers oppressed Syrians, who have suffered for more than a decade under the authoritarian rule of Bashar al-Assad, a new breath of hope. Protesters, opposition groups and civilians have all too often seen their democratic aspirations suffocated, their cities destroyed and their loved ones sacrificed in the context of a brutal war. The overthrow of this regime could pave the way for a more inclusive reconstruction of the country, challenging the political status quo that has perpetuated social and economic inequalities. However, this hope remains fragile in the face of an uncertain political and security reality. Syria remains a deeply fragmented state, with multiple factions, militias and foreign powers vying for influence. The divisive landscape is not limited to rebel and loyalist groups: it also includes ethnic, religious and ideological dynamics, as well as ongoing foreign interference. 2. A fragmented Syria and areas of security vacuum The regime's failure leaves the country in a worrying security vacuum. The Syrian army, weakened by years of war, desertions and targeted Israeli attacks, is struggling to maintain stability in areas now beyond the control of loyalists. Large areas in the south, east and centre of the country are now devoid of state authority, creating fertile ground for the emergence of armed groups of all origins. Some of them risk taking advantage of this instability to strengthen their positions, exacerbating the already violent dynamics in the region. Furthermore, the withdrawal of major support from Russia and Iran has left a strategic vacuum. This could allow new foreign actors or local armed groups to play a role in Syria's political future. Israeli strikes, which have regularly attacked targets linked to Iran and its militias in the country, have also left unhealed wounds, with destroyed infrastructure and militias scattered across different regions, further complicating stability in the territory. 3. Regional consequences: a new geopolitical dynamic The fall of Assad and the overthrow of his regime have direct consequences for the regional geopolitical dynamics. Several foreign powers, including Turkey, Iran, Russia, the United States and Israel, are adapting their strategies in the region. Turkey, which supported the rebel offensive, is now seeking to increase its influence in northern Syria by consolidating its border against Kurdish influence. For their part, Iran and Russia may be forced to reconsider their strategic priorities in the region. The impact of their withdrawal from the Syrian conflict opens the door to a realignment of regional alliances, especially with powers such as Saudi Arabia or the United States, which may seek to strengthen their positions in the vacuum left by the two great powers. Israel, for its part, is likely to continue its military operations to curb Iranian influence in the region. The United States, although less directly involved in the fights for several years, must also navigate this new environment. The fall of the Syrian regime risks changing US strategic objectives, particularly in terms of counterterrorism, countering Iranian influence, and supporting opposition groups. 4. A period of uncertainty for the future While the regime's overthrow offers a historic moment, this military victory has not resolved domestic political challenges or issues related to foreign powers. Syria's future therefore remains uncertain. The prospect of rebuilding a country devastated by more than a decade of war, given the ethnic, religious, and political diversity of its population, remains complex. Many challenges remain: restoring state institutions, reconciliation between different ethnic and religious groups, the reintegration of millions of internally displaced people and Syrian refugees in their areas of origin, and the need to curb foreign interference in the country's internal affairs. Therefore, the fall of the Assad regime, while a major turning point in the history of the region, is also a period of fragility, where any political or military decision could redefine the contours of Syria and the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East. B. IRAN: AN ACCENTUATED EXISTENTIAL CRISIS The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime constitutes a major strategic shaking for Iran, which sees the collapse of one of its key regional alliances. This alliance was created during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and was based on strong geopolitical and ideological foundations, aimed in particular at countering Western influence and establishing an axis of resistance against Israel and the United States in the Middle East. The loss of this alliance would mean for Tehran a significant reduction of its influence in the region and a questioning of its ability to influence regional dynamics through its relations with the Syrian regime and its allied militias. 1. Weakening of the axis of resistance The fall of the Syrian regime weakens the axis of resistance led by Iran, which had played a key role in supporting groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. This axis represented not only a military strategy, but also a political lever to thwart the ambitions of Israel and the Western powers in the region. With the loss of Damascus as a key strategic ally, Iran finds itself facing a situation of increasing vulnerability, both on the security and political levels. This new reality poses a major challenge for Iran, whose influence in Syria had allowed it to monitor the movements of its adversaries, control certain flows of allied militias, and strengthen its ambitions in the regional war against its rivals. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of foreign supporters such as Russia, Tehran must redouble its efforts to maintain control in this part of the Middle East, while trying to manage its relations with other rival powers. 2. The issue of succession and the rise of internal disputes The crisis is also internal. The issue of the succession of Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Revolution, is at the center of all concerns. Khamenei, in office since 1989, is aging, and his imminent departure risks creating a power vacuum with critical consequences for the stability of the Iranian regime. This moment of political transition comes in a context characterized by a surge in domestic protests, which reflect the population's fatigue facing the economic hardship, international sanctions, and political restrictions. In front of this situation, the reformist wing of the regime, represented by political figures in favor of the dialogue with the West, is returning to the forefront. These reformists are calling for a review of Iranian foreign policy, in particular through the resumption of negotiations with Western powers over Iran's nuclear program and economic sanctions. However, their credibility has been seriously weakened since the United States withdrew from the nuclear agreement (JCPOA) in 2018, plunging Iran into a period of increasing international isolation and under significant economic pressure. This fragile situation is pushing the Iranian regime to reactivate its nuclear policy, in the faint hope of strengthening its position in the upcoming negotiations with the new US administration. The aim would be to demonstrate both its capacity to resist international pressure and its strategic ambitions in the always unstable regional context. 3. A cautious approach to avoid escalation To maintain their influence while minimizing risks, pro-Iranian militias must act with increased strategic caution. They are seeking to move in this complex balance, strengthening their positions along the Iraq-Syria border without provoking new clashes with Israel or Western powers. The goal would be to consolidate their military and political capabilities while maintaining some stability in their operations. This strategy also includes strengthening their relations with the Iraqi government, which remains divided on the issue of the militias' position within the Iraqi state. The willingness and steps to secure the border could allow the militias to prove their usefulness in the fight against regional threats, including residues of the Islamic State and smuggling, positioning themselves as key players in Iraq's national security. 4. A period of strategic uncertainty The combination of the collapse of the Syrian regime, domestic protests, regional instability, and international pressures puts Iran in an extremely vulnerable position. The regime must now navigate across a complex situation where any decision – whether on nuclear negotiations, regional stability or internal crisis management – could have significant consequences. In this context, the revival of Iranian nuclear policy seems to be a way for Tehran to reposition itself on the international chessboard, while seeking to compensate for its domestic and regional weaknesses. The outcome of this strategy remains uncertain, as it will depend not only on Iran's ability to consolidate allies and strategic objectives, but also on the willingness of Western powers, especially the United States, to engage in dialogue and negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Thus, Iran's existential crisis is multidimensional: it is geopolitical, economic, domestic and nuclear. Faced with this situation, Tehran will probably have to adopt a pragmatic approach while maintaining its strategic ambitions to avoid an irreversible weakening on the regional and international stage. C. GULF MONARCHIES FACING REGIONAL THREATS 1. Gulf monarchies: new dynamics The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime marks an important strategic turning point for the Gulf monarchies, which now find themselves facing new geopolitical and strategic challenges in their approach to Syria. This situation, caused by the collapse of a key regional actor, is forcing these states to review their priorities, alliances and strategies for preventing prolonged instability in the region, while seeking to protect their national and regional interests. The relations between Iran and the Gulf monarchies have been for a long time characterized by geopolitical, religious and economic conflicts. The fragile balance between these powers is now being tested, with Assad's fall as a new disruptive element. In front of potential threats, these monarchies have maintained an uncompromising stance, seeking to strengthen their military capabilities and international alliances to counter Tehran's influence. The regional dynamics do not stop there. The Gulf monarchies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, continue to closely monitor Iranian expansionism. These countries, often in opposition to Tehran, remain steadfast in their security and diplomatic approaches. Any Israeli attempt at escalation, or any Iranian initiative aimed at exploiting the vacuum left by Assad's fall, would be considered as a direct threat by these states. 2. A period of strategic reassessment Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the Gulf monarchies have adopted different stances regarding the conflict. The differences between them – particularly between Qatar and its neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – are reflected in their different approaches to foreign policy, security, and alliances. However, with the fall of the Assad regime, these differences may change, prompting the Gulf countries to consider more cooperative approaches to ensure regional stability and their strategic interests. 3. Qatar's potential role in reconstruction Qatar is in a particular position. After breaking diplomatic relations with Damascus in 2011, the country had distanced itself from the Syrian regime due to its support for moderate opposition groups and opposition to Assad's policies. However, with the fall of the regime, Qatar could position itself as a key player in the reconstruction phase of Syria. By seeking to play a central role in the reconstruction, Qatar hopes to limit the risk of 'protracted chaos' that could have negative consequences for the region as a whole, particularly in terms of migration flows or political instability. This move also aims to strengthen the country's regional influence by repositioning itself as a diplomatic actor capable of promoting stability and reconciliation. Qatar could invest in humanitarian aid programs, infrastructure reconstruction initiatives, and economic projects aimed at restoring stability in areas devastated by the conflict. This approach would offer Qatar not only a way to contribute to the reconstruction, but also to improve its relations with the various opposition groups and international powers involved in the reconstruction process. 4. Saudi Arabia: Preserving regional stability and Syria's sovereignty For Saudi Arabia, the priority is clear: preserving Syria's sovereignty and preventing any destabilization that could have negative consequences for the entire Middle East. Riyadh remains concerned about Iran's influence in the region, especially in the context of the Syrian crisis. The fall of the Assad regime, while seen as an opportunity to limit Iranian influence, also raises concerns about the potential spread of militias or armed groups into unstable areas of Syria. Saudi Arabia may thus seek to balance its relations with Syria with a strategic objective of stabilizing the region, while continuing to exert pressure on Iran through political and economic means. At the same time, Riyadh may play an active role in diplomatic mediation, to strengthen its relations with the various Syrian factions while working with Western powers to stabilize the country. 5. United Arab Emirates: a pragmatic and balanced approach The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for its part, is adopting a more pragmatic and balanced approach in responding to the fall of the Syrian regime. The Emirates restored relations with Damascus in 2018, marking a change in regional dynamics and a willingness to contribute to regional stability by working towards a dialogue approach with Syria. This strategy allows them to maintain a certain influence in the Syrian political game, while seeking to limit the expansion of Iranian influence in the region. The Emirates are thus continuing diplomatic, economic and strategic efforts to strengthen their position in the regional game without engaging in direct clashes with their regional rivals. This more measured approach also aims to strengthen relations with the major Western powers and their regional partners. 6. Towards increased cooperation despite differences Despite the historical and political differences that have sometimes hindered unity within the Gulf monarchies, the fall of Assad seems to create a favorable dynamic for increased cooperation between these states. The common challenges posed by Syrian instability, the fight against Iranian influence and the need to stabilize the region are pushing these countries to put aside their differences for creating a common front. This new dynamic could take the form of dialogue mechanisms, joint economic projects, or even new diplomatic initiatives aimed at promoting Syrian reconciliation and reconstruction. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be able to overcome internal tensions, particularly between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, and create a coherent and stable regional framework. 7. A new regional balance is emerging The fall of the Assad regime is thus leading to a reassessment of the political dynamics in the Persian Gulf, with each state seeking to navigate across this new geopolitical environment while protecting its own interests. For the Gulf monarchies, the objective is clear: to stabilize the region, avoid the spread of Iranian influence, support Syrian reconstruction and strengthen their respective positions in a context of regional strategic renewal. The coming period will be crucial, as it could allow the Gulf monarchies to play a greater role in the Syrian dynamics, reaffirming their capacity to resolve their internal disputes and to impose themselves as key actors in reconstruction and diplomacy. D. IRAQ: PRO-IRANIAN MILITIAS FACING A NEW EQUILIBRIUM The instability in Syria, especially with the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, opens a new geopolitical chapter for Iraq and its pro-Iranian militias. These groups, especially those integrated within the Hashd al-Chaabi (or Popular Mobilization Units), could take advantage of this situation to consolidate their positions in the region, secure their supply routes, and strengthen their political and military legitimacy by increasing operations along the Iraq-Syria border. However, this dynamic is accompanied by many challenges and risks, especially due to the presence of Israel and the American stance on Iranian influence. 1. Pro-Iranian militias and their strategy in Iraq Pro-Iranian militias, particularly those that are part of the Hashd al-Shaabi, played a crucial role in the reoccupation of Iraqi territories that fell under the control of the Islamic State between 2014 and 2018. Their effectiveness in these operations consolidated their status as military and political actors in Iraq, giving them legitimacy among certain Shiite political factions. Faced with domestic and regional challenges, these militias now see the Syrian situation as an opportunity to strengthen their capabilities. By securing the Iraqi-Syrian border, they aim not only to prevent the return of terrorist groups, but also to create a strategic corridor that allows them to facilitate trade with their regional allies, particularly Iran. Such efforts could increase their control in the region, consolidating their interests in an unstable regional context. However, their strategic ambitions must be balanced by broader political and security stances. The increased interference in the Syrian dynamic risks attracting negative reactions from rival powers and Western states, especially Israel. 2. Iraq in a new regional order The impact of the Syrian situation on Iraq goes beyond simple militia dynamics. The new regional balance, marked by the collapse of the Assad regime, the rise of rival powers, and Tehran's desire to strengthen its influence, places Iraq at the center of new strategic maneuvers. Therefore, pro-Iranian militias could not only increase their military prerogatives, but could also play a key role in the internal political dynamics in Iraq, strengthening their partnership with Iran to operate in this new environment. Shortly, while pro-Iranian militias have the opportunity to expand their legitimacy and capabilities through Syrian instability, they also face major challenges: Israeli actions, the Trump administration's stance, domestic pressures in Iraq, and regional uncertainties. The ability of these militias to adapt and avoid an escalation in their actions could determine their future in the region and beyond their role in the new strategic balance in the Middle East. E. TURKEY: A KEY PLAYER ON THE RISE The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime represents a major strategic turning point for Turkey, with consequences that extend to its domestic politics, regional strategy and international relations, as well. In front of this new regional configuration, Ankara finds itself facing several major challenges, particularly the management of the Syrian refugee issue, the intensification of its military operations in Syria and its relations with Western and regional powers. 1. The case of Syrian refugees at the heart of the domestic debate Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, Turkey has hosted around 3 million Syrian refugees on its territory, due to its geographical proximity to Syria and its initial 'open door policy'. However, this situation has created internal, economic and political tensions in a country that is already facing structural economic challenges. The fall of the Assad regime has revived this debate. The question of the possible return of these refugees to Syria is now at the heart of political and social concerns in Turkey. For a long time, a divisive issue, it now enjoys broad consensus among both the Turkish population and political leaders, particularly due to the need to disengage the country from this humanitarian crisis and reduce social pressures. Ankara hopes now to facilitate the return of refugees as part of a reconstruction plan in Syria, with the support of the international community. However, these projects face several obstacles, including the ongoing insecurity in many Syrian regions, the lack of adequate infrastructure, and political rivalries between local groups and foreign powers. Turkey will therefore have to navigate a delicate balance between the domestic imperatives related to integrating and resettling these refugees and its international obligations, seeking to avoid any rush in the return process. 2. Turkish military operations and ambitions in Syria The fall of the Syrian regime also gives new impetus to Turkey's military ambitions in northeastern Syria. For several years, Ankara has supported rebel groups and conducted military operations to secure its borders and weaken groups it considers threats to its national security, namely groups linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Syrian forces allied with the United States. On the ground, the advance of Turkish army auxiliary troops in northeastern Syria, often composed by Syrian opposition groups, could intensify after the fall of Assad. These maneuvers are intended to create a security buffer zone to counter Kurdish threats and to ensure the potential stability of the Turkish-Syrian border. However, these actions are not without friction. The United States and Iraq have expressed concerns about regional stability, especially in the Iraq-Syria border area, where Turkey is seeking to expand its influence. The intensification of these operations may also be criticized by the international community, especially because of the risks of a resurgence of extremist groups such as the Islamic State (IS) in these destabilized areas. Therefore, Turkey will have to manage these operations with increased caution to avoid a new surge of extremism in a region already ravaged by multifaceted conflicts. 3. Expanding the buffer zone: a risky strategy In this context, Ankara is considering strengthening its buffer zone in Syria. The strategy aims to create a safe region under Turkish control where refugees can be resettled, preventing the expansion of hostile groups such as Kurdish militias or ISIS. However, this expansion would involve new negotiations with Western powers, especially the United States, and with other regional players such as Iran.Managing such a buffer zone is complex, requiring not only military cooperation but also broad diplomatic and economic support. Western powers, especially the United States, may see these actions as a challenge to their influence in the region, while Iran remains a key player with its own strategic ambitions in Syria. Therefore, Turkey will have to maneuver skillfully in this strategic game, balancing its security interests, its relations with its international partners, and its ambitions to stabilize the region through mechanisms of military control. 4. The resurgence of the Islamic State: a major concern The possible resurgence of the Islamic State in this new regional balance remains a major concern for Ankara. Although ISIS has lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq, the current security vacuum, especially in northeastern Syria, could allow the terrorist group to rise from the ashes. Thus, Turkey faces a dual challenge: securing its borders by preventing the resurgence of ISIS, while managing its relations with Western powers in this context of security fragility. In this context, Turkish military operations in the region can be seen as a means of preventing attacks by the Islamic State and assuring the presence of its authority in an increasingly complex environment. 5. Towards a strategically reoriented Turkey The fall of the Assad regime and the new dynamics in Syria require Ankara to reorient its strategy on several levels: managing refugees, securing its borders, consolidating its military operations in northeastern Syria, and expanding its buffer zone. At the same time, Turkey will need to maintain a delicate balance with its Western allies, especially in the context of its regional ambitions and tense relations with the United States. In this new environment, Turkey emerges as a key and central, but rapidly growing, player seeking to strengthen its regional influence while avoiding international isolation. The evolution of its strategy in this context will determine not only its role in the reconstruction of Syria, but also its important positioning in the new geopolitical balance of the Middle East. F. KURDISH TERRITORIES OF NORTHEASTERN SYRIA: AMONG STRATEGIC THREATS AND CHALLENGES The Kurdish regions in northeastern Syria, mostly grouped under the name 'Rojava', after the fall of the Syrian regime find themselves at the heart of a complex game of geopolitical dynamics. These territories, already weakened by the multi-year conflict, are facing additional major threats, due to the advancement of auxiliary troops of the Turkish army, which are pursuing their security objectives in this strategic region. 1. A potentially destabilizing Turkish military advance In the context of the fall of the Assad regime and the ongoing geopolitical recompositions, Turkey is intensifying its operations in northeastern Syria. These operations rely on the use of local proxies (Syrian rebel groups supported by Ankara) and aim to create a safe defensive zone to limit the influence of Kurdish groups in the region. Since the start of its military operations in 2016, Ankara has consolidated its presence in key regions, seeking to weaken the armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and its local allies. The 1998 agreement with Hafez al-Assad, often referred to as the Adana Agreement, allowed Turkey to create a de facto buffer zone on the Syrian border, weakening the PKK's capabilities in southeastern Turkey. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the creation of a security vacuum, Ankara sees opportunities to expand this buffer zone, based on its military operations and its support for local rebel groups. But, intensifying these operations could also be dangerous, especially taking into consideration the emergency of maintaining stability in the Iraqi-Syrian border area, required by Baghdad and the United States. This stability is essential to prevent regional instability from creating new spaces that could be exploited by groups such as the Islamic State (IS), which is seeking to regroup and re-emerge in the context of a deteriorating security situation. 2. The Kurds' position in the face of these challenges The Kurds, especially those of the Rojava Autonomous Administration, face major challenges with this Turkish advance. Indeed, their autonomy in northeastern Syria is constantly threatened by Ankara's ambitions, which seeks to dismantle their territorial control. This dynamic places Kurdish forces in a particularly vulnerable position, due to their dependence on Western powers such as the United States, but also because of their fight against the Islamic State. The Kurds managed to impose themselves as a key force in the fight against the Islamic State in the years 2014-2019, particularly thanks to the help of the international coalition. However, their relationship with Western powers is complex, characterized by ad hoc cooperation but also strategic divergences with the United States and its allies in the region. This factor has left the Kurds in a delicate situation in front of Turkish operations, which are aimed not only at neutralizing the PKK but also at weakening the political and military autonomy of Rojava. 3. Western interests in the region: a precarious balance Turkey is seeking to consolidate its position in northeastern Syria by exploiting the security vacuum to increase its influence. However, it must deal with Western strategic interests in the region, especially in the context of a Syrian context that remains unstable and is likely to favor the reemergence of the Islamic State. The United States and its Western partners have provided military support to Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIS, helping to contain the group in several key regions. This dynamic creates pressure on Turkey, which wants to weaken Kurdish capabilities while limiting the risk that regional instability could pave the way for the resurgence of ISIS. The desire to maintain stability while respecting strategic alliances with Turkey remains a difficult balance for Western powers to maintain it.The dynamic is further complicated by the fact that Turkey and its Western allies sometimes have different visions on the stabilization strategy in the region, particularly to the importance that Ankara attaches to military operations against Kurdish militias, while the West remains focused on the fight against ISIS and political stabilization. 4. The future of Rojava and its strategic challenges Faced with Turkish threats, the Kurds must carefully navigate between several emergencies: preserving their political autonomy, strengthening their cooperation with the United States and the international coalition, and resisting Ankara's military advances. The future of Rojava will depend on their ability to balance their relations with their Western allies and strengthen their governing and defense capacities in front of security challenges and political ones. The situation in northeastern Syria therefore remains unstable, characterized by competing ambitions, geopolitical rivalries, and internal militant dynamics. The Kurds, while continuing to fight the Islamic State, must also prepare a more political and less military response to Turkish expansionist ambitions while seeking mechanisms for dialogue with their Western partners to avoid strategic isolation in an increasingly unstable environment. Turkey, for its part, will need to navigate within the same dynamic with clear strategic calculations, integrating pressure from the United States, Iraq, and its own internal security objectives into a delicate balance. G. JORDAN: GROWING CONCERNS Jordan, located on Syria's western border, remains a key player in the current regional dynamic. Faced with the turmoil caused by the fall of the Syrian regime and the rise of groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in several regions, Amman sees this situation as a potential risk factor for its internal stability. 1. Growing Islamist influence Jordan is particularly concerned about the growing Islamist influence in Syria. HTS, which is a group that emerged from Syrian jihadist groups and is strongly rooted in Idlib province, represents a destabilizing factor in the region. This increase in power is seen as a worrying signal for Jordan, which has faced internal challenges related to Islamist dynamics in the past. There is also concern that these groups could expand their influence into border areas or encourage factions of their followers within Jordan itself. Such a dynamic would have significant political and security implications, especially given the historical ties and existing cross-border networks in the region. 2. Legislative elections and the strengthening of the Islamic Action Front Another important factor is the political growth of internal Islamist groups in Jordan. In the September 2024 legislative elections, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the country's main Islamist party, won a significant number of seats. This victory is largely attributed to popular discontent generated by the war against Hamas, growing economic difficulties, and the perception that the current government's policies have failed to meet the social aspirations of the population. Even if political stability remains globally ensured by the traditional weight of Jordanian tribes in the internal balance, this electoral dynamic indicates increased polarization and a rise in Islamist influence, which, according to some analysts, could weaken state control in some regions. The potential impact of these changes could disrupt the kingdom's internal political balances, especially in the western region bordering Syria. 3. Pressures on the Syrian Border Jordan faces increasing security and migration pressures on its western border, with the continued flow of Syrian refugees and the dynamics of the constant evolving regional conflict. The fall of the Syrian regime has brought new security uncertainties along this border, particularly with the increased presence of Islamist groups and their potential efforts to infiltrate the region. In this context, Jordan will need to strengthen its control capacities while avoiding compromising its relations with foreign powers, particularly the United States and members of the international coalition. At the same time, the kingdom must continue to balance its efforts to limit migratory pressures while maintaining its domestic political stability. 4. Towards a precarious balance The combination of growing Islamist influence in Syria, domestic concerns over the election results, and cross-border dynamics places Jordan in a delicate position. The authorities must carefully maneuver between preserving their domestic political interests, securing their borders, and managing their relations with regional and international actors. Thus, while Jordan remains a key player in regional stability, it must also navigate this complex context with caution, where rising tensions in Syria, combined with domestic challenges, could compromise its fragile balances. H. ISRAEL: A DECISIVE PLAYER IN A SHAKEN MIDDLE EAST The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime represents a major strategic upheaval for Israel, defining a turning point in the regional dynamics to which the country must adapt. Israel remains one of the most attentive actors to developments in Syria, particularly due to its security concerns, geostrategic ambitions, and its rivalries with Iran. After the overthrow of the Assad regime, Israel's position, in this new context, appears on several geopolitical axes. 1. A security opportunity: weakening Iran For several years, Israel has considered Iran one of its main strategic threats, due to Iranian support for Shiite militias in Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. The collapse of the Syrian regime, along with the withdrawal of some of Assad's traditional military support capabilities, weakens Iran's position in the region. Israel has undertaken uninterrupted military operations in Syria to paralyze Iranian influence. The strikes have targeted weapons depots, military positions and arms transfers destined for Hezbollah, which enjoys Tehran's support. This dynamic has helped weaken the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis, while giving Israel strategic space to maneuver for countering Iranian influence. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the resulting security vacuum, Israel may seek to strengthen this dynamic by consolidating its positions on the ground and maintaining constant pressure on Iranian-backed groups. However, this strategy carries risks, especially due to the complexity of regional dynamics and the ongoing instability in some Syrian regions. In his recent statements, following the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah, Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to maintain constant pressure on Iran and its militias in order to prevent any military or strategic reinforcement in the region. This strategy of destabilization and deterrence has exacerbated Iranian vulnerability, which will now have to maneuver between internal and external pressures simultaneously. 2. An opportunity to control the Iran-Syria axis The fall of the Assad regime also weakens the traditional axis of cooperation between Iran and Syria. Israel sees this dynamic as an opportunity to limit the expansion of Tehran-backed groups in Syria, strengthening its ability to operate militarily in the region without having to face a resilient and consolidated Syrian regime. By controlling the situation in key regions, including through targeted military strikes, Israel is seeking to prevent the creation of a land corridor connecting Iran to Lebanon, which would be an important strategic lever for Tehran. This corridor is seen as a key factor in Iran's regional expansion strategy, and its neutralization remains one of Israel's strategic priorities. In this context, the fall of the Assad regime gives Israel a better opportunity to strengthen its military position and relations with regional partners, such as Turkey or even some moderate Arab countries, while continuing its actions against Iran. 3. Relations with the United States and Western allies Israel's strategic position is also influenced by relations with the United States and its policies towards the region after the fall of the Syrian regime. The United States, with its partial withdrawal and pragmatic approach to the region, supports Israel in its determination to contain Iran while seeking to stabilize the situation in Syria through diplomatic and military means. Israel is now recalibrating its priorities in this new environment. With the Iranian threat as a backdrop, Israel wants to maintain a strategic balance in cooperation with the United States and other Western powers, while demonstrating its ability to take independent military action for protecting its interests. 4. Domestic challenges: maintaining security and responding to regional tensions The situation following the fall of the Assad regime also presents domestic challenges for Israel. The security vacuum in Syria, especially in some regions near its borders, could allow a resurgence of extremist groups or new hostile factions. Israel will need to closely monitor developments in the Golan Heights, a strategic region bordering Syria, where extremist groups could benefit from the regional chaos. Israel will also need to remain vigilant to internal dynamics within its Arab neighbors. The fall of Assad could open up new spaces for extremist groups or cross-border conflicts. This situation, combined with Iran's ambitions to maintain a regional presence, forces Israel to strengthen its surveillance and military capabilities to meet new security challenges. 5. Israel: A player to watch Israel remains one of the main obstacles to pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. For several years, the Jewish state has undertaken military operations aimed at weakening Iranian influence in the region, including striking Iranian-linked military targets in Syria. However, these operations are not limited to Syria. Israel has already carried out strikes in Syria, targeting weapons depots, militia centers, and military infrastructure attributed to groups backed by Tehran. The buffer zone is no longer taboo because the Israeli forces have crossed the border into the Golan Heights, moving significantly closer to the capital, Damascus. In this context, the collapse of the Syrian regime and the resulting instability could encourage Israel to intensify its military operations in Iraq, given that the Iran-Syria-Iraq axis poses a strategic threat. The Trump administration, while more aggressive towards Iran than some of its predecessors, has also shown determination towards a gradual US disengagement and support for actions aimed at containing Iranian influence in the region. This dynamic creates a particularly fragile environment for pro-Iranian militias. Their desire to secure their strategic objectives could conflict with Israeli and American positions, which remain determined to limit the expansion of Iranian influence. In this new regional environment marked by the collapse of the Syrian regime, Israel is adapting a pragmatic strategy, combining targeted military actions with enhanced diplomatic cooperation. Israel's objective remains clear: to contain Iran, weaken its regional backers, and maintain its military and security superiority, while taking advantage of the vacuum created by Assad's fall for reshaping its strategic positions.This strategy, however, faces uncertainties in the region. Israel will have to manage not only the rise of Islamist groups like HTS, but also the broader dynamics of regional competition, including powers like the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Through its capacity for foresight, military preparedness, and alliances, Israel remains a key player in this complex context, determined to secure its strategic interests in a Middle East in full restructuring. CONCLUSION: A NEW REGIONAL EQUILIBRIUM The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime marks the end of a political era in the Middle East and paves the way for an extremely complex geopolitical recomposition. This major upheaval, which resulted through a combination of internal efforts, foreign intervention, and regional dynamics, has profoundly altered the balance of power in the region. However, despite this symbolic shift, stability is still precarious and many challenges remain. The demise of the Syrian regime, as it was known, does not mean the end of conflicts or the solution of historical crises. Syria remains a fragmented country, with rebel groups, militias, foreign powers, and sectarian dynamics that will continue to shape its future. In this sense, Assad's fall is not an end point, but a new chapter in a civil war that remains marked by diverse interests and multiple geopolitical ambitions. More broadly, this situation is leading to a repositioning of regional and international players. Turkey, Iran, Israel, the United States, Russia, and other powers all have overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests, generating new tensions and new alliances in an already unstable regional context. This dynamic is redrawing the boundaries of influence, while placing the fight against extremist groups such as the Islamic State at the center of strategic priorities. Moreover, it seems that the fall of the Assad regime could have consequences for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even if the latter risks falling into the background in a context where regional stability remains fragile. The priorities of many powers are now oriented towards reconstruction, militia management, and security stabilization, reducing attention to the Palestinian issue. This situation underscores the need to remember the historical dimensions of the conflict while taking into account new geopolitical realities. In short, while the fall of the Syrian regime represents a decisive turning point, it constitutes neither a solution nor a new established order. On the contrary, it creates a new regional equilibrium, where ambitions, alliances, power struggles, and political aspirations will continue to shape the Middle East. Stability and peace in the region will depend on the ability of regional and international powers to manage these dynamics with pragmatism, cooperation, and long-term strategic vision.

Bracing For Hurricane Trump In 2025 – Analysis	By Yves Tiberghien Over the past five years, the Indo-Pacific has witnessed intensifying great power competition and a series of social and political disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ripple effects of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The coming of an unconstrained and revolutionary Donald Trump 2.0 administration is likely to trigger even more disruption. Ultimately, it will be the choices made by China in response to the opening salvos of the Trump 2.0 administration, as well as the constraining and balancing choices made by large middle powers in the region that will define the outcomes in 2025. Events are driven by the confluence of three trends — the shift from a unipolar world to a hybrid bipolar and multipolar world; the exhaustion of the liberal globalisation experiment; and the disruptive pressures stemming from the shocks of climate change, green tech and the AI revolution. These trends have turned the United States — the superpower at the heart of the current global order — into an insurgent against the system it created. After seven decades building a tight economic and security order that delivered prosperity and freedom for an ever-growing majority, the United States is now bent on destroying key pillars of that order. The policy fireworks following 20 January 2025 in Washington DC will not be minor adjustments. Rather, Trump’s promised wholesale trade war and US withdrawal from international institutions represent a frontal attack on the post-1919 efforts to promote peace and prosperity through international law, institutions, norms and cooperation. Trump’s calls for massive increases in military spending and threats against friendly countries represent a return to 19th century might-is-right diplomacy. Institutional inertia may initially constrain the Trump administration’s efforts, as they did in 2016–20. In Trump’s first term, the US–China trade war did not lead to the unravelling of globalisation because of the critical role played by connector countries. But the president-elect is certain to have a lot more leeway this time around. The more serious constraint will be the core divide at the heart of the incoming administration between trade and burden-sharing hawks and bipolar security hawks who are considering a Ronald Reagan-like military surge to defeat China. US policy toward key allies such as Japan and South Korea and toward strategic middle players such as Vietnam, will be fiercely disputed between the two groups. Incoherence may well hamper the thrust of revolution in US strategy. Elites in Indo Pacific countries struggle to predict and wrap their heads around the coming Trump storm. Most leaders in the Indo-Pacific remain committed to a liberal and rules-based order. They seek stability and only incremental policy change, even in the face of a Chinese revisionist agenda. US allies in the region wish to push back against Chinese threats, but in a way that maintains a global rules-based order. Leaders in the region are struggling to adjust psychologically to what is coming as it goes against decades of known interactions with the United States and habits of US leadership in building international institutions. Policy elites around the region are puzzled as to why the United States would want to destroy the greatest system of institutional and soft power that the world has seen. For the Indo-Pacific, the question is whether the region can hold on to its extraordinary gains from prosperity in the face of a US insurgency and a dangerous escalation in US–China relations. Clearly, the incoming US administration will be the first mover with salvos of trade tariffs, additional technology embargos against, demands to lift military spending by reluctant allies and possible new military deployments. Trump and some of his core business supporters, such as Elon Musk, Stephen Schwarzman or Peter Thiel could ultimately seek a deal with China. But given his foreign and security team and the positioning of the US system relative to China, this is unlikely The second mover will be China. China has three options — deflect, escalate or hedge. China’s ultimate choice is hard to predict, and may evolve according to the intensity of threat perceptions. The first option would be to take a page from Sun Tzu, the famed Chinese strategist, and avoid taking the bait. Instead, China could absorb the punches, lie low, stand for the liberal economic order and pursue diplomatic options. There would be tactical and political costs, but potential long-term strategic gains. Second, China could do what it did in 2018–22 and face off with the United States at every move. This would include security confrontation around key hot spots, more trade measures on critical minerals and key technologies and an escalation of diplomatic confrontation. Under Trump 1.0, this approach played well politically at home in the short-term but led to disastrous diplomatic outcomes. Indeed, through its wolf-warrior diplomacy, aggressive maritime deployments in the region and a senseless border war with India, China’s soft power was diminished greatly. Third, China could take indirect risk management actions through alternative institutions and bilateral engagement around the region, backed by a vast fiscal expansion at home to protect its economy. China’s recent actions, including the critical breakthrough in the border standoff with India, indicate that this might be the dominant approach that China is currently pursuing. China’s choice will be critical, as will be the response of third movers, namely the increasingly powerful middle powers of the Global South, such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and others in Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Meanwhile, allied middle powers such as Japan, Korea, Australia and Canada will face great constraints under Trump 2.0 given their security dependence on the United States. But they may find ways, collectively, to restrain the more extreme impulses of the new administration. The stakes are high. Major unconventional moves by the United States or pre-emptive moves by China could well trigger a mega crisis in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea or on the Korean Peninsula. The outcomes are unknown. The United States will call the opening shots. China will set the nature of the game through its response. But third countries, as well as financial markets, will have a big influence on the shape of the post-Trump world, should they choose to use the leverage they now have.

Reevaluating Jimmy Carter’s Presidency – OpEd	The consensus among historians, journalists, and analysts has long been that President Jimmy Carter’s four-year presidency was a low point in a decent man’s century-long life. In fact, the implicit rap on Carter was that he brought a naïvete to public office that, at best, required a certain moral flexibility. Now that Carter has passed at the age of 100, this simplistic and conventional narrative of his presidency should be reassessed. Let’s not forget that the voters chose Carter’s principled approach in the 1976 election because of the long national disillusionment surrounding the JFK and MLK assassinations, LBJ and Nixon’s dishonest debacle in Vietnam, Nixon’s criminal activities during Watergate, and Gerald Ford’s trashing the rule of law by pardoning his predecessor even before charges were filed. Voters yearned to bring back some semblance of morality and honesty to government. Upon arriving in office, Carter was so squeaky clean that he refused to intimidate lawmakers or horse-trade with Congress to adopt policies on his agenda. If Republican Richard Nixon is regarded as the last progressive president before Barack Obama, Democrat Carter was the first conservative president since Calvin Coolidge. Carter laid the basis for more conservative policies before Ronald Reagan perfected the sales pitch. In addition to opposing interest groups feeding at the public trough, Carter championed limiting the federal government, cutting the federal budget, deregulating industries, and greater local and personal responsibility. He believed welfare eroded the family and the work ethic. In a herculean effort, Carter fully or partially deregulated four sectors of the economy: finance, communication, energy, and transportation, making them more efficient. At first, Carter contributed to the inflation left over from the Vietnam War and Nixon’s permissive monetary policy. However, Carter then appointed inflation hawk Paul Volcker as Fed chairman, who slammed on the monetary brakes, which caused a soft economy and then a recession but made possible the economic growth during Reagan’s administration. Analysts have rightly claimed that Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 election because of stagflation (a sluggish economy and inflation) and the Iran hostage crisis. In the long term, Carter helped solve both of those crises, but at election time, the results weren’t in yet. In the hostage crisis, he didn’t fall victim to the hawks’ criticism that he should attack Iran, which would have gotten the hostages killed. Of course, at election time, this made him look weak. Reagan apparently succeeded in delaying the release of the hostages until after he was elected president, but Carter had negotiated their release. Even Carter’s substantial domestic achievements were eclipsed by his foreign policy successes. His negotiation of the Camp David peace accords and Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is one of the few lasting peace agreements in the Middle East (even the later Oslo accords have failed). Disregarding the hawks, Carter ended the embarrassing U.S. colonial presence in the Canal Zone in the middle of sovereign Panama. Furthermore, Richard Nixon’s opening to China got all the attention, but the improvement of relations between the United States and China languished until Carter formally recognized China. Finally, Carter signed the SALT II agreement with the Soviets, which limited nuclear arms but was never ratified by the Senate. Nonetheless, both countries abided by its terms. In my book, Recarving Rushmore: Ranking the Presidents on Peace, Prosperity, and Liberty, which ranks the presidents on the end results of their policies, I found that no president was perfect. Carter was no exception. He overreacted to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, believing that the Soviets were making a play for Persian Gulf oil. In reality, Moscow was trying to support its client government in Kabul and prevent a potential Islamist revolution from spreading into the Soviet Union. Yet, Carter boycotted the Olympics in Moscow, instituted a grain embargo that merely hurt American farm exports, and proclaimed the 'Carter Doctrine,' which stated the United States would use military force to secure its vital national interests (read: oil) in the Persian Gulf against an outside power trying to control it. In the end, although subsequent presidents could have disavowed the doctrine, especially after the Cold War ended, they unfortunately and eagerly embraced it by building up U.S. forces around the Gulf. This included the needless meddling in the Iran-Iraq War, including conducting the 'tanker war' in the Gulf against Iran and two Gulf Wars later against Iraq. Yet Carter and subsequent presidents should have realized that the best and cheapest way to obtain oil is by paying the world market price. Finally, Carter was so scarred by the Iranian Revolution’s oil price hikes that he fully embraced the canard of the need for U.S. energy independence and attempted to popularize expensive synthetic fuels via the boondoggle of the failed Synfuels Corporation. However, in sum, Carter can rightly be celebrated for his many heroic deeds after leaving the White House. Still, his presidential accomplishments in foreign and domestic policy should not be neglected—which they often are—because they vastly outstripped his more limited failures.

Capturing The Counterculture – OpEd	In a previous article, we traced the development of structures of oversight from Edison’s physical monopolies through Tavistock’s psychological operations, witnessing how corporate and banking interests and intelligence agencies converged to shape public consciousness. Now we’ll see how these methods reached new sophistication through popular culture, beginning with the British Invasion of the 1960s, which demonstrated how thoroughly orchestrated music movements could reshape society. The Beatles and Rolling Stones weren’t just bands—as researcher Mike Williams has extensively documented in his analysis of the British Invasion, their emergence marked the beginning of a systematic and profound cultural transformation. Williams notes that even the term ‘British Invasion’ itself was telling—a military metaphor for what was ostensibly a cultural phenomenon, perhaps Tavistock telegraphing its operation in plain sight. What seemed like playful marketing language actually described a carefully orchestrated infiltration of American youth culture. Through hundreds of hours of meticulously documented research, Williams builds an overwhelming case that the Beatles served as the spearhead of a broader agenda that used albums like Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Rolling Stones’ Their Satanic Majesties Request to deliberately steer youth culture away from traditional values and family structures. What seems tame by today’s standards represented a calculated assault on social norms, initiating a cultural transformation that would accelerate over the following decades. Williams’ research goes further, presenting compelling evidence that the Beatles were essentially the first modern ‘boy band’—their image carefully crafted, their music largely written and performed by others. This revelation transforms our understanding of the British Invasion: what appeared to be an organic cultural phenomenon was in fact a meticulously orchestrated operation, with professional musicians and songwriters behind the scenes while the Beatles served as appealing frontmen for the massive social engineering project. As a lifelong music fan and Beatles devotee, confronting this evidence initially felt like sacrilege. Yet the pattern becomes undeniable once you allow yourself to see it. While debate continues over specific details like the Frankfurt School’s Theodor Adorno’s alleged involvement in crafting Beatles songs—a claim that has both passionate proponents and critics—what’s clear is that the operation bore all the hallmarks of Tavistock’s social engineering methodology. The deliberate crafting of a 'good boys/bad boys' (Beatles/Rolling Stones) dialectic offered controlled choices and allowed 'both sides' to advance the exact same desired cultural shifts. Andrew Loog Oldham masterfully crafted the Stones’ ‘bad boy’ image using public relations techniques reminiscent of Edward Bernays’ methods (the ‘father of public relations’ who pioneered mass psychological manipulation)—creating desire through psychological insight and manufacturing cultural rebellion as a marketable commodity. As Oldham himself acknowledged in his autobiography, he wasn’t just selling music but rather ‘rebellion, anarchy, and sex appeal wrapped up in a neat package’—deliberately creating a myth for people to buy into. His sophisticated understanding of cultural branding and mass psychology reflected the broader methods of influence that were reshaping media and public opinion during the era. Behind Mick Jagger’s rebellious persona lay an education at the London School of Economics, suggesting an insider with a deeper understanding of power systems at play. This assiduous development of image extended to the performers’ inner circle—notably Jagger’s girlfriend Marianne Faithfull, herself a successful singer and socialite, whose father was an MI6 officer who interrogated Heinrich Himmler and whose maternal grandfather had Habsburg Dynasty roots. The Stones’ finances were managed by Prince Rupert Loewenstein, a Bavarian aristocrat and private banker whose noble lineage and financial circles intersected with the Rothschild dynasty—another example of establishment figures behind seemingly anti-establishment movements. Even the record label itself fit the pattern: EMI (Electric and Musical Industries), which signed both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, began as a military electronics company. During World War II, EMI’s research and development contributed significantly to Britain’s radar program and other military technologies. This fusion of military-industrial interests with cultural production was no coincidence—EMI’s technical expertise in electronics and communications would prove valuable in both warfare and the mass distribution of cultural content. These carefully managed British experiments in cultural control would soon find their perfect laboratory in America, where an unlikely convergence would reshape youth culture and the family unit forever. Britain had pioneered these methods of cultural orchestration through music, embedding intelligence ties into the British Invasion, but America would refine and scale these techniques to unprecedented levels. The Laurel Canyon Laboratory In the hills above Hollywood between 1965-1975, as journalist Dave McGowan first documented, an extraordinary phenomenon: the emergence of a new music scene centered in Laurel Canyon, where an improbable concentration of military and intelligence family connections converged to reshape American youth culture. This convergence was no accident—as anti-war sentiment grew strongest in academic circles, this military-intelligence nexus helped redirect potential resistance into a drug-saturated counterculture focused on ‘dropping out’ rather than organized opposition to the war. The military/intelligence connections within Laurel Canyon were striking. Jim Morrison’s father commanded the fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that launched the Vietnam War. Frank Zappa’s father was a chemical warfare specialist at Edgewood Arsenal, a key human experimentation research site. David Crosby, scion of the Van Cortlandts and Van Rensselaers—American royalty—descended from a lineage of political power that included senators, Supreme Court justices, and Revolutionary generals. James Taylor, a descendant of Massachusetts Bay Colony settlers, grew up in a family shaped by academia and military service, including his father’s role in Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica. Sharon Tate, daughter of Army intelligence officer Lt. Col. Paul Tate, moved through these circles before her death. Dennis Hopper, whose father was OSS, directed Easy Rider and starred in it with Peter Fonda, packaging counterculture rebellion for mainstream consumption. The transformation was systematic—from the post-war optimism and unity embodied by JFK’s New Frontier to the calculated fragmentation that followed his assassination. This mass shared public trauma, perfectly suited to Tavistock’s methods of social engineering through psychological shock, marked the end of genuine optimism. The Boomers, raised with unprecedented prosperity and inspired by Kennedy’s vision of a New Frontier, saw their potential for authentic social and political transformation redirected into carefully crafted cultural movements that would shape subsequent generations. These pervasive connections between military-intelligence figures and countercultural leaders—from Morrison’s admiral father to Zappa’s chemical warfare specialist parent to Crosby’s political dynasty—reveal a clear pattern: the systematic co-opting of youth culture by establishment powers. The timing of Laurel Canyon’s emergence as a counterculture hub coincided with the CIA’s MK-Ultra’s mind control program’s peak years of operation. This was no coincidence. The same organizations experimenting with consciousness control through chemical methods, such as LSD, were simultaneously embedding themselves in cultural programming efforts. The convergence of these strategies in Laurel Canyon laid the groundwork for what would soon become the full-scale fusion of music and psychedelics—a calculated effort to thwart organically arising political resistance by channeling it into a movement centered on personal transcendence rather than effective collective action. Programming the Revolution Building on the psychological and cultural groundwork established in Laurel Canyon, the fusion of music and psychedelics marked the apex of consciousness manipulation. This phase of mass cultural programming strategically redirected genuine political resistance into artificially managed cultural channels, steering dissent away from organized movements and into fragmented, drug-fueled withdrawal. Even the Grateful Dead, the quintessential embodiment of California counterculture, which cultivated a devoted following that defined a generation’s search for community and meaning, were intricately tied to mechanisms of societal control. Their manager Alan Trist, was not only the son of Tavistock founder Eric Trist but was also present at the pivotal car accident that killed Jerry Garcia’s childhood friend, Paul Speegle—a tragedy that set Garcia on the path to forming the band. Garcia’s military connection adds another layer of intrigue: after stealing his mother’s car in 1960, he was offered the choice between prison or military service. Despite repeatedly going AWOL from Fort Ord and the Presidio of San Francisco, Garcia received only a general discharge—an unusually lenient outcome that raises questions about potential official connections. Meanwhile, the band’s lyricist, Robert Hunter, participated in government-funded LSD experiments tied to the broader psychedelic research of the era. Serving as the house band for the CIA-connected Merry Pranksters, the Grateful Dead played a key role in steering anti-war sentiment toward psychedelic retreat, aligning the counterculture with state-sponsored agendas in ways that warrant deeper scrutiny. This alignment of counterculture and establishment interests proved wildly effective. As anti-war sentiment grew strongest in academic circles—where genuine resistance could threaten structural power—the emergence of the hippie movement effectively redirected opposition into a youth counterculture saturated with drugs and focused on escapism rather than organized resistance. As the war machine escalated operations in Vietnam, young Americans were guided toward cultural dissolution—a perfect formula for neutralizing meaningful peace movements. The same military-intelligence complex that drove the war was simultaneously molding the culture that would prevent effective resistance to it. Timothy Leary’s role in this transformation was crucial. Before becoming the psychedelic movement’s most influential voice, he had been a West Point cadet and would later serve as an FBI informant. His advocacy for psychedelics emerged alongside the CIA’s own exploration of substances like LSD during the MK-Ultra era. John Lennon later reflected on this confluence with biting irony: ‘We must always remember to thank the CIA and the Army for LSD. That’s what people forget…They invented LSD to control people and what they did was give us freedom.’ This seeming backfire of the program masked a deeper success—dismantling potential resistance through the promotion of chemical disengagement. By popularizing the mantra 'Turn on, tune in, drop out,' Leary advanced this agenda. This redirection not only fragmented youth opposition, but weakened their ties to traditional support systems such as families and communities—exactly the kind of social atomization that would make future control easier. The overlap between government-funded LSD research and the emerging music scene was far from coincidental. While MK-Ultra explored chemical means of consciousness control, the music industry was simultaneously perfecting cultural methods—with bands like the Grateful Dead bridging both worlds through their ties to government-backed LSD experiments and the rapidly growing counterculture. Redirecting Resistance Patterns of government leadership connections to musical movements weren’t limited to the psychedelic era. As popular music evolves through new genres and decades, the same underlying relationships continue between establishment power and cultural influence. In the hardcore punk scene, figures like Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi) whose father was in the White House Press Corps and present at JFK’s assassination, would ironically become one of the most fiercely independent figures in music, pioneering the DIY ethic through his label Dischord Records. His autonomous approach seemed to resist the system, yet his establishment connections highlight a broader pattern. Even in alternative rock, Dave Grohl’s father served as special assistant to Senator Robert Taft Jr. during the Reagan administration. Madonna, who became the defining pop star of the 1980s, was the daughter of Tony Ciccone, an engineer who worked on military projects for Chrysler Defense and General Dynamics Land Systems. Having parents involved in government, defense, or intelligence work doesn’t imply wrongdoing by these artists; however, these examples represent just a fraction of the documented connections between counterculture figures and power structures. The pattern extends across decades and genres, with hundreds of similar cases suggesting not coincidence but systematic design—from jazz musicians backed by banking families to punk rockers with government connections to mainstream pop stars from defense industry families. These pervasive ties raise fundamental questions about the relationship between ruling class power and cultural influence. Perhaps no single family better exemplifies the deliberate fusion of intelligence operations and cultural production than the Copelands. Miles Copeland Jr., who helped found the CIA and orchestrated coups across the Middle East, detailed the psychological strategies behind this integration in his book The Game of Nations. In that revealing text, Copeland explicitly outlined the manipulation methodology that would shape both intelligence operations and popular culture: 'In the world of covert operations, nothing is what it appears to be. The key is not just controlling actions, but controlling the perception of actions.' His son Miles Copeland III became a key figure in the music industry, managing influential acts like The Police (with brother Stewart as drummer) and founding I.R.S. Records. Through I.R.S., Copeland would shape alternative music’s mainstream emergence, managing acts like R.E.M. fronted by Michael Stipe, another military child. The Copelands represent a crucial bridge between covert operations and cultural production, demonstrating how intelligence methodologies evolved from direct intervention to subtle influence through entertainment. Their success in blending counterculture appeal with commercial viability became a template for future narrative sculpting. This pattern of cultural engineering follows historically consistent principles. Artists and movements aligning with intelligence objectives receive overwhelming promotion, while genuine resistance faces suppression or elimination. The tragic ends of figures like Phil Ochs and John Lennon, both under documented FBI surveillance for their direct challenges to state power, contrast notably with the career trajectories of those who presented rebellion within more conventional bounds. Manufacturing Gender While music proved to be the perfect laboratory for testing mass consciousness control, these methods would soon extend far beyond entertainment. Nowhere was this more evident than in the deliberate reshaping of gender roles and family structures, with the goal of transforming intimate aspects of human identity and relationships. The strategic calibration of feminist narratives emerged as a particularly powerful example, with intelligence agencies actively shaping gender politics through media and organized activism. Gloria Steinem, who acknowledged working with CIA-funded organizations like the Independent Research Service during the 1950s and 1960s, exemplifies this intersection. Her Ms. Magazine, launched in 1972, merged feminist ideals with carefully curated messaging, while Steinem later admitted to participating in CIA-funded events aimed at influencing feminist movements during the Cold War. Nicholas Rockefeller’s candid admission to his friend Aaron Russo underscored how women’s liberation was strategically funded to expand state and corporate control—doubling the tax base through workforce participation, weakening family bonds through increased divorce rates, and increasing state influence over children via state-run childcare. During this same period, influential shows like That Girl and The Mary Tyler Moore Show helped normalize these very changes, popularizing the archetype of the independent, career-focused woman in ways that notably aligned with systemic objectives. This transformation was systematic. Women’s magazines shifted from primarily domestic content to increasingly career-focused messaging. Cosmopolitan’sdramatic evolution under Helen Gurley Brown’s editorship in the 1960s exemplified this transformation, normalizing not just women’s workforce participation but also promoting sexual liberation outside traditional marriage—a dual agenda that aligned perfectly with corporate interests in expanding both the labor pool and consumer base. This deliberate shaping of gender movements extends to the present, with Tavistock Institute continuing to form modern narratives. From shifting women’s magazines toward career messaging in the 1960s to today’s relentless promotion of evolving gender narratives, these movements consistently align with agenda-driven objectives. Commodifying Resistance The techniques perfected in Laurel Canyon for transforming genuine resistance into profitable cultural products would evolve into increasingly complex frameworks of control. From the Grateful Dead’s pioneering of festival culture to modern corporate music festivals like Coachella, authentic counterculture spaces would be systematically converted into commercial enterprises. By the 1990s, these methods had evolved into systematic co-option of authentic resistance. While the Boomers experienced the shift from optimism to disillusionment, Generation X faced a more highly refined mechanism that commodified alienation itself. Kurt Cobain’s trajectory from authentic voice of generational discontent to MTV commodity demonstrated how the apparatus of influence had evolved—no longer just redirecting resistance but transforming it into profitable cultural products. This commodification extended beyond music—brands like Nike transformed anti-establishment street culture into global marketing campaigns through figures like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley. The era’s 'alternative' culture became so thoroughly commercialized that mall retailers like Hot Topic emerged to sell pre-packaged 'rebellion' to suburban teens, turning countercultural symbols into standardized retail offerings. The comprehensive hijack of underground music scenes demonstrates how thoroughly the power structure perfected cultural manipulation. Just as intelligence agencies had redirected 60s counterculture, corporations developed advanced methods for capturing and commodifying organic dissidence. The Vans Warped Tour transformed punk rock—once a genuine expression of youth rebellion—into a traveling corporate marketing platform, complete with sponsored stages and branded merchandise. Red Bull’s music academy program went further, creating what amounts to an early warning system for potentially disruptive cultural movements. By identifying emerging underground genres and artists early, they could redirect authentic cultural expression into commercial channels before it developed genuine revolutionary potential. Even the most fiercely independent scenes proved vulnerable to this system. Major labels created fake indie imprints to maintain underground credibility while controlling distribution. Tobacco companies specifically targeted underground clubs and raves, understanding that subcultural credibility could be converted into market share. The pattern established in Laurel Canyon—of transforming authentic resistance into profitable products—had evolved into a science of cultural capture. Just as the Grateful Dead’s government connections helped establish templates for controlled cultural spaces, modern music festivals serve as data collection points and behavioral laboratories. The evolution from Acid Tests to algorithmically curated festival lineups demonstrates how thoroughly the framework of influence has digitized. The Celebrity Machine The approach perfected through Gloria Steinem—channeling authentic social movements through carefully managed spokespersons—would evolve into today’s meticulously crafted model of celebrity activism. This algorithmic management extends beyond content to talent itself, with platforms increasingly determining not just what succeeds but which voices rise to prominence. The strategic positioning of celebrity activists demonstrates how thoroughly institutional interests have penetrated entertainment. George Clooney’s involvement with the Council on Foreign Relations, continuing a multigenerational family connection to power that began with his father Nick Clooney’s Cold War-era journalism, exemplifies how these entertainment-establishment ties often span generations. Angelina Jolie’s evolution from Hollywood rebel to UNHCR Special Envoyexemplifies how countercultural appeal can be redirected toward state objectives. Similarly, Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental advocacy—promoted through WEF platforms while maintaining a private jet lifestyle—shows how even legitimate concerns are shaped to align with elite frameworks. Similarly, Sean Penn’s pattern of high-profile crisis interventions—from Hurricane Katrina to Haiti, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, and most recently Ukraine—raises questions about selective platform access. While establishment-aligned celebrities receive endless amplification, those questioning official narratives often find themselves swiftly marginalized or silenced. Like Steinem’s CIA-backed feminist organizing, modern celebrity activism often aligns remarkably well with ruling class objectives. The path from counterculture figure to establishment voice has become a repeatable template. Marketing Modern Culture Modern equivalents of countercultural programming demonstrate how these systems remain highly effective. From the entertainment industry to luxury fashion houses, today’s cultural engineers craft narratives that align with elite interests under the guise of progress. This pattern of coordinated societal restructuring extends across multiple industries and platforms. The fashion industry’s role became explicit through incidents like Balenciaga’s controversial 2022 campaign featuring children with bondage imagery. While public outrage focused on the immediate controversy, the incident revealed how fashion houses increasingly push narratives about gender, sexuality, and social norms. Just as the Stones and Beatles channeled rebellion into acceptable forms, today’s cultural architects craft carefully calibrated resistance. Billie Eilish’s themes of alienation provide Gen Z with a commercially viable outlet for discontent, while Lizzo’s challenge to conventional beauty standards align with corporate interests in promoting pharmaceuticals, wellness products, and consumer goods tailored to diverse audiences. Even the most commercially successful artists reflect these establishment connections—Taylor Swift’s family ties to banking dynasties, including her grandfather’s role in the Federal Reserve, demonstrate how thoroughly embedded these relationships remain. As researcher Mike Benz has documented, NATO’s own training materials identify Swift as a key figure for message amplification, revealing how bureaucratic influence operates in the digital age. When Health Becomes Ideology The promotion of unhealthy lifestyles serves multiple systemic purposes. A population focused on ‘body positivity’ while struggling with obesity and chronic health conditions becomes both more profitable for pharmaceutical companies and more dependent on institutional systems. This agenda manifests in how unhealthiness is celebrated as progressive and inclusive. Corporate campaigns and media portray obese body types and unhealthy lifestyles as empowering, normalizing behaviors that in most cases will lead to poor long-term health. For example, Cosmopolitan featured a February 2021 cover proclaiming, 'This is Healthy!' alongside imagery of unconventional body types, while Nike introduced plus-size mannequins in their flagship stores, generating significant media buzz. These efforts were celebrated as milestones of inclusivity, solidifying the ‘body positivity’ movement as a cultural touchstone. At the same time, fitness and working out are increasingly framed as symbols of extremism. Articles and think pieces link workout culture and physical health with dangerous ideologies, painting personal discipline as a marker of political radicalization. This patently absurd narrative subtly reframes exercise not as wellness and personal discipline, but as symbols of far-right extremism. This deliberate inversion mirrors Orwell’s dystopia: health becomes harmful, while unhealthiness becomes virtuous. By reframing physical well-being and self-improvement as forms of deviance, these narratives distort societal values, aligning them with complacency as a moral ideal. The seeds of this shift were planted during the Covid-19 pandemic, where public health policies largely ignored foundational wellness practices. Instead of promoting sunshine, exercise, proper nutrition, or weight loss—despite obesity being the highest risk factor—official messaging emphasized isolation, masking, and compliance. In the post-pandemic era, these themes have evolved further, reframing personal health and discipline as not just unnecessary, but as politically dangerous. The treatment of health and fitness reveals a calculated agenda—promoting unhealthy lifestyles while demonizing physical discipline serves the same end: creating a more dependent and controllable population. This isn’t contradiction but convergence: both approaches push people away from self-reliance and toward institutional dependence. This isn’t random contradiction but calculated deception: just as Tavistock learned to use psychological vulnerability to reshape consciousness, modern organizations deploy health narratives to create new forms of social control. ​​This systematic reshaping of health consciousness parallels an even broader transformation: the redefinition of citizenship and national identity itself. Just as physical fitness was reframed as extremism, traditional notions of patriotism and national pride would be carefully reconstructed to serve power structures. The entertainment industry, having perfected techniques for modifying health narratives, would deploy these same methods to reshape public understanding of loyalty and national purpose. Shaping Patriotism From the fitness industry to Hollywood, narratives are crafted to ensure compliance with systemic ideals, often echoing tactics first developed to reshape public sentiment during the isolationist era discussed earlier. Just as J.P. Morgan’s acquisition of newspapers in 1917 helped frame America’s reluctant entry into global conflicts as a moral imperative, television series, streaming shows, and films all shape public perceptions of military action by glamorizing its necessity and heroism. Modern blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick demonstrate how studios must submit scripts to the Department of Defense for approval, with military-mandated changes required to access essential equipment and filming locations. The Pentagon’s influence extends deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Captain Marvelrequired extensive script revisions to secure military support, transforming the protagonist from a civilian pilot into an Air Force officer. Similar military oversight shaped Iron Man, with the Pentagon demanding script approval in exchange for access to bases and equipment. These aren’t just product placement deals—they represent systematic narrative control at the heart of modern entertainment. Other films, such as Zero Dark Thirty and Argo, have been produced in direct collaboration with the CIA, promoting narratives aligned with military interests. The NFL provides another striking example of how sports leagues function as extensions of the entertainment network, leveraging emotional narratives to shape public sentiment. Military flyovers, player tributes to soldiers, and Super Bowl advertisements are often presented as organic celebrations of national pride. However, these moments frequently stem from paid partnerships with the Department of Defense, blurring the lines between authentic patriotism and orchestrated messaging. Just as blockbuster films glamorize military action, sports leagues normalize the connection between patriotism and military service, reinforcing regimented narratives under the guise of entertainment. While it is true that genuine patriotism and respect for service members reflect authentic American values, the entertainment industry’s careful curation of military narratives serves a deeper purpose: normalizing perpetual foreign interventions without encouraging deeper understanding of these conflicts and their terrible consequences. By conflating support for troops with unquestioning acceptance of military action, these cultural products manufacture consent for engagements most citizens neither understand nor meaningfully debate. The transformation of complex geopolitical realities into simplified hero narratives helps ensure public compliance without public comprehension. Even ostensibly critical movies like The Bourne Films and Charlie Wilson’s War blend fact and fiction in ways that subtly glorify intelligence work and interventionist policies. This narrative crafting ensures that skepticism of these organizations remains constrained, reinforcing a sense of patriotism tied to state ideals and policies. Alongside these cinematic examples, the video game industry has become a powerful tool for behavioral influence strategies. Franchises like Call of Duty have embedded pro-military narratives in their immersive gameplay, serving as advanced recruitment tools for the armed forces. While Hollywood and gaming recruit audiences into the machinery of war, contemporary music has been weaponized in a way similar to the examples of jazz diplomacy in the 1950s, the 'British Invasion,' and Laurel Canyon musicians discussed before. Nowhere is this more striking than in hip-hop, where the genre’s transformation from protest music to ‘gangsta rap’ illuminates how power brokers co-opt authentic voices to align with the very corporate and political interests that are actively working to subjugate them. Prison Profit Pipeline Hip-hop’s rise in the 1980s coincided with the crack epidemic, a devastating chapter in American history exacerbated by the CIA’s involvement with Contra rebels in Nicaragua—a link exposed by journalist Gary Webb in his groundbreaking investigation. What began as a genre documenting the effects of systemic oppression and the scourge of drugs in Black communities soon became commodified. The raw narratives of survival and resistance were transformed into glamorized depictions of drug culture, aligning neatly with authority-driven interests that perpetuate profitable cycles of incarceration and control. The music industry’s real agenda becomes explicit through figures like hip-hop icon Ice Cube, who revealed how record labels and private prisons deliberately aligned their interests. 'It seems really kind of suspicious,' Cube noted, 'that the records that come out are really geared to push people towards that prison industry.' His assertion that 'the same people who own the [record labels] own the prisons' exposed the strategic development of content to feed incarceration systems. As Cube explained, 'a lot of dope songs people like are made by a group of people telling rappers what to say,' replacing organic artistic expression with carefully developed narratives. This deliberate shift funneled anger and discontent into self-destructive behaviors, perpetuating cycles of incarceration that aligned neatly with corporate interests. The prison-industrial complex demonstrated how systemic control could merge profit motives with social programming. This fusion of surveillance, behavioral modification, and economic coercion would become the template for digital oversight framework, where algorithms track behavior, shape choices, and enforce compliance through economic penalties—just at global scale. What record labels achieved manually in hip-hop—identifying, redirecting, and commodifying authentic expression—would become the template for digital control. Just as executives learned to transform street culture into profitable products, algorithms would soon automate this process at global scale. The transformation from protest to profit wasn’t limited to music—it became the blueprint for how all cultural resistance would be managed in the digital age. In the next article, we’ll see how these cultural shaping techniques have been automated and perfected through digital systems. The methods of cultural control evolved from physical to psychological, from local to global, from manual to automated. What began with Edison’s hardware monopolies and reached its analog peak in the manipulation of popular culture would find its ultimate expression in digital systems. The transformation from mechanical to algorithmic control represents not just a technological evolution, but a quantum leap in the capability to shape human consciousness.

China Could Test Limits Of Hungary’s Foreign Policy Of ‘Principle...	Trump has nominated three officials with ties to Hungary for key national security posts, but the anti-China bent of his team could still pose a problem as the Orban administration tries to deepen cooperation with Beijing. By Marc Roscoe Loustau The list of Donald Trump nominees with ties to Hungary includes three men set to play key roles in setting the new US president’s national intelligence strategy: John Ratcliffe is Trump’s pick for director of Central Intelligence, Matthew Whitaker is the nominee for ambassador to NATO, and Sebastian Gorka will fill a senior counterterrorism position. All three have ties to Hungary, while Ratcliffe and Whitaker have said Orban’s 'principled realism' is a model for US foreign policy under Trump. In October 2022, Ratcliffe (with his protogé Cliff Sims) published a Wall Street Journal op-ed castigating the Biden administration’s current ambassador to Hungary, David Pressman, for criticising Orban’s ties to Russia. Ratcliffe pointed out that Orban was only trying to keep Russian natural gas flowing to Hungary; after all, the Fidesz government had taken in large numbers of Ukrainian refugees and strengthened NATO deployments in the country. Ratcliffe also criticised a US State Department funding program to promote diversity, which he called 'woke ideology'. Instead, he urged the State Department 'to affirm Western values'. Ratcliffe praised Orban’s 'principled realism' approach, a foreign policy guided by both national interests as well as the moral values espoused by both Orban and Trump. In April 2024, Whitaker headlined the international edition of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Budapest, a gathering of US Republicans and right-wing politicians from around the world. He used a primetime interview to praise the notion of principled leadership, which he said the CPAC host Orban embodied. Whitaker commended politicians who 'stand up for something', according to a report in the government-friendly hirado.hu news outlet, because the principle they represent is part of their identity. Sebastian Gorka, the child of Hungarian emigres to the UK, has the strongest ties to Hungary. He moved back to Hungary for his graduate studies. In the wake of 9/11, he wrote a controversial thesis that, according to critics, equated Islam with terrorism. But Orban’s hyper-masculine governing style – the Hungarian prime minister likes referring to himself as a 'street fighter' – has also won Gorka’s praise. Gorka first gained notoriety in 2017 for declaring that 'alpha males are back' and arguing that American foreign policy should be used to project hyper-masculine power. On China, however, these potential Trump administration officials do not see eye to eye with Orban, particularly Ratcliffe who is set to be the Trump administration’s chief China hawk. Belt up After the EU threatened to cut off funding to Hungary over concerns about the state of the rule of law since the Orban government took power in 2014, the prime minister compensated for this by inviting Chinese infrastructural and industrial investment. In 2014, Hungary announced with much fanfare that China’s government would build a Budapest-Belgrade high-speed rail line as part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure financing initiative (BRI), which Beijing is using to extend its influence internationally. In 2015, following a meeting with high-ranking Chinese officials in Beijing, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement declaring that the BRI 'coincides entirely with Hungarian national interests'. The investment cooperation has continued over the last decade. In May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Budapest to sign bilateral agreements to expand green energy investments, on top of an EV battery manufacturing plant that’s already under construction in Debrecen. But the same Trump administration officials who have praised Hungarian values also see China’s BRI as a threat to US interests. During a 2020 hearing before the US Senate, Ratcliffe raised the alarm that the BRI was an economic and security threat. Legal provisions written into BRI contracts, Ratcliffe warned, require Chinese construction companies to collect intelligence. 'These are all spokes of the same initiative and that is for China to supplant us as the world’s superpower,' Ratcliffe testified. While Hungary is trying to advance China’s economic involvement in Europe, Ratcliffe prefers policies that isolate China in response to such threats. For example, Ratcliffe led a Heritage Foundation panel that produced a July 2024 report pushing a controversial theory that Chinese government-run labs produced the COVID-19 virus. Regardless of the report’s factual credibility, the commission, with Ratcliffe as chairman, advocated isolating China on a number of fronts. The report recommended passage of the BIOSECURE ACT that would decouple supply chains from Chinese state-backed companies and better enforcement of Executive Orders restricting US biotechnology research investment into China. Limited power and influence? Small states like Hungary rarely receive knowledgeable recognition from officials at the top levels of America’s national intelligence establishment, but it’s unclear how much influence Ratcliffe, Whitaker and Gorka will have. Gorka had been angling for the influential position as deputy national security adviser, which has a broader purview than the position of counterterrorism chief. His designated role could be a symbolic slap in the face; at best, it’s a lateral move for someone who has wanted to expand beyond counterterrorism work. As for Whitaker, Trump seems to have only one NATO agenda: to weaken the military alliance. Whitaker’s main role will be to play debt collector, since Trump is singularly obsessed with member states being in arrears. Ratcliffe’s CIA will not have the autonomy that it enjoyed when the George W. Bush and Obama administrations were focused on counterterrorism. Threats posed by Russia and China have redirected attention to state actors. In this arena, the CIA shares authority and expertise with the State Department, the Pentagon and the Director of Intelligence. It’s unclear how much direct influence Hungary could exert on a friend in the CIA if, by definition, Ratcliffe’s decision-making will require working with other top officials who may not have his positive view of Orban’s foreign policy approach. Orban’s 'principled realism' might well become US foreign policy doctrine, but the Trump team’s hawkish China policy could test the contradiction – between values and interests – contained in this term.

Ron Paul: D.O.G.E. End The Global Engagement Center – OpEd	In the book Crisis and Leviathan, libertarian thinker Robert Higgs pointed out that the state uses crises to ratchet up its power and control over citizens. With each new 'crisis' – often directly or indirectly caused by the state itself – government grows and our freedom shrinks. The root cause of the September 11, 2001 attacks was US interventionism, for example. As I said in a presidential debate a few years later, they came over here because we were over there. But instead of looking to that root cause it was determined that the real problem was not enough government. So, taking advantage of the crisis, Congress created a Director of National Intelligence, a Department of Homeland Security, and passed the Patriot Act. The 'Russiagate' crisis was invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign as a dirty trick to use against Donald Trump in the 2016 election campaign. It may not have defeated Trump, but it hobbled his presidency. The result of this manufactured claim that the Russians (and Chinese and Iranians, etc) are meddling in our affairs and manipulating our elections is that the federal government determined that the First Amendment no longer applies to us. They have decided that consuming certain media should not be allowed – for our own safety – so they have denied Americans the right to access media from countries the US government considers 'enemies.' In the name of fighting imaginary foreign meddling in our elections, it’s Americans who find their rights curtailed. They even created an entire government entity within the State Department – the 'Global Engagement Center' (GEC) – right after the phony 'Russiagate' operation was launched to 'recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States…' As it turned out, this 'Center' was not at all about countering foreign 'bad actors' but about silencing Americans who held views the powers-that-be in DC do not like. As Roger Kimbell wrote in a recent article about the GEC, 'Because the GEC could not operate against Americans directly, it did so indirectly by funding entities like the British-based Global Disinformation Index, which compiled a list of publications and individuals that said things the regime did not like. That list was consulted by advertisers wary of winding up on the wrong side of the government…. Result? Millions of dollars of ad revenue dried up, imperiling the future of those outlets.' And, as Kimbell further points out, even when they were caught red handed violating our rights they just hid the beast within leviathan. Thus, even though funding for the GEC was cut from Speaker Johnson’s 1,500 page omnibus spending bill, the beast lives on. The Biden Administration has re-named the Center the 'Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub' and retained the same old GEC employees. Now that this switch has been exposed, however, there is a chance – for once – to finally kill a bad government program. Elon Musk was one of the first to expose the evil of the GEC and as it turns out he is now working with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) to cut this exact kind of government overreach. No more hiding government censorship programs with new names and new branding. Not another dollar should be spent censoring Americans!

Stock Market And Budget Projections: Do The Numbers Add Up? – OpE...	It’s been a while since we’ve had Mr. Arithmetic here, but with Donald Trump coming back to the White House, we may need him around. The immediate reason for consulting his expertise is the projections for big stock market gains in 2025. It seems the median forecast is for the S&P 500 to rise by roughly 10 percent over the course of 2025 from its year-end 2024 level. Many are forecasting considerably larger gains. Basically, the story is that all the good news for corporate profits in recent years will continue and the stock market will keep going higher at close to the pace it has been rising. There is a problem in this story that seems to be getting little attention. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for the S&P 500 is already near the peaks that it hit in the 1990s bubble. Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted level stands at more than 38 to 1. (The cyclical adjustment compares current prices to inflation-adjusted profits over the last decade.) This is more than twice the long-period average and only slightly below the peaks hit in the late 1990s bubble. The question I asked Mr. Arithmetic is whether we can expect to see 10 percent returns in 2025, like the median analyst projected. He immediately suggested that we have to look to profit growth. While no one knows exactly how much profits will grow in 2025, we can look for forecasts. A good starting place here is the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Its most recent projections showed corporate profits growing 3.5 percent in 2025. This means that if we’re starting from a PE ratio of 38 to 1, with a 10 percent stock rise and 3.5 percent profit growth, we will have a PE ratio of over 40 at the end of 2025, even closer to the peak of the nineties bubble. The picture doesn’t look any better going further out. The CBO projections show average profit growth over the next decade of just 2.7 percent annually, only slightly higher than the 2.3 percent average projected inflation rate, using the Consumer Price Index. This means that, assuming the projections are right, if the PE ratio were to just remain at its near record high, and not reach new records, the average real increase in stock prices would be just 0.4 percent annually. Even adding in 2.5 percent for dividends and share buybacks, this would still give a real return of around 3.0 percent, less than a percentage point above the 2.2 percent return investors would get on an inflation-indexed government bond. It’s possible that investors would be willing to hold stocks for returns that are only slightly higher than an entirely risk-free asset, but historically that has not been the case. The returns from stock have averaged more than 4.0 percentage points higher than the returns on government bonds. It may also be the case that we will see the PE ratios rise to new records and just keep rising. Anything is possible, but that scenario also does not seem likely. What If the Projections are Wrong? CBO projections deserve to be taken seriously, but they are not written in stone. CBO has been wrong in the past and they will surely be wrong in the future. It is worth noting that CBO is rarely an outlier. While their projections are model driven, they try to produce numbers that put them near the middle of professional forecasts. The point is to produce numbers that can reasonably be taken as a basis for policy. CBO is not trying to stake out an outlier position. With this in mind, it is still possible that profits will grow considerably more rapidly than CBO has projected, but that means the consensus in the profession is likely off the mark, not just CBO. There are two ways that profits can grow more rapidly than CBO projected. The first is if there is a redistribution from wages to profits. (There can also be a redistribution from the government sector to higher after-tax profits, as a result of lower corporate tax rates. I’ll come back to this.) There already has been a redistribution from wages to profits of more than 4.0 percentage points since the turn of the century. Roughly half of this has been since the pandemic. The CBO projections show some shift back to wages, with the profit share of national income being 1.2 percentage points lower in 2034 than it was 2024. Perhaps this reversal won’t take place and the profit share stays roughly at the current level. In that case, profits will rise at an average nominal rate of 3.0 percent over the next decade. That would make the real return from holding stock, assuming a constant PE ratio, of 3.2 percent, roughly a percentage point above the rate on inflation-indexed government bonds. That still doesn’t sound very attractive. It is possible that we will see a further shift from wages to profits, but this seems unlikely barring major changes (i.e. much higher unemployment) in the shape of the labor market. It seems the possibilities for much more rapid profit growth due to a redistribution from wages are limited. The other way that profits can grow more rapidly is if the economy grows considerably more rapidly than CBO projects. CBO currently is projecting an average annual growth rate of 1.8 percent over the next decade. This is lower than the historical rate because CBO projects very slow labor force growth due to the retirement of the baby boom cohorts. With immigration likely to be restricted for the foreseeable future, any substantial increase in GDP growth above CBO’s current projections would almost certainly have to come from faster than expected productivity growth. This is not impossible given the impact of AI and other recent innovations. Also, we have been seeing faster than projected productivity growth in recent quarters, although these data are highly erratic so that may not tell us much about the future. Suppose that productivity growth averaged 1.0 percentage points higher than CBO now projects and that translates into 1.0 percentage point more rapid annual GDP and profit growth. That would translate into 3.7 percent annual profit growth or 1.4 percent real growth. Assuming the PE ratio stays constant at its near-record high, this would mean real returns from holding stock of roughly 3.9 percent annually, 1.7 percentage points above the return on inflation-indexed government bonds. That still is well below the historic gap, but we’re getting closer. However, it is also worth noting that if we sustain this more rapid pace of productivity growth for a decade, the economy would look very different in 2034 than is currently projected. Most immediately, wages would be considerably higher in 2034 than is now projected. Instead of real wage growth of 1.2 percent annually, assuming income shares are constant, real wages would grow at a rate of 2.2 percent a year. In 2034 the average worker in 2034 would have a real wage more than 26 percent higher than the average worker does today. This would amount to the most rapid sustained real wage gains since the Golden Age from 1947 to 1973. That would be a pretty positive story. It would also mean that, barring major changes in policy, the debt-to-GDP ratio and the interest burden of the debt would not be rising. If this more rapid rate of real wage growth was sustained, it would eliminate most of the projected long-term (75-year) shortfall in the Social Security trust fund. This also would show clearly that funding Social Security is a political problem, not an economic problem. Suppose real wages are 26 percent higher than in 2034 than they are today. Would anyone really say that workers in 2034 would have much grounds for complaint if the Social Security tax was 1.0 percentage point higher than it is now, leaving their after-tax real wage 25.0 percent higher in 2034, rather than 26.0 percent higher? Politicians may not want to ever talk about taxes (we did raise the tax repeatedly from the founding of the program until 1990), but it is hard for serious people to see grounds for complaint. It would also be a small matter in terms of living standards to divert a portion of these gains from faster growth towards accelerating the transition to a green economy. If we diverted one percentage point more of GDP in 2034 towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we would still have 9.0 percent more in that year than CBO current now projects to spend on other things. Anyhow, if we really want to say that we think profits will grow far more rapidly than CBO is now projecting, it would be worth filling out this picture. Either we will see a substantial further redistribution from wages to profits or we can anticipate that we will be far richer in the future than we currently expect, and many of the issues that seem like major problems today will seem trivial. Reducing Corporate Income Taxes What shareholders ultimately care about is after-tax profits, not profits. After-tax profits can rise more than profits if we reduce the effective tax rate on corporate income. There is some room for this. According to CBO’s data, corporate income tax payments increased from 10.2 percent of profits in 2019 to 15.3 percent in 2023. Some of this rise is likely random timing factors, however some of it likely stems from increased enforcement. The Biden administration made it clear that it expected the I.R.S. to enforce the tax law on wealthy individuals and large corporations and even secured additional funding for this effort. By contrast, Trump and Republicans have called these enforcement efforts 'harassment' and seem fine with a situation where the wealthy and large corporations don’t have to pay their taxes if they choose not to. It seems likely that corporate income tax payments will fall as a share of profits under the Trump administration. This is partly due to an occasionally stated desire by Trump to lower the corporate income tax rate further (he reduced it from 35 percent to 21 percent in his first administration) and also the result of lax enforcement. For purposes of these calculations, we can assume that the effective tax rate falls back to the 2019 level of slightly over 10.0 percent. This would mean that after-tax profits would grow by roughly 6.0 percentage points more than the amount projected by CBO. This would allow for an annual real return that is 0.6 percentage points higher than would be implied by the profit growth projection from CBO, or 3.6 percent annually. That is still well short of the 6.2 percent annual return that would be needed to maintain a 4.0 percentage point gap between returns from equities and returns on government bonds. Stock Returns and Profit Growth: Summing Up The table below shows the stock returns that would be consistent with the various scenarios discussed above and both a stable PE ratio and the 2034 PE ratio in markets if the returns on stock matched their historic premium of 4.0 percentage points over the return on government bonds. In the base case, as noted the real return consistent with a stable PE ratio would be 3.0 percent, just 0.8 percentage points above the return on inflation-indexed government bonds. If we assume that stocks pay their historic 4.0 percentage point premium, the PE ratio will rise to 54 by 2024. If we assume that the profit share remains stable, rather than income shifting back somewhat to wages, as projected by CBO, then the return consistent with a stable PE is 3.2 percent. Alternatively, if we assume that stocks pay their historic 4.0 percentage point premium, the PE will rise to 53 by 2024. The faster growth scenario discussed above would allow a 4.0 real return on stocks in the constant PE scenario. If stocks delivered their historic premium, then the PE ratio will rise to 49 by 2034. In the lower taxes scenario, the real return consistent with a stable PE ratio would be 3.5 percent. For stocks to deliver their historic premium the PE ratio would have to rise to 51 by 2034. This analysis implies that in all these scenarios either investors will have to accept a much lower equity premium than they have received historically, or that PE ratios will rise far above previous records. While there is no limit in principle to how high the PE ratio can go, a higher PE means that returns going forward will be even lower. If PE ratios near or above 50 are not impossible, they do at least seem implausible. There is also the possibility that we will see even more extreme scenarios than outlined above. Perhaps growth will be even more rapid than the 1.0 percentage point boost shown here, or maybe corporate taxes will be eliminated altogether. These scenarios, while possibly far-fetched, are not impossible. For those who want to ascribe to such scenarios, it would be useful if they would at least be explicit in their assumptions so that the implications can be drawn out for the economy. For example, if stock projections are based on the assumption that growth will be 2.0 percentage points above the numbers projected by CBO, then the implication is that we will be almost unimaginably wealthy in the not very distant future. In that world concerns about deficits and Social Security solvency would be incredibly silly. And we certainly should have no fear spending considerably more money to avert global warming. If people expect to be taken seriously in their projections for stock gains, they should at least be able to etch out the economic scenario that would go along with it. The reporters who write down stock projections should keep this in mind.

Can We Have Health Care Without Health Insurance Companies? – OpE...	In the aftermath of the senseless murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, responsible commentators were quick to condemn the act. 'Murder is bad, and so are murderers,' wrote the liberal economist Paul Krugman. 'Neither should be celebrated.' But then Krugman went on to offer an admittedly 'somewhat ... caricatured' view of U.S. health care: 'It’s a system in which taxpayers bear the cost of major medical care, but this taxpayer money flows through private companies that take a cut, spend a lot on administration, and do their best to deny care to people who need it.' What service do private insurers provide in return for the fees they collect? Americans, Krugman wrote, 'may not realize the extent to which they are exposing themselves to the delay-and-deny strategy private insurers often use to avoid paying for care.' For many years, Krugman has been an advocate of single-payer health insurance—often pointing to Canada as a model to be emulated. In Canada, there are no health insurance companies. When Canadians get health care, the cost is paid by the government—often with few questions asked. If Canadians can get by without health insurance companies, could something like that work in the United States? Not in a way people would find desirable. All Developed Countries Face Some Health Care Problems There are three problems with the doctor-patient relationship in all developed countries—regardless of the way the payment system is organized. First, when a third party is paying the bill, neither the doctor nor the patient has any incentive to apply the kind of cost/benefit analysis that is normal in the purchase of any other good or service. In considering whether to obtain an expensive test (an MRI scan, e.g.), the incentive is to consider only the benefit. Since cost is irrelevant to the patient, a tiny benefit—no matter what the cost—is viewed as desirable. Second, in a fee-for-service arrangement (such as exists in both the U.S. and Canada), the more services doctors perform, the higher their incomes. So, just as patients have an incentive to over-consume, doctors have an incentive to over-provide. Third, there is malpractice liability, which is especially a problem in the U.S. A doctor who orders an unnecessary MRI scan faces no real penalty. But no matter how improbable, there is always a chance that a scan not ordered will fail to detect a problem that grows worse through time. Our legal system, therefore, provides incentives for too many tests and too many procedures, compared to a system in which costs would have to be justified by comparable benefits. What we are describing are three perverse incentives. If they are not checked in some way, medical care becomes unreasonably expensive. That means higher premiums or higher taxes or both. Canada Rations Care Canada checks these incentives by limiting resources. The typical Canadian general practitioner, for example, does not have radiology equipment and must send patients to a hospital for simple x-rays. The hospitals, in turn, operate under global budgets tht limit spending, no matter what the level of demand. Canada ranks 25th of 29 countries on the number of MRI scanners per person. As a result, the wait for a scan is almost three months, and the wait until final treatment is more than six months. The government has decided to prevent overuse of MRI scanners by severely restricting the number of scanners that are available. Canada’s system of limiting heath care resources and forcing doctors to ration care has many undesirable characteristics. The system favors high-income over low-income patients. It favors white patients over racial minorities. It favors city dwellers over rural residents. It favors the politically connected over those without connections. Arguably, there is more inequality in access to health care in Canada than there is in the United States. How Aggressive Are Private Insurers? Although there are complaints about preauthorization requirements and denials, one could argue that the private insurers are not being aggressive enough. One oft-quoted estimate is that one-third of U.S. health care spending is wasted. If we could magically eliminate all that waste, we could give every American almost $5,000 each year. You might suppose that in countries that impose rationing, such as Canada and the U.K., doctors are forced to be more efficient—prioritizing resources so that the most promising procedures are done first. But studies by the RAND Corporation found that this isn’t so. In Canada and Britain, for example, scholars found just as much unnecessary care (as a percent of the total) as they found in the United Staes. Then there is fraud, which is a special problem in government-administered programs. In Medicare and Medicaid, for example, fraud is estimated to consume at least $100 billion a year. Hospital upcoding (claiming a higher level of patient severity in order to obtain a higher insurance payment) is another problem. One study estimates that increased upcoding (relative to a decade earlier) was associated with $14.6 billion in hospital payments. Although doctors are the biggest critics of claim denials, hospitals are by far a bigger problem. Suppose a patient’s condition is stabilized in an ER. Then the medically correct procedure is usually to send the patient home and let further care be outpatient. Yet some hospitals will keep the patient for a night or two and try to bill an insurer for that cost. Suppose a patient’s condition warrants keeping the patient in an 'observation bed' for a night or two. Some hospitals will treat the patient as a full admission instead and try to bill the insurer at a much higher rate. These are just two of hundreds of ways some hospitals try to add unnecessary costs to our health care system. When insurers deny these claims and refuse to pay the bills they are performing a socially useful function. And the price of that function is not unreasonable. Despite claims that insurers put 'profits before people,' profit margins for health insurers are well below those of the average company in the S&P 500. The Role of Preauthorization An important tool private insurers use to avoid unnecessary spending and inappropriate care is to require preauthorization for a particular drug, therapy, or procedure. Doctors tend to regard these procedures as burdensome and irksome. Yet only 7.4% of requests by patients in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans are denied. Moreover, in the vast majority of appeals (83.2%), the initial denials are overturned. If you follow the health policy literature, you might be led to believe that the denial rate is a special problem in Medicare Advantage. In fact, the denial rate in Medicaid is twice that of the Medicare Advantage rate. Some policymakers have decided to take aim at the use of AI in generating denials. At the same time, some doctors are using AI to file their appeals—greatly reducing the time to file and increasing the success rate. Yet both trends should be applauded if the desire is to make the entire process more efficient. Overall, our health insurance system can be improved, and scholars associated with the Goodman Institute have proposed many ways to do that. But we cannot have a system that works well without companies that perform the functions health insurers are performing today. The public seems to understand this. Despite occasional complaints, more than two-thirds of Americans rate their health insurance as 'good’ or 'excellent.' And that holds for all kinds of insurance: employer plans, (Obamacare) marketplace plans, Medicare and even Medicaid. Even among people who say they are not in good health (and who, presumably, need medical care), a substantial majority give positive ratings to their health plans. Only a tiny percent rate their insurance as 'poor.' And that is good news.

Pakistan: Rekindling Terror In Punjab – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On January 2, 2025, the Punjab Police (Pakistan) released its annual performance report for 2024, highlighting significant achievements in apprehending criminals and ensuring public safety. Over 137,000 fugitives and proclaimed offenders involved in serious crimes were arrested across the province, including Lahore. Among them, 104 dangerous fugitives evading justice abroad were extradited to Pakistan. The report reveals that more than 26,000 A-category and over 111,000 B-category criminals were apprehended in 2024. Furthermore, over 66,000 judicial absconders were arrested, comprising 6,907 in the A-category and 59,373 in the B-category. Intelligence-based operations (IBOs) also led to the arrest of over 35,000 habitual offenders, including 15,154 from the A-category and 20,485 from the B-category. While Police in the province were racking up achievements relating to crimes and criminals, terrorism-related incidents in Punjab, Pakistan’s heartland province, recorded a rise in 2024, after a continuous decline over the preceding seven years, since 2017. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Punjab recorded a total of 59 terrorism-linked fatalities [Nine civilians, four Security Force (SF) personnel and 46 terrorists] in 27 terrorism-related incidents of killing in 2024, as against 48 fatalities (Seven civilians, four SF personnel and 37 terrorists) in 15 terrorism-related incidents of killing in 2023. Overall fatalities thus registered a 23 per cent increase. It is useful to recall, however, that the highest terrorism-related fatalities in the province were reported in 2013, at 1,656. Year 2022 registered just 11 terrorism-related fatalities (10 civilians and one terrorist), the lowest in the province since the commencement of its tryst with terrorism. The highest terrorism-related fatalities in the province were reported in 2013, at 1,656. While terrorism-related fatalities in 2024 increased, as compared to the previous year, terrorism-linked incidents in 2024 remained low, with 54 incidents recorded, as against 82 in 2023. However, the number of major incidents of killing (each involving three or more fatalities) increased from 12 fatalities in two incidents in 2023, to 28 fatalities in five incidents in 2024. The most prominent major incidents in 2024 was reported on October 24, when 10 terrorists were killed during a clash with the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab Police during an Intelligence based Operation (IBO) in the hilly area of Makadwala in the Mianwali District of Punjab. The operation was launched following intelligence reports of the presence of 10 to 15 terrorists in the region. Other prominent major terrorism-linked incidents in the province in 2024 included: December 1: Four militants were killed and two Policemen sustained injuries during a clash, when a group of militants attacked the Chapri Police Station in Mianwali District. According to Police officers, almost 20 militants attacked the Chapri Police Station on the provincial border with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Police were on a high alert; as a result, the attack was successfully repulsed and four militants were killed. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. November 23: On November 23, the CTD killed three terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Chakri village, Rawalpindi District. The three were killed in the exchange of fire, while another two managed to escape. October 6: At least seven TTP terrorists were killed in an IBO by CTD near the Makarwal area of Mianwali District. Eight other terrorists managed to escape. May 12: Four terrorists, involved in the killing of a Policemen, were shot dead during firing by their own accomplices in the Karol Jungle of Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab. Alarmed at the rising incidents of terrorism in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan, Punjab CTD identified 25,432 suspected terrorists in the province, according to an April 9, 2024, report, quoting sources. A report had also been compiled in which details of affiliations of these individuals with different banned organizations, as well as other particulars, were given. The CTD also started conducting surveillance of these persons. Sources elaborated, further, that, of the 25,432 identified persons, 8,926 were affiliated just one organization. Further, the report noted, 'There are 968 such persons in Punjab who are inspired by the ideology of Daesh (Islamic State), a militant outfit designated as a terrorist organization by several countries of the world.' Moreover, by April 15, 2024, the Punjab CTD had completed geo-tagging of over 19,000 seminaries (madrassas) in the province and over 9,000 suspected terrorists were put on a watch list. The list included 65 individuals who had returned from Syria in recent years. Besides, CTD was monitoring 22 people, who had returned home after their release from Guantanamo Bay. According to the CTD record, there were 2,298 youth in Punjab who had received terrorist training in Afghanistan, while 1,566 individuals were identified as having trained within the country. Similarly, the record showed that 540 persons, who were released from Afghan jails, were also under the scanner. As the mainstream Islamic militant outfits assert their presence, blasphemy cases continue to occur in the province, and radicalisation remains rampant. Blasphemy has been used by the Islamist fundamentalists and extremists as a weapon to target minorities. According to partial data compiled by SATP, eight blasphemy related incidents of violence were recorded during 2024, in which five persons were killed, while three persons sustained injuries. There were only three such incidents in 2023 resulting in one fatality and one injury. Three persons were killed in two blasphemy related incidents in 2022, and another three in such violence in 2021. In the most recent incident of a blasphemy attack, a 40-year-old Ahmadi man was killed in the Dhamial Police Station area of Rawalpindi (Rawalpindi District) in Punjab on December 5, 2024. According to a statement by Jamaat Ahamddiya spokesperson Aamir Mahmood, Tayyab was visiting his brother’s shop where he was fatally attacked. The attacker allegedly shouted anti-Ahmadi slurs while he carried out the attack. 'Some days ago, extremists had also attacked his brother’s shop by throwing stones at it and were issuing constant threats. Tayyab’s brother was constantly receiving threats and very recently moved his family out of Rawalpindi,' the Jamaat Ahamddiya statement noted. According to the Lahore based Center for Social Justice (CSJ)’s March 2024 report, at least 329 persons were accused of blasphemy under the law in 2023, out of which Punjab accounted for the highest number (179), followed by Sindh (79). According to CSJ, 2,449 persons have been accused of blasphemy between 1987 and 2023, among who Punjab registered the highest number of 1,770 cases, followed by 471 in Sindh. CSJ cited data from the Punjab Prison Department, indicating that, as of February 13, 2024, there were 587 prisoners in jail for blasphemy under sections 295-A, B and C of the Pakistan Penal Code, across the province. Among these, 515 were under trial, including 508 males, six females, and one juvenile prisoner. Despite the Police and other law enforcement agencies in Punjab reporting a declining trend of crime, a recent report indicated a 5 per cent increase in criminal cases in 2024, as compared to 2023. Statistics published by Geo News on December 30 reflected a 5 per cent spike in criminal cases in Punjab, with 1,067,000 cases registered, as against 1,010,000 in the preceding year, an increase of 57,000 cases. According to Police records, a total of more than 1,067,000 cases were registered in the province during 11 and a half months, including 233 cases of murder during robbery, 1,262 cases of gang rape of women, and 3,880 cases of sexual assault against minors. Records also included 85 cases of kidnapping for ransom and 504 murders. While the Police and CTD large operational claims, several reports suggest that TTP is strengthening its base in Punjab. According to a January 29, 2024, report, TTP has launched a new wing, Ustarana (or Ustrani), comprising highly-trained, well-equipped and motivated cadres, to specifically target Punjab Police personnel and make inroads into the territory. At least three Dera Ghazi Khan (DG Khan) check posts — Lakhani, Jhangi and Triman — situated in the tribal areas along the provincial borders, have become especially vulnerable because of the emerging threat of TTP’s new Ustarana wing. A senior official told Dawn that the TTP, after launching Ustarana, has increased its influence, striking fear among the local tribal people. TTP also demonstrated its presence in the capital city, Lahore, where a Policeman, Ghulam Rasool, was posted in the Police Lines, was shot dead by terrorists near the Tibbi Police Station on May 1, 2024. 'It’s the third incident of targeted killing in a week’s time', the Police stated. A TTP- affiliated channel claimed responsibility for the attack. On the same day, seven Policemen were injured in an overnight attack by terrorists at the Jhangi Check Post in the Taunsa District of Punjab. A TTP-affiliated channel claimed the attack. Further on May 5, two terrorists were killed in 'friendly fire' when a group of TTP cadres attacked CTD personnel in Rawalpindi city (Rawalpindi District), Punjab. The slain terrorists, Naseebullah and Ehsanullah, were identified as TTP fighters. On May 30, 2024, the Provincial Police heightened the security level in the city following a terrorism threat to the headquarters of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA), as well as four Police Stations and Police units in Lahore. The threat was issued by the Khurasani group of TTP, after which the Police leadership held a meeting to devise a strategy to counter any possible terrorist activity in the city. 'It has been learnt reliably that the defunct TTP (Khurasani network), operating under its commander, Ali Zar, has planned terrorist activities to target the Police units in Lahore,' the special information report of the Punjab Police noted. The Police Stations the terrorist outfit allegedly intended to target included Mozang, Badami Bagh, Racecourse and Batapur. Similarly, the Liberty Market Facilitation Centre, the CIA Kotwali and the CIA headquarters, were among the targets of the terrorist organisation, according to the Police report. On January 4, 2025, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) released videos showing its cadres patrolling areas in southern Punjab. These visuals indicate the TTP's growing presence and expansion into Punjab, despite the security establishment’s claims of decimating terrorist groups in the province. With escalating TTP operations across the Afghan border into Pakistan and a significant deterioration in the security situation in the adjacent KP province, a spike in terrorist violence in Punjab is likely as well.

Why Washington Still Pretends January 6 Was An Attempted ‘Coup’ –...	By Ryan McMaken It’s been four years since the January 6 riots of 2021, and with each passing year it becomes more clear that the event was not an insurrection, and it certainly wasn’t a 'coup' of any sort. The legacy media and the Washington ruling elite—two groups united in their loathing for ordinary Americans—cling to the 'insurrection' narrative because it allows them to play victim, and to portray the unorganized populist opposition as dangerous. Thus, we are to believe that an 'insurrection' led by powerless working-class activists from the countryside posed a threat to the nuclear-armed machine that is the federal government. The fruits of this narrative—from the elites’ perspective—are already evident. For four years, the FBI—which can’t be bothered with hunting down rapists and real criminals—has relentlessly pursued the 'insurrectionists.' Virtually all of these 'criminals,' which the FBI would have you believe are violent felons, have been convicted of petty crimes like trespassing. Others have been convicted of 'crimes' that were perfectly legal throughout the first hundred years of American history, but became 'crimes' as the federal government gradually destroyed the Bill of Rights after the Civil War. These newly invented 'crimes' include unconstitutional thoughtcrimes like 'seditious conspiracy.' Among those convicted of actual violence, only a handful were convicted of possessing firearms on capitol grounds. Those convicted of actually using weapons against police were using weapons like crutches and bear spray. No one was convicted of any sort of violence that can seriously be compared to any type of real-life coup or insurrection. The hysteria over this 'coup' has also served to vastly increase the power of the tax parasites known as the Capitol Police. Since the January 6 riots, the Capitol’s top costumed police bureaucrat, Tom Manger, has attempted to turn the police force into a national spy agency of sorts. As Politico reports: Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger has sought to shift the agency’s identity as a traditional police force with a focus on Capitol Hill to a 'protective force' built on intelligence gathering, threat assessment and flexing its nationwide authority and jurisdiction. It now has an intelligence bureau with dozens of agents, as well as field offices in Florida and California, with more possible in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas. Already saddled with the FBI, the NSA, the BATF, and a half dozen other heavily armed federal spy and police agencies, America, it seems, now requires yet another agency to spy on Americans. The Capitol Cops have done their best to put forward plenty of theater designed to make themselves out to be the victims, even though the only homicide committed on January 6 was committed by trigger-happy Capitol cop Michael Byrd. Byrd shot protestor Ashli Babbitt who was 'armed' only with a pocket knife—a knife that was in her pocket when Byrd shot her. What Would a Real Coup Looks Like? So fact that the January 6 riot was nothing that we might call a coup is made clear by the fact that the alleged insurrectionists had no plan to replace the existing regime with something else. In the real world, a coup requires the existence of some group of elites in the wing waiting to replace the status quo elites. This clearly was not the case on January 6, 2021. Indeed, the rioters in the Capitol enjoyed no support from any group of elites at all. It was simply a disorganized riot. Put another way, the January 6 riot was not an attempted coup because it simply wasn’t the sort of event that historians and political scientists—the people who actually study coups—generally define as a coup. Comparing the events of January 6 to those of, say, the 1973 Chilean coup, or the attempted Japanese coup of 1937 shows just how far from a coup the January 6 riot was. So how do we know a coup when we see one? In their article 'Global Instances of Coups from 1950 to 2010: A New Dataset,' authors Jonathan M. Powell and Clayton L. Thyne provide a definition: A coup attempt includes illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive. There are two key components of this definition. The first is that it is illegal. Powell and Thyne note that this 'illegal' qualifier is important to include 'because it differentiates coups from political pressure, which is common whenever people have freedom to organize.' In other words, protests, or threats of protest don’t count as coups. Neither do legal efforts such as a vote of no confidence or an impeachment. But an even more critical aspect of Powell and Thyne’s definition is that it requires the involvement of elites. This can be seen in any stereotypical example of a coup d’etat. This generally involves a renegade military detachment, military officers, and others from within the state apparatus who can employ knowledge, skills, influence, and coercive tools gained through membership in the regime’s elite circles. The attempted coup in Japan in 1937, for example, was carried out by more than fifteen hundred officers and men of the Japanese imperial army. They nonetheless failed, likely because they miscalculated the amount of support they enjoyed among other officers. More recently, in the 2009 Honduran coup, the bulk of the Honduran army turned on the president, Manuel Zelaya, and sent him into exile. That was a successful coup. More famously, Chile’s 1973 coup was successfully led by Augusto Pinochet, the commander-in-chief of the army, and his position enabled him to shell the Chilean executive palace with military hardware. Contrast this with nameless MAGA hat–wearing flag wavers, and the inappropriateness of the term 'coup' in this case should be blatantly obvious. With real coups, power is seized by a faction of the elite which has the ability to take control of the machinery of the state indefinitely. Although some of Trump’s critics claim he was somehow responsible for Wednesday’s mob, it is clear that Trump was not coordinating or directing any sort of military operation through Twitter posts. There was no plan for holding power. Had those who invaded the Capitol building managed to take control of the building for a time, there’s no reason to think this would have somehow translated into control of the state. How would it? The real coercive power remained well ensconced within an apparently undivided military apparatus. Must the military be at the center of any coup attempt? The answer is no. But, even in these other cases, it is clear that what happened on January 6 was no coup. For example, Powell and Thyne emphasize that military involvement at early stages is not necessary: [Other definitions] more broadly allow non-military elites, civilian groups, and even mercenaries to be included as coup perpetrators. This broad definition includes four sources, including [a definition stating that coup] perpetrators need only be 'organized factions'. We take a middle ground. Coups may be undertaken by any elite who is part of the state apparatus. These can include non-civilian members of the military and security services, or civilian members of government. However, in the case of January 6, the rioters had no institutional backing, military or otherwise. The had no promises of help from elites, and no reason to assume they had access to any coercive tools necessary to seize and hold control of a state’s executive apparatus. Nor was Donald Trump even in a position to promise such things. As noted by Elaine Kamarck at the Brookings Institution: We now know that Trump did not even have the support of his own family and friends nor his handpicked White House staff. To pursue his plans, he had to rely on a close group of advisors known as 'the clown show' led by Rudi Giuliani, a pillow manufacturer, and a dot-com millionaire—none of whom was in government and none of whom controlled the most important 'assets' (guns, tanks, planes etc.) needed to take over a government. In contrast to most successful coups in history, Trump had no faction of the military, no faction of the National Guard, and no faction of the District of Col[u]mbia Metropolitan Police at his disposal. In other words, the rioters had no avenue to call upon any faction of the state or any group of elites for backing. Kamarck continues: As we learned in some of the most recent hearings, it was Vice President Mike Pence who was in contact with the military and the police, and most importantly, the military and the police were taking orders from Pence not Trump, the commander in chief! Given that Trump didn’t actually attempt to secure power for himself, we can guess Trump knew that no branch of the federal government was about to step in to illegally extend his tenure as president. 'Coup' Now Means 'Thing I Don’t Like' Since 2021, the media has decided to use terms like 'coup' and insurrection selectively for political effect. This phenomenon was examined in a November 2019 article titled 'Coup with Adjectives: Conceptual Stretching or Innovation in Comparative Research?,' by Leiv Marsteintredet and Andres Malamud. The authors note that as the incidence of real coups has declined, the word has become more commonly applied to political events that are not coups. But, as the authors note, this is not merely an issue of splitting hairs, explaining that 'the choice of how to conceptualize a coup is not to be taken lightly since it carries normative, analytical, and political implications.' Increasingly, the term really means 'this is a thing I don’t like.' It’s clear the January 6 panel in Congress, and countless anti-Trump pundits, use the term in this way to express disapproval and also to justify regime crackdowns against pro-Trump opponents of the regime. It’s easier to justify harsh prison sentences for a disorganized group of vandals if their acts can be framed as a nearly successful coup and therefore a threat to 'our democracy.' Moreover, if the situation were reversed, and if protestors had invaded the Capitol to support a left-wing, proregime candidate, we can be sure that the vocabulary used to describe the event in the mainstream press would be quite different.

How Assad’s Failures Fueled Syria’s Collapse – OpEd	By Abdulrahman Al-Rashed When Bashar Assad lost control of the oil-rich areas in eastern Syria, most of which came under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces, he turned to Iran for oil and its derivatives to enable his forces to continue fighting and to maintain services in the areas under his rule.His weak economy was collapsing and the government was in a state of bankruptcy as it waged war without any revenues. He relied on drugs and terrorism, which became the regime’s most significant exports.Some might think this is an exaggeration or propaganda against a fallen regime incapable of defending itself. However, the regime itself did not hide this reality and even used it as leverage in negotiating its regional and international relations.No Saudi ambassador arrived in Damascus despite the agreement reached in May 2023. Diplomatic representation was limited to operating out of the Four Seasons Hotel and Saudi Arabia did not send its ambassador to the Syrian capital for the first time until the entry of the new leadership and its forces.Relations slowed as the regime failed to fulfill its promises, including halting the smuggling of Captagon. Assad, as usual, delayed delivering on the promised reconciliation and expected billions of dollars in compensation to stop the smuggling operations. Riyadh was not pleased with this, especially since rewarding drug traffickers for halting their activities would encourage further extortion. Assad acted like Colombia’s infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar, earning, according to Western estimates, more than $5 billion annually from Captagon sales — more than his oil revenues before the war.I met the ousted president at least five times in direct sessions, where we talked for hours. Even so, I cannot claim to truly know him. I published most of the discussions from those meetings in Asharq Al-Awsat at the time but stopped after the assassination operations in Lebanon, as his threats began targeting journalists. I was also blacklisted from entering Lebanon. I met him again shortly before the revolution against him, in a group session, where he appeared confident and assured of his safety. In any case, despite the horrifying revelations about him after his downfall, which added to what we already knew about his terrifying regime, he always seemed polite in person, ready to listen and respond. Rarely did he lose his composure. This was his demeanor with all his guests.This left many puzzled about his true nature. Was there a sinister group behind the atrocities in Syria and Lebanon? Was it his brother Maher, his officer Ali Mamlouk, his wife Asma or the Iranian Qassem Soleimani?The truth is that he was behind it all, orchestrating and managing it — not the image he projected. He compensated for his failure to govern the state by wielding brute force. The impoverished country became even poorer, contrary to his claims of being targeted by hostile nations.The truth is, Assad received widespread regional and international support after assuming power. There was hope he would move Syria beyond Hafez Assad’s legacy toward openness and modernization. Instead, he increased the number of prisons, surpassed his father in terms of assassinations and bombings, and hosted terrorist organizations.Thus, the Syrian revolution against Bashar was no surprise, even though it erupted three months after Tunisia’s uprising. Having failed economically, Assad resorted to drug trafficking and hosting armed groups during the Iraq war in coordination with Iran, repeating the same approach during his decade-long war. I cannot recall him ever discussing economic development, modernization or improving citizens’ livelihoods before the revolution.Today, Syria and its new leaders need to reflect on the history of the Assad regime. It is no surprise that a regime collapses when a soldier guarding it or a university professor, who represents the societal elite, earns about $20 a month. The profound lesson is that the risks of economic failure are greater than those of security failure.Economic failure preceded the war by years, as well as America’s Caesar Act sanctions, the freezing of state assets abroad and the collapse of the currency. It was the result of Assad’s mismanagement, rampant corruption, weak governance and the regime’s reliance on a shadow economy fueled by drugs and foreign wars.Despite their severe hardships in the countries in which they sought refuge, Syrians have achieved success in every field. Today, a great opportunity lies ahead. The government of Ahmad Al-Sharaa must first bring together all Syrians in their diversity to become part of the state and open up to the world to attract investment.

A Comparative Analysis Of Regime Survivability: Iran (2025) Vs. S...	The Value of Comparative Analysis Predicting the near future of Iran’s regime in 2025 requires a methodical approach grounded in historical parallels. Comparative analysis offers a powerful lens to assess how authoritarian regimes collapse when exposed to converging pressures such as economic strain, geopolitical isolation, ideological disillusionment, and domestic unrest. The Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991 remains a critical case study, demonstrating how systemic vulnerabilities can unravel even the most entrenched regimes. As historian John Gaddis observes, 'The Cold War ended not with a bang but a whimper, as the Soviet system imploded under its own contradictions' (Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History, 2005). By examining these parallels, we can identify patterns that might illuminate the survival odds of Iran’s regime, which is facing mounting crises today. Iran’s challenges bear striking resemblance to those that contributed to the Soviet collapse. Escalating economic hardships, the loss of regional influence, and growing public disillusionment mirror the conditions that unraveled the USSR. As political scientist Mark Katz notes, 'Authoritarian regimes rarely fall solely from external pressure; it is the internal cracks that determine how long they last' (Katz, Revolutionary Regimes, 2019). Using a weighted framework to evaluate key survival factors—geopolitical isolation, economic strain, ideological collapse, and internal dissent—this analysis compares the Soviet Union’s final years to Iran’s current trajectory. The findings highlight that worsening economic conditions and any external military strike will further accelerate Iran’s decline, significantly reducing its chances of survival. Methodology: Factors Influencing Survival The analysis employs a weighted framework to evaluate the survival prospects of Iran and the Soviet Union. Four key factors are assessed for their impact on regime stability: 1. Geopolitical Isolation (30% weight): Loss of allies and external influence, compounded by adversarial forces. 2. Economic Strain (30% weight): Financial deterioration and the regime’s capacity to manage economic crises. 3. Ideological Collapse (20% weight): Erosion of public belief in the regime’s foundational principles. 4. Internal Dissent and Repression (20% weight): Grassroots opposition, elite defections, and the effectiveness of state suppression mechanisms. Each factor is scored on a scale of 0-100% for severity, with the weighted average determining the probability of survival. 1. Geopolitical Isolation Soviet Union (1991): • The USSR experienced rapid geopolitical isolation as Eastern European communist regimes collapsed (e.g., East Germany, Poland, Hungary), and independence movements swept through its republics. The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 symbolized its diminishing global reach (Gaddis, 2005). • The U.S. and NATO expanded their influence in Eastern Europe, leaving the Soviet Union cornered and weakening its ideological claim to global leadership. Score: 20%. The Soviet Union’s loss of alliances and territorial control severely weakened its geopolitical position. Iran (2025): • Iran’s regional isolation has intensified with the collapse of key proxies: Syria, Hezbollah, and potentially the Houthis in Yemen. The loss of Syria disrupts Iran’s logistical support to Hezbollah, while Hezbollah’s neutralization weakens Iran’s military deterrence in the Levant (Al Jazeera, 2024). • Escalating tensions with Gulf states, Israel, and Western powers compound Iran’s isolation, while international sanctions continue to restrict its global engagement. Score: 25%. While Iran retains limited influence in Iraq and Yemen, its growing isolation mirrors the Soviet Union’s geopolitical decline. 2. Economic Strain Soviet Union (1991): • The Soviet economy stagnated due to inefficiencies in central planning, a bloated military budget, and declining industrial productivity. The collapse of global oil prices in the 1980s further depleted revenues (Kotz & Weir, Revolution from Above, 1997). • Gorbachev’s reforms, including perestroika, inadvertently exacerbated economic instability by exposing systemic inefficiencies without providing effective solutions. Score: 15%. Economic collapse undermined the Soviet regime’s ability to sustain itself financially. Iran (2025): • Iran’s economic decline is accelerating due to U.S.-led sanctions, inflation, and currency devaluation. Rampant corruption and financial mismanagement exacerbate the crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that Iran’s GDP growth is stagnant, while inflation exceeds 40%, pushing millions into poverty (IMF Report, 2024). • Funding for regional proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis places additional strain on Iran’s resources. Unlike the Soviet Union, Iran lacks an industrial base, making it more vulnerable to prolonged economic crises. Score: 10-15%. Iran’s worsening economic crisis is a critical vulnerability, and further deterioration will significantly reduce its odds of survival. 3. Ideological Collapse Soviet Union (1991): • Marxism-Leninism lost credibility as living standards stagnated and the system failed to deliver on its promises. The collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe further discredited the Soviet Union’s ideological foundation (Suny, The Soviet Experiment, 1998). • Nationalist movements within Soviet republics, including the Baltics and Ukraine, undermined Moscow’s ideological control. Score: 10%. The ideological collapse of Marxism-Leninism was a central factor in the Soviet Union’s demise. Iran (2025): • Iran’s theocratic ideology is increasingly rejected by its secular, youthful population. Widespread protests over women’s rights and personal freedoms reflect growing public disillusionment with the regime’s foundational principles (BBC Persian, 2024). • The fall of proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis undermines Iran’s claim to leadership of the 'Axis of Resistance,' further eroding its ideological legitimacy. Score: 15%. While ideological collapse is slower than in the Soviet case, public rejection of Iran’s theocratic system continues to deepen. 4. Internal Dissent and Repression Soviet Union (1991): • Anti-regime protests erupted across Soviet republics, driven by nationalist movements in the Baltics, Ukraine, and Central Asia. Elite defections, including Boris Yeltsin’s opposition to Gorbachev, fractured the regime (Plokhy, The Last Empire, 2015). • Gorbachev’s reluctance to use force allowed dissent to grow unchecked, accelerating the USSR’s collapse. Score: 15%. Widespread dissent and weak repression mechanisms destabilized the Soviet Union. Iran (2025): • Iran faces persistent protests over economic grievances, women’s rights, and political repression. Ethnic separatist movements (e.g., Kurds, Baluchs) exacerbate instability (HRW, 2024). • The regime’s security forces (IRGC, Basij) have shown a willingness to use force to suppress dissent, providing short-term stability but risking long-term fragmentation. Score: 20%. Iran’s stronger repression tools provide temporary stability, but mounting dissent reduces its long-term survivability. Final Survival Probabilities Factor Weight (%) Soviet Union (%)Iran (%)CommentGeopolitical Isolation (30%)20%25%Iran retains limited influence in Iraq and Yemen.Economic Strain (30%)15%10-15%Iran’s worsening economic crisis is a critical factor.Ideological Collapse (20%)10%15%Both regimes face growing ideological disillusionment.Internal Dissent (20%) 15%20%Iran’s repression tools are stronger than the USSR’s Iran Survival Probability (2025): Comparative analysis reveals that Iran’s regime faces pressures strikingly similar to those that led to the Soviet Union’s collapse. Economic deterioration, worsening geopolitical isolation, and growing public disillusionment significantly reduce its survivability. Further economic decline or military strikes by Israel or the U.S. will likely reduce Iran’s survival odds to 10-15%, paralleling the Soviet trajectory. As history demonstrates, no authoritarian regime can withstand the simultaneous collapse of its economic, geopolitical, and ideological foundations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy7wW2N6rpCd5	2025-01-06T16:25:37-08:00	
India: Irritants Persist In Andhra Pradesh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in dealing with the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) menace remained visible through 2024. In order to push the Maoists further back in the state, the Andhra Pradesh Cabinet decided, on August 7, 2024, to renew the ban on rebel outfits in Andhra Pradesh for another year. Addressing the media at the state secretariat, Information minister Kolusu Parthasarathy explained the Cabinet decision, 'The cabinet has approved proposals to extend the existing ban on organisations of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF) for another year under Section 3 (a) of the AP Public Security Act - 1992.' Meanwhile, according to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), one civilian was killed through 2024 in Andhra Pradesh. There was one such killing in 2023, as well as one each in 2022 and 2021. A total of 33 such killings have been registered since June 2, 2014, when Andhra Pradesh was split, to carve out the new state of Telangana. A high of five civilian fatalities were documented in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019, while a low of one fatality was registered in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. There were three fatalities in 2018 and four in 2020. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documenting Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-related violence across the country, undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana] has recorded 549 civilian fatalities till date (January 5, 2025), including a high of 132 civilian fatalities in 2005. In the fight against the Naxalites, the Security Forces (SFs) have not suffered any losses over the past seven years. The last fatality registered in this category was on May 5, 2017, when a Home Guard, Sheikh Valli, was killed in a landmine blast triggered by CPI-Maoist cadres on the Lothugedda Junction-Balapam stretch in Visakhapatnam District. This was the lone SF fatality documented in Andhra Pradesh after its split on June 2, 2014. Since March 6, 2000, undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana] has registered 133 SF fatalities (January 5, 2025), including a high of 41 in 2001. The Maoists did not suffer any loss through 2024, as well in 2023 and 2022. Six Maoists were killed in 2021. A total of 32 such killings have been documented since June 2, 2014. A high of nine Maoist fatalities was documented in 2019, while a low of one fatality was documented in 2020. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 916 Maoist fatalities (January 5, 2025) have been documented in undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana], including a high of 165 in 2003. While SF ascendency in the state had been significantly consolidated on the ground before the split of the state in June 2014, it has been further reinforced thereafter. Meanwhile, no Naxalites were arrested in 2024, though SFs arrested 10 Naxalites in 2023, according to the SATP database. Since June 2, 2014, the total number of arrests stands at 159. Continuing SF pressure also resulted in the surrender of 45 Naxalites in 2024, in addition to nine in 2023. Since June 2, 2014, surrenders total 550. On October 11, 2024, two Maoists, Muchika Aitha (20) and Madakam Hinge (20), surrendered to Superintendent of Police (SP) Amit Bardar in Alluri Sitarama Raju District, expressing disillusionment with the party’s ideology and a desire for a peaceful life. Aitha and Hinge both hail from the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh and had been active in the Maoist ranks for several years. Both the cadres cited several reasons for their surrender: increasing Police presence, the government’s developmental initiatives, and the effective rehabilitation policies offered by the state, which include financial rewards and job opportunities for surrendering cadres. Other parameters of violence also suggest diminishing Maoist activities in the state, as in all other Maoist-affected regions in India. The Maoists did not exchange fire with SFs in 2024, while there was at least one such incident in 2023. The State did not record any incident of explosion in 2024, as in 2023. No incident of explosion was recorded in 2022 and 2021 either. The last incident of explosion was recorded on August 3, 2020, in which two civilians were killed. The Maoists could not issue any bandh (shutdown strike) call in 2024 or in 2023 and 2022. The last bandh call was given on April 26, 2021, but drew poor response, with peaceful prevailing almost across the tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The bandh call had come from the CPI-Maoist, in protest against alleged harassment and torture of innocent people, especially tribals, and social and civil rights activists, by SFs. An analysis of overground and underground Maoist activities in Andhra Pradesh confirms their diminishing impact in the state. According to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from four districts in 2024 (Andhra Pradesh has a total of 26 districts). Only the Kurnool District fell in the ‘moderately affected’ category, while the remaining three districts – Alluri Sitharama Raju, Parvathipuram Manyam, and Visakhapatnam – were ‘marginally affected.’ In 2023, Maoist activities were reported from four districts, with Alluri Sitharama Raju District falling into the 'moderately affected’ category, while the remaining three districts – Visakhapatnam, Prakasam, and Sri Sathya Sai – were in the 'marginally affected’ category. Realisation of the futility of the Maoist ‘movement’ is increasingly widespread among the people. On May 30, 2024, tribals organised a rally against the CPI-Maoist at the Maddigaruvu weekly market in G Madugula Mandal (administrative sub division) in the Alluri Sitarama Raju District. As many as 500 people from Killamkota, Boithili, Injari, Ginnelakota, Jamiguda, and Kuntarla Panchayats (village-level local self-government institutions) participated in the rally and raised the slogan 'Maoists don’t come to the Alluri district.' They claimed that development programmes were now taking place, which was not the case during the earlier era of Maoist dominance. Images of various development projects in their areas were displayed on placards. The tribals said that since the past year, the establishment of cell towers and the construction of roads in the Maoist-affected areas had been ongoing, and hoped that such development work would be carried out on a large scale by the government. However, on December 10, 2024, CPI-Maoist cadres set a private car on fire on the Bhadrachalam-Chintoor Highway near Sirivella village under the Chinturu Police Station limits in Alluri Sitharamaraju District. According to sources, the Maoists forced the passengers in the car to get out of the vehicle and set it on fire. SFs have recovered arms on at least three occasions in the current year, as compared to four such incidents in 2023. A total of 48 incidents involving the recovery of arms has been recorded in the state since 2014. Meanwhile, taking action against the Maoist rebels, on October 1, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken up an investigation to probe supply of weapons and explosives to the CPI-Maoist, with the objective of targeting Police officers in Andhra Pradesh. The case is linked to the arrest of two persons – Naka David Raj (from Odisha) and Vijay Viswas (from Dantewada, Chhattisgarh) in the Chinturu area of Alluri Sitharama Raju District in February 2024. The duo was travelling on a two-wheeler, when intercepted by Police officers. They were found in possession of fuse wire, detonators, gelatin sticks, and handwritten sheets in Hindi and Telugu. Further, on March 29, 2024, the NIA charged a suspect for his role in radicalising vulnerable youths using CPI-Maoist ideology. The probe agency filed its original charge sheet in the Munchingput conspiracy case in Andhra Pradesh in May 2021. Ramakkagiri Chandra is the eighth accused to be charged in the case related to the radicalization of 'vulnerable youths towards the Maoist ideology and extension of support to the banned CPI-Maoist.' Chandra was a ‘state committee member’ of the Pragathisheela Karmika Samakhya (PKS), a frontal outfit of the CPI-Maoist. The NIA's investigation has revealed that Chandra conspired with underground leaders of the CPI-Maoist to promote the activities of the organisation. The Andhra Pradesh successes against the Maoists on the ground are astonishing in view of the fact that this was the epicentre of the movement in the country, as well as that they are overwhelmingly the result of State Police initiatives. However, the Maoists cannot be written off as yet. Further, the existing and significant shortages of resources in the State Police raise concerns. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, the State Police continues to face critical gaps in capacities and deployment. As against the sanctioned strength of 106,368 policemen in Andhra Pradesh, only 88,054 were in position, creating a deficit of 17.21 per cent, indicating that, as against the sanctioned police-population ratio (police personnel per 100,000 population) of 200.40 in the state, only 165.89 were in position. The Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometres) in Andhra Pradesh was just 54.05, against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio were well below their sanctioned strengths, at 65.29 and 82.82, respectively. In addition, the sanctioned strength of the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State was 144, but just 128 officers were in position, creating a deficit of 11.11 per cent, substantially weakening the executive command of the Force. Andhra Pradesh has led an exemplary campaign to degrade the Maoist threat in what was at one time the Maoist heartland. Residual elements of the movement in the State, nevertheless, persevere. SF dominance has pushed the Maoists, and it is unlikely that the rebels will be able to rebuild their strength. Nevertheless, it is imperative for the Governments, both at the Central and State levels, to address critical security deficits and strengthen the administrative, developmental and security outreach to eliminate the remaining influence of the rebels.

The Second Trump Presidency And NATO’s Nuclear Approach – Analysi...	By Shravishtha Ajaykumar In February 2024, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump voiced dissatisfaction with the 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GD) defence spending target set by the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), urging them to increase it to 3 percent. He also threatened not to extend protection to those members unwilling to fulfil this requirement. Trump’s first term was dominated by a United States (US)-centric approach and the same is expected to define his upcoming second term. During the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump frequently criticised the Biden administration’s level of involvement. In his speech in February 2024, Trump used the issue of NATO defence spending to bolster his argument to withdraw the US from being a primary supporter of Ukraine. Old wars, old presidents As of November 2024, Trump’s speech is no longer just a possibility but a recollection of his previous term’s actions. In 2019, the Trump administration withdrew from the INF Treaty (1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty), leaving only the New START treaty to address US-Russian agreements on deploying nuclear weapons. The New START treaty has also been criticised by many experts and by Trump himself, who wants to negotiate a new treaty altogether, maintaining that the New START treaty alone is insufficient to limit the use of nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin had claimed that Western support in Ukraine, in the form of long-range missiles, may see a Russian nuclear response. While many US policy experts have criticised this as a near-impossible outcome, Putin’s rhetoric may have shaped the US sentiment of wanting to withdraw. US’s potential withdrawal from Ukraine would directly impact European powers, forcing countries like Germany to take a more prominent role and contribute more to their defence budget, something they have hesitated to do thus far, which would strain alliances within Europe and cohesion within NATO. Russia’s nuclear posturing will exacerbate tensions within NATO and between the European Union (EU) and the US. The previous Trump administration threatened to withdraw from NATO. While this did not materialise, the fear around the withdrawal indicated to competing global powers, like China and Russia, that NATO and the US do not function independently. The EU and NATO could come under growing pressure to strengthen their militaries, which could then heighten geopolitical differences, both within Europe and with the US. At its 75th anniversary Summit in July 2024, NATO tried to address its stance against Russia. However, its continued reliance on the US and hesitation to make Ukraine a full member has dampened these efforts. Nuclear posturing and NATO At the 2024 Summit in Washington D.C., NATO reaffirmed its status on nuclear weapons and development, identifying nuclear weapons as an instrument of international security and deterrence, especially in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war. As mentioned earlier, Russia has also reaffirmed its willingness to use nuclear weapons. Both Russia and the NATO countries gesturing to potential nuclear weapons use only indicates that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its attempt to contain nuclear proliferation is far from being successful. Furthermore, Finland and Sweden joining NATO may also impact the NPT. So far, these countries have opted out of alliances with nuclear weapons. Although neither of them possesses nuclear weapons, they are now a part of NATO and are under the protection of its nuclear umbrella. This inclusion will require these new members to strictly adhere to the required 2 percent (of GDP) defence spending. Trump's long-standing criticism of NATO and Europe’s military expenditure has had a lasting impact on transatlantic relations. States such as France and Germany may further develop autonomously operatedmilitary systems, potentially leading to different approaches in how NATO responds to security threats. Furthermore, Trump's support for a more hawkish posture towards the European military may induce reappraisals of Europe's reliance on the United States for military deterrence. Reaffirming NATO and strengthening nuclear security Rather than withdrawing or reducing its involvement in NATO, The US can approach the region more practically to reinvigorate the alliance’s defence posture, ensuring that its nuclear deterrence capabilities remain robust and relevant to the modern security environment. The next presidential term presents an opportunity to reactivate relationships with NATO partners and reiterate collective defence and nuclear security guarantees. Further, the US also can and should be at the forefront of supporting arms control, particularly due to the nuclear risk to Europe and West Asia. While Trump’s 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran has led to significant tensions, especially with Türkiye, a more balanced approach that combines deterrence with diplomacy would be more successful. The US can thus tackle the nuclear threat posed by Tehran, by maintaining its relationship with Britain, France and Germany, who are already addressing the problem, thereby helping restore stability in the region. The United States must continue its adherence to arms control treaties, including the aforementioned New START Treaty between the US and Russia, and continue to spearhead efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons through international mechanisms. In a changed geopolitical landscape in which new nuclear powers are emerging and state and non-state actors are challenging alliances, NATO must not only relaunch its nuclear posture, but also mobilise its members based on shared security, diplomacy, and arms control. The US must continue to engage with NATO and its allies, reaffirming the importance of collective defence and nuclear deterrence, while simultaneously advancing efforts to prevent further nuclear proliferation and reduce the risk of catastrophic conflict. Trump’s policies in his first term perceptibly altered NATO’s strategy for defence and nuclear security, by essentially enfeebling the alliance. The foundations of a stable, secure international order call for NATO to remain firm, steadfast, and able to respond to traditional and nuclear threats. Rather than withdrawing, the United States should seek to reaffirm its commitment to NATO, enhance nuclear security efforts, and work collaboratively with its allies to address emerging threats.

Setback In Sino-Indian Relations Due To Fresh Territorial And Wat...	Recent cartographic changes by China and its decision to dam a river in Tibet have raised the hackles in New Delhi putting recent arrived détente under strain. Last year, regional rivals India and China reached an agreement on border patrolling, reducing tension in the Eastern Ladakh sector. Prior to that in July, the Indian government'sEconomic Survey said that 'to boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make.' The border détente and the idea to allow Chinese investments were interpreted as early signs of a rapprochement between the two countries that were involved in an interminable border dispute and relentless jostling for supremacy in South Asia. But as 2025 dawned, cracks appeared in the relationship. China decided to form two 'Counties' called He'an and Hekang, in the Xinjiang province, parts of which fell in the Indian territory of Ladakh. India conveyed its protest to China about the establishment of these Counties on its territory. For India this was yet another case of China's cartographic aggression. China had earlier given its own names to various places in the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh which it claims is 'Southern Tibet' and, therefore, a part of China. Controversial Dam China also announced that it would build a gigantic dam, the biggest in the world, on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet, which flows into Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in India and then into Bangladesh. The Yarlung Zangbo of Tibet becomes Brahmaputra in India and Jamuna in Bangladesh. China's dam project is seen in India as threatening the livelihood of people in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam whose farmers depend on assured flows in the Brahmaputra. It is feared that China could weaponize water from the dam by withholding or releasing water in ways that could harm these Indian States. Similarly, Bangladeshi farmers will be affected by changes in the flow in the Jamuna due to manipulations at the dam in Tibet. The dam, which will cost US$ 137 billion, is located on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river at the U bend in Medog Country in Tibet. It will have the capacity to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. China says that the project is expected boost engineering industries and create employment in Tibet. But given the low industrialization in Tibet, the bulk of the beneficiaries will be in the already industrialised parts of China east of Tibet. India Protests Disturbed about the possible deleterious effects of the dam, the Indian External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last Friday: ' As a lower riparian state with established user rights to the waters of the river, we have consistently expressed, through expert-level and diplomatic channels, our views and concerns to the Chinese side over mega projects on rivers in their territory. There is a need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries. The Chinese side has been urged to ensure that the interests of downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas. We will continue to monitor and take necessary measures to protect our interests.' In response, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China had always been responsible for the development of cross-border rivers and the hydropower development in Tibet had been studied in an in-depth way for decades and safeguard measures had been taken for the security of the project. She added that China will continue to maintain communication with countries in the lower reaches through existing channels and step up international cooperation on disaster prevention and relief. Indian commentators point out that there is an India-China Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that requires China to provide hydrological information on the Brahmaputra River during monsoon season from May 15 to October 15 each year. Data includes water level, discharge, and rainfall. The data helps India with flood control and disaster mitigation. The MoU was renewed in 2008, 2013, and 2018, but expired on June 5, 2023. The two countries are currently renewing the MoU through diplomatic channels. Differing Views Be that as it may, views differ on the impact of the dam on India. The general Indian nationalist opinion is that it will be disadvantageous and harmful to India both economically and strategically. The matter was reportedly raised with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan by his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval in their meetings in New Delhi on January 5 and 6. News reports said that on March 1, 2012, the Brahmaputra had run completely dry at Pasighat in Arunchal Pradesh. But after a few hours, Pasighat got inundated! It indicated that water in the upper reaches was first released and then suddenly shut at a dam in Tibet. Nilanjan Ghosh of the Observer Research Foundation, recalled that in 2020, there was an increase in turbidity and blackening of the water in the Tsiang river, as the Yarlung Tsangpo is called in Arunachal Pradesh. There was also a temporary stoppage of data sharing by China over the high season flows during the 2020 Doklam military standoff between China and India. Hence the need for an agreement and strict adherence to it. Geologists point out that the Chinese dam projects are very close to the geological fault line where the Indian Plate collides with the Eurasian Plate. The area is therefore prone to earthquakes. Indeed, a study conducted by the China Earthquake Administration found that in the six years after the construction of the giant 'Three Gorge Dams' over the Yangtze river in the Hubei province in 2003, there were 3,429 earthquakes along the reservoir. But between 2000 and 2003, before the dam was constructed, there were only 94 earthquakes. Eighty large cracks appeared on the Three Gorges Dam's concrete face, just days after the reservoir was filled for the first time in 2003. These raised concerns about the dam's safety. In 1975, 62 dams had collapsed in Henan due to heavy downpours during a typhoon. That event killed more than 26,000 people by the official count – though other estimates were several times higher. Contrary View However, some experts on water resources management feel that the Chinese dam will not make a difference to Assam because the water in the Brahmaputra is not so much from Tibet but from tributaries and rainfall on the Indian side. The tributaries which contribute significantly to the Brahmaputra are Luhit, Dibang, and Dihang, near Sadiya on the Indian state of Assam. The rainfall on the Tibet side is less than on the Assam side. A large part of the Tibetan component of the basin, i.e. the longer stretch of the Yarlung Zangbo river is located in the rain-shadow north of the Himalaya, and is therefore a recipient of much less rainfall as compared to the south. While the average annual precipitation in the trans-Himalaya is around 300 mm, the average annual precipitation (that includes mainly rainfall) touches 3,000 mm in the south. The foothills are frequently fed by anomalous precipitation of a magnitude that is capable of causing great floods, experts note. While the peak flows at Nuxia and Tsela Dzong measuring stations at the great bend in the Tibetan plateau are about 5,000 and 10,000 cubic metres per second (cumecs), the peak flow at Guwahati in Assam is approximately 55,000 cumecs. The lean season flow in Nuxia is in the range of 300-500 cumecs, while the lean flow at Pasighat in India is to the tune of 2,000-plus cumecs, the one at Guwahati is around 4000-plus cumecs. According to Dr. Nilanjan Ghosh, Director at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in India, given the precipitation, run-off and sediment flow regimes, it is unlikely that any intervention on the Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet by China will cause any substantial harm for downstream economies in India and Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcyy19VPxQfGs8	2025-01-06T16:19:26-08:00	
Stalemate With Rebels Grips Cameroon’s Anglophone Region – Analys...	Every February 14 in a remote part of northwestern Cameroon, the people of Ngarbuh village gather to pray around the graves of the 21 civilians killed in 2020 by a group of soldiers and militiamen in one of the worst atrocities of the still-simmering civil war. After initially denying responsibility, the army investigated and released a statement calling it 'an unfortunate accident, the collateral result of security operations in the region.' Ma-Shey Margaret survived, but all of her neighbors were killed, including an uncle and his entire family. A row of five burned-out homes stands nearby as a haunting reminder of the massacre. 'I weep each time I set eyes on the mass graves of the innocent people,' the 49-year-old told HumAngle Media for a September 2024 article. 'Right now, we are still not safe. The military wants us to report the presence of the separatist fighters to them, which is a risky thing to do. We live in constant fear.' The roots of the conflict trace back more than 100 years, to the aftermath of World War I, when the country was split into British and French colonial control. Today, English-speakers account for nearly a fifth of Cameroon’s population of 24 million, the majority of whom speak French. What began in Cameroon’s two Anglophone regions as a series of peaceful protests against marginalization in 2016 has escalated into a devastating civil war. In the Northwest and Southwest regions, years of grievances at perceived discrimination coalesced into a 2017 declaration of independence and resulted in a military crackdown. After eight years of fighting, Cameroon is stuck in a festering conflict, unable to quell the tension and violence between its French- and English-speaking people. More than 6,000 have died at the hands of separatist and government forces, and at least a million people are homeless. 'Violence in the entire Anglophone region has been building in 2024,' Dr. Ladd Serwat of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED) said during a September 10 webinar. 'The second quarter of 2024 was actually the most violent of the conflict so far.' Reporting for the Nigerian media site HumAngle, Nalova Akua visited both Anglophone regions and said reprisal killings between separatists and security forces are a regular occurrence. 'The government has intensified its pursuit of a military solution to the conflict, hoping to take advantage of widening fragmentation between the armed separatist groups,' she wrote. Serwat said ACLED data shows a rise in infighting between separatist groups often trying to control small areas. Coupled with their increased illicit economic activity, kidnapping for ransom and targeting of civilians, the separatists appear to be moving further from the goal of independence and closer towards self-preservation, he believes. 'We certainly have seen the interests of armed groups become more and more localized,' he said. 'I think there’s less and less espoused interest in creating an entire separate country. The fragmentation of this conflict is increasing the levels of violence, but it’s also weakening the bargaining position of the separatist movement, which I think makes peace negotiations more difficult. There are more groups with more competing interests, so bringing those groups to the table can be quite challenging.' Simon Munzu, retired chair of the Coalition of Cameroon Federalist Groups and Activists steering committee and a former United Nations assistant secretary-general, has criticized Cameroon’s attempts at dialogue and peace-making, which have fizzled in recent years. 'All those measures have failed because the government is acting in bad faith,' he told HumAngle. 'It refuses to acknowledge the exact nature of the Anglophone problem. It therefore refuses to adopt real solutions that could resolve the problem and end the crisis. The measures it has taken so far are purely cosmetic.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy9p67zXoM_VI	2025-01-06T16:15:08-08:00	
Join The Army; Travel To Exotic, Distant Lands; And Radicalize – ...	It has been popular to see political and religious radicalisation as something oddly separable from institutions of state. State institutions are meant to cope and cure the condition, not foster it. Like some errant form, it takes place because of popular trends, messages floating in the detritus of the internet and the disrupting buzz and slurry of social media. It catches in conversation like a cold, inspiring the estranged, confused and lonely to take action. Of late, the righteous types in the military have been confronted by the prospect that their citadel of honourable service and upstanding behaviour could be a foundry for extremism and mental mutilation. Is there any more extremist act than killing someone, often nameless to the killer, and being lauded for it? Anything more horrific than enlisting thousands to fight and die in a war inexplicable, incomprehensible, or even illegal? Anyone who goes to war is normalised for the task of killing and rendered abnormal for the tragic aftermath of living. The conclusion of hostilities for the combatant becomes a cruel suspension of one reality and its replacement by another. Having engaged in legalised murder and maiming in battle, the recruits who fight for a country return to a state that repudiates their experiences as situationally quaint while demanding their smooth assimilation. Killing is no longer excusable or legal. A life of domestic, suburban decay before numbing screens and dulling consumption is. The recent events of death and mayhem in New Orleans and Las Vegas, both taking place on New Year’s Day, involved US military personnel, former and current. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, from Houston, killed 14 people and injured 35 others in New Orleans after driving a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street. He was subsequently killed by police. Between 2007 and 2020, he had stints in the US Army as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist, a period which also included deployment to Afghanistan between February 2009 to January 2010. Master Sgt Matthew Alan Livelsberger was serving as a soldier in US Army Special Operations, using his time for approved leave to detonate a Tesla Cybertruck at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas. He left a note expressing a need to 'cleanse' his mind of the lost lives he had known and 'the burden of the lives I took.' These incidents have supplied the usual candy floss to seekers of the consultancy fee and the Oedipal school of mother-father-son confusion, scarring family collapse and economic stress. This is the clipboard assessment of Jabbar from Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism: 'the collapse of his family background, his multiple divorces, financial problems' are given a thick underlining. She authoritatively states that 'mass attackers' tend to have sundered family lives. 'And then there’s the issue of him being a veteran and if that might have played a role.' Whenever the military is mentioned, cautionary notes are appended. Clinical and forensic psychologist Joel A. Dvoskin warns against pointing an accusing finger against the glorious institution that is the US Army. 'The Army is a vast organization with all kinds of different people and all kinds of different training experiences,' he observes. Dvoskin adopts an intellectually curious approach: If a link between military service and mass casualty attacks could be found, it should only be used constructively. The material on military experience stimulating radicalisation is becoming a merry pile. Academics seek tenure for work on this subject. Think tanks are gibbering for grants and scratching for influence in this field. All are wondering about the links between the uniformed experience and the socially calamitous meltdown that results in suicide, homicide or both. Much of this jolting fascination can be put down to the background of those with military blooding who were arrested for participating in the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol. The Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS) has also become a source of interest, being a dataset of over 3,500 violent and non-violent extremists of various persuasions in the US, from the far left to the far right, Islamist beliefs, or single burning issues between 1948-2022. Those working for the national consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), note in a research brief from June 2023 that 170 individuals with US military service records plotted 144 mass casualty terrorist attacks on US soil, representing a quarter of all those who plotted mass casualty extremist attacks between 1990 and 2022. The researchers argue that a military service record is a more reliable way of classifying mass casualty offenders identified in the PIRUS dataset than other more common considerations such as mental health issues, lone or small group offending, and having a criminal history prior to radicalisation. Those with US military records were '2.41 times more likely to be classified as mass casualty offenders than individuals who did not serve in the armed forces.' Those with such records were also abundantly linked to far-right domestic extremist groups and movements (73.5%), while 15%, or 24 offenders, 'were inspired by or connected to foreign Islamist extremist groups' such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Rich Groen, Jabbar’s former commander, has not twigged to the vicissitudes his own sacred line of work entails. He reflected on Jabbar being 'a great soldier, someone who showed discipline and dedication', a point made as if to preclude the possibility that violence in civilian life might ever be out of order. 'To think that the same individual who once embodied quiet professionalism could harbor so much hate, leading to such unspeakable atrocities, is incomprehensible and heartbreaking.' Heartbreaking, yes; incomprehensible, hardly. The unfashionable and unpopular lesson here would be to cut back on that most extremist of phenomena: the business of war and the military racket that feeds it. Don’t needlessly place personnel in conditions that will torment their being and deprive them of a moral compass. Could there be any better prevention to this than peace itself?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy07HwURIRBmD	2025-01-06T16:12:53-08:00	
Zelenskyy Calls For US Security Guarantees, Seeks Early Trump Mee...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says any security guarantees for his country to end the war with Russia would only be meaningful if they were provided by the United States and that he hopes to meet with President-elect Donald Trump soon after his January 20 inauguration. 'Without the United States, security guarantees are not possible,' he said in a three-hour interview published on January 5 with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman. 'I mean security guarantees that can prevent Russian aggression.' In the interview, which took place in Kyiv and in English, Ukrainian, and even Russian at times, Zelenskiy stressed his belief that any cease-fire without security guarantees for Kyiv would be used by the Kremlin as an opportunity to resupply and reorganize for new offensives. As the third anniversary of Russia's unprovoked, full-scale invasion approaches on February 24, the death and destruction continues in many Ukrainian cities -- mainly in the east and in territory occupied by Kremlin forces -- and across the border in Russia's Kursk region. Uncertain times lie ahead for Kyiv, with Trump set to reclaim the White House on January 20. Trump, who has vocally criticized the volume of U.S. aid to Ukraine, has repeatedly vowed to bring the conflict to a quick end, though he has provided few details. Many Ukraine supporters are concerned he will press terms unacceptable to Kyiv. A push for a cease-fire is almost certain, however, in light of Trump's promises to end the war quickly. The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden shepherded some $60 billion to Ukraine in weapons, equipment, and other aid over the past four years. Zelenskiy has a long, difficult history with the incoming president. Trump's first impeachment as president in 2019 was sparked by a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which Trump appeared to condition U.S. military aid on Zelenskiy ordering a criminal investigation of Biden. Trump has taken aim at Zelenskiy several times. During his presidential campaign, he repeated his description of the Ukrainian president as 'the greatest salesman in the world' -- a reference to the tens of billions of dollars in aid that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have approved since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. However, in the interview, Zelenskiy said he is confident Trump will help bring a fair, sustainable peace deal, along with the required security assurances. 'Trump and I will come to an agreement and...offer strong security guarantees, together with Europe, and then we can talk to the Russians,' Zelenskiy said. 'We and Trump come first, and Europe will support Ukraine's position,' he said. 'I think that President Trump not only has the will, he has all these possibilities, and it's not just talk,' Zelenskiy added. 'I really count on him, and I think that our people really count on him, so he has enough power to pressure him, to pressure [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.' Asked what he would need to consider a cease-fire, Zelenskiy said security guarantees, preferably within the NATO alliance -- something Putin has vehemently opposed. NATO membership was one of the Kremlin's original grievances used to justify the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In any settlement, Zelenskiy said, Western partners should, at the least, guarantee security in Ukrainian territory not now occupied by Russia, continue to supply military assistance, and to keep in place the economic sanctions that have devastated Russia's economy. 'If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again,' he said. Zelenskiy said Putin's goals are to bring about 'a weak NATO' and a 'Ukraine which cannot survive on the battlefield,' and to 'prevent me from building a strong relationship with Trump.' Zelenskiy also relayed what he said was a phone conversation with close Kremlin ally Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the authoritarian ruler of neighboring Belarus. Zelenskiy said that in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion, Lukashenka apologized for the missiles that were fired from Belarus territory. 'He said that 'it was not me. Missiles were launched from my territory and Putin was the one launching them.'' Zelenskiy said the Belarus strongman told him: 'Volodymyr, this is not me. I'm not in charge.... I’m not in charge. These are just missiles. This is Putin.' 'I told him, 'You are a murderer, too, I’m just saying.' He told me, 'You must understand, you can't fight the Russians.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy2UTva45hBOi	2025-01-06T16:11:08-08:00	
Ex-Malaysian PM Najib’s House Arrest Bid Gets Boost Through Court...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof, Muzliza Mustafa, and Noah Lee A Malaysian court has boosted incarcerated former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s attempt to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence at home, saying the government didn’t adequately challenge the bid. This means the case goes back to the High Court, which now has to hear Najib’s application to review his sentence. It refused to do so last year, citing a lack of evidence. Najib, 71, has claimed since April that the king issued a decree on Jan. 29, 2024, a day before the monarch’s term ended, permitting house arrest but that the government did not announce it. The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 decision on Monday that overturned the earlier one, said the applicant 'only needs to show that he or she has a good arguable case premised on the fact that his interests or rights have been aggrieved' and he had demonstrated that. '[W]e are therefore minded to allow the appeal. We hereby order the matter to be remitted to the High Court to hear the [case] but before a different judge,' the appeals court said. 'The fact that there is no rebuttal evidence from the respondents challenging the [decree’s] existence ... is rather compelling. This court cannot simply ignore the existence of the order.' The appeals court also allowed Najib to present what his lawyer said was new evidence to the High Court – a hearing is set for Jan. 13. ‘Valid and authentic’ The new evidence is a Jan. 4 letter to Najib’s eldest son signed by the office of the ex-king stating that the royal did issue a decree permitting Najib to finish his sentence under house arrest. Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, the former king, is the ruler of Pahang state, from where Najib hails. In a rare response to a media request, the sultan’s palace confirmed to BenarNews that the letter and its contents were authentic. 'Please be informed that the letter dated Jan. 4, 2025, signed by [the royal administrator] … is valid and authentic,' the email response from the Pahang palace stated. In its judgment, the appeals court said there was 'no justification for ignoring the existence of this order.' BenarNews contacted the Attorney General office for comment, but did not immediately hear back. In July 2020, the Kuala Lumpur High Court found Najib guilty of illegally receiving 42 million ringgit (U.S. $9.3 million), in a case linked to the scandal-ridden Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB. After a series of appeals, the country’s highest court in August 2022upheld his conviction from two years earlier and ordered he be sent to prison to serve his 12-year sentence, which was later reduced to six years. Najib has several cases against him related to the plunder of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Investigators estimate that more than $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB through fraudulent shell companies for corrupt government and bank officials and their associates. Hours after Monday’s court’s ruling, the government reiterated that it had no knowledge of the decree permitting house arrest. Najib claims this royal directive was issued as a 'supplementary decree,' adding to the one the king issued halving his 12-year sentence. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the prison department had not received any directive for Najib’s house arrest when it was informed about his sentence reduction. 'It is important to clarify any misconceptions about the Home Ministry, especially the prison department, for not obeying the order,' he said. 'How can we execute an order that does not exist in the letter?' Meanwhile, the Anwar Ibrahim government was criticized for what was perceived as yet another occasion that it failed to prepare for a big case. Najib’s United Malays National Organization (UMNO) is a key partnerin Prime Minister Anwar’s ruling coalition. And recent legal victories for the ex-PM, his associates and his party members, have raised questions about the government influencing the judiciary. Anwar has consistently denied such charges. Commenting on the recent acquittal of former first lady Rosmah Mansor – Najib’s wife – local media quoted him as positing a theory for cases that saw charges being dropped, and acquittals. According to Anwar, after UMNO’s historic election defeat in 2018, prosecutions, driven and rushed by 'venom, enmity, and political vengeance,' led to them being 'flawed.' Political analyst Azmil Mohd Tayeb said the appeals court’s ruling had set a 'dangerous precedent' that reinforced perceptions of impunity for the elite. 'This [ruling] signals [there are] two sets of laws – one for the elites and another for ordinary citizens,' Azmil, a political scientist at Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Another analyst, Syaza Syukri of the International Islamic University Malaysia, noted that Malaysia’s elites have often avoided accountability. 'Just that Najib got attention because he was a Prime Minister and of course due to [the scale of the scandal],'she told BenarNews. 'This is nothing new in the grand scheme of things.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy7zHazzVaGnc	2025-01-06T16:09:31-08:00	
Italy: Opposition Press Meloni Over Musk’s Alleged SpaceX Deal	By Nicoletta Ionta (EurActiv) -- Italian opposition parties have challenged Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s alleged €1.5 billion security deal with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, demanding clarification in parliament. The parties are voicing concerns over a reported five-year contract between the government and Elon Musk's SpaceX, aimed at creating a secure telecommunications system for government use. Initial reports by Bloomberg on Sunday suggested the Italian government is in talks with SpaceX, with the project already receiving approval from Italy's Intelligence Services and the Defence Ministry. Touted as the largest project of its kind in Europe, the reported plan is for SpaceX to provide secure internet via its Starlink system for Italian government operations, communication services for the military in the Mediterranean, and direct-to-cell satellite services for emergencies like terrorist attacks or natural disasters. In a statement on Monday, the Italian government denied that any contracts or agreements had been signed with SpaceX. The statement did not clarify whether the government was engaged in ongoing negotiations with SpaceX over such a deal. Instead, the government said that the talks are 'part of the normal consultations that State institutions have with companies.' Musk also did not confirm the reports, but stated on X that he is ready to 'provide Italy with the most secure and advanced connectivity!' The news shook the opposition ranks, which united in calling out the alleged deal and demanding clarification from Meloni. 'The statement does not clarify whether talks are ongoing with Starlink,' said members of the centre-left Democratic Party (S&D) in a joint statement. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein deemed the denial 'completely insufficient' and called on Meloni to provide clarification from the government in Parliament. 'Italy is not selling out,' she added. Former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, head of the opposition Five Star Movement (The Left), accused the government of handing national security to Musk for 'the modest sum of €1.5 billion in public funds.' 'Can all of this be decided based on personal ties between our Prime Minister and one of the aspiring 'masters of the world'?' Conte said. 'Nobody has abolished Parliament,' former liberal Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said. 'The government cannot give one and a half billion to a private entity without a tender or any public transparency.' The news came shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's unexpected visit to Mar-a-Lago, US President-elect Donald Trump's residence, on Sunday. The Italian government however, clarified that the matter of SpaceX was not discussed during the visit, describing such claims as 'simply ridiculous'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcyycTq3AwOrFJ	2025-01-06T16:07:43-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Tragedy Of Non-Application Of Soma...	The Somali Xeer is often said to be the soul of the Somali nation, a people who live across many countries today, but mostly in Somalia proper, the Republic of Djibouti, the Federal Republic of Ethiopia and the Republic of Kenya. Many critics of the Somali Xeer limit its application and applicability to Somalia only and ignoring the fact that the Somali nation and territory was divided during the colonial times into these four countries. Although the Somali Xeer, was largely replaced by state legal and court systems, it still remains the core legal system, which governs the Somali way of life. The Somali Xeer is wide and covers many aspects of life including conduct of marriages, festivals, sharing, facing calamities, wars, crime, and many others. However, the Somali Xeer is said to fall short of addressing some issues including the issue of individual responsibility, where a perpetrator of a crime is not individually responsible for his transgression, exclusion of women from the Tree or the court, and the unfair treatment of marginalized groups and minorities. The Somali Xeer is a framework which keeps communities to live together. Communities are often families and protection of family honor was and is the basis of a typical Somali way of life. If a member of a family commits an error, it is treated as a collective error of the family, and they all bear responsibility together. The Somali is the only insured person in the world not by an insurance company but by his family or clan affiliation. It is a sword with two edges, where on the one hand, the individual receives help of the whole family, while a family shares the benefit or compensation received as a result of a member being a victim. However, as state-building resumes and state-legal systems develop, this collective responsibility can and will be transformed into individual responsibility. The Somali Xeer is not static but adaptable and handles all issues. The core system of an issue is first to check whether a situation has occurred before or is new. This is called the Curad (Precedence) or Ugub (New) issue of matters. Similarly the issue exclusion of women is not as generally presented. Women were always involved in Somali affairs and even played prominent roles in determining the life systems of the Somali people. However, issues of women modesty and honor was also respected but they were and still are allowed to participate through giving evidence or observe discussions and hearings under the Tree. There is nothing that prevents them from participating in a Somali court system today and the Somali Xeer can easily adapt a renovation in this regard. As noted earlier, it is an adaptable system which accepts new situations and conditions, and which creates solutions for these new situations and conditions. One should note that it is man-made, and that, therefore, it is not perfect. There is no reason, why it should not address all aspects of modern life systems. Contrary to defining the Somali Xeer as a system of addressing only peace issues and conflict resolution mechanisms, it is much wider and covers all aspects of life. Unlike more modern legal systems, it protects the interests of all, without undue pressure on an individual and provides a healing process for a community. The Somali Xeer or the Laws of Somalis is an effective way of providing justice and is said to be superior to democratic laws in many ways. One could read the book 'The law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic Development in the Horn of Africa – January 1, 2012, by Michael Van Notten) for more details. The Somali Xeer addresses property rights, laws of contracting, and delivers justice and this was done much earlier than modern democratic societies. It has, indeed, no foreign words in the delivery of its processes and procedures evidencing that it was developed locally in the very Horn of Africa in the Somali language. It would appear that there is a need for applying the Somali Xeer with respect to settling the current ongoing civil conflict in the country. This would be good for both Somalia and the countries interested in it. Its geostrategic location, its resources which include its resilient population and others, in terms of minerals, agriculture, blue economy, all need a peaceful place and not the turbulent country, it currently presents itself. It is clear the political class of Somalia today, both in governance and in the opposition, is corrupt and unpatriotic and would not bring forth a stable, peaceful, and developing country. It is why the silent majority, the really good people of Somalia, should come forward to reclaim their country and reform it through the application of its traditional legal systems and conflict resolution mechanisms, which have kept the Somali way of life for millennia before. This does not mean that the current political class should be punished as in non-Somali legal systems. Offenders of the system according to the Somali Xeer, are not generally punished but rehabilitated and victims are compensated. Perhaps an innovation could be added where the wrong gains they made at the expense of the nation can be recovered to build schools and medical facilities and roads for the people, but allowing them enough to live off comfortably, as previous leaders of the country, who erred. We should not ignore the fact that a Somali is insured under the Somali Xeer through the clan or family infrastructure, who collectively assume the wrong doings of one of theirs. It was considered shameful for a clan member to cause such distress for the clan. This should still be the case under the current circumstances, if the nation has to recover from the chaos and its shameful situation. The Somali Xeer or the Law of the Somalis was and is perfectly capable of making and maintaining peace and always protected the Somali nation from within and from without. But it appears that democratic processes which the Somalis hardly understand have been imposed on the people, which divides them even more – to differing classes, which Somalis have no experience of handling – ruling and ruled classes. No wonder there is chaos in the country and in the political system. The Somali people are a people who learned how to live in peace through consensus and compromise throughout history in the harsh environment in which they live. They lived and thrived through this system. Even the greetings among Somalis is 'Ma Nabadbaa?' or 'Is it Peaceful?' when one encounters another. They attached a lot of importance to peace among themselves to even call the title of their chieftains the 'Nabad-doon' or the 'Peacemaker.' It is when there is peace that life grows, and people go about their normal daily chores like farming, animal husbandry, fishing, building, irrigation, drilling for water wells and so on. The beauty of the system is that it is acceptable from one corner of the Somali territories to the other, i.e., from Djibouti to the Estuary of Tana River in Kenya to Moyale and Haadamo in Ethiopia to Ras Asyer in the very Horn of Africa and everywhere in between – some 1.3 million square kilometers of land. Complimented by the singularity of their faith, Islam, and their tongue, Somali, there was no reason to have been divided. However, divided now, they are and we are dealing only with present day Somalia, which should revisit the application of the traditional legal system of the country and people, the Laws of the Somalis or the Somali Xeer. It is the system which enables Somalis to survive through situations many other nations would have by now succumbed and perished. Somalis still look after each other through this system across the globe and this solidarity is the basis of the Somali Xeer, which should be deployed to solve the seemingly intractable political chaos of the current political class.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7mZUeETBuXim	2025-01-06T16:03:18-08:00	
Dalai Lama Gets Stirring Welcome In South India For Extended Stay	By Pema Ngodup, Dickey Kundol and Tenzin Dhonyoe The Dalai Lama on Sunday received a stirring welcome in South India, where more than 10,000 ethnic Tibetans lined the streets to greet the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader as he arrived for an extended stay at the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in Bylakuppe. It was his first visit to the Bylakuppe Tibetan Settlement in the Indian state of Karnataka — the largest Tibetan settlement in the world outside Tibet — in over seven years. An estimated 70,000 Tibetans live in the community, which was established on land leased by the state government for Tibetans who resettled in India after 1959. That was the year the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India alongside thousands of Tibetans after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The trip also marked the Dalai Lama’s first domestic travel within India after his return to his residence in Dharamsala in the northern part of the county in late August 2024, following a two-month stay in the United States, where he underwent a successful knee replacement surgery in New York. The visit comes as the Dalai Lama, 89, tries to allay concerns over his general health amid questions about his successor. The Chinese government insists it will select the 15th Dalai Lama, though Tibetan Buddhists believe in the reincarnation of their spiritual leaders.The Dalai Lama, who has said he expects to live to be over 100 years old to fulfill the wishes of the Tibetan people, has stated that his incarnation could be found in India. 'Today, I have come to Tashi Lhunpo Monastery which was founded by Gyalwa Gendun Drub, the First Dalai Lama,' he said, at a reception ceremony in the monastery. 'As his successor, I feel happy and honored to be here today,' The Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, known as the seat of the Panchen Lama, was founded in 1447 in Shigatse, Tibet, by the first Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Drub. After China’s occupation of Tibet, the monastery was re-established in Bylakuppe, South India, in 1972 by senior monks under the guidance of the Dalai Lama. 'In Tibet, the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery was renowned for the quality of the monks’ studies of Buddhist philosophy and logic,' he said. 'It is one of Tibet’s most important monasteries,' the Dalai Lama said. The exact duration of the Dalai Lama’s 'extended stay' in South India has not been disclosed. Local Tibetan officials told RFA that the primary purpose of his visit is to rest and enjoy the warmer climate of South India in the winter, and that, as such, no major teachings have, as yet, been planned. However, from Wednesday onwards, public blessings for the Tibetan people are expected to be held three times a week — every from Monday, Wednesday and Friday — with the initial rounds to focus on Tibetans aged 80 and above, according to the Dalai Lama’s office. Rousing welcome The Dalai Lama left his residence in Dharamsala on Jan. 3 for an overnight stay in the Indian capital New Delhi, from where he made a journey to Bangalore the following day. There, hundreds of Tibetan professionals, students and businessmen dressed in their traditional best greeted him with incense, flowers and silk scarves. On Jan. 5, the Dalai Lama flew by helicopter from Bangalore to the Bylakuppe settlement. All along the more than 5-kilometer (3-mile) stretch of road leading to the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, thousands of Tibetans carrying traditional silk scarves and incense welcomed him amid the sounds of cymbals, drums and horns, as monks and nuns chanted. 'All of us residents of the Tibetan settlements in South India are very fortunate that His Holiness is here,' said Namgyal, who hails from the Doeguling Tibetan Settlement in Mundgod, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Bylakuppe. 'Even though I’m old, I’ve made the journey to be here to satisfy my heart’s desire to see His Holiness,' he said. Tsewang Dolma, an elderly woman from the Tibetan settlement in Hunsur, over 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Bylakuppe, said she was elated about the visit. 'I feel very emotional and am almost tearing up,' she told Radio Free Asia, while holding a bouquet of flowers to welcome the Dalai Lama. 'All I pray for is that he lives a long, long life.' Role of Buddhist monasteries The Dalai Lama’s last visit to Bylakuppe was in December 2017, during which he gave Buddhist teachings at Sera Jey and Sera Mey monasteries. In his address at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, where the heads of all the different Tibetan monastic institutions were gathered, the Dalai Lama emphasized the critical importance of monasteries in serving as 'centers of learning' for Buddhist study and practice. 'As I have always advised, the principal purpose of a monastery is to serve as a center of learning where monks and nuns have the opportunity to study and put into practice the Buddha’s teachings,' he said. 'Members of all the monastic institutions should strive to uphold the Buddha’s teachings, particularly in this degenerate age,' the Dalai Lama said, while noting the growing interest in Buddhism in China and other regions. 'Today, many people around the world who are not Buddhists are taking an interest in the Buddha’s teachings,' he added. 'These include scientists who value the Buddhist tradition’s emphasis and use of reason and logic.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7ro9nDtGbizL	2025-01-06T16:00:53-08:00	
Pentagon Announces Transfer Of 11 Yemeni Detainees From Guantanam...	The Department of Defense announced Monday the resettlement of 11 Yemeni detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the Government of Oman. The 11 detainees are: Uthman Abd al-Rahim Muhammad Uthman (ISN 27), Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi (ISN 28), Khalid Ahmed Qassim (ISN 242), Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi (ISN 569), Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah (ISN 841), Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani (ISN 893), Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah (ISN 1017), Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi (ISN 1453), Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash (ISN 1456), Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj (ISN 1457), and Abd Al-Salam Al-Hilah (ISN 1463). Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani (ISN 893) was deemed transfer eligible by the process established by the 2009 Executive Order 13492, 'Review of Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities.' The other 10 Yemeni GTMO detainees transferred to the Government of Oman were determined eligible for transfer under the Periodic Review Board process established by Executive Order 13567, 'Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station Pursuant to the Authorization for the Use of Military Force.' Although different processes, each of the 10 Yemeni detainees underwent a thorough, interagency review by career professionals who unanimously determined all detainees as transfer eligible consistent with the national security interests of the United States. On Sept. 15, 2023, Secretary of Defense Austin notified Congress of his intent to repatriate these 11 Yemeni detainees to the Government of Oman and, in consultation with our partners in Oman, we completed the requirements for transfer. The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility. The PRB process was established by the President’s March 7, 2011, Executive Order 13567. It is consistent with section 1023 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 and affirmed in Executive Order 13823 (Jan. 30, 2018). The PRB panel consists of senior career officials from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State, along with the Joint Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The PRB determined by consensus that continued law of war detention was no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the national security of the United States and that any national security risk from these 10 Yemeni detainees could be adequately mitigated. Pursuant to Executive Order 13567, that determination became final after all Principals concurred. As of today, 15 detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay: 3 are eligible for transfer; 3 are eligible for a Periodic Review Board; 7 are involved in the military commissions process; and 2 detainees have been convicted and sentenced by military commissions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7m-QV7RMz2i-	2025-01-06T15:59:31-08:00	
Iran To Station New Air Defense Systems At Sensitive Sites	The commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base -the central headquarters of Iran’s Air Defense- said a series of new and secret air defense systems have been installed near the country’s sensitive locations. Brigadier General Qader Rahimzadeh announced on Monday that the air defense forces from the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) will stage a joint large-scale war game in coming days. He noted that the Army and the IRGC air defense units have stationed a series of new systems, which are unknown to the enemies, near the sensitive centers of Iran, adding that the equipment will be employed in the forthcoming exercise. The forces participating in the drill will be practicing the skills they have been trained in during the past year, the general stated, saying the exercises are designed considering the enemies’ movements and the Iranian air defense needs. In remarks in 2018, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei described the air defense base as a very crucial part of the Armed Forces that is at the frontline of confronting enemies of Iran. The Leader also stressed the importance of accelerating the capabilities of the base and the Air Forces' staff.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7t1siAvHAKPk	2025-01-06T15:56:00-08:00	
Protected Areas Provide Habitat For Threatened Lynx, But Wildfire...	Canada lynx are specialized hunters, able to travel in deep snow and spot prey in the darkness from 250 feet away. Keen hearing and vision make them excellent trackers, but what do we learn by turning the tables and tracking them? Scientists are using GPS data and advanced modeling to refine maps and identify important habitat characteristics, particularly in the forests of western Colorado, southern Wyoming, and northern New Mexico, the southernmost extent of its range. New research and updated maps show that more than half of lynx habitat in the southern Rocky Mountains overlaps protected areas like wilderness and national parks. The maps also show that lynx habitat is sparse, patchy, and poorly connected, existing only in narrow bands due to Colorado’s complex mountainous terrain. These maps can identify corridors where habitat loss affects animal movement, which is important for healthy populations. Updated maps help managers focus conservation efforts and pinpoint places to promote new habitat, especially given the frequency of human development, fire, and forest insect outbreaks near the edges of lynx range. Lynx in the western US prefer high elevation spruce-fir forests with tree branches hanging close to the snow or ground surface, providing dense horizontal cover. This forest structure supports the cat’s favorite prey, snowshoe hares, which can make up 90 percent of their diet in winter. Lynx were reintroduced to the southern Rockies over two decades ago, after populations had fallen below a self-sustaining level. Several generations of females and kittens have successfully established here, allowing these populations to bounce back. Researchers used GPS collars to track lynx within the study area, focused on the southern extent of its range. They also considered over 40 habitat or environmental characteristics, such as the amount of precipitation as snow versus rain, the month with the coldest temperature, road density, vegetation, and slope position. Combining GPS and habitat data and using state-of-the-art statistical tools and modeling methods, these scientists identified which characteristics best predicted where lynx were found and used this information to map 'likely' lynx habitat where cats have a high probability of living, breeding, and successfully raising young. Then they took this information one step further, comparing 'likely' habitat with disturbances like insect outbreaks, wildfire, timber harvest, or human-footprint impacts such as urbanization or ski resorts. The scientists found that around one-third of likely habitat overlapped with disturbance, including forest insect outbreaks (31 percent), wildfire (5 percent), and forest management activities like tree harvest and prescribed burning (3 percent). Despite the greater overlap of lynx habitat with insect outbreaks, the scientists are more concerned by the impacts of severe wildfires. 'We know that lynx continue to occupy areas after insects kill the overstory trees during spruce-beetle outbreaks. Forests impacted by spruce beetles still have enough young conifer trees in the understory to support hares,' said Dr. John Squires, the study's principal investigator and a Rocky Mountain Research Station research wildlife biologist. 'Also, some tree species like subalpine fir often survive spruce beetle attacks. That means that forest insects represent a more benign threat to lynx compared to broad-scale, high-severity wildfire.' The researchers found that lynx tend to avoid fire-impacted areas until the understory has regrown–a process that takes upwards of 50 years in subalpine forests in the southern Rockies, where fires tend to burn less frequently than lower elevation forests and are often stand-replacing. 'Although fire disturbance from 1990-2022 overlapped only 5 percent of likely lynx habitat in this area, we believe that frequent, high-severity fire is the main risk to lynx in high-elevation forests moving forward,' continued Squires. 'We were surprised at how little lynx habitat overlapped areas of managed forest and human development,' said Dr. Lucretia Olson, study coauthor and a Rocky Mountain Research Station ecologist. 'While forest management mainly causes temporary habitat changes, activities like urbanization and developing or expanding ski areas often lead to permanent losses. We hope our work will reach managers who make complex decisions about land uses.' Squires stressed the value of partnerships for conducting this research: 'Close collaboration across state and federal agencies in terms of data sharing, logistical support, and added expertise made this research possible.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7nsOUTITgv_b	2025-01-06T15:54:01-08:00	
AI Slashes Cost And Time For Chip Design, But That Is Not All	Specialized microchips that manage signals at the cutting edge of wireless technology are astounding works of miniaturization and engineering. They’re also difficult and expensive to design. Now, researchers at Princeton Engineering and the Indian Institute of Technology have harnessed artificial intelligence to take a key step toward slashing the time and cost of designing new wireless chips and discovering new functionalities to meet expanding demands for better wireless speed and performance. In an article published in Nature Communications, the researchers describe their methodology, in which an AI creates complicated electromagnetic structures and associated circuits in microchips based on the design parameters. What used to take weeks of highly skilled work can now be accomplished in hours. What is more, the AI behind the new system has produced strange new designs featuring unusual patterns of circuitry. Kaushik Sengupta, the lead researcher, said the designs were unintuitive and unlikely to be developed by a human mind. But they frequently offer marked improvements over even the best standard chips. 'We are coming up with structures that are complex and looks random shaped and when connected with circuits, they create previously unachievable performance. Humans cannot really understand them, but they can work better,' said Sengupta, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and co-director of NextG, Princeton’s industry partnership program to develop next-generation communications. These circuits can be engineered towards more energy efficient operation or to make them operable across an enormous frequency range that is not currently possible. Furthermore, the method synthesizes inherently complex structures in minutes, while conventional algorithms may take weeks. In some cases, the new methodology can create structures that are impossible to synthesize with current techniques. Uday Khankhoje, a co-author and associate professor of electrical engineering at IIT Madras, said the new technique not only delivers efficiency but promises to unlock new approaches to design challenges that have been beyond the capability of engineers. 'This work presents a compelling vision of the future,' he said. 'AI powers not just the acceleration of time-consuming electromagnetic simulations, but also enables exploration into a hitherto unexplored design space and delivers stunning high-performance devices that run counter to the usual rules of thumb and human intuition.' Wireless chips are a combination of standard electronic circuits like those in computer chips and electromagnetic structures including antennas, resonators, signal splitters, combiners and others. These combinations of elements are put together in every circuit block, carefully handcrafted and co-designed to operate optimally. This method is then scaled to other circuits, sub-systems and systems, making the design process extremely complex and time consuming, particularly for modern, high-performance chips behind applications like wireless communication, autonomous driving, radar and gesture recognition. 'Classical designs, carefully, put these circuits and electromagnetic elements together, piece by piece, so that the signal flows in the way we want it to flow in the chip. By changing those structures, we incorporate new properties,' Sengupta said. 'Before, we had a finite way of doing this, but now the options are much larger.' It can be hard to comprehend the vastness of a wireless chip’s design space. The circuitry in an advanced chip is so small, and the geometry so detailed, that the number of possible configurations for a chip exceeds the number of atoms in the universe, Sengupta said. There is no way for a person to understand that level of complexity, so human designers don’t try. They build chips from the bottom up, adding components as needed and adjusting the design as they build. The AI approaches the challenge from a different perspective, Sengupta said. It views the chip as a single artifact. This can lead to strange, but effective arrangements. He said humans play a critical role in the AI system, in part because that AI can make faulty arrangements as well as efficient ones. It is possible for AI to hallucinate elements that don’t work, at least for now. This requires some level of human oversight. 'There are pitfalls that still require human designers to correct,' Sengupta said. 'The point is not to replace human designers with tools. The point is to enhance productivity with new tools. The human mind is best utilized to create or invent new things, and the more mundane, utilitarian work can be offloaded to these tools.' The researchers have used AI to discover and design complex electromagnetic structures that are-co-designed with circuits to create broadband amplifiers. Sengupta said future research will involve linking multiple structures and designing entire wireless chips with the AI system. 'Now that this has shown promise, there is a larger effort to think about more complicated systems and designs,' he said. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the future holds for the field.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoGLfZrvquG-s	2025-01-06T15:48:24-08:00	
Beyond The ‘Dragon Arc,’ A Treasure Trove Of Unseen Stars	Looking halfway across the observable universe and expecting to see individual stars is considered a non-starter in astronomy, a bit like raising a pair of binoculars at the moon in hopes of making out individual grains of dust inside its craters. Thanks to a cosmic quirk of nature, however, an international team led by astronomers at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory did just that. Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, the research group observed a galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years from Earth, at a time when the universe was half its current age. In this distant galaxy, the team identified a large number of individual stars, made visible thanks to an effect known as gravitational lensing and JWST's high light collecting power. Published in the journal Nature Astronomy, the discovery marks a record-breaking achievement – the largest number of individual stars detected in the distant universe. It also provides a way to investigate one of the universe's greatest mysteries – dark matter. Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, contain tens of billions of stars. In nearby galaxies such as the Andromeda galaxy, astronomers can observe stars one by one. However, in galaxies billions of light-years away, stars appear blended together as their light needs to travel for billions of light-years before it reaches us, presenting a long-standing challenge to scientists studying how galaxies form and evolve. 'To us, galaxies that are very far away usually look like a diffuse, fuzzy blob,' said lead study author Yoshinobu Fudamoto, an assistant professor at Chiba University in Japan and a visiting scholar at Steward Observatory. 'But actually, those blobs consist of many, many individual stars. We just can't resolve them with our telescopes.' Recent advances in astronomy have opened new possibilities by leveraging gravitational lensing – a natural magnification effect caused by the strong gravitational fields of massive objects. As predicted by Albert Einstein, gravitational lenses can amplify the light of distant stars by factors of hundreds or even thousands, making them detectable with sensitive instruments like JWST. 'These findings have typically been limited to just one or two stars per galaxy,' Fudamoto said. 'To study stellar populations in a statistically meaningful way, we need many more observations of individual stars.' Fengwu Sun, a former U of A graduate student who is now a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, stumbled on a treasure trove of such stars when he was inspecting JWST images of a galaxy known as the Dragon Arc, located along the line of sight from Earth behind a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell 370. Due to its gravitational lensing effect, Abell 370 stretches the Dragon Arc's signature spiral into an elongated shape – like a hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions. In December 2022 and 2023, JWST obtained two pictures of the Dragon Arc. Within these images, astronomers counted 44 individual stars whose brightness changed over time due to variations in the gravitational lensing landscape. 'This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,' Sun said – as long as nature is there to lend a helping hand. However, even extremely strong gravitational magnification from a galaxy cluster is not sufficient to magnify individual stars in galaxies even farther away. In this case, the discovery was made possible by a serendipitous alignment of 'lucky stars.' 'Inside the galaxy cluster, there are many stars floating around that are not bound by any galaxy,' said co-author Eiichi Egami, a research professor at Steward Observatory. 'When one of them happens to pass in front of the background star in the distant galaxy along the line of sight with Earth, it acts as a microlens, in addition to the macrolensing effect of the galaxy cluster as a whole.' The combined effects of macrolensing and microlensing dramatically increase the magnification factor, allowing JWST to pick up individual stars that otherwise would be too far and faint to be detected at all. Because the stars inside the magnifying cluster move relative to the target stars in the distant galaxy and Earth, the alignment of microlenses in this natural 'telescope' changes slightly over short timeframes – from a few days to a week. When they are perfectly aligned, the brightness and magnification of the distant stars increase dramatically, only to fade again shortly afterwards. 'By observing the same galaxy multiple times, we can spot stars in distant galaxies because they appear to pop in and out of existence,' Fudamoto said. 'This is a result of the varying effective magnifications from the macro- and microlensing effect as the microlensing stars move in and out of the line of sight.' The research team carefully analyzed colors of each of the stars inside the Dragon Arc and found that many are red supergiants, similar to Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion, which is in the final stages of its life. This contrasts with earlier discoveries, which predominantly identified blue 'supergiants' similar to Rigel and Deneb, which are among the brightest stars in the night sky. According to the researchers, this difference in stellar types also highlights the unique power of JWST observations at infrared wavelengths that could detect stars at lower temperatures. Future JWST observations are expected to capture more magnified stars in the Dragon Arc galaxy. These efforts could lead to detailed studies of hundreds of stars in distant galaxies. Moreover, observations of individual stars could provide insight into the structure of gravitational lenses and even shed light on the elusive nature of dark matter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoJkqqfhnNjbd	2025-01-06T15:44:16-08:00	
New Star In The East: Arakan Army – OpEd	The United League of Arakan (ULA) and its military wing Arakan Army may achieve the impossible -- independence for Myanmar's Rakhine province to fulfil the great Arakanese dream of regaining what they lost in 1784. If the ULA-AA manage to overrun the entire Rakhine province and declare independence, this will be the first successful secessionist campaign in Asia after the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. But Bangladesh was liberated by a decisive Indian military intervention, without which the Pakistan army would never have lost the war. Not to speak of the training and arming of tens of thousands of Bengali guerillas by India. On the other hand, the Arakanese rebels have fought their battles on their own and won decisive victories despite indiscriminate use of airpower by the Burmese military junta. And no major power has come forward to bolster the AA's armoury -- at least not openly. The AA commanders transitioned from guerrilla style hit-and-run warfare to conventional offensive battles, perfecting the encirclement tactics to enforce denial of supplies. In fact, they bettered the Kachin rebels who helped the battered nucleus of National Unity Party of Arakan (NUPA) raise the Arakan Army in the first decade of this century. The Kachin Independence Army has also captured much territory in their province, including the rare earth mines at Pangwa but they are not yet in sight of complete victory. The ULA-AA has already captured 15 of the 18 townships of the Rakhine (former Arakan) state of the Union of Myanmar. Only the renovated port of Sittwe done up as part of the India-funded Kaladan Multimodal Transport project, the China-funded deep-sea port of Kyaukphyu and the town of Munaung is in the hands of the Burmese military junta. On the last day of 2024, the Arakan Army overran the town of Gwa. Last week it had captured Ann, the headquarter of the western military regional command. It also overran Maungdaw and now control the entire border with Bangladesh. In fact, the ULA-AA has subtly warned Bangladesh not to back the Rohingya militants who fought alongside the military junta with support from their intelligence agencies. The Arakanese rebels are also upset over 'increasing atrocities on Buddhist minorities' in Chittagong Hill Tracts in Southeast Bangladesh. The Yunus-led interim government is already worried over the situation in Rakhine. Having established control over much of Rakhine and also taken control of the strategic river town of Paletwa in Chin state, the ULA-AA said in a statement on Sunday that it is agreeable to talk to the military junta. Referring to the Haigeng Agreement, a short-lived ceasefire agreement brokered by the Chinese in January 2024, the statement said that 'we always remain open to resolving the current internal issues through political means rather than military solutions.' The ULA statement, also published in Chinese, assures 'foreign countries' -- surely China and India--that it will protect their investments in Rakhine State. Hailing the 'active leadership of the People's Republic of China,' the statement said that the Arakan People's Revolutionary Government 'welcomes and recognizes all foreign investments that will bring benefits to the Arakan region and assist in its development and progress.' It added that the government 'will take special care to ensure the security and safety of those involved in investment activities, projects, and businesses.' The statement comes covert meetings between senior Arakan Army leaders and top security officials of both China and India. But it is not yet clear whether the ULA-AA will launch offensives straightaway to capture Sittwe and Kyaukphyu or wait to assess Chinese and Indian reactions. Their amazing military victories have been achieved despite extensive use of Burmese airpower and naval power. So the rebels may need a brief breather to regroup for one last big attack, but the real reason behind offering talks and assuring foreign investors is to seek time to assess the chances of diplomatic recognition if independence is indeed achieved. Without recognition by important countries, both in Asia and the West, the ULA-AA may not be able to complete its journey towards independent statehood. The two other members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDDA) have also agreed to resume their political talks with the military junta, under Chinese mediation. But they have refused to hand over the town of Lashio, headquarters of the northwestern military command, back to the military junta, as desired by China. If the Burmese military junta agrees to negotiate, the Arakanese rebels may not immediately push for independence but might explore possibilities of extensive federal autonomy with other ethnic armed organisations. That partly depends on how successful the other rebel groups are in their military offensives against the junta. Myanmar is clearly the new Syria in the east, but it is yet to attract the kind of global attention one would have expected.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoDz6UQInD2wU	2025-01-06T15:42:14-08:00	
New Study Links Millions Of Diabetes And Heart Disease Cases Glob...	A new study from researchers at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, which published in Nature Medicine, estimates that 2.2 million new cases of type 2 diabetes and 1.2 million new cases of cardiovascular disease occur each year globally due to consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In developing countries, the case count is particularly sobering. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the study found that sugar-sweetened beverages contributed to more than 21% of all new diabetes cases. In Latin America and the Caribbean, they contributed to nearly 24% of new diabetes cases and more than 11% of new cases of cardiovascular disease. Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa are countries that have been particularly hard hit. More than 48% of all new diabetes cases in Colombia were attributable to consumption of sugary drinks. Nearly one third of all new diabetes cases in Mexico were linked to sugary drink consumption. In South Africa, 27.6% of new diabetes cases and 14.6% of cardiovascular disease cases were attributable to sugary drink consumption. Sugary beverages are rapidly digested, causing a spike in blood sugar levels with little nutritional value. Regular consumption over time leads to weight gain, insulin resistance, and a host of metabolic issues tied to type 2 diabetes and heart disease, two of the world’s leading causes of death. 'Sugar-sweetened beverages are heavily marketed and sold in low- and middle-income nations. Not only are these communities consuming harmful products, but they are also often less well equipped to deal with the long-term health consequences,' says Dariush Mozaffarian, senior author on the paper and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School. As countries develop and incomes rise, sugary drinks become more accessible and desirable, the authors say. Men are more likely than women to suffer the consequences of sugary drink consumption, as are younger adults compared to their older counterparts, the researchers say. 'We need urgent, evidence-based interventions to curb consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages globally, before even more lives are shortened by their effects on diabetes and heart disease,' says Laura Lara-Castor, NG24, first author on the paper who earned her Ph.D. at the Friedman School and is now at the University of Washington. The study’s authors call for a multi-pronged approach, including public health campaigns, regulation of sugary drink advertising, and taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Some countries have already taken steps in this direction. Mexico, which has one of the highest per capita rates of sugary drink consumption in the world, introduced a tax on the beverages in 2014. Early evidence suggests that the tax has been effective in reducing consumption, particularly among lower-income individuals. 'Much more needs to be done, especially in countries in Latin America and Africa where consumption is high and the health consequence severe,' says Mozaffarian, who is also Jean Mayer Professor of Nutrition at the Friedman School. 'As a species, we need to address sugar-sweetened beverage consumption.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDkD2j6aFUYXw	2025-01-06T15:40:31-08:00	
Marked Decrease In Arctic Pressure Ridges	In the Arctic, the old, multiyear ice is increasingly melting, dramatically reducing the frequency and size of pressure ridges. These ridges are created when ice floes press against each other and become stacked, and are a characteristic feature of Arctic sea ice, an obstacle for shipping, but also an essential component of the ecosystem. In a recently released study in the journal Nature Climate Change, experts from the Alfred Wegener Institute report on this trend and analyse observational data from three decades of aerial surveys. Satellite data from the last three decades documents the dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice due to climate change: the area covered in ice in summer is declining steadily, the floes are becoming thinner and moving faster. Until recently, it was unclear how the characteristic pressure ridges had been affected, since it’s only been possible to reliably monitor them from space for the past few years. Pressure ridges are produced by lateral pressures on sea ice. Wind or ocean currents can stack floes up, forming metre-thick ridges. The part of the ridges – which break up the otherwise smooth surface of the ice every few hundred metres – extending above the water is called the sail and measures between one and two metres. Even more impressive is the keel below the water line, which can extend down to 30 metres and create an impassable obstacle for shipping. Pressure ridges affect not only the energy and mass balance of the sea ice, but also the biogeochemical cycle and the ecosystem: when their sails catch the wind, floes can be driven all across the Arctic. Polar bears use pressure ridges as a source of protection for overwintering or birthing their young. In addition, the structures offer ice-associated organisms at various trophic levels protection and promote the turbulent mixing of water, which increases nutrient availability. A team of researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), has now reprocessed and analysed laser-based readings gathered in 30 years of research flights over the Arctic ice. The survey flights, which cover a total distance of roughly 76,000 kilometres, show for the first time that the frequency of pressure ridges north of Greenland and in Fram Strait is decreasing by 12.2%, and their height by 5%, per decade. Data from the Lincoln Sea, an area where particularly old ice is known to accumulate, paints a similar picture: here, the frequency is declining by 14.9% and the height by 10.4% per decade. 'Until now, it’s remained unclear how pressure ridges were changing,' says Dr Thomas Krumpen, a sea-ice expert at the AWI and the study’s main author. 'More and more of the Arctic consists of ice that melts in the summer and is no more than a year old. This young, thin ice can more readily be deformed and more rapidly forms new pressure ridges. So you might expect their frequency to increase. The fact that pressure ridges are nonetheless in decline is due to the dramatic melting of older floes. Ice that has survived several summers is characterised by a particularly high number of pressure ridges, since it has been subjected to high pressures over a longer timeframe. The loss of this multiyear ice is so severe that we’re observing an overall decline in pressure-ridge frequency, even though the thin young ice is easier to deform.' In order to draw conclusions regarding Arctic-wide changes, the researchers combined all observational data to develop a metric. Then, with the aid of satellite data, they applied it to the Arctic as a whole: 'We tend to see the greatest decline in pressure ridges in those places where the ice’s age has decreased most,' summarises Prof Christian Haas, Head of Sea-ice Physics at the AWI. 'Major changes can be seen in the Beaufort Sea, but also in the Central Arctic. Both regions are now partly ice-free in summer, though they were once dominated by ice that was at least five years old.' For the study, individual pressure ridges and their heights were precisely measured and analysed during survey flights. This was possible thanks to the low-level flights (less than 100 metres above the surface) and the laser sensors’ high scanning rate, which allowed terrain models to be created. The AWI began scientific flights over the sea ice in the early 1990s, launching from Svalbard. Back then, the institute relied on two Dornier DO228s, Polar 2 and Polar 4; they have since been succeeded by two Basler BT-67s, Polar 5 and Polar 6. Specially equipped for flights under the extreme conditions found in the polar regions, they can be fitted with a range of sensors. Using these aircraft, researchers survey the ice north of Greenland, Svalbard and Canada twice a year. But the icebreaker Polarstern’s onboard helicopters are also part of the monitoring programme. In order to estimate the direct effects of the observed changes on the Arctic ecosystem, models need to be developed that can reflect both physical and biological processes in sea ice of various ages. Although we know that pressure ridges are home to a range of organisms, we still lack a deeper understanding of the role of pressure-ridge age. Yet this aspect is especially important, as the percentage of ridges that don’t survive their first summer is on the rise. Another riddle: although the size and frequency of ridge sails have decreased, the drift speed of Arctic ice has generally increased. As AWI sea-ice physicist Dr Luisa von Albedyll, who contributed to the study, explains: 'Actually, the ice should drift more slowly when the sails shrink, since there’s less area for the transfer of momentum. This indicates that there are other changes producing just the opposite effect. Stronger ocean currents or a smoother ice underside due to more intensive melting could be contributing factors. To answer these open questions and gain a better grasp of the complex interrelationships, we have made the entire dataset available in a public archive, (Link zu PANGAEA), ensuring that other researchers can use it and integrate it into their studies.' An expedition with the research vessel Polarstern is planned for next summer, with a focus on investigating the biological and biogeochemical differences between floes and pressure ridges of different ages and provenances. At the same time, there will be extensive aerial survey flights with the research aircraft. According to Thomas Krumpen: 'By combining ship-based and aerial observations, we hope to gain better insights into the complex interactions between the sea ice, climate and ecosystem – since we’ll only be able to devise effective strategies for the preservation and sustainable use of the Arctic once we better understand the region’s environmental system.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDgh7izzti-E3	2025-01-06T15:38:15-08:00	
Pope Francis Said: ‘All Religions Are Paths To God’ So True Relig...	For most of the last half of the 20th century liberals confidently believed that racism and religious extremism would soon disappear from human society: but shockingly they have revived in the 21st century. One reason for this revival is that for more than thirteen centuries most Jews, Christians and Muslims have read each other's holy scriptures from an adversarial perspective. Since all monotheistic scriptures come from the one and only God, we should view other monotheistic scriptures as potentially enriching our understanding and appreciation of our own scripture. But in the middle ages almost all readers thought of revelation as a zero sum sport like tennis, rather than a multiple win co-operative sport like mountain climbing. In a zero sum game any value or true spiritual insight I grant to another scripture somehow diminishes my own. This was the result of the influence of Greek philosophy's emphasis on the logic of the excluded middle. Something is either true or it is false. There is no other option. If two propositions contradict one another, one or both of them must be false. This would mean that if my religion is true, yours must be false. In modern terms, light could not be both a particle and a wave at the same time. Yet we now have been enlightened and know that light is indeed both a particle and a wave at the same time, depending how you observe it. This medieval situation did not improve much in modern times. In the last two centuries university academics have written many studies of comparative religion which they claim are objective and not distorted by their religious beliefs. Unfortunately, academics who treat other religions academically usually do not believe that other scriptures are actually Divinely inspired. Indeed, many academics do not believe that even their own sacred scriptures are Divinely inspired; and believe in nothing but their own skepticism. They use the same kinds of explanations to understand a revealed religion that they would use to explain secular history and literature. As a rabbi I follow a different model, one I learned from prophet Muhammad. For example, the Mishnah (an early third century compilation of the oral Torah, states, 'Adam was created as an individual to teach you that anyone who destroys a single soul, Scripture imputes it to him as if he destroyed the whole world.' (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) And the Qur'an states,'one who kills a human being, unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land, would be as if he slew the whole people, and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people' (Qur'an 5:32) Academics explain the similarity of the two statements by assuming that since the Jewish statement is several centuries earlier than the Qur'an, Muhammad must have heard it from a Rabbi or other educated Jew in Medina. However, I believe Prophet Muhammad is a non-Jewish Abrahamic prophet of God who confirms the Torah of prophet Moses. Muhammad has no need to learn this statement from another human being. Academics might reply that the statement is not found in the written Torah; it appears in the oral Torah written by the Rabbis in the Mishnah more than 1000 years after Moses. But the Rabbis maintain that the Mishnah is part of the oral Torah that was passed down from Moses through many generations; just as Ahadith have been passed down through the generations. Indeed, the Qur'an itself introduces this statement as follows, 'It is because of this that We ordained for the Children of Israel 'one who kills a human being ...' (Qur'an 5:32) No prophet of God needs to be informed by another human what should be written in Holy Scripture. God is the source of all Divine inspiration. There are several verses in the Qur'an that mention things from the oral Torah. My perspective is that prophets and Holy Scriptures can not in reality oppose one another because they all come from one source. Prophets are all brothers; they have the same father (God) and different mothers (motherlands. mother tongues, nations, cultures and historical eras). (Sahih al-Bukhari 3443 Book 60, Hadith 113) All of these factors produce different rituals and legal systems, but their theology can differ only in small and unessential details. As the sage of Konya, Jalal al-Din al-Rumi says, 'Ritual prayer might differ in every religion, but belief never changes.' (Fihi Mafih 49) Religions differ because the circumstances of each nation receiving them differ. Where sacred Scriptures differ they do not nullify each other; they only cast additional light on each other. My belief is based on an important Hadith of prophet Muhammad. Abu Huraira relates, 'The people of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and then explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Allah's Apostle said (to the Muslims). 'Do not believe the people of the Book, nor disbelieve them, but say, 'We believe in Allah, and whatever is revealed to us, and whatever is revealed to you.'' Following Muhammad's teaching I too neither believe nor disbelieve the Qur'an. If I believed in the Qur'an, I would be a member of the Muslim ummah (community). But I cannot disbelieve in the Qur'an because I believe that Muhammad was indeed a non-Jewish, Abrahamic prophet; and I respect the Qur'an as a revelation to a kindred people, in a kindred language. In fact, the people, the language and the theology are closer to my own people, language and theology than that of any other religion on earth. How does this perspective affect my understanding of their Qur'an and my Torah? Unlike those in the past who played the zero sum game, I do not seek some verse in the Qur'an I can dispute or object to. Indeed, this is what the Qur'an itself teaches. 'For every community We have appointed a whole system of worship which they are to observe. So do not let them draw you into disputes concerning this matter.'

15 Questions That Will Put An End To The ‘Climate Scare’ Once-And...	To support the growth of health and prosperity worldwide for the 8 billion on this planet in the coming decades, and the increasing demand for electricity, AND for the 6,000+ products in our materialistic society, and for the various transportation fuels, will challenge humanity’s creativity to support the supply chains to meet those growing demands. Government mandated winners and losers are only applicable to those few in the wealthier countries that can afford huge subsidies, but the reality that there are no silver bullet answers. For those outside the few wealthy countries, we see that at least 80 percent of humanity, or more than six billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day, and billions living with little to no access to electricity. Politicians in wealthier countries are pursuing the most expensive ways to generate intermittent electricity. Energy poverty is among the most crippling but least talked-about crises of the 21st century. We should not take electricity, products, and fuel for granted. Wealthy countries may be able to bear expensive electricity and fuels, but not by those that can least afford living in 'energy poverty.' It should be one of everyone’s New Year’s resolutions to acquire a passion to stimulate discussions to enhance everyone’s Energy Literacy. To support and facilitate those Conversations, at least 3 are required: A Moderator: Teacher, student, or Podcast host. A representative of the products and fuels of our materialistic society, and A representative of the pro-renewables for zero-emissions electricity. Here are just a few open-ended starter questions for Teachers, Students, and Podcaster Moderators to stimulate 3-way Energy Literacy Conversations: Limitations of just electricity from renewables. Renewables, like wind and solar, only exist to generate occasional electricity. Since these so-called renewables, CANNOT manufacture any of the more than 6,000 products AND the various transportation fuels made from fossil fuels for vehicles, planes and ships, that are demanded by the infrastructures of today, the same infrastructures that did not exist 200 years ago, the question for our conversation is: WHY eliminate fossil fuels when there is no known 'replacement' to fossil fuels that can support the materialistic demands for products and fuels of the population and economy that are supporting the 8 billion on this planet? Most of the products in our materialistic society are made from fossil fuels. Everything that NEEDS Electricity, like iPhones, computers, data centers, and X-Ray machines, that need electricity to function, and all the parts of toilets, spacecraft, and more than 50,000 merchant ships, more than 20,000 commercial aircraft and more than 50,000 military aircraft are also made from the products based on derivatives manufactured from crude oil, so the question for our conversation is: Why rid only the wealthy countries with 'green' movements, of fossil fuels as that would just divert the supply chain of oil to refineries in developing countries, to meet the demands for products and fuels that did not exist 200 years ago? Only wealthy economies have 'green' movements. For the 8 billion now on planet earth, of which 80% are making less than $10/day, and lack many infrastructures being enjoyed by those in the wealthier countries such as Transportation, Airports, Water filtration, Sanitation, Hospitals, Medical equipment, Appliances, Electronics, Telecommunications systems, Heating and ventilating, so the question for our conversation is: Why are the wealthy countries the only ones pursuing a 'green movement' with subsidies and mandates? Planet Earth’s resources are limited! Our 4-billion-year-old planet has limited natural resources like oil, gas, coal, lithium, cobalt, manganese, etc. that are being extracted at alarming rates. Even with technological advances in the next few decades by those in wealthier countries, we may find 'more', but at current rates of extraction of those resources, the planet may be sucked dry in 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 years, so the question for our conversation is: Should there be a greater focus on the limitations of earth’s natural resources now being extracted for the enjoyment by wealthier countries on Earth as our 4-billion-year-old planet will continue to be here, with or without humans,? Developing countries are THE only source for the materials for wealthier countries to go 'green'. Since the current 'green movement' technology requires significant rare earth minerals and metals to construct EV batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels that are not easily available in the few wealthier countries are being mined in developing countries, so the question for our conversation is: Are the wealthy country mandates and subsidies ethical and moral, to continue financially encouraging China and Africa to continue the egregious human rights' violations of vulnerable minority populations by exploiting 'their' poor with yellow, brown, and black skin, and financially supporting environmental degradation to 'their' landscapes just to reinforce mandated EV’s, and subsidizing of wind turbines, and solar panels in 'wealthier country backyards'? The Future of EV Batteries. The first cell phone, more than 50 years ago in 1973, the Motorola DynaTAC, weighed 2.5 pounds and was 9 inches tall. Today’s cell phones are generally under 7 ounces with almost unlimited functions, easy charging, and with virtually unlimited applications. In the coming decades, the current 1,000 pound lithium battery in EVs will seem barbaric just like the first cell phone, future EV batteries will be lighter, cheaper, longer range, and shorter charging times, so the question for our conversation: How long do you think it will take humanity ingenuity and creativity driven by the free enterprise environment, to meet the humongous growing demand for efficient electricity, that will most likely exceed what we experienced in cell phone development that took 5-decades? Electricity came about AFTER the discovery of oil. ALL six methods to generate electricity, from hydro, coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar, for the generation of electricity are ALL built with the products, components, and equipment that are made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, so the question for our conversation is: Why rid the world of fossil fuels as that would eliminate our ability to generate electricity? So-called renewable power has proven to be very expensive electricity. The few wealthy countries able to provide heavy subsidies to transition to occasional electricity generation from breezes and sunshine has proven to be ultra-expensive for Germany, Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, all of the EU, and the USA. These few wealthy countries that currently represent about one of the eight billion of the world’s population, still remain ignorant that billions in Africa, Asia and Latin America still live on less than $10 a day – and that billions still have little to no access to electricity, so the question for our conversation is: How will the 'green movement' help those in poorer developing countries join the industrialized society being enjoyed by those in the wealthier countries? The supply chain to support zero-emission mandates must be ethical and moral. The zero-emission mandates from the few wealthier developed countries requires key challenges in the supply chain requirements from the raw materials sector for rare earth minerals and metals that need to be overcome if the electricity generation transition is to be realized, so the question for our conversation is: Why are there no conversation about securing sustainable supply chains, promoting responsible sourcing practices with labor and environmental laws and regulations, and ensuring a just and equitable green and digital transition for everyone, both poor and wealthy? Nuclear power plants are prolificating around the world. For more than 7 decades, nuclear power has proven to be the safest, most compact, emissions free, and cheapest way to produce continuous, uninterruptable, and dispatchable electricity, has resulted in increased activities in China, Russia, and Japan with about 60 new nuclear power plants under construction across the world and a further 110 planned, so the question for our conversation is: Why do you think that America is supporting subsidies for unreliable wind and solar generated electricity that is NOT continuous nor dispatchable, and avoiding nuclear generated electricity that is continuous, dispatchable, and emissions free? Nuclear power generation has an impressive safety track record.America has a track record of almost 70 years of nuclear power plant operation without any injuries, including over 70 years of nuclear Navy reactor operations for all their submarines and aircraft carriers, so the question for our conversation is: Why is there so much public resistance in America to allowing nuclear power to compete with other forms of power generation on the open market? The USA is falling behind in technological developments in nuclear power generation. While nuclear power generation is proliferating around the world in China, Russia, and Japan with about 60 new nuclear power plants under construction and a further 110 planned, nuclear power design and construction came to a slow end in America in the early 1980’s due to the handling of the anti-nuclear movement and an incompetent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, so the question for our conversation is: What will it take to stimulate American interest to just catch up with foreign countries domination of technological developments in nuclear power generation? CO2 starvation. The minimum threshold for plant life is 150 ppm of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), but today, CO2 levels are about 420 ppm which is essential for life on Earth as humans need carbon dioxide to regulate respiration and control blood pH while Plants use carbon dioxide to create oxygen through photosynthesis, so the question for our conversation is: With CO2 levels today nearing the starvation levels for plant and human life on earth, why the focus to reduce CO2 levels to end life? Government subsidized projects have yet to produce Environmental Impact Reports. To date, all wind and solar generation of electricity has been funded by government subsidies as NONE have been financed by private entrepreneurial investor funds, but all those subsidized renewable projects have yet to be accountable for Environmental Impact Reports (EIR’s) that details the life cycle for renewables that runs from design, procurement, and construction through operations, maintenance, and repair, as well as the life ending decommissioning and disposal or recycling and restoration of the landscaping back to its original pristine condition, so the question for our conversation is: Why are government subsidized renewable projects toward wind, solar, and electric vehicles EXEMPT from the same Environmental Impact Reports that extensively discuss decommissioning, recycling, and restoration of the landscaping back to its original pristine condition for wind, solar, and EV battery materials, when they are required when those projects are funded with private money? Earth’s natural resources are not being replenished. As the world’s population depletes the 4-billion year old Planet earth’s natural resources of crude oil, coal, natural gas, and the critical minerals and metals to support the 'green' movement like, lithium, cobalt, manganese, etc., over the next 50, 100, or more years, our grandchildren may be unable to enjoy the more than 6,000 products of our materialistic society, being enjoyed by the current residents on this planet, so the question for our conversation is: To continue the preservation of human life on earth, how do we get serious about conservation, efficiency improvements, and recycling the waste that humans are generating? The above open-ended questions are intended to facilitate the stimulation of 3-way Energy Literacy Conversations among teachers, students, and Podcast Moderators with representatives of the products and fuels of our materialistic society, and representatives of the pro-renewables for zero-emissions electricity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDnymKlMfHqOs	2025-01-06T15:33:51-08:00	
Prime Apple Growing Areas In US Face Increasing Climate Risks	Some of the most productive apple regions in America are facing big challenges from a changing climate, according to a Washington State University study. Researchers analyzed over 40 years of climate conditions that impact the growth cycle of apple trees from bud break and flowering through fruit development, maturation and color development. While many growing areas are facing increased climate risks, the top three largest apple producing counties in the U.S. were among the most impacted: Yakima in Washington, Kent in Michigan and Wayne in New York. In particular, Yakima County, the largest of the three with more than 48,800 acres of apple orchards, has seen harmful trends in five of the six metrics the researchers analyzed. 'We shouldn’t take the delicious apples we love to consume for granted,' said Deepti Singh, a WSU climate scientist and the study’s corresponding author. 'Changing climate conditions over multiple parts of the growth cycle pose potentially compounding threats to the production and quality of apples. Moving forward, it would be helpful to think about adaptations at different stages of apple growth that can minimize overall harmful impacts.' The team’s immediate next step is to look at projections, Singh added, to inform planning and management in the tree fruit industry. For this study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the researchers analyzed climate data from 1979-2022. They specifically looked at six metrics that impact the apple growth, including two metrics of extremes—extreme heat days, defined as days with a maximum temperature greater than 34 degrees C (93 F) that can cause sunburn as well as other problems, and warm nights when the minimum temperatures were greater than 15 C (59 F) that can adversely affect coloration. The researchers also looked at the number of cold days; 'chill portions' or the number of colder hours an apple tree needs to be dormant; the last day of spring frost; and growing degree days, meaning the number of days above a certain temperature that are conducive for apples to grow. Changes in these metrics can impact apple production, changing the time when apple flowers bloom, increasing the risk of sunburn on apples as well as affecting apple appearance and quality. The western U.S. has experienced the strongest trends in multiple metrics that are detrimental to apples. The challenges are complex partly because apple trees are perennials, said co-author Lee Kalcsits, a WSU tree physiologist who leads programming at the Wenatchee Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center. 'What goes on in different seasons can affect long-term health as well as the performance and productivity of the apple tree during that specific season,' he said. 'So what goes on in the winter affects what happens in the spring, which affects the summer, and it just keeps going around in a cycle.' Growers are already adapting, he added, noting that in Washington state, producers are employing measures such as netting and evaporative cooling to fend off sunburn during the more frequent extreme heat. With more climate risks likely, researchers are also taking steps to help the industry adapt. Kalcsits is leading a project funded by a $6.75 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help mitigate the impact of extreme climate events on apple and pear crops. It is a multi-institution grant with work planned across the nation as well as in the apple growing regions of Washington state. 'Washington is a great place to start to talk about adaptation,' said Kirti Rajagopalan, a WSU biological systems engineer and study co-author, who is also working on the grant project. 'A lot of the commercial apple production happens in the northern U.S. There are also parts of Washington where the summers can get pretty hot, so this is a good place for a case study – and if we can manage it here, then it's likely manageable elsewhere too.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDsloRK3rhV9T	2025-01-06T15:30:43-08:00	
Microplastics Widespread In Seafood People Eat	The tiny particles that shed from clothing, packaging and other plastic products are winding up in the fish that people eat, according to a new study from Portland State researchers, highlighting a need for technologies and strategies to reduce microfiber pollution entering the environment. Building on previous research exploring the prevalence of microplastics in bivalves like Pacific oysters and razor clams, researchers in PSU’s Applied Coastal Ecology Lab — led by Elise Granek, professor of environmental science and management — turned their focus to commonly eaten finfish and crustaceans. Summer Traylor, who graduated in 2022 with a master’s in environmental management, led the project with assistance from undergraduate environmental science student Marilyn Duncan, who graduated in 2024. The team set out to fill in gaps about microplastic contamination in Oregon finfish and shellfish and better understand variations across trophic levels, which classify a fish’s position in the food chain, and in pathways to consumers. Traylor’s research helped her land a job working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) after graduating from PSU, and Duncan has plans to continue microplastics research in graduate school. The team quantified anthropogenic particles, materials produced or modified by humans, that they found in the edible tissue of six species that are economically or culturally important in Oregon: black rockfish, lingcod, Chinook salmon, Pacific herring, Pacific lamprey, and pink shrimp. They compared particle concentrations across trophic levels and whether their position in the food web affected what and how much was contaminating their edible tissue as well as whether there were differences in samples acquired directly from research fishing vessels versus those from supermarkets and seafood vendors. Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist and associate professor in Oregon State University’s College of Agricultural Sciences, helped analyze and validate a subsample of suspected plastics in her lab. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Toxicology, found 1,806 suspected particles across 180 of 182 individual samples. Fibers were the most abundant, followed by fragments and films. Among the species sampled, pink shrimp, which filter-feed right below the surface of the water, had the highest concentrations of particles in their edible tissues. Chinook salmon had the lowest concentrations, followed by black rockfish and lingcod. 'We found that the smaller organisms that we sampled seem to be ingesting more anthropogenic, non-nutritious particles,' Granek said. 'Shrimp and small fish, like herring, are eating smaller food items like zooplankton. Other studies have found high concentrations of plastics in the area in which zooplankton accumulate and these anthropogenic particles may resemble zooplankton and thus be taken up for animals that feed on zooplankton.' Though the group expected that the processing from catch to consumer would introduce additional contaminants from plastic packaging meant to preserve seafood, that wasn’t universally true across the species. The researchers rinsed off the fish fillets and shrimp, replicating what most people do at home before preparing them, suggesting that in some cases, additional contamination that may land on the surface during processing can be removed with rinsing. The study results, however, provide evidence of the widespread presence of particles in the edible tissues of Oregon’s marine and freshwater species. 'It’s very concerning that microfibers appear to move from the gut into other tissues such as muscle,' Brander said. 'This has wide implications for other organisms, potentially including humans too.' The researchers say the findings signal the need for both further studies to understand the mechanisms by which particles translocate into muscle tissue, which humans eat, as well as policy interventions to regulate anthropogenic particles. 'This project established critical baseline data for West Coast fisheries stakeholders and highlighted how much we still do not know about these pervasive microplastic pollutants,' said Traylor, who now serves as a NOAA Corps Officer, helping collect baseline microplastic data in the Gulf of Mexico to further expand public knowledge and understanding. The authors are not advocating for people to stay away from seafood because, as Granek likes to remind people, microplastics are everywhere: in bottled water, beer, honey, beef, chicken, veggie burgers and tofu. 'If we are disposing of and utilizing products that release microplastics, those microplastics make their way into the environment, and are taken up by things we eat,' she said. 'What we put out into the environment ends up back on our plates.' That’s why Granek’s lab group is beginning to focus more on solutions. 'We're continuing to do work to understand the effects of anthropogenic particles on animals, but we're also moving into experimental work to test what are effective solutions to reduce microplastics entering marine ecosystems,' she said. She’s leading a $1.9 million NOAA-funded project that is developing and testing washing machine, dishwasher and clothes dryer filters that can serve as cost-effective filtration solutions. In another project funded by Oregon Sea Grant, six catch basin filters will be installed in stormwater drains in two coastal towns to determine their efficacy in trapping microplastics from road runoff before entering waterways. Brander’s lab is collaborating on both projects as well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDjHWCY69-HV2	2025-01-06T15:28:12-08:00	
Lead Pollution Likely Caused Widespread IQ Declines In Ancient Ro...	Lead exposure is responsible for a range of human health impacts, with even relatively low levels impacting the cognitive development of children. DRI scientists have previously used atmospheric pollution records preserved in Arctic ice cores to identify periods of lead pollution throughout the Roman Empire, and now new research expands on this finding to identify how this pollution may have affected the European population. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), examined three ice core records to identify lead pollution levels in the Arctic between 500 BCE through 600 CE. This era spans the rise of the Roman Republic through the fall of the Roman Empire, with the study focusing on the approximately 200-year height of the Empire called the Pax Romana. Lead isotopes allowed the research team to identify mining and smelting operations throughout Europe as the likely source of pollution during this period. Advanced computer modeling of atmospheric movement then produced maps of atmospheric lead pollution levels across Europe. Combined with research linking lead exposure to cognitive decline, the research team also identified likely reductions in IQ levels of at least 2 to 3 points among the European population. 'This is the first study to take a pollution record from an ice core and invert it to get atmospheric concentrations of pollution and then assess human impacts,' says Joe McConnell, research professor of hydrology at DRI and lead author of the study. 'The idea that we can do this for 2,000 years ago is pretty novel and exciting.' Records of the Past Preserved in Ice McConnell’s Ice Core Laboratory at DRI has spent decades examining ice cores from places like Greenland and Antarctica, where sheets of ice have built up over millennia. Using enormous drills, they painstakingly extract columns of ice as much as 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) long, reaching more distant depths of Earth’s history with each inch. McConnell’s team creates precise timelines using records of well-dated volcanic eruptions, which stamp the ice record like postcards from the past. Gas bubbles trapped in the ice offer insight into the atmosphere of past eras, while pollutants like lead can be used to interpret mining and industrial activity. McConnell began developing methods to create very detailed lead records in ice more than twenty years ago, when he applied them to more recent history. When archeologists and historians learned of this work, they approached him hoping to apply these new techniques to the Roman period, seeking answers to lingering historical questions. 'The resulting research changed our understanding of the era by finding precise linkages between the lead pollution records and historical events such as population declines associated with periodic plagues and pandemics,' adds coauthor and ancient historian Andrew Wilson of Oxford University. A Growing Understanding of the Harms of Lead Pollution Ancient lead pollution stemmed largely from silver mining, whereby the lead-rich mineral galena was melted down to extract silver. For every ounce of silver obtained, this process produced thousands of ounces of lead—much of which was released to the atmosphere. In the 20th century, lead pollution predominantly came from the emissions of vehicles burning leaded gasoline. Following the passing of the Clean Air Act in the U.S. in 1970, which restricted the use of leaded gasoline, researchers have tracked the sharp decline of lead in human blood. However, the nationwide exposure, particularly for children born between 1950 and 1985, allowed scientists to track lead’s impact on health and cognitive development. 'As lead pollution has declined during the last 30 years, it has become more and more apparent to epidemiologists and medical experts just how bad lead is for human development,' McConnell says. In adults, high levels of lead exposure are linked to infertility, anemia, memory loss, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and reduced immune response, among other impacts. In children, even low levels of exposure have been connected to reduced IQ, concentration challenges, and reduced academic success. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a blood lead level of 3.5 µg/dl the point for medical intervention for children, they have stated that there is no level of lead exposure without risk. 'Lead is known to have a wide range of human health impacts, but we chose to focus on cognitive decline because it’s something we can put a number on,' says study coauthor Nathan Chellman, assistant research professor of snow and ice hydrology at DRI. 'An IQ reduction of 2 to 3 points doesn’t sound like much, but when you apply that to essentially the entire European population, it’s kind of a big deal.' The study found that atmospheric lead pollution began during the Iron Age and reached a peak during the late 2nd century BCE at the height of the Roman Republic. It then declined sharply during the 1st century BCE, during the crisis of the Roman Republic, before increasing around 15 BCE following the rise of the Roman Empire. Lead pollution remained high until the Antonine Plague from 165 to the 180s CE, which severely affected the Roman Empire. It wasn’t until the High Middle Ages in the early 2nd millennium CE that lead pollution in the Arctic exceeded the sustained high levels of the Roman Empire. According to the research, more than 500 kilotons of lead were released to the atmosphere during the nearly 200-year height of the Roman Empire. Although ice core records show that Arctic lead pollution was up to 40-fold higher during the highest historical peak in the early 1970s, the insight gained from this study demonstrates how 'humans have been impacting their health for thousands of years through industrial activity,' McConnell says.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynzzvGzJAE9q-y	2025-01-06T15:24:12-08:00	
New Non-Paper On Developments In The Western Balkans – OpEd	On December 4, 2024, the Sarajevo portal 'Slobodna Bosna' published the full text of the document accompanied by the article entitled 'New Non-PAPER for the Western Balkans, green light from Washington for the final result...'! The Albanian Institute for Geopolitics translated and published it in full. In relation to this 'New Non-Paper', in this analysis we will try to draw some conclusions related to the authorship and the messages that are claimed to be conveyed and related to the security of the Western Balkans and its future in NATO and the EU. Entry A non-paper is an unofficial diplomatic document that presents a proposal, formulation, draft, amendment, or similar, with which the author does not wish to be officially identified. As a rule, it is used for informal presentation of diplomatic positions to see - whether these 'offered' positions will be accepted and to determine the maximum common position of the parties involved - in a certain political dispute.So, precisely because it deals with delicate political issues, the names of the authors of the non-paper are not mentioned and it can also be translated as a 'working document' in the diplomatic vocabulary... In this analysis, it is about a document coming from Washington.The branches of the Bosnian portal 'Slobodna Bosnja', it is said in the introduction of the text, near the new head of American diplomacy, confirmed that the document was already on the desk of Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, who has been appointed by the newly elected American President Donald Trump as Secretary new US State. The goal of the initiative is to put an end to territorial claims and conflicts in the Western Balkans and create opportunities for a final turn towards Euro-Atlantic integration of the entire region, as well as away from Russian influence and possible wars, which, from time to time, threaten to destabilize the the region.In the geopolitical context, this document seems to have a clear goal - that of the integration of the Western Balkans first of all within the strategic architecture of the USA, respectively the core of this architecture which means the Anglo-Saxon sphere of interest. Hypotheses The new non-paper on the Western Balkans [1] is an informal document that is often used by international actors to stimulate discussions and propose ideas or strategies regarding sensitive political issues, without taking an official position. Recently, there have been rumors that such a non-paper is circulating on the integration processes of the Western Balkans in the European Union (EU), as well as on issues such as dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, internal reforms and the acceleration of integration processes. In the predecessor non-papers, there was an open tendency to use the 'coveter's letter' through the narrative of a 'great Albania' in the general public, there were clear intentions to make the idea of ​​the 'Serbian World' aka great Serbia, more acceptable to international factors. But what are the de facto authors of the new non-paper revealing? What does the new non-paper contain? The contents of a non-paper are usually not published officially, but described in the media through diplomatic sources. As we pointed out at the beginning, 'Slobodna Bosna' has published a new non-paper related to the Western Balkans, which is claimed to come from Washington. The current document reflects the intention of the Western decision-making centers for the termination of territorial conflicts in the Western Balkans, therefore it has nothing to do with Greater Serbia. One even gets the impression that the essence of this new document is the idea of ​​a kind of distancing of the states of Southeast Europe, aka the Western Balkans, from Russian influence, which would automatically, according to the document in question, cancel the possibilities for possible conflicts, which are warned through the exercise of Serbian state terror against the Republic of Kosovo and its citizens [the case of Banja on September 24, 2024 and the latter in the Ibri e Lepenci channel]. The new non-paper specifically states: 'The goal of the initiative is for all countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States to be in NATO, Serbia and Kosovo to recognize each other, to repeal the application of the Declaration of the All-Serbian Parliament in BiH , and the possibility of introducing the Law on Dual Citizenship in Montenegro'. Currently, Montenegro has a strong position regarding the recognition of dual citizenship. According to the legislation in force, a foreign citizen seeking Montenegrin citizenship must surrender his previous citizenship. This legal provision constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of the proposals of the pro-Serbian and pro-Russian parties, which require that Montenegrin citizens of Serbian origin have the right to have dual citizenship, including that of Serbia. These efforts come as part of a broader strategy to change the demographic and political balance in Montenegro, significantly strengthening ties between the Serbian community and Serbia. This scenario creates a favorable basis for political manipulation and increasing Belgrade's influence in Montenegro. Demographic statistics show deep changes in the ethnic composition of Montenegro during the last decades. In the last census, 41.12% of the population declared themselves as Montenegrins, while 33% declared themselves as Serbs—an increase of 4% compared to the 2011 census.[2] The 'new non-paper' would essentially contribute to the democratization of the Western Balkans, clearly preserving the existing - internationally recognized borders. Let's remember the fact that, for four years now, we have been witnessing disturbing trends, that through the example of Montenegro, which is the 'alpha and omega of the Greater Serbia project', Serbia can prove in reality its possibilities for expansion even through the hybrid war, alias 'soft approach', installing the pro-Serbian and pro-Russian government in Podgorica, despite the fact that Montenegro is a member of NATO. Meanwhile, through the All-Serbian Assembly held on 07.06.2024 in Belgrade and the approval of the Political Platform as a basic document in the service of the 'Serbian World' idea, Serbia challenged the Pre-Soviet diplomacy, making clear the final goal of the Serbian strategy. Content and deadlines for the implementation of the 'new non-paper' According to this document, within the year 2025 - from April to October, it is planned to hold a large international conference designed as an 'Initiative of the Commonwealth of Independent States' (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina) organized under care of the EU, NATO and the USA. According to the said document, a series of agreements and memoranda would be signed at the conclusion - in which the states participating in the conference would mutually commit to the following: 1. The signing of the Agreement between Serbia and Kosovo for the full normalization of relations according to the Franco-German-EU plan, which means the de facto recognition of Kosovo by Serbia and the formation of the Community of Municipalities with a Serbian majority in the north of Kosovo, on the part of Kosovo. 2. The agreement between Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina on the repeal of the 'Declaration for the Protection of National and Political Rights and the Common Future of the Serbian People', [i.e. the Political Platform of the All-Serbian Assembly - SR], fully and strictly respecting the Agreement of Dayton and the political sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aforementioned declaration [on the 'Serbian World'] is essentially a program of political movements with the ultimate goal of creating a greater Serbia. [3] That is, it is the logical continuation of Milosevic's 'all Serbs in one state' policy, which he once articulated - in accordance with the guidelines from the SANU [Serbian Academy of Art and Science] Memorandum. 3. The agreement between Serbia and Montenegro foresees the permanent suspension of the Law on Dual Citizenship of Montenegro, creating a de facto opportunity for an army of citizens to restore Serbian citizenship as well. Through this act, more than 200,000 Serbian citizens could automatically obtain Montenegrin citizenship, through which, then, as voters, they would be able to overturn the political will of the majority citizens of Montenegro, seriously undermining the Montenegrin identity and the state of Montenegro, since it has only about 633,000 inhabitants.4. The joint agreement on preserving and respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro), and 5. The agreement for submitting a joint candidacy for membership in NATO (Serbia, BiH and Kosovo) by taking all the necessary steps and measures towards an accelerated process of admission to the EU. [4] *** The response to this document did not take long from Belgrade. However, both Vucic and Putin are asking about something concrete. In this context, Aleksandar Vučić's response to the non-paper offers was quick, clear and unequivocal. He said: 'As long as I am president of Serbia, there are no international conferences, no recognition of Kosovo and no membership in NATO'! Emphasizing then: 'There will be no conferences as long as I am president and I am president of Serbia, at least for another two years and a few months.'! Reactions to non-paper Positive : Some countries see this as a new impetus for integration and conflict resolution, especially for those who feel left behind by previous processes. Skeptical : Others are concerned about ideas that may violate the territorial integrity of countries, as well as unequal treatment among countries in the region. Kosovo and Serbia : If the non-paper includes ideas for mutual recognition or new models for dialogue, it is likely to stimulate heated debates in both countries. Conclusion These non-papers often remain unclear to the general public, as they do not have an official character. However, they provide an indication of the direction that EU policy or international actors may follow. It is worth seeing how the discussions will take place and whether the proposals included will find concrete support. It is clear that the solution to all these conflicts and decades-long disputes between the states in the Western Balkans, including the ideas of a return to war, is the membership of the bloc in NATO and the EU. The spirit of this document claims to be more comprehensive - this means the full application of democratic elections, the creation of a political environment where free media can live, the independence of the judiciary and the police, including the full harmonization of foreign policy and security with that of the EU, which implies the acceptance of the political and governing philosophy, and which in principle implies the peaceful resolution of all disputes between the countries of the region.The document in question, with emphasis on its first point and those numbered four and five, offer a clear vision for the development of the region's separation from the sphere of Russian influence and the opening of real opportunities for economic and digital development of the Western Balkans, placed Albania and Kosovo at the heart of a global strategic architecture. This project, as well as peace in the region itself, further depends on the position of Serbia. The first reactions from Belgrade seem to say that Serbia and Russia will reject this non-paper, as Vucic has already said. The real reasons why Belgrade reacted so quickly are of an ideological and political nature: it is aware that its acceptance means giving up the ambitious project of the 'Serbian World' alias Greater Serbia. The consequences if this document were to be rejected, according to its conclusion, would be unbearable: 'Rejection of the participation of the countries of the Western Balkans in the Conference on Peace and Cooperation in BP and adherence to all the mentioned initiatives, memoranda and agreements , would clearly show ill will towards neighboring countries, towards European peace and order and security, and towards the wider European community of states. This rejection would also lead to the end of the EU membership negotiations, non-membership of the Schengen Agreement, withdrawal of foreign investments, economic sanctions and political and economic isolation.' [5]In conclusion, we can underline that, in diplomatic circles, there is no longer any doubt that 'the first non-paper (2021) completely pro-Serb, was drafted in 'Vučić's office or in one of the Moscow cabinets', and was issued to the public by the then Slovenian Prime Minister, Janez Jansha. Meanwhile, if we judge based on its content and especially on its spirit, the 'second (pro-Western) no-paper', in the Croatian media [6] it is judged that it must have been drafted by the Bosnian elite with a strong political-religious background, but anyway supported by some counties from the west.__________________________ 1. ).See the version in Albanian: [ ]2.

Biden Honors Soros – OpEd	On January 4, President Biden gave the Medal of Freedom to George Soros. It is the nation’s highest civilian award, given to 'individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' The White House said those who received the award are 'great leaders because they are good people who have made extraordinary contributions to their country and the world.' The truth is that George Soros has done more to destroy western civilization and the United States, in particular, than any single person in the world. An inveterate anti-Catholic bigot, his anti-law enforcement policies have impoverished and punished legions of innocent black Americans. A self-hating Jew, he has been condemned by Jewish leaders in the United States and Israel. Soros uses his Open Society Institute to help 'reset' America’s priorities. He contributes to 'dark money' organizations that make it hard to trace the origins of their funding services. This includes funding the Tides Foundation. According to the Capital Research Center, 'If the Left does it, Tides funds it.' Among the most important American values is freedom of speech. Soros has worked overtime to kill it, donating to causes that fight 'disinformation,' or speech that the Left deems worthy of censoring. He was particularly active in promoting President Obama’s efforts at censorship. Soros has sought to destabilize America by supporting open borders, welcoming those who have illegally entered the country. His embrace of Black Lives Matter, which has openly said it wants to destroy the nuclear family, is of a piece with his attacks on the criminal justice system. He gave Alvin Bragg $1 million when he was running for the DA in Manhattan in 2021; he gave George Gascón nearly $3 million when he ran for DA in Los Angeles in 2020. In 2022, he gave $40 million to elect seventy-five 'social justice' prosecutors. Between 2016 and 2022, Soros gave more than $29 million to a personal network of political action committees specifically established to back radical DA candidates. By mid-2022, one in five Americans, or seventy million people, were living in a jurisdiction overseen by a Soros-backed prosecutor. Soros DAs were running New York, Chicago, Saint Louis, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Crime-ridden Austin, Texas, was made worse when he gave $500,000 in 2021 to defeat a ballot initiative that would have provided more money to hire police officers (cops were retiring at record levels). [See my book, War on Virtue: How the Ruling Class is Killing the American Dream, for the documentation.] Soros’ Open Society Institute has waged war on Catholics for decades. It funds many dissident organizations, activist groups that falsely claim to be Catholic. They include Catholics for Choice, a pro-abortion, anti-Catholic letterhead funded by the likes of Soros. He was also the money behind Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and Catholics United, two front-groups set up by Clinton aide John Podesta to create a 'Catholic Spring' revolution in the Church. Though Soros is Jewish, he has been accused by the ADL of blaming anti-Semitism in Israel on the Israeli government, and the Jerusalem Post has accused him of weakening support for Israel in the Democratic Party. The editor of the New Republic, Martin Peretz, called him 'a cog in the Hitlerite wheel.' As a young man in Hungary, Soros became a Nazi collaborator. In a 60 Minutes interview he admitted that he helped confiscate property from Jews. He told Steve Kroft that he never regretted doing so. When asked if this was difficult, Soros said, 'Not, not at all.' Stunned, Kroft said, 'No feeling of guilt?' 'No' came the reply. Biden has been telling us for four years how much he supports DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). His decision to honor George Soros, the world’s most influential anti-Catholic bigot, shows what a liar this 'devout Catholic' really is.

Syrian Kurds Should Not Be Left At The Mercy Of Turks – OpEd	Since Assad's regime fell in early December, clashes have intensified in northern Syria between the US-backed Kurdish fighters and the Turkish proxy force Syrian National Army (SNA). Following the regime change in Syria, Turkey has become the most important regional actor in the country. By providing support for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army Ankara has been consolidating its power over Syria. Turks think that this is the right time to get rid of the small statelet of Syrian Kurds often referred to as Rojava sitting next to its borders. The Kurdish people, often referred to as the largest stateless ethnic group in the world, have faced centuries of marginalization and persecution. Scattered across Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the Kurds share a cultural, linguistic, and historical bond but remain divided by political borders imposed after World War I. In Syria, their plight has been particularly stark with decades of oppression and neglect under the Arab nationalist Baath regime. Kurds in Syria have long been treated as second-class citizens. Stripped of citizenship rights in the 1960s, many were rendered stateless and denied access to education, property ownership, and other fundamental rights. Syrian Kurds, who make up about 10-15% of the population, had been more suppressed and less visible than Kurds in Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. From the beginning of the Syrian war, the main Kurdish political party in Syria, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) chose to side with neither Assad nor the anti-regime opposition groups and instead sought to secure its position in the north. In 2012 it unilaterally declared the establishment of an autonomous region called Rojava (Western Kurdistan), formed of three territorially separate cantons: Afrin, Kobane, and Manbij. Turkey's regular military interventions endangered the PYD's position in North and North-East Syria, but the latter continued to maintain an efficient and well-organized administration even under dire situations, with a commitment to bottom-up democracy, gender equality, and minority rights. This is exceptional in the Middle East, where hopes for democracy have been largely crushed since the Arab Spring. Currently, this Kurdish project in Syria is fighting for its survival as they face Turkish mercenary groups like SNA and direct Turkish attacks in the form of artillery shelling and airstrikes. Turkey's key objective in Syria is simple: liquidating multiethnic, Kurdish-led governance along its border, and pushing the Kurdish population back into the Syrian desert by establishing a twenty-mile-deep 'safe zone.' There, it will also resettle Syrian refugees in formerly Kurdish settlements as a way of both satisfying domestic anti-refugee sentiment and entrenching ethnic change along its border. Turkey has been continuously attacking not only Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases but generally every kind of Kurdish structure in its vicinity. Syrian Kurds have been regularly targeted by Turkey and its allied militias. Through regular shelling of Kurdish positions and military campaigns like Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch. Syrian Kurds are on top of the Turkish hit list as they are the major obstacle in Ankara's expansionist policies in Syria. Turkey justifies its fierce hostility towards Kurdish forces in Syria by arguing that Kurdish-controlled regions in northern Syria are terrorist dens and shelters for the outlawed PKK which has launched a guerrilla campaign against Turks since 1984. But Turks failed to provide any evidence that Kurds have launched any terror attacks against Turkey from Syria. The real motive behind these kinds of onslaughts launched by Turkey is to drive out the Kurds from these areas and get the pro-Turkish population settled there. It is evident from the fact that in its previous operation in Afrin, Turkey engaged not in counter-terror, but in ethnic cleansing. In its multiple reports, Amnesty International has reported that Turkish military forces and their allied armed groups. Have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into northeast Syria. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the main fighting force of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (Rojava) since the beginning has been an important ally of the West in the fight against ISIS. They have done the bulk of the fighting on the ground against ISIS. It should be remembered that Syrian Kurds are still holding thousands of ISIS operatives in the prisons controlled and guarded by them. The new regime in Damascus led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham offers to take over guard duty at Al-Hol prison camp, where thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families remain under guard, is ridiculous, it's equivalent of a hunter offering to guard its prey. The situation would be worse, however, as the thousands of Islamic State fighters would spread out not only across Syria and the Middle East but also into Europe with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan happily extorting concessions from weak European and NATO leaders in exchange for promises not to turn on the wave of illegal immigration. Ankara's neo-Ottoman approach in the region has been clearly visible through its engagement in the Syrian conflict after 2011. All of Turkey's strategic targets and demands since the start of the Syrian conflict like the ousting of the Assad regime, preventing a Kurdish autonomous region, declaration of a no-fly zone, creating a buffer zone along the eastern part of Euphrates River, and protecting radical Islamist groups in Idlib, have been a part of this approach. But Syrian Kurds who are a beacon of liberalism and democracy in the troublesome Middle East should not be allowed to fall prey to the expansionist policies of Turks if this valuable ally of the United States is not provided with the required assistance in time. The West will lose its credibility as a reliable ally.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynzxb3CZfNdiFE	2025-01-06T15:19:12-08:00	
Sarfraz Hussain: Bank Of Punjab Driven By Innovation And Dedicati...	Sarfraz Hussain is a seasoned banker with over 23 years proven track record of success and delivery. He carries with him diversified exposure in Agriculture, SME Banking and Credit Administration with leading commercial banks of Pakistan. He is currently associated with The Bank of Punjab (BOP) as Head Agri Credit Division for last 6 years, and h holds a M. Phil degree in Agri Economics from University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. There are several international and local trainings in his credit, covering different aspects of banking. He is also a certified trainer on the platform of National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), a training arm of State Bank of Pakistan. His accomplishments at bank testify to his acumen and expertise. BOP has been recognized as Best Bank for Agriculture at the Pakistan Banking Awards 2024. Following are excerpts from an exclusive interview with Sarfraz Hussain. BOP has been recently declared the Best Bank for lending to farmers. Please share the important benchmarks achieved. Sarfraz Hussain: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) acknowledges the critical role of the farming community in sustaining Pakistan’s economy. Guided by a strategy centered on empowerment, innovation, and sustainability, BOP has taken transformative steps to redefine agricultural financing and uplift the livelihoods of farmers nationwide. Key benchmarks achieved include: Sarfraz Hussain Best Agri Bank Recognition: BOP has been awarded the title of Best Agri Bank by Pakistan’s Banking Association (PBA) which is the most prestigious award in this sector in Pakistan. Additionally, BOP has also won of Best Agri Mid-Tier Bank for two consecutive fiscal years (2021–22 and 2022–23). Since it has now entered the league of large Agri Banks, it now ranks second amongst the large banks as per the State Bank of Pakistan’s Agriculture Scorecard. Exponential Growth: Over the last three years, BOP’s agricultural portfolio has increased manifold, from PKR14.93 billion to PKR43.70 billion. Additionally, the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) also stand at a very low level, below 5% as of December 31, 2023 (far lesser than the industry/competition). Pioneering Initiatives: As the pioneer of the Kissan Card Project, BOP has enhanced financial accessibility for a huge chunk of small/ subsistence farmers – which is perhaps the overlooked portion of the farming population due to lack of organized documentation, business model, socio-economic conditions etc. This program enables them to benefit from digital and subsidized solutions which has been launched by BOP; the Govt. of Punjab. The program, which is an end to end digital system based on a structured transaction through Cards to be used at specified POS machines (vendors), aims to disburse PKR75 billion to more than 500,000 farmers for the ongoing Rabbi season. The prescribed innovation took place by integrating PLRA, PITB and PMD systems into BOP’s system enabling smooth sailing of the project. Additionally, BOP has developed a 'Livestock Card' addressing the small farmers of Non-Farm segment. The project aims to facilitate an estimated around 400,000 farmers with a limit of PKR27,000/ animal. The project aims to disburse a total of PKR11.00 billion. Global Recognition: BOP won the prestigious Gates Foundation's Digital Agri Challenge Fund through Karandaaz, affirming its innovative approach to agricultural finance. The challenge fund won by BOP was contested by several other banks/FIs in partnership with Fintechs/ Agtechs. BOP has been allotted a grant of PKR50.00 million through the project which aims to develop an end-to-end digital lending platform targeting the small/ subsistence farmers. The maximum loan amount to an individual farmer is PKR1.00 million which will be extended to both the Farm (Crop Production) as well as Non-Farm (Dairy & Livestock Only). The Bank will integrate its system with Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) for this purpose which will verify a borrower’s land for the crop loans. Electronic Warehouse Receipt Financing: BOP is pioneer bank in introducing EWRF in the industry. This feat is achieved by only 2 banks at the overall industry level, even today. Introduced financing programs under conventional, Islamic, and government schemes, revolutionizing post-harvest financing. BOP has disbursed PKR1.28 billion in this area of financing against major commodities i.e. Paddy and Maize. Adoption of New Insurance Method for Risk Mitigation: Launched the Area Yield Index Insurance to safeguard farmers against production risks. This project, which was launched as a pilot, was also pioneered by BOP and one other Bank in the industry. The payout to the farmers against their crop yields was exemplary. Area Yield Index Insurance (AYII) protects farmers against yield losses due to various factors like adverse weather or pests. An Area Yield Index Insurance (AYII) is an insurance cover that insures farmers against a pre-set historical benchmark. The perils covered in this product are windstorm, frost, excessive rainfall, heat wave, hail, flood, drought, pest and diseases. AYII index insurance primarily covers natural calamities or other factors causing yield reductions in the area. Commitment to Inclusion; Non-Financial Advisory Services: Through a relentless focus on innovation, financial inclusion, and sustainability, BOP continues to empower farmers and strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural sector. BOP has also embraced the Agri Finance Literacy Program (AFLP) introduced by SBP through which it conducted around 600 awareness sessions since the program’s inception, all over the country. The awareness sessions also paved way for female farmer inclusion. Due to female inclusion focus, BOP has also won the women inclusion award by PBA (which is also a prestigious award). Tech-Enabled Advisory Services: Partnered with reputed AgriTech firms to offer non-financial advisory services, equipping farmers with essential knowledge and tools for improved productivity. The onboarding of Agritechs took place through PPRA as well as MOUs/ Agreements. Reputed names in the Agritech industry are included in this list. BOP is currently engaged in providing advisory services to its customers of farm loans i.e. crop Production; Tractors etc. BOP’s comprehensive and forward-looking approach underscores its dedication to being the preferred partner for farmers and a catalyst for agricultural transformation across Pakistan. How has BOP achieved these benchmarks, whereas some larger banks have not? Sarfraz: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has achieved its benchmarks through a strategic approach that prioritizes innovation, inclusivity, and technological advancement in agricultural finance. Key factors contributing to BOP’s success include: Board Level Commitment: Agri Financing is close to the heart of BOP’s Board. This puts special emphasis on the level of commitment towards this industry. BOP’s senior management is keen to implement the Bank’s strategy formulated to expand agri financing through inclusion, diversity and digitalization. Creation of Agri Hubs: The Agri Credit Division (ACD) of BOP expanded its foot print beyond the borders of Punjab and is now present in all the provinces of Pakistan. Similarly, specific hubs were created through which Agri field officers were hired to expand the team presence in all areas thereby ensuring portfolio growth. ACD is currently managed through the field by a division of 11 regions, 36 hubs and more than 200 Agri designated branches. Each region has a Regional Head supported by a Regional Credit analyst. Program Lending Approach: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has strategically divided its network into Rural and Urban regions to tailor its offerings to specific customer needs. In rural areas, BOP prioritizes agriculture-based customers, providing a comprehensive suite of Farm and Non-Farm products. This includes financing for essential areas like crop inputs, farm machinery, Dairy/ livestock, fisheries, food processing, and sustainable energy solutions. BOP finances all these sectors under program based lending duly approved by the Bank management. Delegation Matrix: In order to address the Bank’s processing challenges, BOP simplified the approval processing of Agri Loans and delegated powers of approval to the Business Unit, thereby, creating a dedicated Credit Factory within the Business Unit by the name of CIU (Credit Initiation Unit) who look after the business risk and ensure compliance to the regulator and bank’s policy etc. By adopting this multifaceted approach, BOP has successfully outperformed larger banks and established itself as a leader in agricultural finance, driving growth, innovation, and inclusivity in Pakistan’s agricultural sector. What is the amount and share of Inputs/ development/ warehouse construction/ livestock/ aqua culture in the total lending to farmers? Input loans: PKR18.58 billion Development: PKR4.98 billion Livestock/ aquaculture: PKR14.244 billion FFSAP+EWRF: PKR0.367 billion BOP has extended loans to fishermen which were the major products financed and what is the total quantum of loans extended in FY24? Sarfraz: Overall financing and trade business extended to Aquaculture including fishermen during the year remained PKRs3 billion approximately. BOP is involved in EWR financing, what was the quantum of financing in FY24? Sarfraz: By spearheading Electronic Warehouse Receipt (EWR) financing, BOP has revolutionized agricultural financing in Pakistan. The bank has significantly expanded its EWR financing portfolio beyond the pilot phase, incorporating a diverse range of commodities such as maize, rice/ paddy, and wheat. Through this initiative, BOP has enabled farmers and businesses across various regions to unlock the value of their agricultural assets, promoting sectoral growth and financial empowerment. EWRF significantly addresses the country’s issue of Food Security, postharvest crop losses and compensation to farmers for the sale of their crops in the peak time. In FY24, BOP disbursed PKR1.28 billion under EWR financing. What is the lending target of lending to farmers for FY25? Sarfraz: After being named Best Agriculture Bank of the Year 2024, BOP is poised to further its leadership in agricultural financing. The bank remains dedicated to enhancing financial inclusion, delivering innovative solutions, and transforming the agricultural sector. For FY25, BOP has set an ambitious lending target of PKRs110 billion to support the growth and prosperity of farmers across Pakistan. Which new areas BOP intend to explore in FY25? Sarfraz: BOP is focused on digital innovation in agriculture financing to provide quick and efficient online loan solutions for farmers, improving accessibility, transparency, and the overall borrowing experience. Key areas of exploration include: Launching the Digital Grower Loan. Digitizing non-farm sectors lending. Offering bundled non-financial advisory services alongside farm sector financing. Partnering with agribusiness corporates for dairy/ Livestock / Crop Production/ Agri machinery to enhance financial inclusion through a close loop value chain model. What is the recovery percentage/ bad loans? Sarfraz: BOP has maintained an impressive recovery rate of 97%, with bad loans accounting for less than 3% of the portfolio, reflecting its strong risk management and borrower engagement strategies. Does BOP go for credit insurance? Sarfraz: BOP currently does not go for credit insurance. This is in line with the industry practice in Pakistan where credit insurance does not prevail. Additionally, we believe that the local insurance industry is not offering any such credit solutions. However, BOP has insurance arrangements in place for Livestock and Dairy Animals, Agri Machinery and Tractors, along with crop loan Insurance for Crop Production loans. Moreover, Bop offers comprehensive insurance coverage for all its agricultural products. This includes life insurance of its clients pertaining to digital lending.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynz-Hzuf4i5kwW	2025-01-06T15:16:57-08:00	
Indian Politicians And Media Are Harming Hindus In Bangladesh – O...	That the sense of gratitude is not perpetual is a proven reality evident in the context of Bangladesh-India relations. During Bangladesh's War of Liberation, India extended unparalleled support, often beyond its own capacity. India not only provided shelter to 10 million refugees but also ensured their sustenance with remarkable compassion and empathy. On the historic day of December 16th, the unforgettable scenes of the Pakistani army's surrender to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India at the Ramna Racecourse remain etched in our collective memory. The open-air signing ceremony and the sky-high cheers from the people of Dhaka as they welcomed the Indian army generals and soldiers were nothing short of incredible. Where have those profound feelings of solidarity and gratitude gone? Why have they faded over time? Two key incidents can help us to explain the erosion of positive sentiments toward India in Bangladesh: the Farakka Long March of 1976, led by Maulana Bhashani, and the tragic killing of a 15-year-old girl named Felani in 2011. The Farakka Long March symbolized widespread resentment over India's alleged failure to ensure a fair and equitable share of river water, leaving Bangladeshis feeling deprived. Similarly, the repeated killing of Bangladeshis intruders—along the India-Bangladesh border, with Felani's death serving as a heart-wrenching example, has further fueled anger and distrust. These events reflect deep-seated grievances of Bangladeshis. India demonstrated remarkable diplomatic success in the early 1970s, particularly under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who skillfully outmaneuvered her global counterparts. The creation of Bangladesh in 1971 stands as a testament to her strategic acumen and India's diplomatic prowess during that era. During I.K. Gujral's premiership, India adopted the Gujral Doctrine, which emphasized fostering goodwill and cooperation with neighboring countries without expecting reciprocity. This policy created a period of relative harmony and satisfaction among Bangladesh and other neighboring nations. Unfortunately, in the years since, India's approach to regional diplomacy has seen a decline, contributing to rising tensions and resentment in its immediate neighborhood, including Bangladesh. The rise of the BJP as a Hindu nationalist party in India has inadvertently fueled the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh. This dynamic is deeply rooted in the historical and sociopolitical interplay between the two neighboring countries, forming a dialectical relationship that continues to shape their interactions. A key misstep in Indian diplomacy lies in its tendency to prioritize relations with ruling regimes rather than engaging directly with the people. Effective diplomacy should center on fostering goodwill and trust among the population of the concerned country. Building a sustainable and robust bilateral relationship requires winning the hearts and minds of the populace, thereby creating a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. Both Congress and BJP governments have blindly supported the Hasina regime in Bangladesh. The BJP government continued to back Sheikh Hasina, even though her re-election was marred by widespread electoral rigging. When a government is installed through such dubious means, it loses the trust of its people. Consequently, the overt support from India for Sheikh Hasina’s regime not only alienated the Bangladeshi people from their own government but also intensified resentment against India itself. India’s failure to grasp the depth of public anger towards Sheikh Hasina is baffling. Had Indian policymakers truly understood the situation, they might have advised Hasina differently—perhaps urging her to hold free and fair elections or even to resign voluntarily to prevent escalating tensions. The resignation and departure of Sheikh Hasina have brought a new wave of challenges. As is often the case after regime changes, incidents of persecution against minority communities, particularly Hindus, have surfaced. One particularly troubling case is that of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, who has been arrested on charges of sedition. Disturbingly, he has been denied bail, and lawyers willing to represent him have reportedly faced intimidation, with some even being physically assaulted. As a Hindu-majority country and a close neighbor, India has a moral responsibility to address these issues with sensitivity. The Prime Minister's Office, through its regular briefings, could express concern over the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh—much like the way the United States has been vocal about human rights issues. However, instead of adopting a constructive approach, many Indian politicians and media outlets have resorted to relentless denunciations. Indian television channels, in particular, have been saturated with loud and sensational coverage of Bangladesh’s internal events since Sheikh Hasina’s departure. This incessant vilification not only undermines India's credibility as a responsible regional power but also risks worsening the plight of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. A more measured and diplomatic response is urgently needed to support minority rights without inflaming tensions further. Their actions appear more motivated by political self-interest, with the aim of leveraging communal sentiments to secure votes. They are doing little to help the Bangladeshi Hindu community and, in fact, they have no capacity to effect meaningful change on the ground. However, these relentless denunciations have caused significant harm to Bangladeshi Hindus. Such actions have fueled distrust between Muslims and Hindus, further straining the already delicate fabric of interfaith relations in Bangladesh. This atmosphere of division has created tangible challenges for Hindus in various spheres of life. For instance, I have come across numerous accounts of Hindu professionals—particularly those in leadership positions in offices and academic environments—facing resistance, disrespect, and even outright hostility from their Muslim subordinates. This toxic environment, largely exacerbated by the polarizing narratives broadcasted by Indian media, is making it increasingly difficult for Hindus to perform their duties and maintain their positions. A harmonious relationship between India and Bangladesh is essential for fostering peaceful coexistence between Hindus and Muslims, not just in Bangladesh but also in India. Responsible diplomacy and measured rhetoric are critical to building mutual trust and addressing minority issues effectively.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynz0P4yrQaDPjO	2025-01-06T15:14:37-08:00	
NATO, Ukraine, And The Looming Challenges Of Trump’s Return – Ana...	As Europe braces for President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, questions loom over its impact on the war in Ukraine and NATO’s future. Nearly three years on, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains the most significant challenge to transatlantic security since World War II. The year 2024 proved pivotal for the conflict. Russia secured minor territorial gains in Ukraine but paid a steep price. As it ramped up airstrikes on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine responded with bold moves, including an incursion into Russia’s Kursk Oblast and advancing weapons capable of hitting deep inside Russian territory. In a dramatic twist, North Korean ground forces entered the fray on Russia’s side, escalating tensions further. These developments have underscored the complexity of the war and its far-reaching consequences. With Trump soon to return to office, Europe must tackle shifting dynamics that could redefine its approach to the conflict and test NATO’s resolve in safeguarding transatlantic stability. After Ukraine’s underwhelming counteroffensive in 2023, expectations for any major breakthrough in 2024 were notably tempered. The narrative among Kyiv’s Western allies shifted to a longer-term strategy: rearming, restructuring, and training the Ukrainian military for a potential counteroffensive in 2025. However, this plan faced significant setbacks, with political gridlock in Congress that delayed critical military aid for months. By early 2024, Ukraine was grappling with dire shortages of air defense missiles, artillery shells, and basic ammunition for its front-line troops. When American aid finally arrived in March, it came just as Ukraine faced mounting pressure from small yet strategically important Russian advances, particularly in the Donetsk region. Nevertheless, bolstered by the much-needed support, Ukraine launched an audacious counteroffensive into Russia’s Kursk Oblast, which showcased Ukraine’s ability to succeed when adequately equipped. The capture of Russian territory reshaped the strategic calculus. Any future peace talks are now unlikely to freeze the front lines at their current positions. Moreover, Ukraine’s maneuver compelled Moscow to divert troops and resources to defend Kursk, alleviating pressure on other critical fronts. This operation not only signaled Kyiv’s resilience but also demonstrated the enduring importance of sustained Western support. Ukraine also faced diplomatic setbacks during NATO’s landmark 75th-anniversary summit in Washington this July. Expectations were high that the alliance would outline a definitive path for Ukraine’s membership, even as immediate accession was off the table due to Kyiv’s ongoing war with Russia. Instead, Ukraine was handed ambiguous assurances of eventual membership but without a clear roadmap, leaving Kyiv with more questions than answers. This outcome represented a missed opportunity, both for NATO and Ukraine. For Ukraine, it dashed hopes of a transformative moment in its integration into the Western security architecture. For NATO, it highlighted an internal hesitancy to adapt decisively to the evolving threats posed by Russia’s aggression. The vague promises made by NATO underscores the persistent uncertainty in Ukraine’s fight for a secure place within Europe’s defense structure. It also signals to Russia that cracks remain in the West’s resolve. Ukraine left the summit with a reaffirmation of NATO’s moral support but without the strategic guarantees it so urgently seeks. To predict Donald Trump’s strategy in Ukraine, his first-term approach to foreign policy provides useful insights, particularly his handling of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. Although he vowed to exit the nuclear deal during the 2016 campaign, Trump did not immediately follow through upon taking office. Instead, he adopted a gradual approach: an interagency review led to a phased withdrawal, which culminated with a definitive exit in May 2018, more than a year into his presidency. This methodical withdrawal was followed by the launch of a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, executed with deliberate planning despite its divisiveness. A similar pragmatism may shape Trump’s policy toward Ukraine. Although some of his prior comments have raised concerns about his stance on Russia, Trump is unlikely to pursue a course that could be interpreted as weakness. A settlement that favors Moscow would risk significant political fallout, undermining his strongman image. Any conclusion to the war that weakens Ukraine while bolstering Russia could mirror the optics of the Biden administration’s much-criticized withdrawal from Afghanistan, an outcome Trump would be keen to avoid. Whether through intensified diplomatic efforts or recalibrated military aid, Trump’s decisions will likely balance his political ambitions with America’s international credibility. Frustration is mounting among Ukrainians over delays in recent assistance and the strict limitations imposed by the White House on the use of American weapons. However, Trump’s recent exchanges with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been notably positive. Their in-person meeting in September was described as constructive, and within 24 hours of Trump’s reelection, the two leaders spoke again by phone, signaling an ongoing commitment to dialogue. Moreover, early indications from Trump’s new administration have been encouraging for Kyiv. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio are both known for their past expressions of support for Ukraine, suggesting a continuation of assistance under new leadership. As Trump seeks a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, any expectations of a swift or simple outcome are misguided. The world must brace for the likelihood that the war will remain unresolved through 2025.

Moscow–Pyongyang Partnership Could Derail Japan’s Indo-Pacific St...	By Ben Sando In November 2024, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stopped in Kyiv for a surprise meeting with his counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. Iwaya’s priority was to discuss the some 12,000 North Korean soldiers battling Ukrainian forces in the Kursk border region of Russia. This burgeoning military alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow threatens to upset the security balance in Northeast Asia and may force Tokyo to scale back its engagement with maritime issues in East Asia. For the past two decades, a new generation of political leadership in Tokyo has encouraged a pivot away from Japan’s insular, restrained defence posture towards greater engagement in defence multilateralism, led by the United States. Former prime minister Shinzo Abe signalled his resolve in 2014 by reinterpreting Japan’s pacifist constitution to allow greater leeway for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to come to the aid of an ally under attack, an act Japan’s armed forces were previously unable to perform. In 2016, Abe announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, which was geared towards curbing China’s growing influence in maritime Asia. Japan helped revitalise the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad), and has participated in naval exercises with Quad members in waters as far-flung as the Indian Ocean. In tandem with this enhanced multilateral engagement, the SDF has shifted its focus south and has invested in the defence of its southernmost islands, the Nansei Shoto, against Chinese aggression. Japan’s expansive new foreign policy has cemented it into the United States’ vision for East Asian order and endeared Tokyo to capitals throughout the Indo-Pacific. But Tokyo’s expansive regional vision has implicitly relied on a relatively predictable balance of power in Japan’s immediate vicinity, Northeast Asia. The principal impediment to peace in Northeast Asia — North Korea — has historically been deterred by the US nuclear umbrella and remained weak and impoverished due to decades of economic sanctions. While South Korea has been preoccupied with balancing North Korean military power, Japan has been able to prioritise issues beyond its main archipelago, such as China’s threats to maritime security in East and Southeast Asia. For Japanese defence planners, the North Korean threat is not as urgent as China’s expansionism. North Korea remains a frail power, but its incipient military alliance with Russia promises toboost its technological capacity, enable its independence from China — its traditional security partner — and allow it to project force beyond the Korean Peninsula. This Russian aid is already visible. Moscow has shared air defence technology with Pyongyang and has aided it in its halting efforts at a military space program. Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, predicts that Moscow will transfer nuclear submarine technology to Pyongyang. North Korea’s submarines, which presently patrol its shores in the Sea of Japan, could offer an elevated threat to Japan’s Maritime SDF if equipped with more advanced propulsion systems. Emboldened by its freedom from Beijing and replete with advanced weaponry, Pyongyang may escalate tensions with its democratic neighbours in Northeast Asia in a bid to secure diplomatic concessions. Such aggression may force Japan to re-orient from a focus on containing China to deterring North Korea. Simultaneously, the Japanese political elite and public may lose enthusiasm for the FOIP vision that commits defence and diplomatic resources beyond Japan’s main archipelago. Anxiety over North Korea’s military expansion serves the interests of China and Russia, which both oppose Japan’s support for Taiwan and Ukraine. Beijing and Moscow may opt to underwrite a policy by North Korean president Kim Jong-un to impede the expanding regional strategies of South Korea and Japan through calculated aggression. As Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party — the political force behind the FOIP vision — rules with a minority government, Japanese political elites may lose the political capital to convince the public to support engagement beyond acute Northeast Asian threats. Much of North Korea’s strategy will be defined by its interactions with US President-elect Donald Trump. But it is uncertain whether Trump can recreate the conditions needed for any kind of rapprochement with Pyongyang, especially given that North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile technology is established and Kim Jong-un has eradicated the channels for diplomatic engagement with South Korea. Tokyo should not wait for unilateral US diplomacy and should instead double down on successful defence trilateralism with Seoul and Washington. If Tokyo can learn to trust South Korea and the South Korea–US alliance with its own security, it can continue an offensive position that commits the SDF beyond Northeast Asia. There is evidence that this is possible. In October 2022, when North Korea fired a missile over Japan’s main island, it was South Korea and the United States that retaliated with a precision bombing drill near North Korea. But the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Seok Yeol has thrown the prospect of such a policy up in the air. If Seoul commits to blunting North Korea’s escalations against both South Korea and Japan, Tokyo will retain relative comfort in committing the SDF to contain China in the East and South China Seas, even as North Korea and Russia grow more menacing. Only sustained security cooperation with Seoul will allow Tokyo to preserve its FOIP vision and tackle the growing threat of Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.

China’s Paper Boat Navy: A Colossus At Risk Of Capsizing – Analys...	China's naval expansion has been nothing short of staggering. In just two decades, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has transformed into the world's largest maritime force by fleet size. This dramatic growth underpins Beijing's ambitions to project power and challenge the established dominance of the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, beneath the veneer of strength lies a navy grappling with critical vulnerabilities—untested in combat, reliant on unproven technology, and overstretched in its strategic reach. The PLAN may appear formidable on paper, but is a colossus with clay feet. Its vulnerabilities expose it as a paper tiger, raising serious doubts about its ability to sustain dominance during prolonged maritime conflict. A Force Without a Fight: The PLAN's Combat Deficiency Military power is measured in numbers and tested in the crucible of battle. By this metric, the PLAN is strikingly deficient. Since the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, China has not engaged in significant armed conflict, leaving its military leadership and personnel devoid of the experience that underpins effective combat readiness. Decades of peace have created a theoretically powerful but operationally unproven force. No matter how elaborate, Naval exercises cannot replicate war's chaos and unpredictability. For instance, the PLAN's dual-carrier drills in the South China Sea (SCS) showcase technical skills but lack the real-world pressures of adversarial engagement. In stark contrast, the U.S. Navy and its QUAD allies like the Indian Navy have amassed decades of operational experience, from combating piracy off the Horn of Africa to high-stakes missions in contested waters. Combat in modern maritime warfare demands quick decision-making, flexible tactics, and the ability to adapt under fire. The PLAN's rigid command structures and lack of real-world testing leave critical questions unanswered: Can it operate cohesively under fire? Will its untested systems perform reliably when it matters most? Quantity Over Quality: The PLAN's Technological Dilemma The rapid expansion of China's fleet has come at a cost. While the PLAN boasts over 234 warships, many vessels suffer from design flaws, reliability issues, and rushed production schedules. The result is a fleet that prioritises numbers over combat endurance. Submarine Mishaps: The 2024 sinking of a Zhou-class nuclear submarine during trials near Wuhan epitomised the risks of hasty development. Engineering flaws led to the catastrophic failure of a vessel intended to represent the cutting edge of Chinese naval power. Surface Fleet Shortcomings: The PLAN's frigates and destroyers, including those exported to Pakistan, have faced recurring technical problems. Islamabad's dissatisfaction with Chinese-built F-22P frigates highlights the gap between expectations and reality. Ageing Underwater Arsenal: China's submarine force, though growing in size, struggles to match the stealth, range, and firepower of its American counterparts. The lack of advanced vertical launch systems (VLS) on PLAN submarines further limits their operational flexibility. While Beijing's shipyards are among the most productive in the world, this industrial prowess masks underlying weaknesses. The PLAN's emphasis on rapid construction leaves little room for rigorous testing and quality control, creating a fleet that may falter under sustained conflict. Exporting Dependence: China's Arms in the IOR Beyond building ships for its own use, China has sought to extend its influence through arms exports to nations in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan have become major recipients of Chinese naval platforms, often provided at attractive financing terms or as part of broader strategic agreements. However, these deals come with significant caveats. Substandard Equipment: Myanmar's decision to return a Chinese submarine in 2022 after persistent mechanical failures reflects the low quality of these exports. Technology Lock-In: By refusing to share critical technologies, China ensures recipient nations remain dependent on Beijing for maintenance and upgrades. This dependency stifles the development of indigenous defence capabilities and fosters long-term reliance on Chinese support. Limited After-Sales Service: Recipient nations frequently cite a lack of post-delivery support, further diminishing the operational value of Chinese-made vessels. These practices undermine China's image as a reliable arms supplier. The PLAN's export model prioritises influence over partnership, leaving recipient nations questioning the value of Chinese military hardware. Strategic Overreach: The Risks of Expansion China's naval ambitions are not limited to shipbuilding; they extend to the Indo-Pacific and beyond. From constructing artificial islands in the West Philippine Sea to deploying warships in the Indian Ocean, Beijing is signalling its intent to dominate key maritime chokepoints. However, this strategy exposes significant vulnerabilities. Logistical Constraints: The PLAN lacks a robust network of overseas bases that underpins U.S. naval operations. Its reliance on the Djibouti facility and sporadic port agreements limits its ability to sustain deployments far from home. Blue-Water Aspirations: While China has made strides toward becoming a blue-water navy, much of its fleet remains optimised for littoral operations. Frigates and corvettes dominate its order of battle, offering limited utility in high-seas engagements. Aircraft Carrier Shortcomings: The PLAN's aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, face significant logistical and operational challenges. Their role in modern naval warfare remains uncertain without the advanced catapult systems and air wings that define U.S. supercarriers. China's efforts to project power risk outpacing its ability to sustain it. Overextension could leave the PLAN vulnerable to rival powers' counterstrategies, particularly in contested regions like the West Philippine Sea and the Indian Ocean. Opportunities for Counterbalance The PLAN's weaknesses present a strategic opening for its adversaries. Regional powers such as India, Japan, and Australia are uniquely positioned to counterbalance China's maritime ambitions. Enhanced interoperability, joint exercises, and leveraging advanced technologies can tilt the scales in favour of a rules-based maritime order. With its established naval tradition and strategic location, India is particularly well-placed to challenge Beijing's influence in the IOR. Its growing partnerships with like-minded nations, including the USA and Japan, highlight the potential for coordinated responses to Chinese assertiveness. A Navy on Shaky Waters China's navy may be the largest in the world, but its scale belies its fragility. From its lack of combat experience and unreliable technologies to its contentious export practices and strategic overreach, the PLAN is a force that remains unproven in both capability and resilience. As the Indo-Pacific becomes the stage for great power competition, China's maritime aspirations face mounting challenges. The PLAN's vulnerabilities offer a cautionary tale and an opportunity for regional and global actors to craft a counterbalance that ensures stability and deters aggression. Ultimately, the PLAN's rapid rise is as much a warning to its adversaries as it is to itself: strength built on shaky foundations rarely endures the test of time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3W6xRNJzdXYn	2025-01-04T17:13:01-08:00	
US-India: Diamonds Are Not Forever – OpEd	The US state department disclosed on Thursday in an accounting of gifts received from foreign leaders during 2023 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s was the 'priciest' gift that President Biden received, rather, his wife Jill Biden received — a diamond valued at $20,000 (over Rs. 17 lakh.) To an observer of the US political culture, it would invoke the analogy of a Middle Eastern sheikh from the Gulf region kow-towing to curry favours from the White House. Indeed, troubling questions do arise. Touched to the quick, Delhi reacted immediately to put the record straight — that it was an artificial lab-grown diamond with a cost price between Rs. 15000-25000, which would put the value of the gift between Rs. 1.1-1.9 lakh only. What Delhi didn’t say, or more likely its bureaucrats didn’t know, is that while real diamond has no limits on its shelf life, a lab-grown diamond may look the same, but has zero resale value. Suffice to say, the brilliance of the relationship may be gone, but the stone won’t lose its lustre and doesn’t get worn out with time. Delhi’s clumsy clarification, unattributed of course, makes things worse. Actually, none of the three famous people looks good in this controversy. It makes Jill Biden who apparently took the gift seriously and retained it for official use, somewhat foolish. A lavish edition of Mahabharata, the great epic that tells a millennia-old tale about the futility of war would have probably made a more appropriate gift from Modi to Biden who poked his nose into a fratricidal strife in distant Eurasia, undermined a nascent peace treaty between two brothers, and coaxed the impetuous kid brother to instead go into a futile proxy war that ultimately caused the death of hundreds of thousands of his subjects and destroyed his kingdom. Biden is still unrepentant. Earlier this week, columns of American military vehicles loaded with weaponry were crossing border from Iraq into Syria in anticipation of some war in the making just 4 years after the old one ended. However, the good part is that the diamond controversy is emblematic of the matrix of US-Indian relationship beneath the rhetoric. Some sixteen months after gifting the diamond, BJP accused the Biden administration of conspiring to overthrow Modi government. Which means that the estimation of Jill Biden being a ‘silvery influencer’ in the White House was a wrong notion. The Biden administration is no longer believing that in Modi government it has a potential ally to curb China’s rise as superpower that would spell doom for the 5-century old Western hegemony in the world order. The Biden Team belatedly realised that Delhi was not only boosting the ties with Russia but also had a master plan to engage with China bilaterally and work out the guard rails of co-habitation as immediate neighbours. The common refrain is that constraints in India’s development path forced the government, under pressure from the industry and business, to ease the tensions with China to attract investments and boost trade. But that is not the whole story. Chinese commentaries are stressing that the two countries have a higher destiny that is easier to realise if they cooperate rather than undercut each other. There is much truth in this, as the colonial history would testify. At any rate, the defining moment in the US-Indian relationship came with the G20 Summit, which Modi hosted in the third quarter of 2023, when Biden came to Delhi and in tandem with his Canadian counterpart Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took up with Modi the report of the Five Eyes (US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand) that India was involved in trans-national crimes in North America. The whiplash, albeit administered in private, came as a bolt from the blue when Indian diplomacy was riding high — oil trade with Russia going hand in hand with the 'consequential' partnership with the US. The entire delusional foreign-policy matrix began unravelling. And a cat-and-mouse game began, culminating in the Biden administration installing a hostile regime in Bangladesh. It was a stark reminder that diamonds are not forever. Indeed, there are heartrending tales in literature of young love and passion turning into betrayals, vendetta, betrayals, revenge and marginalisation, and an entire world tumbling down around diamonds. Fortunately, the sordid chapter is ending as the Trump presidency begins on Jan. 20. The big question is what conclusion Trump would have drawn by now. Perhaps, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is doing the right thing by reminding the Trump Team tirelessly that their boss holds the patent for Quad. But, a rearguard course correction is already being advocated in the US intellectual discourses. The prestigious DC-based Stimson Centre addressed two policy briefs on the Indo-Pacific in quick succession to the new administration no sooner than Trump’s election victory was in the cards on November 5: Revive the South Asia Strategy by Elizabeth Threlkeld • Elizabeth Zazycki dated November 26, 2024, which argues that 'The next administration should craft a standalone South Asia strategy to address regional complexities while aligning with Indo-Pacific priorities', and, Think Small to Win Big in the Indo-Pacific by Kelly A. Grieco • Evan Cooper dated November 21, 2024, which argues that 'The next administration should lean into smaller, more flexible alignments and issue-based coalitions and lead more with economics and diplomacy rather than military and security policies.' Succinctly put, the thesis advanced by these policy wonks is, paradoxically, what Jaishankar also has been espousing — multi-alignment as a foreign-policy doctrine. There is a saying that our dreams ought to be what define our individuality. As the English poet and philosopher William Blake put it succinctly, ‘No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings’. But the Modi Government’s diplomacy leaps out of Kautilya’s Arthashastra, the ancient Indian Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, politics, economic policy and military strategy which overlooks that this is an era of Internet and Artificial Intelligence. Delusional mantras still continue — ‘There is a bipartisan consensus in America for relations with India; so-and-so in Trump Team has been in the India Caucasus; we got along fine with Trump, etc.’ From available indications, however, Trump 2.0 can be radically different. Trump has no more elections to fight and his soaring ambition, which is no secret, will be to carve out a legacy that outshines by far all his mediocre predecessors. Trump’s turnaround on H-1B visa debateshows that he can take tough decisions and there are no holy cows in his domain. Then, there is the X factor, the known unknown, navigating his compass. By the way, I go along entirely with the incisive opinion of Mick Mulvaney, who served as Mr. Trump’s second chief of staff, when he told the Times, 'What makes (Elon) Musk such a valuable adviser is that he has enough money — and enough other things to do — that he is uniquely situated to be the bearer of honest news. More than perhaps anybody else on the planet, he doesn’t need the job.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3dHO0TwJO-yn	2025-01-04T17:11:28-08:00	
India Can Learn From Argentina’s Economic Turnaround – OpEd	By Mudit Jain Argentinean President Javier Milei is a self-described anarcho-capitalist, which means he supports replacing the state with free markets and private entities. He can also be described as a minarchist, supporting a 'night watchman' state whose only function is to preserve its citizens’ safety and property rights. In simple words, for Milei, citizens should have the freedom and responsibility to support themselves through their own enterprise, both economic and social, with the state providing only military, police and law courts. As soon as he entered office in December 2023, Milei implemented shock treatment — much needed after years of hyperinflation and rampant taxing and spending led to low investment and capital flight. Let’s look at what he has achieved in one year since then. Under Milei, annualized inflation — which was over 200% a year ago — has come down to 166%. Because falling prices have a cascading effect, this trend will accelerate in the new year. BBVA Research projects that it will reach just 35% in 2025. Milei loosened tenancy laws, leading to an increase in the housing supply and drastically reducing rents. In February, Milei oversaw Argentina’s first monthly budget surplus in 12 years, a feat that he would go on to repeat throughout 2024, substantially decreasing the country’s default risk. The new president has achieved all this through drastic cuts in government spending and regulation, allowing the markets to perform the basic function of price discovery based on supply and demand. He abolished 13 ministries, slashed 30,000 government jobs and limited both the size and powers of the tax department. The results have been magnificent. There are still challenges of poverty reduction and unemployment but these are legacy issues and will take time to improve. With the current numbers, Argentineans are finally starting to feel some hope. India can learn from Argentina Could such policies improve the economy of India? After India’s independence in 1947, industrialization took off sharply under a mixed economy model. Rapid growth continued until faulty policies of excessive state control under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1966–1977 and 1980–1984) led to stagnation. In 1970, the per capita income of India, South Korea and China was around $270. In 2022, nearly 50 years later, that number was about $2,700 for India, compared to over $10,000 in China and over $30,000 in South Korea. Even Bangladesh has exceeded India in per capita, and India is now one of the poorest countries in Asia. Sure, India can technically claim to be the fifth largest economy in the world, with a fast growth rate of 7%, but the reality is starkly different the numbers are normalized on a per capita basis. Besides, with just as much veracity, India could call itself the world leader in the number of people living in poverty, in people suffering from blindness and in malnourished people. Corruption is endemic, government services at all levels are abysmal, trade deficits are huge, jobs are unavailable, and millions continue to migrate overseas both legally and illegally. The feudal mentality of the state continues as it did in colonial times; the impulse of policymakers is to make the state even bigger and the citizens even less empowered. One can hardly imagine how this would lead to improvement. Instead, we should take a cue from Milei’s philosophy of minimal state intervention. Less government spending would mean less incentive for corruption and less inflation. At the same time, deregulation would mean empowered, productive citizens enabled to create their own enterprises, raising GDP and lowering unemployment. Indians are natural entrepreneurs, after all; unleashing their latent energies would create a huge domestic market that would facilitate unlimited growth. It would be the golden age of India. Countries like China and Singapore have shown that state control can indeed grow the economy — if it is done responsibly and lawfully. Sadly, India has developed the worst habits of command economies without the benefits. The Indian administrative state is too corrupt to pull off a feat like China or Singapore. We are more like Argentina, and what worked there can work here too. India could be the poster nation of this new philosophy of placing the common citizen on top.

World War I: The Great Banker Bailout – OpEd	By Joshua Mawhorter 'Nobody could hate war more than I do.'—J. P. Morgan, Senate Munitions Committee 'We see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run with their two feet cut off, they stagger on their splintered stumps into the next shell-hole; a lance-corporal crawls a mile and a half on his hands dragging his smashed knee after him; another goes to the dressing station and over his clasped hands bulge his intestines; we see men without mouths, without jaws, without faces; we find one man who has held the artery of his arm in his teeth for two hours in order not to bleed to death. The sun goes down, night comes, the shells whine, life is at an end.'—All Quiet on the Western Front It is estimated that the disaster of World War I claimed some 15-22 million lives. This does not even take into account the injuries, property destruction, and other post-war consequences. The above quote from the well-known novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, captures a horrific snapshot of World War I. While people often flippantly talk about war—especially from within the borders of a wealthy international hegemon like the United States—people ought to read such descriptions and soberly weigh the costs and benefits of going to war. Given the description of the destruction above, plus the fact that Woodrow Wilson ran on the slogan, 'He kept us out of war,' Americans probably would have resented the fact that the late entry of the United States in World War I served, at least in large part, to bail out American bankers. Such a statement as, 'We are fighting this war on behalf of the bankers,' was, at one time, enough to land an American populist presidential candidate—Eugene V. Debs—in prison under the Espionage Act and Sedition Acts in 1918. However, following the war, Woodrow Wilson admitted, Why, my fellow-citizens, is there any man here, or any woman—let me say, is there any child here, who does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry? . . . This war, in its inception, was a commercial and industrial war. It was not a political war. Yet, in the above quote, Wilson only admitted that this was the case for the commercial powers of Germany and its rivals, but he did not acknowledge the rescue that the US performed for American bankers in the war, who had been funding the Allied cause and providing loans to the Allied powers. The newly-printed money for these loans, supplied to Allied European powers, was quickly funneled back to certain industries in the United States who provided war materials. In the middle were the Fed-connected bankers. No less an historian than the Oxford don, Niall Ferguson—who we might expect to act as a 'court' historian who crafts evidence only to make a positive case for the actions of the state—in his Pity of War (p. 329), said, 'By the beginning of 1917, J. P. Morgan was so committed to Britain...it was Morgan as much as Britain which was bailed out in 1917.' He was right. World War I provided a new opportunity to utilize the newly-created powers of central banking through the Federal Reserve system. The Federal Reserve—doubling the money supply since its inception in 1914—would finance US entry into World War I. This probably could not or would not have been supported by the American people through direct taxation. World War I simultaneously strengthened the power and centralization of the Fed, the federal government, and the closely-connected banker-industrial class. Wall Street banks and Morgan were greatly benefited by the war as financier and mart for war materials for the Allies. How did this process work? The war heavily indebted England and France. When the merchant banks and even the central banks of those countries hit limits, the political elites of England and France turned to the US and the House of Morgan. Most of the money loaned out by the US was quickly funneled back to the US to purchase war materials from select US companies. Acting both as banker and purchase agent, J. P. Morgan would loan the money to the Allies, quickly receive it back in order to direct it to US companies, receiving a commission from each transaction in both directions. Many of the companies receiving these production contracts were often owned by Morgan holding companies or were at least within 'his orbit of bank control.' When it seemed that the Axis powers might succeed in the war as is ground toward a stalemate, these financial interests agitated for American entry into the war to extricate them from a major financial loss and open new vistas of profit. Woodrow Wilson also saw US financial control over the other Allies as essential to influencing France and England into Wilson’s view of post-war peace and world order. The fortunes of the House of Morgan had actually been declining since about 1900, but the outbreak of the war provided opportunity for Morgan, the Fed, the Fed-connected banks, and the select companies which would receive war contracts. Rothbard said, 'At the moment of great financial danger for the Morgans, the advent of World War I came as a godsend.' Walter Hines Page—trustee of the Rockefeller General Education Board, editor of several Wall Street publications, and so pro-British that he often appeared to others to be a British agent—is described in Lundberg’s America’s 60 Families (1937), 'He did everything he could to have the United States rake England’s chestnuts out of the fire.' Therefore, 'There was every reason, of course, for Wall Street to regard the war as beneficent.' While there is absolutely nothing wrong with voluntary trade and profit on a free market, as these are essential features of a thriving civilization, we should remind ourselves that there are two ways to reap economic growth—engaging in the production-and-exchange process or force and fraud to expropriate the production of others. Reaping wealth by the political means—war, force, coercion, cronyism—should not be considered as within the same category of market profits. While there were many well-earned entrepreneurial fortunes during this era, many fortunes were made through the war—wealth transferred from the American people to these institutions via the Fed and government. Lundberg, again, records that, in 1892, the number of fortunes amounting to a million dollars or more was only 4,047. In 1914, the millionaire or higher fortunes amounted to 7,509, but by the next year—largely because of the war profits—there were 10,450. The Internal Revenue Bureau recorded that the number grew to 11,800 in 1917. The newly-inflated money that the US government 'sent' to Europe quickly returned to the US bankers and companies with war contracts. Lundberg writes, Europe got none of the money lent by the Treasury; it received only materials of war. The owners of American industries got the money. They employed most of it to expand the industrial equipment of the nation and to increase the size of their fortunes and the extent of their power. In short, the war debt created by the American government amounted simply to money transferred from the people of the country to the richest families, who owned the banks and industries. Wartime profits…were enormous. The money that the US government—aided and abetted by the Fed and banking system—gave to the Allies was basically' [transferred] into the hands of the wealthiest families.' General Smedley Butler—retired major general, two-time Medal of Honor recipient, and author of War is a Racket—wrote in 1935, In the World War a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their income tax returns no one knows. (emphasis added) The US got involved in the war, quickly ensuring an Allied victory. Rather than a stalemate of exhausted powers, American entry into the war prevented a negotiated peace, drove the Allies toward an unconditional surrender policy toward Germany, German dismemberment, war guilt and reparations requirements laid totally on Germany, etc. The disruption of WWI not only cost lives and property, but enabled the rise of fascism, Nazism, and Communism. Ignoring the other disastrous consequences of WWI, at least the men who fought and died, the civilians who died, their families, the injured, those who had their property and livelihoods destroyed, those who would suffer under the later brutal 20th-century regimes, and those who held their arteries together with their teeth, could rest assured that US entry and an Allied victory at least saved US bankers and funneled war profits to politically-connected US businesses.

Not Even Beautiful Hawaii Is Immune To ‘Tax Flight’ – OpEd	By Keli‘i Akina If you’ve ever been to Hawaii, you might wonder why anyone would leave the state. Its beauty and fair weather are world-renowned, and it’s not for nothing that the place has often been called the 'Paradise of the Pacific.' The reality, however, is that the Aloha State’s population has been decreasing every year since 2016, and most observers believe it’s because of the state’s high cost of living, of which taxes are a significant part. Indeed, the concept of 'tax flight' has been in the news a lot in recent years. Tax flight is when the residents of a state with high taxes leave to go live in a state where the tax burden is lower. The extent to which tax rates directly influence migration patterns is a matter of debate. But the data do demonstrate that people tend to leave higher-tax states in favor of states with lower taxes. For fleeing Hawaii residents, a popular destination is Las Vegas, Nevada, which has no state income tax and now is often called 'Hawaii’s Ninth Island,' due to its high number of former Hawaii residents. Other high-tax states which have experienced consistent population loss include California, New York, and Illinois. Conversely, low-tax states such as Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada have all seen their populations grow. Moreover, jurisdictions that don’t act to reduce their tax flight will likely soon be looking at more of it. That’s because as residents leave, a state or county’s tax burden falls on ever-smaller numbers of taxpayers, which in turn will mean tax increases for those who stay behind, which further incentivizes people to leave, and so on. It’s easy to see how this can lead to a state, county, or city budget crisis, especially for jurisdictions that have racked up large pension liabilities or other long-term debt. But there is something states can do to stop the bleeding, though it might be painful to those who aren’t used to it: Cut taxes and rein in spending. In Hawaii, lawmakers have finally come to terms with this idea. Going into 2024, Hawaii families making the median income paid the second highest income taxes in the country, after Oregon, a state with no sales tax. But during the state’s 2024 legislative session, the governor and legislature unanimously enacted the largest personal income tax cut in state history. By the time the 2024 cuts take full effect in 2031, the average Hawaii family making the median income will have seen its taxes reduced by more than 70 percent and cumulatively saved more than $19,000, or about $7.6 billion statewide. As Hawaii prepares for its next legislative session, starting this month, the governor has pledged to secure the cuts by reducing spending and balancing the budget. In fact, his proposed budget for fiscal 2026 is actually 1.8 percent lower than the current fiscal year’s budget. Time will tell whether local lawmakers ruin the rosy outlook by getting back on the tax-and-spend bandwagon. And, of course, it would be naive to expect that Hawaii’s historic tax reduction will solve all of its population-loss problems overnight. Significant reforms are still needed to bring down the state’s housing costs; healthcare regulations continue to add to Hawaii’s high medical costs and limit access; occupational licensing severely limits job opportunities; and the federal Jones Act continues to add to the cost of all goods imported by ship from the US mainland. Still, the tax cuts signed into law earlier this year are a promising start, and they demonstrate an understanding of a very simple principle: If you want people to stay in your state, then you need to reverse the economic policies that are inducing them to leave.

New Censor Replacing Old Censor At Meta – OpEd	Some people are optimistic that the promotion of Joel Kaplan to be Meta’s president of global affairs heralds the end of, or at least a big reduction in, censorship at Meta’s social media sites of Facebook and Instagram. This optimism springs from the fact that Kaplan leans Republican in the notoriously Democratic leaning company, and even was White House deputy chief of staff for policy in the Republican George W. Bush administration. Yet, there is plenty of reason for skepticism. Support for free speech has become a rallying cry for many Republicans in response to censorship efforts by Meta, other companies, and governments over the last few years. However, many Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals still are keen on censoring people, though sometimes for different reasons than are many Democratic or Democratic-leaning individuals. Consider efforts by Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott a good example, to shut down very broadly defined 'antisemitic' communication. Also, Kaplan is not a hire from the outside. He joined Meta 13 years ago as vice president of United States public policy. Since 2014 he has been the company’s vice president of global affairs. In this job, Kaplan has worked with Nick Clegg — the person Kaplan will succeed. Are we to believe Kaplan has spent all this time itching to tear down the censorship implemented, with his help, by this boss? They have had some differences of opinion regarding Meta’s censorship, but let’s wait and see what change comes. Clegg, in a Thursday Facebook post, praised profusely Kaplan ascending to Clegg’s job, stating: And no one could pick up from where I’ve left off with greater skill and integrity than my deputy, Joel Kaplan. I am simply thrilled that Joel will now become Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer. Hmmm. That is not suggesting a big change in policy on censorship is on the way. Reporter Glenn Greenwald provided in a Friday Twitter post a fact that challenges the optimism that Kaplan’s promotion signals the end of, or even a large reduction in, censorship by Meta. Greenwald wrote, using 'FB' to refer to Facebook: 'Kaplan was the senior FB official who worked directly with the Israeli Government to ensure that Israel’s demands for censorship were honored.' Backing up his claim, Greenwald linked in his Twitter post a September 12, 2016 The Times of Israel article that detailed Facebook’s, at the behest of the Israel government, then substantial and expanding clamping down on communication. This was years before the company’s name change to Meta. The article identifies Kaplan as a Facebook employee who took part in a high-level meeting to carry out the arrangement with the Israel government: Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan met Monday morning with senior Facebook officials in an effort to jointly stem online incitement that Israel claims leads to terror activities. The Facebook officials included Joel Kaplan, vice president of Global Public Policy and a former deputy chief of staff for policy at the White House, and Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of product policy and counterterrorism. And the censorship by Facebook at the Israel government’s request was ongoing before the meeting. Noted in the article: In a speech at a conference in Herzliya, also on Monday, Shaked said that Facebook has already started removing 95 percent of content Israel has requested it to remove, while YouTube has complied with Israel’s requests 80 percent of the time, the Israeli news website Ynet reported. But, that was just the start. The Israel government wanted even more censorship from Facebook. From the article: 'In the meeting Israel requested that Facebook be more proactive in removing materials that could be seen as incitement to terror and the joint teams will study how to work together to serve the interests of both parties, a person familiar with the matter said.' This man is the hope for stopping censorship? Hoping is fine, but it is often important to keep your feet firmly on the ground as well.

Japan: Religious Groups, Activists Urge Govt To Review Laws On Re...	(UCA News) -- Faith leaders, academics, and rights activists have expressed concern over legislation and restrictions in Japan against religious entities following former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s assassination, which they warn could threaten 'all religions.' Some 31 global leaders in the field of freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) issued a joint statement on Dec 31 titled 'A Religious Liberty Crisis in Japan,' Bitter Winter reported. 'Various forces are using this [Abe’s] assassination to begin dismantling key human rights of religious believers in the democratic nation of Japan,' the statement said. 'We believe that the strong emotions generated by the Abe assassination, understandable though they may be, should not lead to legislation, administrative, or legal actions that violate human rights in Japan,' the signatories said. 'A democracy should not arbitrarily harm the right of any religion to operate freely, collect donations, and transmit its faith and moral values to the next generation,' they added. Tetsuya Yamagami shot and killed Abe on July 8, 2022, over his ties to the Unification Church. Yamagami said his family faced economic hardship due to hefty donations made by his mother to the church, which was estimated to be around US$1 million. The signatories alleged that the donations from the Yamagami family were returned in 2009 as part of a mutually agreed settlement, which is 'less mentioned in the media.' They also pointed out that Tetsuya was never a member of the Unification Church and 'had in fact signed a statement accepting the settlement.' Following Abe’s assassination, there was a 'sudden resurgence of old and largely politically motivated campaigns against the Unification Church,' the statement said. 'These efforts, relying on the populist but unscientific term ‘cult’ also targeted other groups, including religions such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses,' they said. The signatories said that the sale of articles at exorbitant prices — called 'Spiritual Sales — was carried out by a company whose members were part of the Unification Church and had ceased by the time of Abe’s assassination. The signatories also said that only the negative claims of second-generation Unification Church members were heard, who alleged that they 'were not provided with good educational opportunities,' by the media and politicians. The media and politicians were 'ignoring the thousands who grew up happily in new religious movements and gladly remained there,' Bitter Winter said citing the statement. The signatories said three legal measures that threaten all religions, 'not the [Unification Church] alone, and not new religious movements alone,' were enacted in Japan. The first measure includes provisions for the dissolution of a religious corporation, which the signatories said was revised to enable the disbanding of religious groups if they 'lost some civil cases.' The previous version of the law was interpreted to permit dissolution only if religious corporations were found guilty of major crimes. 'If this minimalist basis for dissolution is upheld by the courts, then no religion will be safe from dissolution,' the signatories warned. Secondly, the signatories said that new provisions were introduced limiting the possibility for 'controversial' organizations to solicit donations and made it easier for those who had donated to such movements, or their heirs and relatives, to get their money back. Thirdly, the signatories expressed concern about guidelines in the form of questions and answers on the deprivation of second-generation members of 'controversial' religious movements and the so-called 'religious abuse of children.' The signatories alleged that, 'several provisions of the guidelines have nothing to do with the Unification Church and target the Jehovah’s Witnesses and other conservative Christian groups.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3VjgQyIZ2Mny	2025-01-04T16:49:37-08:00	
2025, Iran Is Back In US Crosshairs For Regime Change – OpEd	The signs are that Iran is going to face intensified hostility from the U.S. over the next year for regime change. The sudden fall of Syria and the isolation of Hezbollah in Lebanon – Iran’s regional allies – have made Tehran look vulnerable. Anti-Iran hawks in the U.S. are cock-a-hoop about the prospect of regime change in Tehran. The recent death of Jimmy Carter at the age of 100 puts in perspective how great a prize the Islamic Republic represents for Washington’s imperial desires. Carter was disparaged as the American president who lost Iran in 1979 as a crucial client state for U.S. power in the Middle East. For over four decades, American imperialist power has sought to topple the Islamic Republic and return the Persian nation to the U.S. global fold. Though, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken lamented last month, American 'regime change experiments' in Iran have been a failure. Now, however, there is renewed enthusiasm in Washington for the Persian prize. The lust for regime change in Tehran has peaked with the dramatic fall of President al-Assad in Syria. American lawmakers and Iranian exiles are publicly calling for the new Trump administration to get back to its maximum pressure campaign on Tehran because they believe there is 'a perfect moment' for regime change. During Donald Trump’s first White House (2017-2021), he revoked the Iranian nuclear deal of the Obama administration and ramped up economic sanctions in what was referred to as a policy of 'maximum pressure.' A growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats are urging the United States to seize the opportunity of a perceived weakened Iran to overthrow the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. At a recent forum in Washington, it was reported that speaker after speaker brayed for regime change in Tehran. For years, such a desire had been dulled with U.S. failure and the formidableness of the Islamic Republic. 'We have an obligation to stand together with allies in making sure this regime’s suppression will come to an end,' said Democratic Senator Cory Booker. 'Iran is projecting only weakness,' declared Jeanne Shaheen, another Democratic Senator. Republican Senator Ted Cruz sounded vindicated over his long-time anti-Iran stance: 'I have, for a long time, been willing to call quite unequivocally for regime change in Iran… The ayatollah will fall, the mullahs will fall, and we will see free and democratic elections in Iran. Change is coming, and it’s coming very soon.' James Jones, a former White House national security adviser, said: 'The tectonic shift in the Syrian government… should mean to the people of Iran that change is in fact possible in the Middle East.' The Islamic Revolution in 1979 deposed Shah Pahlavi, an ardent American client. The revolution and the hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran was a horrible blow to Washington’s global image. The Shah had been brought to power by the U.S.-British coup in 1953 and for 26 years, the dictatorial monarch ruled with an iron fist as a loyal and massive buyer of American weaponry and supplier of oil profits. The overthrow of the Shah put Iran in the crosshairs for regime change. The Americans prompted the Iraq-Iran War between 1980 and 1988. The new Islamic rulers were subjected to crippling economic sanctions, which were eased in 2015 with the signing of the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration. By then, the U.S. was trying a softer policy of regime change and limited engagement. Trump abandoned that policy, reverting to a more hostile one. Trump ordered the assassination of Iran’s top military commander Major General Qassem Soleimani on January 3, 2020. Trump can be expected to make Iran his foreign policy goal during the first year of his second administration beginning on January 20. There is a giddy sense that the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen has fatally weakened the Islamic Republic. During his election campaign, Trump endorsed Israeli plans to attack Iran’s nuclear sites militarily. Trump will be tempted that Iran could be an early success for his political legacy. To overthrow the Iranian government and replace it with a pro-U.S. regime would be the prize of the century for the American imperial ego. There is also the imperative of geo-strategy. Russia, China and Iran have emerged as an important alternative geopolitical axis that is perceived as a threat to U.S. global power and the American dollar hegemony. Iran appears to be the weakest link among the opposing bloc, known as the BRICS. Trump seems to be prioritizing making a peace settlement in Ukraine with Russia. Part of that calculation is incentivized by freeing up U.S. resources to target Iran. Last year, the imperialist Atlantic Council published an article headlined: 'The United States needs a new Iran policy – and it involves regime change, but not the traditional kind'. The Atlantic Council article advocated intensified economic and political pressure on Iran and internal destabilization by the covert backing of Iranian opposition groups. We can expect a turbo-charged color revolution in Iran, with Western media amplifying public protests against the authorities. Also recommended by the Atlantic Council: 'Propaganda efforts to drive a wedge between Russia and Iran, as well as undermine its support by the rank-and-file within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and military, would also help weaken the regime.' The year ahead is shaping up for a mammoth effort by the U.S. to target Iran. Suddenly, the U.S. imperial regime-change machine has found the driving seat again after years of sputtering failure in Iran and Syria. The victory of CIA proxies in Syria to finally overthrow Assad is producing a rush to do the same in Iran. That prize seemed out of reach for too long. A new American president and a new Middle East configuration have brought Iran back into the crosshairs for regime change with an intoxicating vengeance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3Q9MbLqhkHG4	2025-01-04T16:44:35-08:00	
Poland’s EU Presidency: Thinking In Polish – Analysis	By Shairee Malhotra On 1 January 2025, Poland assumed the presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). The EU’s rotation system, which changes presidencies every six months, marks the beginning of a new trio of presidencies led by Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus. Poland will preside over the presidency until 31 June, during which it will drive the EU’s political agenda while factoring in its own national interests. After Hungary’s controversial tenure, where top EU officials boycotted meetings in Budapest, the Polish presidency is expected to be markedly different. Hungary was the first country to have an EU presidency while being under EU sanctions over rule of law tensions. Moreover, much to the EU’s chagrin, Hungary’s eurosceptic Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, undertook unilateral 'peace missions' to Moscow and Kyiv during his EU presidency. On the other hand, the victory of the pro-European Donald Tusk in Poland’s 2023 parliamentary elections, over the nationalist and eurosceptic Law and Justice party (PiS) that ruled Poland for eight years, marked Warsaw’s return to the European mainstream, already bolstered by its leading role in Europe’s response to Russian aggression. Tusk’s experience, based on his tenures as the former head of the EU Council from 2014–2019 and as the Prime Minister during Poland’s first EU presidency in 2011, ensures the EU is in sound hands during Poland’s presidency. Poland takes charge at a critical juncture for Europe—the Russia-Ukraine war is entering its fourth year, and on the other side of the Atlantic, the uncertainties accompanying Trump 2.0 loom large. Meanwhile, the incoming European Commission’s new legislative framework will soon emerge. Polish priorities Tusk emphasised the EU’s need to 'think in Polish', making it capable 'not only of survival but also of a political offensive.' The overarching theme and motto for the Polish presidency is 'Security, Europe!' with security organised into seven dimensions: external security, internal security, energy security, economic security, food security, health security and information security. This encompasses a comprehensive approach to security that goes well beyond the military domain. External security dimensions include continued Ukraine support, as well as scaling up domestic defence production to expand Europe’s defence industry. This includes mobilising greater European defence spending, which reached a record 279 billion euros in 2023—a 10-percent increase from 2022—but it also requires an additional 500 billion euros over the next decade, according to Mario Draghi’s report on competitiveness. A key priority is strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) eastern flank through defence infrastructure initiatives like the East Shield, which Poland wants the EU and its member states to co-finance. Initiatives such as the to finance the EU’s military-industrial complex over the 2025-2027 period, fall short of funding requirements, and Poland advocates the use of common euro bondstowards defence. External security also includes tackling challenges at the EU’s external borders and hybrid threats such as the 'instrumentalisation of migration'. As Europe braces for Trump’s planned tariffs on European imports, and as economic ties with its other main trading partner, China, remain strained, economic security, which includes deepening the single market and eliminating barriers to cross-border trade, is highlighted as a key priority. With regard to food security, the Polish programme emphasises 'a competitive and resilient European agriculture'. In this context, a strong Common Agricultural Policy to support farmers and strengthen their position in value chains, and the development of rural areas is highlighted. Poland also intends to address challenges arising from future EU enlargement in this sector. The programme reiterates the need to boost energy security through diversification and a further reduction in dependency on Russian sources. It also necessitates reduced dependence on imported technologies, components, and critical raw materials, while decreasing costs for European citizens and businesses. Poland advocates for a more flexible energy-climate policy, focusing on 'rewards and incentives [rather than] penalties and obligations'. Information security involves enhancing cybersecurity while also battling disinformation and information manipulation. In reference to health security, Poland focuses on addressing mental health challenges, empowering the digital transformation of healthcare, and strengthening European pharmaceutical manufacturing. The programme also emphasises strengthening transatlantic ties, and among EU member states, Poland is well-equipped to do so. Trump’s contempt for NATO and his pledge to end the war in 24 hours on terms likely to favour Russia are concerns for Warsaw. Still, Poland, despite being amongst the staunchest supporters of Ukraine, is on the same page as Trump when it comes to the need for increased European defence spending, leading by example. Poland currently spends 4 percent of its GDP (gross domestic product) on defence—much higher than the 2 percent NATO threshold—and it intends to raise this to 4.7 percent in 2025. Moreover, 35 percent of the Polish defence budget is committed to buying American weapons, thus cementing Warsaw’s status amongst the top five importers of American military equipment, thereby fulfilling Trump’s push towards 'buying American'. In other priorities, Poland will encourage the EU to impose further sanctions on Russia, with the 16thsanctions package expected to be adopted in February 2025. It will also focus on accelerating EU enlargement since the EU decision in December 2023 to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova. Can Poland deliver? One caveat is the Polish presidential election, which is scheduled for May 2025, a decisive vote for the country’s future presented as a choice between the hard-right and centre-right. This may pose distractions, especially as several EU initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, and the grain imports agreement with Ukraine, are not favoured by Polish voters. Yet, member states such as France and Spain have conducted national elections during their EU presidencies, proving that domestic political pressures and EU ambitions can be balanced. Russia’s war against Ukraine vindicated Poland’s warnings about Russian aggression and Western European dependencies, heightening Polish credibility. In the words of the Polish Minister for EU Affairs, Adam Szłapka, Poland is now 'an expert for the greatest challenges' confronting the West. For Poland, the presidency is an added opportunity to fortify its role as a major European power centre, given the eastward shift in Europe’s centre of gravity, reinforced by political turmoil in the traditional hubs of Paris and Berlin. Moreover, Tusk’s return to power in Poland also sparked a revival of the Weimar Triangle. On the other hand, Poland’s participation in the Nordic-Baltic 8 (NB8) meeting in November 2024 reflects its increasingly close ties with the Nordic and Baltic nations that share its security concerns regarding Russia. Poland will have to navigate a challenging terrain, but it is well-positioned to take over the EU presidency, bringing to the table strategic foresight, action-driven leadership, and an ability to unite member states.

Musk Projects His Hard-Right Influence In Europe	(EurActiv) -- He demanded new elections in Britain, promoted Germany's far-right, blasted the European Commission -- and that's just the start. Elon Musk is pushing the hard right in Europe, where progressives are grappling with how, or even whether, to contain him. The interventions by the world's wealthiest man -- who also owns one of the planet's largest megaphones, the social media platform X -- have already seen him secure unprecedented influence thanks to his proximity to US President-elect Donald Trump. Now the ever-more powerful Tesla and SpaceX chief is turning his gaze on Europe, where many governments are already grappling with the rise of populism and the far-right. '(Keir) Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,' the multi-billionaire posted recently. He was referring to the British prime minister's time as chief state prosecutor in England and Wales, which coincided with a child grooming scandal -- posting about it repeatedly on Friday. Musk has also called for the release from prison of Tommy Robinson, an extremist agitator, and boosted the fringe anti-immigration Reform UK party, whose leader Nigel Farage he met with recently. On Friday, he shared a message from former prime minister Liz Truss calling for an end to state BBC funding. As in the United States, Musk is increasingly popular with young British men, according to the Savanta polling institute. For them, 'the lines between the perceptions of success and wealth are increasingly blurred with politics,' Chris Hopkins, Savanta's political research director, told AFP on Friday. Downing Street has so far refrained from engaging with Musk's comments, other than the odd light rebuke and stressing that it 'looks forward' to working with Trump's administration. The response Friday by a senior British government minister to Musk's latest attacks over the exploitation scandal highlighted the delicacy of leaders' high-wire act. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV News that Musk's comments were 'misjudged and certainly misinformed.' But, he swiftly added, 'we're willing to work with Elon Musk, who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries to tackle this serious issue.' 'As 2025 begins, Musk is no longer a jaundiced commentator on British politics but a power player within it,' political commentator Patrick Maguire wrote in The Times on Friday. The 'government needs to figure out how to deal with Elon Musk and his interventions, because this is not sustainable,' posted Sky News political reporter Ben Bloch on X Friday, as Musk called yet again for new elections. 'Dictator' Britain is not Musk's only target in Europe. He met Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a leading figure on the radical right, when the latter visited Trump in Florida last month. The businessman has also been accused of interference by the German government for his strong support of the far-right AfD party ahead of parliamentary elections. On 9 January, he will host a conversation with the party leader, Alice Weidel, on X. The 53-year-old entrepreneur also branded as 'dictator' judges who recently annulled Romania's presidential election amid suspicions of Russian interference. Musk is also an enthusiastic supporter of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the country's most right-wing leader since 1945, who calls him a 'genius.' Politics and business Musk's political initiatives are intimately linked to his economic interests, experts suggest. For Musk and Trump, 'democracy, debate, disagreement, state welfare systems all get in the way of business,' said Ilan Kapoor, a professor at Toronto's York University known for his critical research on neo-liberalism. 'This is why they look favorably towards more authoritarian forms of government, which they think can function more efficiently, by eliminating political opposition and cutting down the role of government (although the contradiction is that they need a lot of state intervention when it comes to their 'law and order' agenda).' Musk also criticized the European Commission, calling the functioning of the European Union undemocratic and demanding a greater role for the European Parliament. He has spoken as the EU, grappling with rampant disinformation on social media, attempts to regulate his X network under a landmark new content law. A former European Commissioner, Věra Jourová, went so far as to describe Musk as a 'promoter of evil' in an interview with Politico last October. In December, researchers from the European Council on Foreign Relations warned that Musk could use X 'to mobilize citizens and far-right parties to raise the political cost for EU decision-makers pursuing the crackdown.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3ZwukgYaWLZc	2025-01-04T16:29:06-08:00	
Ukraine Can Expect Further US Aid Offers Before Biden Leaves Offi...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine can expect more announcements in coming days about additional U.S. security assistance, a White House spokesman said as President Joe Biden’s term in office winds down. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing on January 3 that additional announcements on the provision of U.S. aid to Ukraine can be expected in the coming days. He gave no specifics. The announcements would follow a $5.9 billion package of additional military and budget assistance for Ukraine announced by the Biden administration last week amid concerns that the new administration under President-elect Donald Trump will significantly reduce or halt arms supplies to Ukraine in order to push Kyiv to negotiate a peace settlement with Russia. The White House said in a statement on December 30 that the aid includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package. The Treasury Department later on December 30 announced a separate $3.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine in direct budget support. Biden said in the statement that the United States would continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in the war, but despite his pledge, the $5.9 million package was thought to be the last during his administration, which is set to end on January 20 with the inauguration of Trump. Kirby also announced that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin would travel to Ramstein, Germany, for a meeting next week of Ukraine Defense Contact Group on January 9. Kirby had previously said that there was a possibility that another meeting of the group could take place before Biden leaves office. Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed later on January 3 that Austin would leave for Germany on January 7 to attend the 25th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. The meeting will 'reaffirm our enduring commitment to Ukraine,' Singh said at a briefing. 'Together with defense ministers and military leaders from around the globe, Secretary Austin will focus on delivering practical and coordinated support that reinforces Ukraine’s ability to defend itself today and deter aggression in the future.' She said more details about Austin’s schedule would be announced in the coming days. Asked about plans for future meetings of the contact group, Singh said it would be up to the incoming secretary of defense to decide whether to continue them. She added that Trump’s transition team had so far met with 79 Pentagon officials about the transition to the new administration. There has been no confirmation from the Trump team that his designated Ukraine envoy, retired Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg, will travel to Kyiv in the coming days. Reuters quoted two sources with knowledge of the trip's planning as saying that Kellogg will visit senior leaders in Kyiv. His team is working to set up meetings with leaders in other European capitals, such as Rome and Paris, they said. He is not planning to visit Moscow during the trip. The meetings are expected to focus on fact-finding on behalf of the new administration rather than on active negotiations, the sources said. The trip is seen as a sign of the urgency that Trump, who said he would end the war in Ukraine swiftly after his inauguration, has placed on quickly winding down the war. Ukraine and other European countries have been skeptical about the claim and are concerned that a deal drafted by Trump could force Ukraine to give up territory to Russia in exchange for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised interview broadcast on January 2 that Trump's 'unpredictability' could help end the war. Zelenskiy said that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is afraid of Trump, who could be 'decisive' in ending the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3eGHaCvqFrNh	2025-01-04T16:26:47-08:00	
Status Quo Frame In Burma’s Internal Warring – OpEd	The military regime in power is the status quo. It sees itself as the eternal and indispensable actor/player in Burmese politics to the point that Burma is like its private property which it profits from. However, it was under pressure to open up if it wanted to keep the status quo going, thus that 'controlled democracy interlude' with a constitution which kept power in its hand. Displaying it was ready to change and transit to a democracy, the regime played and plays the NCA process but always on its own terms, in its control. Across the table the participating EAOs thought they should end the wars through negotiations prospecting the post-military era and democratic federalism. They bought into endless protracted rounds of negotiations without seeing a light of the day till today. When the military regime found that this controlled democracy experiment didn’t go their way with the NLD and its famous leader getting the upper hand, it was time to finish off this democratic experiment to preserve the status quo. What followed next was the contestation of the status quo with brutal repression and suppression and the unfolding of the rest of the events till today. In this it is the young that is contesting the status quo with the help of certain older resistance armies while other old soldiers were sitting on the fence or continuing with the NCA process. They are part of the status quo in the same boat as the military regime. The NCA types still saying a political issue must be solved through a political process meaning no more battles, no wars when they were in battles with the military. This poses a problem when the military regime does fall and the fighting resistance wins. A new war? The actions of the UWSA also defends the status quo since they have their own territory and new ones without objections of the SAC and has the support of China. How does its allies feel about it? ASEAN and its Member States are status quo powers, and they are in a world of status quo diplomacy. Hence, they cannot really sanction the military regime and put ASEAN at risk of a split since it is divided, risking losing its centrality, straining its raison d’être. They had to come up with a compromise, the 5-point Consensus, 'in helping the people of Myanmar to achieve an inclusive and durable peaceful resolution to the crisis' with a few Member States grudgingly entertaining contacts with the NUG over time. They stick to the status quo fearing chaos in a post status quo as the statement cited above reveals especially 'peace, security, and stability in the region' in the same statement. Here is the primary concern of ASEAN. In this context of the 5-point Consensus, the only thing ASEAN has hit on is emergency aid and even then it passes through the status quo SAC when IDPs in the areas under resistance control is where needs are largest. Thailand on its own initiative talks of helping SAC to organise elections to bring in some legitimate government under the existing Constitution which keeps power in the hands of the SAC. This is similar to the present Thai political status quo where the military is lurking behind the scene. It is supporting a status quo way out, the future election which also has China’s support. This obviously will be opposed by the resistance and as some analysts say will not solve the problem and no peace and stability will occur. Now we hear that Thailand wants to mediate between the KNLA and the KTLA. Isn’t this interference in the affairs of another country even if for any good reason? ASEAN is ineffective. It can continue with its bla, bla, bla, retreats, conferencing and meetings etc.. ASEAN does not have the confidence that the resistance will win and be capable of forming a new state and bringing stability. The status quo is a sure bet for order and stability rather than chaos. Hence, the resistance must prove, rout out the junta on the ground in winning the civil war, a ceasefire at least between resistance forces and the first steps towards the establishment of a federal or co-federal state: a transitional government at least to hold the country together. This will then give some confidence to ASEAN which will then have to accept the reality of a new sitting power in Myanmar. East Timor is an example and explains why she whole-heartedly supports the Myanmarese/Burmese resistance. She too had to fight to be recognised and accepted by the status quo ASEAN powers and now it is part of the status quo. The rest of the international community is in the entourage of supporting ASEAN. Japan as a status quo power through its envoy or envoys tried to mediate between the regime and certain resistance armies but now it is gone with the wind. She still has her investments while the NUG and other local civil society organisations call for divestment. Australia has for years continued to entertain relations with the SAC with the rational that one of its citizens was in prison but it has always thought that it had influence having military-to-military relations which has ended. The far away EU has been using funds and still does support civil society actors but no call of divestments (garment and textile industries) because it will result in job losses. The US, the one power does not appear to see Burma as a strategic interest even in the face of China or she accepts that Burma is part of the Chinese sphere of influence. She has her Burma Act but we have still to see what it is concretely. A bit of what she gives to Ukraine or Israel will help the resistance to overcome the regime but fears entering into confrontation with China. All these external powers have sanctions, the easiest thing to do but has it got real effects. The UN is the only vigorous institution acting on Burma. Africa and South America has been quiet except for Gambia and Argentina both related to the Rohingyas. They are all very good at making statements. Wonder how many tons of paper have been spent if these statements are printed out. They all see the sitting military regime as crucial to negotiate with the resistance for peace. None will line up behind the resistance except East Timor if I am not provocative. For their own reasons, they are reinforcing the centrality of ASEAN to find peace in Myanmar and S.E. Asia. Myanmar does not appear to be at the top of their foreign policy agenda. There are more pressing concerns. They are all after a status quo solution. My message to the resistance is that the bottom-line is to rely on your own efforts and make yourselves credible meaning unity rather than internal disputes. The NUG must be a credible alternative for the status quo powers to dialogue with not necessarily recognition, but it is, however, challenged by other EAOs who themselves are in contact with external powers. This brings me to China. The scene is free for China to deal in its own way with Myanmar motivated by its huge investments in the country and pursuing its intention of having access to the Indian Ocean. We have seen her arranging ceasefires between the SAC and the Northern Alliance allies. This, of course, puts a lie to China’s non-interference policy. We are mediators they say while saying we are against foreign interference. It seems to have gone further by putting pressure on the EAOs under its wing, the TNLA, the MNDAA to stop fighting. Will China send in its troops to protect its investments? It should not be a surprise if she does. She has opted for her joint private security company behind which are mercenary soldiers. These Chinese moves will increase anti-China sentiment towards her that does not bode well for future relations. The latest is supporting a general election as a status quo solution to the alternative chaos it perceives. How does the EAOs which she supports feels of this? She is siding more towards the SAC than towards the resistance these days. China wants to bring an end to the Myanmar crisis but on its own terms and interests. With the NUG, there is no evident ties while the NUG has issued its pragmatic policy towards China. What really counts is that the NUG and the resistance must show it’s a credible alternative. Winning battles expanding territorial control is not enough. India in courting the military regime because of China (China in the Indian Ocean) is just allowing the regime space to play a game between the 2 giants to its own benefit. But it is no match to China. Am I provocative here for India? She anchors herself with Myanmar by her investments, the Kaladan to speak of one, which is no comparison with China’s. It is stated that she wants Myanmar’s cooperation regarding the Indian insurgencies on its border with Myanmar while its border states are sympathetic to their brethren across the border, the Chins for example. In no way is India in a position to contribute positively to bring about a peaceful solution inside Myanmar and without any openings with the resistance and the NUG. It has put all its cards with the status quo regime. She is making it difficult for the Rohingyas to take refuge. She has no solidarity with them. She is just thinking of its own selfish national interest like all other states countering China primarily. Lately with China’s move of her joint private security company, India has started engaging with the AA along with CNF, KIA and the NUG as reported. An example here of a status quo power having to recognise the reality on the ground to engage with a resistance army to its fellow status quo SAC. Bangladesh evokes sympathy and thanks for housing the Rohingyas but are the Rohingyas a cash-cow for Bangladesh through all the monetary transfers she receives and where is all this money going to. Its call for repatriation is going nowhere while its government and even the press, writers, analysts, the thinkers talk of security. We don’t see any seriousness to stamp out trafficking, the Rohingya armed groups that terrorise the Rohingya population the latest being recruitment to fight the resistance in their homeland allying with the SAC. Will the new interim government led by a Nobel Prize Laureate take hold of the Rohingya issue and deal with it in a positive sympathetic way? With the complete control of the border towns along the Bangladesh-Burmese border by the AA, time for Bangladesh to entertain talks with the AA, a non-state actor, the language of the status quo. Concretely, it is with the AA that it has to speak to of repatriation but the AA will not accept if the Rohyinga armed groups are not annihilated especially when they are aligning with the SAC. Finally, are the journalists, the commentators, the analysts, the opinion makers who write about what is happening in Burma/Myanmar. Without putting all in the same bag, they are writing in a mindset with the starting point of the status quo. To start with is the language of the status quo: terrorists, insurgents, rebels…… and what else instead of speaking of the resistance, the freedom fighters, the revolutionaries as the resistance call themselves……. Then, with the status quo in mind, how the SAC is facing up to the resistance, to the opposition? What are their manoeuvrings? Speculating on what is happening within the ranks in SAC. How long they are going to last? Speculating on the SAC as a necessary, indispensable actor in power-sharing as a way out to avoid chaos, instability even when populations of Burma want the SAC out of politics, of government. We need to see much more analysis, opinions from the point of view of the resistance. Factual reportage of their victories and losses, stories of the people in the resistance, the situation of the IDPs, there are but not much speculation on how they are going to or could overcome the SAC? How are they going to change the status quo? Is the resistance just going to fight to the last man to remove the military? The tipping point when the balance of power will change. Has it changed? At what point is the resistance ready to negotiate? Perhaps the resistance, the NUG are not even thinking through when they are ready to negotiate to end military rule. And after the end of military rule? Hence, more on the internal dynamics of the resistance, their unity. More on how the NUG works, more on the progress of the NUCC. Perhaps this is top secret not to inform the SAC. How could analysts supporting the resistance share their views with the resistance on how to proceed to topple the status quo, what to do with negotiations. The final word is that analysts, observers, commentators, journalists ….. have to take a stand and not sit on the fence in a so-called neutral position.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3TFYJ05qC5UZ	2025-01-04T16:21:47-08:00	
Rohingyas’ Return To Myanmar Uncertain, Despite Rebel Control Of ...	The dream of returning home to Myanmar remains uncertain for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh despite rebel control of the border, members of the ethnic group said Friday. About 740,000 Rohingya fled from western Myanmar’s Rakhine state following a bloody crackdown against members of their stateless Muslim minority group in August 2017. They joined other Rohingya who had settled in camps in and around Cox’s Bazar, bringing the total number of refugees in southeastern Bangladesh at the time to just over 1 million. Years of negotiations to repatriate Rohingyas to Rakhine state have yielded little progress, in part because members of the community say their safety cannot be guaranteed back home after the military that targeted them seized power in a February 2021 coup d’etat. On Dec. 8, rebels known as the Arakan Army, or AA, which is battling the junta for self-determination in Rakhine state, captured Maungdaw township and took control of the region’s border with Bangladesh. The takeover rekindled hope that the Rohingya might be offered safe transport across the border and feel comfortable enough with AA governance to resettle their communities in Rakhine. On Wednesday, the AA — which now controls about 80% of Rakhine state — announced that it would begin allowing people displaced by fighting to return home, after having fully secured the border. However, RFA Burmese spoke with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who said they remain uncertain about their return — in part because it’s unclear whether the AA might accommodate such a move and because ongoing fighting in Rakhine would leave them susceptible to military airstrikes. 'It is a time of war, so it is impossible for us to return home,' said Mohammed, a Rohingya refugee from Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh. 'Even if the AA takes over the entirety Rakhine state, our repatriation program remains far off because they are not a legitimate government.' Refugees who earlier fled violence and persecution in Myanmar said they had been kidnapped and forced to fight in the country’s ongoing civil war for the Arakan Army as well as the junta.both the junta and the AA Nearly 65,000 Rohingya have crossed into southeastern Bangladesh since late last year amid unrest and violence in Rakhine, according to Bangladeshi officials. Even if the refugees are allowed to return home, they remain fearful of junta airstrikes, said Europe-based Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin. 'The repatriation program is directly related to the AA because they currently control the area [where the Rohingya communities are],' he said. 'Even if the AA gives firm guarantees, the Rohingya people might suffer great losses if the junta carry out airstrikes when they return home. Their repatriation is largely concerned with their security.' Demands for repatriation Rohingya refugees have also demanded recognition of their identity as an ethnic minority of Myanmar, acknowledgment of their Myanmar citizenship and the opportunity to return home 'with dignity.' On Dec. 25, more than 100,000 Rohingyas in the Cox’s Bazar refugee camps protested and called for assistance from the international community, including the United Nations, in meeting their demands ahead of a return to Myanmar. 'When people in the camps return home, they hope to go back to their original homes,' said Mohammed of the Kutupalong refugee camp. 'Moreover, we have also asked both Myanmar and international representatives to ensure our rights to freedom of movement, access to education, and all other basic rights. We will not change these demands.' The AA’s seizure of the border has, in some ways, complicated the issue even further. On Dec. 22, during a meeting on the situation in Myanmar, held in Thailand last month, Bangladesh Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafi Alam told reporters that the Bangladesh government had urged Myanmar’s junta to 'find a way' to settle the border dispute as it would 'not engage' with the AA. A week later, however, Bangladeshi security experts, former diplomats and scholars advised the Bangladesh government to engage with the AA directly and diplomatically. The status of the relationship remains uncertain. A former district law officer who asked not to be named due to security concerns told RFA that the repatriation of the Rohingyas will depend on the ruling administration in Rakhine state. 'Since there is currently no legal framework for the repatriation of the Rohingya, a bilateral agreement is essential for implementing this program,' he said. On Dec. 23, nearly 30 Rohingya organizations worldwide called on the AA to guarantee the rights and security of all communities in Rakhine state, including the Rohingya; establish an interim consultative committee; recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic minority of Myanmar; and adopt and enforce a public code of conduct for AA fighters. Attempts by RFA to contact AA spokesperson Khaing Thukha for comment on the Rohingyas' return went unanswered by the time of publishing. Dire food shortage Meanwhile, more than 5,000 displaced Rohingya sheltering at a camp in Rakhine’s Pauktaw township are in urgent need of food after not receiving aid for more than a year, they told RFA on Friday. A Rohingya at the camp in Pauktaw’s Ah Nauk Ye village said that the displaced are living on a diet of rice gruel, due to the food shortage. '[Dry] rice is urgently needed at the camp as some displaced persons are suffering from starvation,' said the camp resident, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal. 'We have no jobs and are forced to borrow money from others. The rising prices of essential goods are making our situation even more difficult.' Camp residents said that a pregnant woman, an elderly person, and a child died in December due to a lack of access to healthcare and medicine, as well as malnutrition. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Myanmar’s junta has restricted the delivery of food, medicine, and other relief items under its humanitarian assistance program to Rakhine state. Moreover, local and international aid agencies have been blocked, and the United Nations Development Program warned in November that about two million people in Rakhine state could experience food shortage in March and April due to insufficient food supplies. Attempts by RFA to reach Hla Thein, the attorney general and junta spokesperson for Rakhine state, for comment on the food shortages went unanswered Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3QcUS7HS2lRa	2025-01-04T16:17:48-08:00	
US Capital In ‘Heightened Threat Environment’ After New Year’s Da...	By Jeff Seldin Law enforcement and security agencies in and around Washington are bringing in reinforcements as they prepare to secure three high-profile events in the nation's capital, following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck bombing in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The first event will occur Monday, when Congress meets to certify results of the presidential election four years to the day since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The second will be the state funeral for the late President Jimmy Carter, starting with a ceremony and procession on Tuesday before wrapping up on Thursday. The last high-profile event will come Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. 'That has never happened before. We have three [National Special Security Events] over a 15-day period,' Matt McCool, U.S. Secret Service Washington Field Office special agent in charge, told reporters Friday. 'But what I will tell you is we're flexible. We're adaptable. We've been working on these events for, in some cases, years,' he said. 'So, we're going to be prepared.' Despite concerns stemming from the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas bombing, security officials are confident so far that the Washington events will proceed safely. 'We are not tracking any credible or specific threats associated with these events,' said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge at the FBI's Washington Field Office. The law enforcement and security agencies, however, are not taking any chances, acknowledging that the city and the region are operating in a heightened threat environment. The Secret Service said Friday that it was bringing in agents from across the country to boost staffing levels, which were already the highest they have been in three years. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said it has added to its ranks almost 4,000 officers from departments across the country. The capital's National Guard Bureau confirmed it also has approved requests for additional support, including the provision of 500 guardsmen for the Jan. 6 election certification and liaison officers for the state funeral. An additional request for 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen to assist with security for the Trump inauguration is pending. Increased security measures, including barriers and fencing, are already up in parts of Washington and around the Capitol, but more are coming. 'A multitude of seen and unseen security measures will operate in tandem to ensure a comprehensive and seamless security plan comes to fruition,' McCool said, adding that the measures will include the use of aerial drones. 'The Secret Service will use drones as part of our comprehensive security plan,' McCool said. 'Do not be alarmed if you see these assets during the upcoming events or training in the days ahead.' The Metropolitan Police Department said its increased security measures would go into effect starting Sunday, with the deployment of specialized officers around the city to respond to any emergencies. The U.S. Capitol Police, whose 2,400 officers and civilian employees are responsible for protecting the Capitol and members of Congress, also said they were more prepared to handle contingencies than they were four years ago, when rioters upset with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee and injuring police officers. About 1,560 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot. So far, about 979 have pleaded guilty, while another 210 have been convicted. 'Our nation's capital is prepared to ensure that the legislative process will proceed without disruption, and our government will have a peaceful transfer of power,' said Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, noting that the force has implemented more than 100 recommendations made following the 2021 riot. Officials in Washington are also bracing for potential protests, saying several planned demonstrations have already gotten required permits. 'We are committed to upholding the right to peacefully assemble and protest here in our city,' said Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith. 'We welcome visitors to come and experience what this incredible city has to offer, but those who are intentional on unlawful activity should know that there will be consequences,' Smith said. 'However, as I've stated before, when we have special events, and I want to be very clear, that we will not tolerate any violence, rioting, destruction of property, or any behavior that threatens the safety and security of our city.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3ZibOcf0B442	2025-01-04T16:15:59-08:00	
2024 In Review: Was It The Year Of Democracy? – OpEd	The world bid farewell to 2024 which forged a phase marked by its democratic struggles, political reforms, and major shifts in power. From the streets of Dhaka to the battlefields of Myanmar, from election rallies of Washington to war-torn Syria and Ukraine, and to the polls of India and Russia, 2024 left behind a legacy that may reshape the global politics with tremendous effects and transformational reforms across the globe. As the last hospital of Gaza has been shut down, and Palestinians are on the verge of eternal extinction, hope remains the only beacon since the world has abandoned them. Meanwhile, a country with liberal values has unprecedentedly rocked by a coup, with South Korea witnessed political upheaval as its President faced an arrest warrant. In 2024, almost half of the world’s population was in political temperature to go the polls across more than 80 countries since it was heralded as 'the year of democracy'. But even in what we call 'successful democracies'– freedom of speech, plurality of media and equality of participation were in immense threats. There were widespread political upheaval, rise of commodity prices as well as corruption and civic unrest in countries across continents that fueled violence and various other tragedies. Across countries, people demanded freedom, accountability, fair elections and overall change of heavily corrupted systems. Among the stories that defined the year 2024, Bangladesh emerged as a symbol of democratic hope as it earned its place in The Economist’s 'Country of the Year' in which the country has been praised for overthrowing an autocrat as well as restoring order in the first place. Here is a review of incidents that occurred in key countries that indicate how those nations are going to navigate their democratic futures: Bangladesh: The Revolution That Captivated the World The year began in Bangladesh with prolonged dissatisfaction under the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina, with manipulated election held on 7 January; the Awami League won an easy victory with every opposition being silenced, jailed and even killed. But the July Revolution changed everything, by captivating the world’s attention citizens from all walks of life including students, opposition parties, civil societies and mass people came to the streets, bringing an end to the ruling party’s 15-year old oppressive regime. Later on, when the reformist government took seat led by Chief Adviser Dr. Muhammad Yunus, economic reform and restoring rule of law have become priorities to change the long-sustained corrupt system of Bangladesh. The Economist’s 'Country of the Year' credit is yet to be maintained in rebuilding democracy through collective action. Point to be noted as democratic uprising in Bangladesh has been decided in the streets, not at the polls. Syria: Another Unprecedented Change After 12 years of longstanding civil war as well as almost 50 years of autocratic rule by two generations of tyrants, Syria became free. With emerging horrendous stories of the hidden cells of Sednaya Prison, Syria seems to be recovered from reign of fear. With Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the alliance of rebel groups announced reforms in the country bringing Syrian interests for the first time. It is a matter of fact that the western alliance did not want HTS to come to power. However, in growing escalation of Iran and Israel, HTS was implicitly permitted to overthrow Al Assad regime, cutting off Iran’s arms and logistical supply chain with Hezbollah. Turkey has played major role negotiating with the West to bring HTS in power of Syria, defeating both Russian and Iranian interests there. United States: Trump’s Return The U.S. presidential election, amidst a deeply polarized political landscape, saw Donald Trump reelected. Despite controversies, the reelection of Mr. Donald Trump raises concern not only in USA but to various upcoming international negotiations. Trump is notorious who has already stacked courts, and with his populist demands, attempted an insurrection to maintain power. In world stage, he altered major relations with countries like Russia, India and those in the Middle East. Yet still democratic divide remains as Trump 2.0 is taking power in USA, institutions in the USA are one of those to bring its vibrant democracy forward. Gaza: A Year of Unrelenting Crisis In 2024, Gaza endured the most suffering in its history, with the whole city becoming rubbles and dreams becoming shattered. In a full blown war toward the common people by Israeli forces, the casualties turned some of Palestinian families erased from existence, turning the nation to extinction. The modern era has seen no such thing like a nation is being extinct while the world does nothing. In U.S. universities, student protests for saving lives in Gaza were also suppressed, revealing a lack of value placed on freedom of speech. This has also prompted a reevaluation of what freedom of speech should truly mean in a democratic society. South Korea: A Shocking Coup In an unbelievable move, South Korea which often considered as an example of liberal democracy faced an exceptional coup in October when factions within the military under President Yoon Suk-yeol seized power. The coup shocked the world, most notably, citizens within South Korea rallied for returned to democracy. An arrest warrant was issued after Yoon, which is remarkably unseen against a sitting president in South Korea’s history. Question remains will this incident impact democratic navigation in South Korea in recent times? Myanmar: Ethnic Armed Organizations Strike Back Myanmar's Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) has launched a coordinated offensive and gained significant momentum against the military Junta regime. The Chin National Army (CNA) in Chin state and Arakan Amry (AA) in Rakhaine state as well as many other factions in the country are now challenging the iron-fist Junta regime in Naypyidaw. However, concerns remain as the rebels are backed by Chinese interests, will they tend to democratic reforms or anything else that favors China in the end? Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka’s new President and the Marxist-leaning politician is playing a key role in deciding the future of reforms of the debt-ridden nation in the Indian Ocean. Slowly but steadily the country is emerging from a crushing financial crisis that ousted Rajapaksa rule in 2022. A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka now hopes for its democracy may show financial recovery from the crushing economic crisis. Ukraine: Defiance in the Face of Aggression Ukraine’s struggle against Russian aggression continued in 2024. Despite significant territorial losses, Ukraine displayed significant resilience. Democratic future of Ukraine depends on continuous support from the West and the capabilities of Ukrainian resistance from mass people to the soldiers in the battlefield. Meanwhile, international community’s support, particularly from NATO and the EU, remained fundamental for Ukraine’s existence as a sovereign state in front of Russian aggression. Pakistan In Pakistan, the most popular party leader, Imran Khan, had been imprisoned by Pakistan’s interim military rulers, hindering democratic governance in the country. Pakistan’s 2024 election, held on February 8 after two years of political turmoil has seen significant political melodrama and Imran Khan’s party was banned from entering into election, causing people to come to the streets. Yet the democratic aspirations were neglected and future remains bleak in Pakistan. India: Modi’s Toughest Contest Yet Indian elections were held from 19 April to 1 June in 7 phases, with Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) facing strong opposition from a united coalition of rival parties. As in the world's largest democracy, BJP remained a formidable force, but growing dissatisfaction over economic policies, unemployment and incessant minority attacks remain severe. India often showed elections as weather of festivals, yet its institutions, free press, and minority rights are to be scrutinized, especially when continued campaigns against the Muslim minority are on significant rise. Russia: Putin’s Predictable Victory In stark contrast to democratic upheavals elsewhere, Russian election had a predictable outcome: strongman Vladimir Putin’s victory. Although many in the world rejected this as allegations of vote manipulation persisted, Putin’s hold of power remains unshaken. The future of democracy in Russia looks bleak, with little room for any opposition and generations are accustomed to Vladimir Putin’s manipulated news outlet while his continued influence in countries like Moldova, Georgia and Romania remains fearful democracy in those countries. The Future of Democracy in 2025 and Beyond As the world moves into 2025, the incidents of 2024 will have tremendous impacts into upcoming events. For democracy to thrive in the world, strengthening institutions and promoting inclusivity will be crucial besides taking mass aspirations into consideration. Analyzing incidents from world politics, the implications for global democratic health continue to subjects of debates. In the developed world, voter dissatisfaction remains over issues like ineffective governance and inflation, while in many parts of the globe, democracy is craved through violence in the streets. As the Time magazine pronounced 2024 as a 'make-or-break year' for democracy, it can be said only elections no more guarantee democracy, rather forging effective institutions is a key to surpass the setbacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3TJIJpcVaipe	2025-01-04T16:13:45-08:00	
China’s ‘Monster’ Ship Arrives At Scarborough Shoal	The world’s largest coast guard vessel, a Chinese ship known as 'The Monster,' has arrived at the disputed Scarborough Shoal inside the Philippine exclusive economic zone to boost Beijing’s control over the maritime area, an American analyst said. Meanwhile, the Chinese navy has been conducting a New Year carrier-based helicopter training exercise in the airspace over the South China Sea, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The 12,000-ton CCG 5901 arrived at Scarborough Shoal on Wednesday, said Ray Powell, director of the SeaLight project at Stanford University, who tracks the ship’s movements. There are at least three other Chinese coast guard ships – CCG 3106, 3302 and 3305 – as well as seven militia ships, already present at the shoal, Powell told Radio Free Asia. The aim of their mission is to boost Beijing’s control over the maritime area just 125 nautical miles (232 kilometers) from the main Philippine island of Luzon, he said. Scarborough Shoal is known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc and has served as a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but their access has been restricted by Chinese vessels in recent times, which hold de-facto control of the area. It is well within the area under the jurisdiction of the Philippines, where it has exclusive rights to resources in the waters and on the seabed. 'The Monster' is not only large in size, it is also armed with heavy machine guns and has a helicopter platform. It is unclear whether the ship carries any helicopter unit on this mission but last week, the Chinese coast guard conducted a carrier-based helicopter training exercise, also at Scarborough Shoal, using another coast guard vessel. Control of airspace Chinese authorities 'are now paying more attention to the deployment of airpower' in relation to the South China Sea disputes, Yang Xiao, a maritime expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said on an influential blog with nearly three million followers on Sina Weibo. The U.S. and Philippine militaries have been deploying reconnaissance aircraft and drones to the Scarborough Shoal, a strategically located chain of reefs south of Bashi channel between Taiwan and the Philippines, Yang said, adding that China now has to gain air control, especially after it announced baselines to form territorial sea and airspace around the shoal in November. The carrier-based aircraft training is to send a warning to the Philippines and its ally the U.S. that they should think twice before 'entering China’s airspace,' the Chinese expert said. The Chinese coast guard’s training exercise on Dec. 27 was similar to current drills by a helicopter unit of the Southern Theater Command navy’s carrier-based aviation force, conducted at an unspecified location in the South China Sea. According to CCTV, on Wednesday and Thursday, various types of carrier-based helicopters carried out multi-subject practical training including search and rescue, alert control, and sea landing, 'further improving the unit’s coordinated combat capabilities.' The aircraft also carried out reconnaissance patrol and alert control training exercises at high altitude in a 'target sea area,' CCTV said without identifying the location. In recent weeks, China’s military has been ramping up combat readiness exercises at Scarborough Shoal. On Sunday, its Southern Theater Command staged large-scale patrols around the shoal, with both navy and the air force taking part. Submarine drone Meanwhile, the Philippine armed forces on Thursday said it was conducting an investigation into the origin and purpose of a submarine drone with suspect origins in waters off the central Philippines. Philippine police said the drone, which was fished out of waters off Masbate island in the central Philippines on Monday, could be Chinese. A report by the police about the incident said the drone was found by fishermen on the morning of Dec. 30 while fishing in the area. The fishermen, accompanied by village officials, then turned over the item to police. The yellow drone had the markings 'HY-119,' which police said refers to a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not return messages requesting for comment. 'The Navy is currently conducting further investigation to determine its origin and purpose,' Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs chief Col. Xerxes Trinidad said in a statement. 'The AFP is fully committed to ensuring the safety and security of our maritime domain, with all necessary resources mobilized to address similar and other situations with the utmost diligence,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3QnOdx4v8B2V	2025-01-04T16:11:29-08:00	
UNIFIL Accuses Israeli Army Of Deliberately Destroying Property I...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on Saturday accused the Israeli army of deliberately destroying its property and critical infrastructure in southern Lebanon, marking a serious escalation in tensions along the border. In a statement issued on Saturday, UNIFIL said: 'This morning, peacekeepers witnessed an Israeli army bulldozer destroying a blue barrel marking the withdrawal line between Lebanon and Israel in Al-Labbouneh, as well as a watchtower belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces adjacent to a UNIFIL site in the area.' The blue barrels, which serve as markers for the withdrawal line — commonly referred to as the Blue Line — are crucial in delineating the boundary established following Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. UNIFIL condemned the actions, describing them as a 'deliberate and direct destruction' of its property and infrastructure clearly identifiable as belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). The statement further characterized the incident as 'a blatant violation of (UN Security Council) Resolution 1701 and international law.' Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006 to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War, calls for respect for Lebanon’s territorial integrity and the cessation of all aggressive actions in the area. UNIFIL also urged all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could jeopardize the fragile cessation of hostilities. 'We urge all parties to refrain from any actions, including the destruction of property and civilian infrastructure, that could jeopardize the cessation of hostilities,' the statement added. The incident comes amid heightened tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border, with several exchanges of fire reported in recent weeks. There has been no immediate comment from the Israeli military regarding the accusations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3bQZXxa8ebAa	2025-01-04T16:06:13-08:00	
The Destruction Of Early Republican Architecture In Ankara – OpEd	Unbelievable things are happening in Ankara. Many valuable buildings from the early Republican period, which witnessed the founding years of the Turkish Republic, are sadly being demolished one by one. In their place, either empty parking lots or new structures with no architectural or historical connection to the past are being constructed. The Etibank building was one of the first to go. This structure, reflecting the modern architectural style of the Republican era, was torn down, leaving behind an empty parking lot. At the Opera Square parking area, the Melike Hatun Mosque, inspired by Ottoman-era designs, was built. Meanwhile, the magnificent İller Bank building next to it shared the same fate and was demolished. Today, only a temporary shack occupies its former location. But it didn't stop there. The Ministry of Public Works and Settlement building was also torn down, leaving yet another parking lot in its wake. There are now plans to build a mosque on that site. Similarly, the beautiful DSİ (State Hydraulic Works) building was demolished, replaced once again by an empty parking lot. One of the most distressing losses is the destruction of the Ministry of Public Works building, designed by the renowned Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister. This structure was not merely a building but a monument embodying the modernization ideals of the Republic. Now, this historical masterpiece is being erased. The Yargıtay (Supreme Court) building is also on the brink of demolition. The Saraçoğlu Neighbourhood appears to have been spared for now. However, even one of the symbolic structures of the Republic, the Çankaya Presidential Mansion, has been left neglected and abandoned to decay. The architectural treasures of the early Republican period are disappearing one by one, replaced by empty parking lots or soulless, nondescript structures. This is not just a loss of architecture; it is also the destruction of a historical and cultural identity. These buildings represent more than bricks and mortar; they are living testaments to a bygone era, reflecting the spirit of a time when the Republic's ideals of modernization and development were at their peak. Preserving this heritage is vital not only for Ankara but also for Turkey's cultural memory and identity. Yet, it seems these structures are not seen as valuable monuments but as disposable entities, torn down without a clear plan for their replacement. This is a grave injustice to our history and culture.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3Rn6CWnESyXZ	2025-01-04T16:02:29-08:00	
Key Strategic Forces Takeaways From The 2024 China Military Power...	By Rebeccah L. Heinrichs China’s Nuclear Buildup The Department of Defense has released its annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments. The report confirms that China is accelerating its strategic nuclear breakout. China now has over 600 fully operational nuclear warheads in its arsenal, up from the estimate of 500 in last year’s report. This supports the DoD’s assessment that China is on track to have 1,000 fully operational nuclear warheads by 2030. Official assessments expect China to complete its buildup and modernization efforts by 2035. However, Xi Jinping’s aim to replace the United States as the preeminent geopolitical power—and his attendant ambitions to undermine US security alliances—raises doubts that China will be satisfied with peer nuclear status rather than nuclear superiority. The New START Treaty between the US and Russia is the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement. Yet Moscow is not complying with its verification requirements. The treaty limits each nation to 1,550 total deployed nuclear weapons between intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (with each bomber counted as one warhead). The treaty is expected to expire in February 2027. The DoD report includes several key findings regarding China’s nuclear buildup: China possesses approximately 400 ICBMs, up from last year’s estimate of 350, all of which can reach the continental United States. The People’s Liberation Army’s expanding nuclear force will enable it to target more US cities, military facilities, and leadership sites than ever before in a potential nuclear conflict. Since 2017, China has constructed 30 new silos for DF-5-class liquid-propellant ICBMs, more than doubling its previous total before the recent buildup. The Chinese Navy has fielded the extended-range JL-3-class SLBM, capable of reaching the continental United States, on its JIN-class ballistic missile submarine, enabling China to strike the continental United States with SLBMs from the Bohai Gulf or the South China Sea. With Russian assistance, China has completed construction of the first of two planned CFR-600 nuclear reactors, and construction on the second is ongoing. Each reactor can annually produce enough weapons-grade plutonium for 'dozens of nuclear warheads.' China is developing an 'early warning counterstrike' posture aimed at rapidly responding to warnings of a nuclear attack with retaliatory strikes. China seeks to diversify its force with more low-yield precision strike missiles to control escalation. Since the Cold War the United States has sought to rely less on nuclear weapons in its defense strategy. But Russia and China have not followed suit. Both have invested heavily in nuclear weapons as part of their strategies to coerce the US and its allies. Making matters worse, Russia is helping China accelerate its nuclear development. How the US Should Respond The United States needs to prioritize strategic deterrence above all else. It should adapt its forces to credibly deter simultaneous and opportunistic aggression. 1. Prioritize efforts to bolster strategic deterrence. The modernization of the nuclear deterrent, supported and expedited by both the Trump and Biden administrations, is essential. In 2023, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, of which I was a member, found that the currently planned US nuclear force modernization is necessary but not sufficient. This latest report on China’s nuclear buildup reinforces the commission’s findings and the salience of its recommendations. 2. Urgently adapt US theater nuclear options to offer the president a range of credible nuclear response options to convince China and Russia that their nuclear threats will not achieve their aims and they should not venture to use even a low-yield nuclear option. These theater options should account for advances in Russian and Chinese integrated air and missile defense (IAMD). To do this, the US will also need its allies to build up their conventional forces while contributing to US efforts to improve nuclear deterrence. 3. Adapt and expand missile defense to protect the US homeland as well as critical assets abroad. IAMD contributes to deterrence by complicating adversaries’ calculations and causing them to doubt their attacks will succeed. As China’s nuclear program matures and the United States seeks to protect the American people and US vital interests, Washington should also bolster homeland defense against Chinese and Russian missile threats.

Cold War: Moldova’s Breakaway Transnistria Freezes Amid Russian G...	This week's cut-off of Russian gas supplies could create a humanitarian crisis in the breakaway Transnistria region, sparking public discontent and that might threaten Moldova's path towards the EU, experts warn. By Madalin Necsutu After more than three decades of de facto control over Moldova’s separatist Transnistria, the small region on the left bank of the Dniester River was left in the cold when Moscow halted gas supplies from January 1. Before then, Russia’s energy giant Gazprom delivered gas to Moldova, including the separatist region of Transnistria, through Ukraine. But Ukraine has said it will no longer allow the transit of Russian gas through its territory once its contract with Gazprom, which was valid until the start of 2025, expired. Although Russia has the technical possibility to continue to send gas to Moldova through the trans-Balkan gas pipeline, via Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, Gazprom has refused to do so. Gazprom claims it has ended supplies because of Moldova’s huge debts, although Chisinau disputes this. Analysts in Chisinau believe that Russia is using the expiry of the gas transit contract with Ukraine to put pressure on Moldova, cause public discontent and disrupt its route towards eventual European Union membership, away from Moscow’s influence. 'Gazprom … has a contractual obligation to deliver gas to the border with Moldova and it could use the alternative route through Turkey,' Sergiu Tofilat, an energy expert at WatchDog Community, a Chisinau-based think tank, told BIRN. From 2006 until 2024, Russian gas deliveries to Moldova, including the Transnistrian region, were based on two agreements. Under a contract signed with Gazprom in 2006, Moldovagaz supplied gas to Tiraspoltransgaz, the Transnistrian energy company, from 2007 to 2011. Both parties renewed the agreement annually until 2019 and they extended it from October 2021 until 2026. A second contract, between Moldovagaz and Tiraspoltransgaz, signed in 2011, stipulated the conditions for delivering Russian gas to Transnistria. The most recent contract signed between Gazprom and Moldovagaz, signed in October 2021, covering the next five years to 2026, obliged the Russian company to supply Moldova with 3.3 billion cubic meters a year. Of this, 1.24 billion cubic meters would go to Moldova proper and 2.06 billion to Transnistria. But, in December 2022, Gazprom only supplied Moldova with the gas intended for Transnistria – 2.06 billion, equal to 5.7 million cubic meters per day. This came after Moldova decided to stop buying gas from Russia, a political decision designed to coordinate with international efforts to stop funding the Russian war machine maintained by money from the sale of gas and oil. While Moldova gave up its contractual share of the Russian gas, the remaining 2.06 billion cubic meters of gas was required to meet Transnistria’s internal needs and allow it to produce electricity, vital for its economy. Moscow has long viewed Transnistria as a strategic outpost and base for possible military action in the Balkan region. It illegally keeps about 1,600 soldiers in the region, divided into alleged peacekeeping troops and soldiers of the Operative Group of the Russian Army, OGRT. This is subordinate to the Western Military District of the Russian Army based in St Petersburg, whose mission is to guard about 20,000 tons of ammunition left over from the Soviet period in the village of Cobasna. Arguments over size of Moldova’s debts On December 28, Gazprom informed Moldovagaz, its Moldovan subsidiary, that it would stop all gas supplies to Moldova on January 1, citing Moldova’s alleged refusal to pay its debts. It noted Moldova’s habit of 'regularly not fulfilling its payment obligations under the contract, which is a serious violation of its terms' as the reason for stopping deliveries. 'In this context, based on the provisions of the contract … Gazprom is introducing, starting at 08:00, on January 1, 2025, a limitation of natural gas supplies to Moldova,' a Gazprom press release said. Gazprom referred to an alleged but unspecified debt of 709 million US dollars owed by Moldovagaz, which Gazprom said should be paid by the Moldovan authorities. However, an independent international audit done in September 2023 set Moldovagaz’s debt to Gazprom at only eight million US dollars, which Chisinau was willing to pay immediately, but Moscow refused. At the same time, the Transnistrian region already owes Gazprom a colossal 10.5 billion US dollars for gas consumed and never paid for over three decades. Gazprom has tolerated this debt, which is transferred annually to the Russian company’s economic balance sheet. Gas crisis hits secessionist regime The separatist leader in Tiraspol, Vadim Krasnoselsky, announced on Wednesday that the region’s gas reserves currently stood at 13 million cubic metres. Most of the region’s 350,000 or so inhabitants, about 220,000, hold Russian passports and are citizens of Russia. In 1992, after a war in which Transnistrian forces were aided by the former Soviet Union’s 14th Army, the tiny region became de facto-independent from Chisinau – but in practice in Russia’s orbit. Krasnoselsky insisted that the energy crisis was under control and that he would not allow the region to collapse. But most economic institutions in Transnistria are already paralysed. According to media reports, the end of gas supplies has led to the closure of most industries, except for food factories. Thousands of people have become unemployed overnight. The MoldGres thermal power plant in the town of Cuciurgan has switched to coal-fired operation and, together with the Dubasari station, can cover electricity needs for at most 50 days. 'The crisis is so serious that there is no need to list which enterprises have stopped. All industrial enterprises are standing still except those that ensure Transnistria’s food security,' the separatist deputy prime minister of Transnistria, Serghei Obolonik, told the Novostipmr news agency. 'There are no energy resources for the industrial sector,' he added. ‘Squeezing Moldova’ ahead of elections The authorities in Chisinau believe Russia wants to create a humanitarian crisis and trigger a domino effect in Moldova ahead of crucial parliamentary elections due this summer. The idea is that high prices for energy will foment dissatisfaction among Moldovans who might otherwise vote for pro-European forces. High energy prices will lead to further price rises of all goods and services and cut living standards. 'The 2025 parliamentary elections are seen as a last major opportunity for Moscow to reaffirm its influence in the Republic of Moldova and to slow down or even stop the pro-European orientation of the Moldovan state,' political analyst Anatol Taranu wrote in an editorial for IPN news agency. The elections will determine whether Moldova stays on its European course, against a background of polarisation in society and scenarios in which pro-European forces might find themselves unable to form a governing coalition. In tandem with stopping gas deliveries to Moldova, on December 23, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, SVR, accused Moldova’s pro-Western President, Maia Sandu, of preparing a military operation in Transnistria. According to the SVR, the alleged plan is for Moldovan military to take over the Cuciurgan power plant in Transnistria, which is supplied by Gazprom. The SVR claimed that, after Sandu recently the Moldovan government’s energy security chiefs, the meeting ended with Sandu saying it was time to plan a military operation to establish control over Transnistria and 'eliminate the Russian peacekeeping presence in the region', the SVR said. 'No one can guarantee that the Moldovan president will not really try to start a real war in the region,' the SVR alleged, as quoted by the Russian TASS news agency. Meanwhile the secessionist authorities in Transnistria are trying to shift attention from Moscow and seek culprits in Chisinau. Tiraspol and the Transnistrian media insist that Gazprom stopped supplies to Transnistria because Moldovagaz failed to pay its debts. They also claim Chisinau did nothing to persuade Kyiv to extend the gas deal. In response, Moldovagaz announced on Thursday that, together with the energy company Energocom, it is 'willing to provide assistance, including technical and commercial support to Tiraspoltransgaz, in organising the purchase of natural gas on any European gas platform'. Kremlin accused of ‘energy blackmail’ President Sandu has condemned the actions of the Russian authorities, accusing them of blackmail. 'The Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European path,' she said on December 30. Moldova is also being hit by the crisis. It was buying about 80 per cent of its electricity from the Moldgres thermal power plant in Transnistria at a below-market price. Now it has to secure energy from other sources. Neighbour Romania has jumped to Moldova’s aid and is already supplying about 50 per cent of Moldova’s electricity needs. Romania’s energy minister, Sebastian Burduja, said Russia has used energy as a weapon of blackmail for decades, always threatening to 'turn off the tap'. He added that those who dream of 'cheap Russian gas' should remember that freedom has a price. 'Without energy independence, there can be neither the freedom nor the security of a country … we have a moral duty to be with our brothers across the Prut [river in Moldova],' he said. Moldova has secured another 30 per cent of the electricity it needs through the heating company Termoelectrica. Another 15 per cent comes from renewable energy and about 5 per cent from the CET Nord plant and the Costești hydro plant in the north. On December 30, meanwhile, Prime Minister Dorin Recean called for a new look at laws on the nationalization of enterprises, to 'get rid of any tools of blackmail'. He was referencing the fact that Russia’s Gazprom owns about two-thirds of the shares in Moldovagaz, while Moldova’s Ministry of Economy owns about 35 per cent. However, some experts see this energy crisis also as an opportunity for Moldova. They see it as a chance for Moldova to reintegrate the Transnistrian region, which represents about 11 per cent of the country’s land surface, and to 'close the Transnistrian file'. 'Every crisis also brings opportunities. In this case, stopping the delivery of ‘free’ gas to the left [bank] of the Dniester would pave the way for the reintegration of the two banks,' energy expert Sergiu Tofilat said. 'However, this project can become feasible only with the support of external partners, to maintain stability in the region, especially on the border with Ukraine,' he concluded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3EHVzdL_0VhC	2025-01-03T16:29:38-08:00	
Chinese Companies Expanding Abroad Must Strike A Balance Between ...	By Chen Li Chinese companies are riding a new wave of 'going global,'driven by a strong enthusiasm to expand into overseas markets, targeting regions like Africa, South America, and North America. However, hidden beneath this wave is a profound contradiction between growth and costs. ANBOUND's founder Mr. Kung Chan raised athought-provoking point during the 2025 Trend Seminar, that Chinese companies going global must make a choice between 'growth' and 'cost'. High-growth markets like Africa may offer rapid growth, but they come with enormous risks. In contrast, developed country markets arevast with stable returns, but the costs are higher, making them more suitable for companies aiming to 'grow bigger and stronger'. Mr. Chan warned that it is improbable to have both ways and attempting to take advantage ofboth sides is not feasible. Growth and cost are inherently difficult to balance,and before going global, companies must carefully consider their positioning and what trade-offs they are willing to make. The crisis triggered by BYD's factory project in Brazil is a typical example of failing to properly balance growth with costs. As the largest economy in South America, Brazil offers immense potential in the new energy vehicle market, making it a key target in BYD's global strategic layout. However, such high-growth markets also come with significant risks. According to a statement from the Brazilian Labor Prosecutor's Office, BYD's contractor,the Jinjiang Group, severely violated labor laws: workers faced excessively long hours, poor living conditions, and even had their passports confiscated. These actions were deemed 'slave-like conditions', sparking a strong social backlash in Brazil. While BYD quickly responded by terminating its contract with the Jinjiang Group, its response in China was to avoid addressing the core issue, attempting to shift the focus by claiming it was a smear campaign by 'hostile forces'. However, this response did not quell the controversy but further damaged the brand's image. BYD's management failure has not only harmed the company's own interestsbut also impacted China's national image. The most fundamental principle ofcorporate management is to respect and take care of employees. During China's most difficult times, the country still provided workers with clothing allowances and diplomatic etiquette training to maintain national dignity. However, today, some Chinese companies expanding abroad are attempting to cut costs, resorting to questionable practices, neglecting basic management principles, and putting workers' legal rights at risk. This is not only a failure in corporate management but also a blow to the country's reputation on the global stage. Similar issues also occurred at Fuyao Glass's U.S. factory. Fuyao triedto implement its highly efficient Chinese-style management model in the U.S. but overlooked the importance American workers place on labor rights and unionculture, leading to escalating management-employee conflicts. The documentary American Factory showcased Fuyao's lack of cultural adaptation, which sparked public criticism of 'Chinese-style capitalism'. Fuyao's experience highlights that entering developed markets comes with higher costs, and that only by respecting the cultural differences of the target market and adheringto local laws can a company achieve long-term growth. Ignoring these issues notonly fails to save costs but can also lead to greater hidden costs as conflicts escalate. Mr. Chan's perspective reveals the core challenges faced by companies expanding abroad. High-growth markets such as Africa and South America, while offering tremendous growth potential, come with high risk and cost. Meanwhile, developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, though more stable in terms of regulations, have high entry costs. Blindly pursuing growth or overly focusingon cost-cutting can lead to significant costs for companies expanding overseas. More importantly, when Chinese companies expand abroad, they not only represent themselves but also carry the image of the nation. Companies going abroad must not only pursue profits but also fulfill their responsibilities to employees, society, and the country. This means Chinese companies expanding abroad must abandon a 'shortcut-taking' mentality, as fulfilling basic responsibilities ismore important than anything else. If a company cannot even guarantee basic labor rights and management standards, how can it talk about brand building and long-term development? Some companies, in an effort to cut costs, have taken the misguided path of exchanging short-term gains for long-term costs, which not only plunges the company into crisis but also forces the country to be a rreputational damage. As Mr. Chan stated, companies expanding abroad must clarify their growth objectives while adhering to bottom-line management and making sound risk predictions. The balance between growth and cost is a constant challenge for Chinese companies expanding internationally. As they pursue growth, these companiesmust also confront the realities of costs and ensure they maintain strong management practices and cultural adaptation. In high-growth markets, understanding and managing risk is crucial, while in developed markets, a careful approach to cost is essential. Expanding abroad is a key step in the globalization of Chinese companies, but it is not without its difficulties. Byplan ning ahead, taking responsibility, and strategically balancing growth withcost management, companies can achieve sustainable success on the global stage. Final analysis conclusion: The international expansion of Chinese companies is a delicate balance between growth and cost. High-growth markets offer tremendous potential but come with significant risks, while developed markets have stable rules but higher entry costs. The cases of BYD and Fuyao Glass demonstrate that blindly pursuing growth or overly focusing on cost-cutting can lead to costly consequences, affecting both business interests and China's national reputation. Companies expanding abroad must set clear objectives and uphold their bottom lines, i.e., ensuring employee rights, complying with regulations,and adapting to cultural differences, while also managing risks. Only through responsible business practices can companies strike a balance between growth and cost, achieving true globalization.

Drone Production In South And North Korea – Analysis	By Dr. Ranjit Kumar Dhawan The Korean Peninsula is one of the highly militarised regions in the world. In the milieu of the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war since 2022, which has seen extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the export of defence equipment from both South and North Korea has significantly increased.1 South Korea has also been focusing on technological innovation in developing new defence systems. In this regard, drone technology has gained attention in South Korea as a new instrument in modern warfare. In North Korea also, drone technology is being used to develop more sophisticated systems for surveillance, as well as for combat operations. Defence Production in South and North Korea The experience of the devastating Korean War (1950–1953) had a deep impact on the development of defence industries in both South and North Korea. The Korean War ended only with an armistice which has still kept the two Koreas technically at war with each other. Due to the continued conflict on the Korean Peninsula, defence industries received top-most priority by the administrations in Seoul and Pyongyang. Apart from the threats of the outbreak of another major conflict on the Korean Peninsula which led to an arms race between South and North Korea, the urge to become ‘self-reliant’ in defence production had also been equally strong in both Seoul and Pyongyang.2 In South Korea, the defence production was largely promoted by the Park Chung-hee administration (1961–1979). In the wake of threats of withdrawal of the American troops from South Korea in the 1970s, the need to become self-reliant in defence became the goal of Seoul. In this regard, South Korea reverse engineered weapons mainly received from the United States. Also, the Park Chung-hee government collaborated with family-controlled big capitalist enterprises, known in Korean as chaebol, and provided them support to make the country self-reliant in defence production.3 In contrast to South Korea, the North Korean defence industries followed socialist principles of state ownership and were promoted to defend the country from the imperialist forces.4 Moreover, the urge to attain independence in international affairs under the larger ideology of Juche in North Korea gave national defence a key priority in the country.5 Although in the initial years after its establishment, North Korea was heavily dependent on the then Soviet Union for arms procurement, in the later period, the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang started manufacturing a number of weapons within the country. North Korean regime even focused on the development of nuclear weapons as part of its Juche ideology and to gain legitimacy from the domestic population.6 The North Korean regime exported some of its ballistic missile technologies in exchange for its nuclear weapons programme. In this regard, North Korea’s nuclear proliferation activities with Pakistan are now well-documented.7 Drones and the two Koreas The advancement made by South Korea in drone technology was displayed during the country’s Armed Forces Day parade on 1 October 2024, along with other military assets.8 A day later, South Korean government signed a deal on 2 October 2024 to buy about 200 units of Warmate suicide drones from WB Electronics firm of Poland.9 Also, for the first time in November 2024, South Korea and the United States conducted a joint military exercise for the use of drones in combat operations.10 This joint drone exercise tested the compatibility and synergy between the South Korean surveillance drone RQ-4B Global Hawk and the MQ-9 Reaper attack drone from the United States. It was also reported in December 2024 that South Korea is mulling to obtain about 100 cardboard drones to counter rising threats from North Korea.11 Later in December 2024, South Korea was stated to start the manufacture of medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) which are capable of producing high-resolution pictures. These would be used for surveillance against the North Korean targets.12 South Korea also planned to conduct military exercises in December 2024 against the infiltration of drones from North Korea in future.13 In the milieu of the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, North Korea has exported several tonnes of weapons to Russia, and has dispatched thousands of soldiers to fight against Ukraine in support of Moscow.14 The participation of North Korean soldiers in this war has been facilitated due to the ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ between Moscow and Pyongyang which was signed in June 2024, and later ratified in December 2024. This new treaty has the provision for mutual defence if either of the two countries comes under foreign invasion.15 It is also argued that North Korea’s participation in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kyiv would provide North Korean soldiers new experiences with regard to the modern warfare and use of drone technology.16 Recently, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called for significantly increasing the production of ‘suicide attack drones’ and has urged for more research on this technology.17 The increased production of the suicide drones by North Korea could also be meant for export to Russia to be used against the Ukrainian forces.18 However, the advancement in drone technology by the two Koreas could also be used against each other. In the past, drones were apparently sent by both North and South Korea across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreas, for spying or for spreading propaganda leaflets. In December 2022, South Korea accused North Korea for sending several drones towards Seoul and adjoining areas.19 This incident of North Korean drones entering into the South Korean airspace led to a serious security challenge for South Korea. Later, in October 2024, the Kim dynasty regime claimed that South Korea sent drones to scatter anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets over the sky of North Korea and warned of 'horrible disaster' if it happens again in future.20 The North Korean state media even released the pictures of a drone allegedly sent by Seoul.21 On the other hand, South Korean defence ministry flatly denied any role in sending drones laden with propaganda leaflets to North Korea.22 Conclusion The advent of the drone technology in modern warfare has created new opportunities and challenges. The demand for such low-cost, expendable, but precise and lethal power of drones has increased across the world. While it has helped export-oriented nations in their defence production, it has also added lethality by causing massive destruction at a much cheaper cost. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has proved the efficiency of the drones. In this regard, while the interest in the production and export of drones from both South and North Korea would help them economically, it may also increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Bangladesh: Can Sheikh Hasina, Awami League Make A Political Come...	By Sharifuzzaman Pintu The once formidable Awami League has faded from the limelight in Bangladesh, leading some political analysts to question the party’s future amid uncertainty about whether it will be allowed to participate in elections again. The AL, which led Bangladesh to independence in a vicious war against Pakistan in 1971, held power for 15 consecutive years under Sheikh Hasina until a student-led revolt toppled her in early August. Now, there’s a growing debate about whether the party and former Prime Minister Hasina, who led Awami for 45 years, can make a comeback in Bangladeshi politics in the wake of her downfall. Abdul Latif Masum, a political analyst and former professor of government and politics at Jahangirnagar University, said the party had previously faced a crisis caused by Hasina’s six-year exile following the assassination of her father, Bangladesh founding President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and other family members in 1975. It also survived the anti-dictatorship movement of the 1990s. 'Actually, this crisis is different from all the previous incidents, where Hasina has put herself, the party and countless leaders and workers in existential crisis by fleeing. So in my opinion, the future of Awami League is zero and Sheikh Hasina’s future is double zero,' he said. Others pointed to a lack of remorse from Hasina and Awami leaders over alleged abuses that were committed during her rule, which grew more autocratic toward the end. 'Despite the corruption, misgovernance and human rights abuses, neither Sheikh Hasina nor others in the party has shown regret or apologized,' Mujahidul Islam Selim, former president of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, told BenarNews. When asked if he or other Awami League members would apologize, A.F.M. Bahauddin Nasim, the party’s joint general-secretary, leveled counter-accusations of genocide and power-grabbing against interim government leader Muhammad Yunus and other leaders in the interim government. Yunus took over the reins of government on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled to India, where she remains in exile. Since then, Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrants in October against Hasina and AL associates for alleged crimes against humanity. More recently, the government filed a formal request for Hasina’s extradition from India in late December. Bahauddin Nasim remains defiant despite facing possible arrest. 'Many were killed and publicly hanged during the movement. People have seen those atrocities. The big question is whether the public would forgive them instead,' he told BenarNews from an undisclosed location. 'The Awami League is a people’s party. We remain humble before them and act appropriately at the right time.' While Hasina does not have a presence on social media, the Awami League posted a New Year’s message attributed to her on its X page. In it, she expressed hope for peace and prosperity in 2025 while lamenting that 'the likelihood of achieving these hopes has significantly diminished.' In addition, the statement said, the 'unconstitutional overthrow of the legitimate government in July 2024, through local and international conspiracies disguised as student protests, has resulted in an illegal, undemocratic group seizing state power. 'A once globally praised Bangladesh, known for its stable law and order, communal harmony, and robust socio-economic development, now finds itself grappling with chaos. The rule of law has collapsed, with crimes such as murder, robbery, and looting becoming everyday occurrences.' Student leaders concerned Student leaders who spearheaded protests that led to Hasina’s fall have expressed strong reservations about her party rejoining politics or participating in elections. 'The Awami League conducted three consecutive illegal elections. How can they be allowed another chance without first declaring those elections invalid,' Samantha Sharmin told BenarNews. She serves as spokeswoman for the Jatiya Nagorik Committee (JNC), which is comprised of protest leaders and which formed on Sept. 8. Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the pro-democracy student movement, has repeatedly emphasized that the Awami League must face trial before any discussion of election participation. Despite those calls, A.M.M. Nasir Uddin, the chief election commissioner, said unless the government or the courts banned AL, there would be no legal obstacle to the party participating in elections. Analyst Latif Masum said Awami members were delusional in their hope for a miraculous return led by Hasina. 'The anger and resentment surrounding the party are so intense that if they attempt a return, resistance will be overwhelming,' he told BenarNews. ‘People miss Sheikh Hasina’ Still, Hasina has support with AL. 'Since Aug. 5, ongoing injustices and anarchy have boosted the Awami League’s popularity,' said party leader Bahauddin Nasim, who added, 'People miss Sheikh Hasina.' In addition, some leaders of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP) have called for AL to participate in upcoming elections – Yunus recently called for a national vote to occur at the end of 2025 or by March 2026. The BNP, the main opposition party during Hasina’s rule, has been pressing the Yunus-led government to pave the way for a general election. 'We expect the election to be participatory. If anyone is to be excluded, it will be the people’s decision. However, anyone who commits a crime will face justice, and the government is responsible for that,' BNP Standing Committee member Hafiz Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. Sharmin, the JNC spokeswoman, argued that just as the AL could not gain legitimacy in elections or parliament without the BNP, the same held true for the BNP – it could not gain acceptance without the Awami League. 'With political unity, the Awami League could be banned directly. However, some political parties are opposing this, creating a dangerous situation. Those opposing the ban have strayed from the spirit of the mass uprising,' she said. Syed Anwar Hossain, historian and political analyst, said an AL return to power should not be discounted. 'The interim government continues past mistakes, worsening the human rights situation, leaving people afraid to speak up. With sky-high prices for essentials, ordinary people are suffering, making the change of a ruler irrelevant to them. These kinds of failures of the current or successive regime will create a path for the Awami League to return,' he told BenarNews. 'While Sheikh Hasina’s human rights violations must be addressed, the Awami League should still be allowed to participate in politics,' Hossain said. He pointed out that fallen rulers around the world, including in Bangladesh, have returned with great influence. 'Whether Sheikh Hasina succeeds or not remains uncertain, but the Awami League will endure – a truth many are reluctant to acknowledge,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3ARqdkcbZxKv	2025-01-03T16:21:22-08:00	
The Limits Of Transactionalism – OpEd	We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.' -- C.S. Lewis 'Men Without Chests' I recently returned from Spain where I participated in a seminar on The Defeat of the West, the most recent book by the well-known French historian Emmanuel Todd. Whether one agrees with all, part, or none of his thesis—I find myself in the second category—it is a compelling and suggestive read, one that in typical Todd style relies on the innovative mixing of demographic, anthropological, religious, and sociological theories to make its case. One would think that here in what we are constantly told is the beating heart of the West, a book such as this, written by someone who is widely acknowledged to be one of the more prestigious historians and public intellectuals in Europe and who, moreover, sports a very enviable record of prognostication (he was one of the first important public figures to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union), would be the subject of lively speculation on these shores. But as of yesterday this book, unlike so many of his others, was still unavailable in English, nearly a year after its publication. And outside of a brief article at Jacobin and another by the thankfully iconoclastic Christopher Caldwell at the New York Times, it has garnered no sustained attention within the chattering classes of the US left or right, a fate that would only seem to confirm one of the many excellent points he makes in the book: that one of the more salient features of societies that have started on a sharp descent into cultural decline is their enormous capacity to deny palpable realities. For Todd, decline is inexorably linked with cultural nihilism, by which he means a state of being defined by the generalized absence of consensually recognized moral and ethical structures within the society. Like Weber before him, he sees the rise of Protestantism, with its theretofore largely unknown emphasis on personal responsibility and probity in both personal and public matters, as key to the rise of the West. And he thus sees the final expiration of this same ethos among us, and especially among our elite classes, as heralding the end of our time of unchallenged world prominence. One can accept or not that it was the particular attributes of the Protestant mindset that, more than anything else, launched the West on its now 500-year reign of world hegemony. But I think it is harder to dispute his larger and what I think will be his more enduring point: that no society can impel itself toward the commission of great, creative, and hopefully humane things without a broadly agreed upon set of positive moral imperatives emanating from a purportedly transcendent font of power and energy. Put in a slightly different way, without a set of social norms modeled by our elite classes that encourage us to feel wonder and awe before the condition of being alive, and the sense of reverence that inevitably follows in their wake, human beings will inevitably redound to their most base impulses, something that in turn sets off endless rounds of infighting within the culture, and from there, its eventual collapse. After saying that, I could, if I wanted to play to the cheap seats, go on a long diatribe about how, over the last 12 or so years, the Democrats, with their many accomplices in the media, academia, and the Deep State have set out quite consciously to destroy this preternatural human impulse toward reverence and all that flows from it, doing so especially, and most criminally, in social spaces inhabited by the young. And no element of that would-be diatribe would be false or misleading. But in doing so, I’d be engaging in the type of lying and self-deception that these misnamed liberals, with whom I used to mostly identify, are so good at. The fact is that these so-called progressives were and still are working on well-fertilized terrain, land carefully tilled by Republicans in the wake of September 11thwith the plow of fear, the hoe of social ostracism and, above all, the stinking manure of conversation-ending false binaries in our civic discussions. You know, exchanges like this. Person 1: 'I’m troubled by the idea of destroying Iraq, thereby killing and displacing millions, when Saddam had nothing to do with Bin-Laden or September 11th'. Person 2: 'Oh, so you’re one of those America-hating types that loves terrorists and wants to let them kill us all.' Or things like the brutal cancelling of people like Susan Sontag and Phil Donahue, just to name two, who dared question the wisdom of purposely destroying a country that had had nothing to do with the attack on the Twin Towers. The conceptual thinking of human beings is largely delimited by the repertoire of verbal devices at their disposal. With more words and tropes come more concepts. With more concepts comes more imagination. Conversely, the fewer available words and concepts a person has, the less rich his repertoire of concepts and imaginative capabilities. Those who control our media on behalf of the super-elites are well aware of this reality. They knew, for example, that it was perfectly possible to be against what was done on September 11th and not be in any way in favor of the ideas and methods of bin Laden or the goal of punishing Iraq for his sins. But they also knew that allowing space for this concept in our verbal economy would greatly complicate their preconceived plan to remake the Middle East at the point of a gun. So, they used all the coercive powers at their disposal to disappear this mental possibility from our public life, purposefully impoverishing our public discourse to achieve their private ends. And, for the most part, it worked, paving the way for the use of the exact same techniques, only more widely and more viciously, during the Covid operation. Americans are a famously transactional people. And we have just elected a famously transactional President. I have nothing against transactional approaches to problem-solving per se. In fact, in the realm of foreign policy, I believe they can often be quite useful. And I believe that if Trump can do away with so many of the ideological aprioris that currently fog American elite thinking on its dealings with the world—including their need to see ourselves as inherently different and better than all other collectives on the earth—he will be doing us and all the world a great favor. There is, however, one great drawback with transactionalism as it relates to the issue of establishing or re-establishing what I earlier described as 'a broadly agreed upon set of moral imperatives emanating from a purportedly transcendent font of power and energy.' And it’s a big one. Transactionalism is by definition the art of manipulating what recognizably is, and is thus often indifferent when not openly hostile to the process of what we might need or want to be from a moral and ethical point of view down the road. Am I saying that Trump has no positive vision for the future of the US? No. What I am suggesting, however, is that his vision for the future appears to be rather delimited, and riven, moreover, with contradictions that may sink it in the longer run. From what I can tell, his outlook revolves around two major positive concepts (amidst a sea of others designed, for better or worse to undo the work of his predecessors (e.g. close up the border). They are a return to material prosperity and a renewed respect for the military, the police, and all other uniformed civil servants. A third, more vaguely and more confusingly expressed positive concept is that of transforming the US from an instigator of wars into a purveyor of peace. Returning material prosperity is of course a noble goal that if accomplished would alleviate a lot of citizen anxiety and misery. But it does not, in and of itself, address the problem of cultural nihilism that Todd sees as lying at the core of the West’s and hence the US’s social decline. In fact, a good case could be made that by renewing our obsession with the pursuit of material gains at the expense of more transcendently conceived goals, we could, in fact, be unwittingly hastening our descent down that hill of decline. And using the military as the prime placeholder for that which holds us together presents another set of problems. One of the key goals of those who planned the cultural and media response to 9-11 was to take a once broad field of social exemplarity where there were heroes of all social classes and types and reduce it to a space defined by narrowly conceived fixation on the military and those who wore uniforms. This, of course, played into the authoritarian and bellicose plans of the neocon warmongers who planned that propaganda effort. But looking back, we can see that this not only placed an undue and unrealistic moral burden on our servicemen—they are, after all, principally in the business of killing and maiming— but led to a dangerous narrowing of the discourse, central to the creation and maintenance of every healthy culture in history, of what it means to be a good person and to live the 'good life.' And as for peace, it is difficult to make a convincing case for it when it is clear that the US leadership class, including the faction about to enter the White House, has shown itself to be wholly indifferent to the gruesome slaughter of tens of thousands of maimed and slain children in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. Nope, largely limiting our repertoire of exemplarity to those who kill and those who get rich, with side helpings of praise for famous athletes and young women who exhibit surgically enhanced 'beauty,' really won’t do the trick. What exactly will, I don’t know. What I do know is that problems, such as the dramatic winnowing and hollowing out of our public discourses of social exemplarity can never be repaired if we don’t talk about them. When was the last time you talked in depth with a young person about what it means to live a good and fulfilling life as it is conceived of outside the parameters of economic gain or the game of acquiring reputation chits through the acquisition of titles and credentials? My guess is that for most of us it has been longer than we care to admit. And my sense is that a lot of that reticence comes from the fact many of us have been worn down by the overwhelming pressure in our culture to be 'pragmatic' and to not 'waste time' thinking about big questions like 'Why am I here?' and/or 'What does it mean beyond to live an internally harmonious and spiritually satisfying life? You know, those 'spiritual' things that in recent years have been portrayed by our elite culture planners as, take your pick, a marker of being a loopy New Ager or a culturally intolerant Right-Winger. But when we look at things in the broader expanse of history, it becomes clear that the real joke is likely to be on those who, desirous of achieving status in the pragmatically defined world, amputated their relationship to the world of holistic and reverent thinking. Or to put it in terms used by Ian McGilchrist, the joke is likely on those who passively subjugate the 'master' who inhabits the big-thinking right hemisphere of the brain to the restless, narrowly focused 'grabbing and getting' spirit of his 'emissary' who inhabits in the left side of his cranium. As contemporary thinkers as seemingly different as Stephen Covey and Joseph Campbell have argued, lasting satisfaction really only comes when we work, as it were, from the 'inside out,' bringing what we have found to be more or less true in our own internal dialogues and pilgrimages 'out' into our friendships and loveships, and from there, into the conversations we maintain with others in the public square. If, as Todd suggests, we have lost the spiritual ethos that allowed the West to gain favor and power in the preceding centuries, we better get down to work on creating a new social credo, understanding as we do so that while those focused on the spirit often easily conceive of the matter that surrounds them, those obsessed with matter generally have a harder time of doing the opposite.

Frail Egos And Sandpit Colonialism: Australia, The United States ...	Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard is in the news again. The release of Australian cabinet documents from 2004 – a supposed treat for historians of Australian history each new year – has been given a typically modest, calm and boringly anodyne treatment in media outlets. One topic featured should have caused continued sharp intakes of breath and stirs of indignation: Australia’s participation in the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Led by the United States with clinging support from the United Kingdom and Australia, ostensibly to disarm Saddam Hussein’s regime of biological, chemical and dare it be said, possible nuclear weapons, was a crude example of buccaneering, criminal adventurism. It was illegal, lacking the approval of the United Nations Security Council. It was almost certainly a crime against the peace, a higher offence developed by drafters and judicial authorities during the Nuremberg war crimes trials of 1945-6. The words of US chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, Robert H. Jackson, delivered in his opening statement to the International Military Tribunal in November 1945, are all too pertinent. While Nazi Germany is the target of his address, the US-led coalition can do just as well as substitutes: 'That attack on the peace of the world is a crime against international society which brings into international cognizance crimes in its aid and preparation which otherwise might be only internal concerns. It was aggressive war, which the nations of the world had renounced.' This vast hinterland of venality, incompetence, and indifference to international law – the very sort of things countries such as the United States and Australia hyperventilate over when concerning adversaries – should have received more comment. The issue of Iraq in the 2004 cabinet release receives some mention in David Lee’s rather skimpy overview, perhaps unsurprising given that he occupies the position of National Archives of Australia Cabinet Historian. In a comment to Guardian Australia, however, Lee makes a suggestion that should make the blood of service personnel and Australia’s citizenry boil. 'The balance of evidence we’ve seen from the cabinet records from 2003 and 2004 indicate that weapons of mass destruction is not the casus belli – the cause of war – for Australia, but rather Australia’s desire to strengthen the US alliance.' Put another way, the commitment was, as have most Australian commitments to war been over its short history, a matter of impressing others. The released documents do reveal that the Howard government, through its National Security Committee (NSC) of key ministers, had approved the deployment of forces three months prior to the official authorisation of Australia’s involvement on March 18, 2003, and began planning for it from August 2002 onwards. This meant that Australia, along with the US and UK, had long given up on getting a UN Security Council resolution authorising an invasion, let alone waiting for the findings from ongoing UN weapons inspectors. This hideous sense of a chugging, unstoppable train to war is evident in the admission on the part of Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, that the WMD issue was scratchy at best. A January 10, 2003 oral briefing on the efforts of the UN weapons inspectors drew a rueful observation: 'there was no confidence that the inspection process would uncover clear evidence of continuing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programmes'. On February 10, 2004, the NSC met to discuss the release of a public version of a review by the Department of Defence of Iraq operations. The advanced deployment, above all else, had to be kept secret from the public, described in the minute as 'the specific issue of public handling of when ADF action in Iraq commenced'. This had an added urgency, given that the Bush administration had, by January 2004, conceded that launching a war to disarm a state of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) had been without merit. The Howard government not only risked having its mendacity exposed, but its competence questioned. Showing that old dogs (and dogmas) are beyond learning new tricks, Howard remains unmoved and unenlightened by his role in this bloody affair. Last November, ahead of the release of the cabinet papers, he merely admitted to being disappointed by the failure of US intelligence assessments he refused to question. He still 'tenaciously' maintained 'that the decision was taken in good faith, based largely on what was called a national intelligence assessment.' When considering such assessments, the former PM continues to prove slippery. 'I knew from earlier examinations that there had been a failure to find stockpiles, in other words, the physical weapons, although there was plenty of capacity through programs to develop them rapidly.' When a failure to find something is paired with the capacity to develop it, its absence becomes irrelevant. The capacity to develop a weapon becomes the equivalent of hypothetically having it. As if hearing the sound of a distant arrest warrant being rustled up in The Hague, Howard concludes that, 'We were wrong, in fact, but not maliciously.' Like the fate that was to cruelly befall so many Iraqis and those in the broader Middle East, such a claim lacks legs, arms, or any limbs for that matter. It is also impossible to reconcile with the hardboiled zealotry that marked Washington’s desire to redraw the Middle East in a fit of forced democratisation. The journey into Mesopotamia was a blind mission of assumption and presumption: the instant, easeful discovery of WMDs in the possession of a madman previously feted by the West; the creation of a transitional authority without hiccup, despite a wholesale dismantling of the Baathist state. Neither eventuated. The invaders were sandpit colonialists, poorly costumed to reenact the glory days of European empires in the Middle East with trimmed forces and smaller budgets. What makes Australia’s own involvement even worse, was that the reason to go to war lay less in an international security threat than a weak ego and reputational yearning: to be cringingly worthy to Washington.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3PM4VmFwbFgq	2025-01-03T16:18:18-08:00	
African Union Developing A Ten-Year Comprehensive Agriculture Pro...	For three working days, 9th –11th January 2025, in the Speke Resort Conference Centre in Uganda's capital, Kampala, the African Union Commission (AUC) will host the Extraordinary Summit on the Post-Malabo Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). This Summit is supported by the Government of Uganda. The event is organized jointly by the African Union Commission, Department of Agriculture Rural Development Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment (DARBE) and African Union Development Agency- New Partnership African Development (AUDA-NEPAD). Dignitaries will deliver statements on the consideration of the Kampala Declaration, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) Ten-Year Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); the draft Statute of Africa Food Safety Agency; and the report on selection of African Union Centres of Excellence for Research and Training in Fisheries, Aquaculture, Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation and Ecosystems Management. The Objectives of the Summit: The convening of the extraordinary session of the Assembly is specifically to: Endorse the draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. The draft declaration provides a vision for transforming Africa’s Agrifood Systems for the period: 2026-2035. Endorse Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan: 2026-2035. This plan provides details on how to achieve the goals and targets in the draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. Risk Management and Mitigation The post-Malabo CAADP strategy will span ten years, from 2626 to 2035. Given the longtime horizon, many risks and uncertainties could affect the strategic positioning of the agri-food systems transformation agenda to deliver on its goals. There are external socioeconomic, environmental, and other shocks that might come up, which will demand that the strategy be agile enough to respond to such unforeseen developments. The strategy will therefore call for institutional adaptation to changes in a complex and rapidly changing context. Major risks and uncertainties will need to be identified and outlined together with their respective mitigation actions. Key interventions to ensure better risk management include: ● Identify potential risks (e.g., political instability, climate change) and put in place mechanisms for dealing with or mitigating such risks ● Identify health crises, including pandemics or epidemics, early and develop mechanisms for minimizing negative impacts ● Identify and address gender inequalities or biases and restrictive social norms that may limit the access of women and youth to education, resources, and decision making processes thereby preventing them from fully participating in and benefiting from agricultural activities or initiatives ● Invest in durable peace because it is essential for building resilient agri-food systems (from the local to global levels) and affects agricultural production, food security, market access, investment, resilience, and social cohesion. Establishing and maintaining peace is critical for enabling long-lasting investment to unlock the full potential of Africa's agri-food systems. The Kampala CAADP Declaration will need to emphasize establishing conflict-resolution mechanisms at the community level while strengthening local markets and value chains. ● Promote household insurance and other coping mechanisms that can help mitigate the impact of health shocks on livelihoods. These mechanisms will be key to enhancing the resilience of communities. ● Enhance public health surveillance systems to detect and respond to health threats, including of zoonotic origin. It will also be important to strengthen food safety measures to prevent health shocks related to foodborne diseases. ● Financial resources will be required to achieve the Kampala CAADP declaration's resilience objectives. Specifically, households need access to credit, savings, and other financial instruments that help them weather economic shocks. ● Food price monitoring: It will be necessary to implement policies that stabilize food markets and prevent price volatility to ensure a steady supply of food and agricultural inputs. ● Capacities development of African governments to formulate resilience-focused policy measures is a critical step and a priority for the CAADP Strategy and Action Plan. Mainstreaming resilience-focused policies will trickle down to operational actions led by various stakeholders towards sustainable agri-food systems. Background: The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) has been crucial in driving agricultural transformation across Africa since its inception in 2003. The program is aimed at increasing food security and nutrition, reducing rural poverty, creating employment, and contributing to economic development while safeguarding the environment. CAADP aims for a 6% annual growth rate in the agricultural sector, with African Union member states allocating at least 10% of their budgets to agriculture. Building on the Maputo Declaration (2003-2013), the 2014 Malabo CAADP Declaration renewed commitment to CAADP and established ambitious goals for 2025, including eradicating hunger, reducing malnutrition, tripling intra-African trade, and building resilience of livelihoods and production systems. The Malabo Declaration underscored the importance of mutual accountability through agricultural biennial reviews and recognized the essential role of related sectors like infrastructure and rural development. During the Thirty-Seventh Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly in February 2024, the Heads of State and Government expressed concern that the continent is not on track to meet the Malabo CAADP goals and targets by 2025. This has spurred a call for the development of a post-Malabo CAADP agenda to build resilient agri-food systems. It is in this context that the An Extraordinary Summit of The African Union Assembly of Heads of States and Governments is scheduled for January 9th to 11th 2025 in Kampala, Uganda, to deliberate on the post-Malabo CAADP agenda to consider the draft Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan with its associated draft Kampala Declaration on Advancing Africa's Inclusive Agrifood Systems Transformation for Sustainable Economic Growth and Shared Prosperity. Format and Structure of the Summit: The Extraordinary Summit will start with a one-day meeting of the Ministers responsible for Agriculture, Rural Development Water and Environment on the 9th of January 2025, to be followed by Joint Session of the Ministers of Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment together with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs on the 10th of January 2025. The sessions will feature two presentations the: i) draft CAADP Ten-Year Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); ii) draft Kampala CAADP Declaration and both will be done in closed sessions. The Ministerial sessions will be structured to encourage inclusive and interactive conversations and dialogue among the Ministers, as well as between the Ministers and key strategic stakeholders. At the same time, it will enable the Ministers to review the strategic documents presented to them for their consideration and recommendations to the Assembly. The Assembly of Heads of State and Government will convene on the 11th of January 2025 to endorse the: i) draft Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); ii) draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. Participants: The Extraordinary Summit on the CAADP Agenda will be attended by Heads of States and Government of the African Union Member State, Ministers of Foreign Affairs, PRCs, Ministers and Experts in-Charge of Agriculture (forestry, fisheries, crops and livestock), Rural Development, Water and Environment, RECs, Youth, Women, Non-State Actors, Media, Academia and Development Partners African Union: The AU is guided by its vision of 'An Integrated, Prosperous and Peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena.' The African Union (AU) is a continental body consisting of the 55 member states that make up the countries of the African Continent. To ensure the realisation of its objectives and the attainment of the Pan African Vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, Agenda 2063 was developed as a strategic framework for Africa's long term socio-economic and integrative transformation. Agenda 2063 calls for greater collaboration and support for African led initiatives to ensure the achievement of the aspirations of African people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3G3YrJqnlYH9	2025-01-03T16:15:41-08:00	
Georgia At The Crossroads – Analysis	By Luke Coffey For more than two months, mass demonstrations have dominated Georgia, a small, yet strategically vital, country in the South Caucasus. These protests initially erupted in response to parliamentary elections in late October, widely regarded by international and local observers as fraudulent. The situation intensified dramatically in November when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia would suspend its EU membership talks until at least 2028. Considering that 80 percent of Georgians support joining the bloc — according to consistent polling, including among Georgian Dream voters — this decision struck a nerve. The government’s actions have sparked a wave of unrest unseen since Georgia’s 2003 Rose Revolution. Adding fuel to the fire, Georgian Dream recently orchestrated the election of a new president under questionable circumstances. President Salome Zurabishvili’s term ended last month, marking the end of the Georgian people directly electing presidents. This time, the president was chosen by an Electoral College in parliament dominated by Georgian Dream. Opposition parties, boycotting parliament in protest of the October elections, were absent, effectively ensuring victory for Georgian Dream’s candidate. For the first time since independence in 1991, Georgia’s military abstained from its traditional parade in Tbilisi during the new president’s inauguration. This symbolic gesture from a military that prides itself on being apolitical reflects broader dissatisfaction within the institution. Meanwhile, Zurabishvili declared herself the 'people’s president,' pledging to challenge Georgian Dream’s increasing authoritarianism. In her parting words, she affirmed that the presidency’s legitimacy is rooted not in a building but in the will of the people, therefore arguing that she remains the legitimate president of the country. Georgian Dream’s transformation from a pro-Western coalition in 2012 to its current pro-Russian iteration is not surprising for those who follow Georgian politics. While elements of the party always harbored pro-Moscow sentiments, they were once marginalized by those who took a more Euro-Atlanticist outlook. Over the years, those pro-Russian voices have risen to prominence, sidelining Western-oriented members and redirecting the party’s trajectory. Today, Georgian Dream’s policies reflect a Kremlin-aligned worldview, including denouncing Western sanctions on Russia, deepening economic ties with Moscow, and blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine. Considering that Georgia has long aspired to join NATO and the EU, these are unusual policy positions to take. Georgia’s historical relationship with Russia is marked by betrayal. It is important to know this history to better understand the events of today. In the late 18th century, Imperial Russia offered security guarantees to the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, the precursor to modern Georgia, only to abandon it during a Persian invasion in 1795. After the Persians withdrew, Russia annexed Georgia in 1801. A similar betrayal occurred in 1920 when Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Moscow, pledging to respect Georgia’s sovereignty after the latter declared independence in 1918. Less than a year later, the Soviet Union invaded, overthrowing Georgia’s government and incorporating it into the USSR. This history of betrayal has left a deep mistrust of Russia among many Georgians. Life in the Soviet Union and the 2008 Russian invasion reinforced these fears. Moscow also occupies 20 percent of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory to this day. For Georgians, these historical grievances are not distant memories but lived realities, influencing their geopolitical aspirations. The current protests are the culmination of these grievances and fears. While Georgian Dream has maintained its grip on power through media suppression, undermining civil society, and discrediting political opposition, public discontent has reached a boiling point. Georgians have demonstrated their willingness to stand up for their European aspirations repeatedly, most notably in May when hundreds of thousands protested against a law seen as restricting civil society. But the current protests are different in their intensity, scale, and persistence. With Georgia’s EU membership aspirations enjoying widespread public support, the government’s decision to suspend talks has galvanized even those who previously supported Georgian Dream. The sheer size and duration of these protests are unprecedented in Georgia’s recent history. For comparison, the 2003 Rose Revolution lasted 21 days before achieving change, while Ukraine’s Euromaidan protests lasted 93 days. As of this week, the Georgian protests have surpassed 65 days, and show no signs of abating. The international community must pay closer attention to Georgia for two critical reasons. First, Georgia’s strategic location makes it a geopolitical linchpin. Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Georgia serves as a vital corridor for energy supplies, with oil and gas pipelines traversing its territory. These pipelines are essential for diversifying Europe’s energy sources and reducing dependence on Russian energy. Any instability in Georgia could disrupt these supply lines, with global ramifications. Second, Georgia’s crisis offers Russia an opportunity for intervention. With its setbacks in Syria and an inability to achieve a major breakthrough in Ukraine, the Kremlin may view Georgia as an easier target to reassert its influence. The current protests are not just about electoral fraud or the EU membership suspension; they are about Georgia’s identity and its place in the world. Will Georgia continue on its Euro-Atlantic trajectory, or will it revert back to the Russian orbit against the will of most people? As the world faces an array of challenges in 2025, from conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to economic instability, Georgia’s unfolding crisis might seem peripheral. But ignoring it would be a mistake. Georgia is at a crossroads, and its future hangs in the balance. The international community must not turn a blind eye. What happens in Georgia will not stay in Georgia — it will reverberate across the region and beyond. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

The New Hysteria: The Regime Pivots From Russians To Immigrants –...	By Ryan McMaken The debate over immigration is working out perfectly for the deep state. Donald Trump is calling on the CIA and the FBI to 'get involved' in domestic policing. At he same time, MAGA conservatives are begging the US government to impose a vast new surveillance state on Americans in the name of stopping illegal aliens. For at least four years, Russiagate hysteria has been used to promote more police statism, spying, military intervention, and government spending. Now, the incoming president Donald Trump will help the US regime seamlessly pivot from Russiagate hysteria to hysteria over Islamists and immigrants. The result will be the same: more growth in the federal police state and the further erosion of the Bill of Rights. This will be welcomed by MAGA conservatives who weeks earlier claimed to be suspicious of federal power and opponents of federal spy and police agencies. Trump’s Foreign Bogeymen and His Allies at the CIA On Thursday, Trump posted on X/Twitter demanding that 'The CIA must get involved, NOW, before it is too late,' presumably in reaction to the New Orleans New Years Eve massacre, which rightwing activists have declared to be an act of terrorism committed by an Islamist from an immigrant family. In the same post, Trump says 'This is what happens when you have OPEN BORDERS,' tying the issue of immigration to terrorism, and then demanding that the CIA become more active in domestic spying. Trump has already given a number of hints as to what will be used to justify the continued drumbeat for police statism under his second administration. Just prior to his post calling for an expanded CIA, Trump declared that 'Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe.' This is Trump’s version of the 'communists under your bed' hysteria of the 1950s, which, of course was used to justify the growth of the American security state during the Cold war. The Trump administration has already signaled its openness to a growing surveillance state through Trump’s chosen friends and alliances. For example, Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance is essentially bankrolled by Peter Thiel, founder of Palantir, a data mining firm thoroughly linked to the CIA. Thiel is a longtime advocate of a federal surveillance state, and now Trump proposes appointing Thiel’s protégé, Blake Masters, as head of the BATF. All the evidence points to an incoming administration that is very comfortable with helping the deep state get bigger and more powerful. After all, during Trump’s first administration, Trump immediately betrayed his promise to make the six-decade-old JFK files public, instead siding with CIA and FBI bureaucrats. Trump apparently believes that the taxpayers still must not be allowed to view basic historical records from the days when your grandfather was still hoping to move up to middle management at Studebaker Corporation. Moreover, during his first term, Trump issued an order giving more independence to the CIA, making it easier for the agency to conduct cyber attacks without oversight from the civilian government. Who can be surprised that he’s now calling on the CIA to do more? Using Immigration to Justify the Panopticon From the regime’s perspective, it was a brilliant move when Trump tied together the topic of Islamic terrorism—used to fuel the runaway police state of the Bush years—to the topic of immigration. This new synergy will be excellent for further growing state power. Indeed, it’s likely the regime can barely believe its good fortune on the immigration front. After years of subsidizing migrants with taxpayer dollars to balloon immigrant numbers, the regime will now be rewarded with vast new powers to 'solve' the problem. Opponents of immigration will throw their support to deep state agencies while demanding a stronger surveillance state that supporters tell themselves will only ever be used against immigrants. For example, back in November, Trump promised that, if reelected, 'We will finally complete the Biometric Entry/Exit Visa Tracking System which we need desperately. It will be on land, sea, and air. We will have a proper tracking system.' Meanwhile, the US Office of Biometric Identity Management plans to 'improve facial recognition technology' for children by collecting biometric data from immigrant children. This is all key to building the tools necessary for implementing nationwide AI surveillance tools. For years, anti-immigration activists have been calling for vast new federal powers such as national identification cards and 'E-verify,' so these new federal programs and powers are unlikely to meet any opposition from 'America First' activists. The incoming administration certainly has the connections necessary to make it all happen. Key to building the vast new databases justified by migrant control will be new AI tools developed by highly paid Silicon Valley tech bros like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. In September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison happily reported that 'Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on.' It’s not mentioned if non-citizens will be on their best behavior too, but it’s clear that citizens are going to be targeted every bit as much as any immigrant. In response to all this, some might say 'well you can’t just let immigrants do whatever they want.' Assuming we agree with this sentiment, we can still see that history has made it quite clear that immigration can be suppressed quite effectively—as it was from the 1950s to the 1990s—without a federal surveillance state. A surveillance state is not necessary to end migrant welfare. A surveillance state is not necessary to deport violent migrants. Nor a surveillance state necessary to drastically cut down on border crossings with walls and fences. Nonetheless, anti-immigration activists have been quite effectively duped by the federal regime which has gone to great lengths to drastically maximize immigration that would never be seen unless migrants were being actively rewarded with free cash upon entry. The ruse has worked well to get conservatives calling for vast new federal powers. The federal government has provided free room and board for millions of migrants, torn down border barriers, and opposed state-level efforts at border control. Then, rather than focus on ending the subsidizes and controlling the physical border—strategies that worked fine for decades—Trump doubles down on building a biometric visa tracking system. Heads, the feds win. Tails, you lose. Other supporters of the new ostensibly anti-immigrant police state may also say 'well it’s inevitable, so we might as well use the spy state against immigrants.' Yet, this isn’t even true because the surveillance state is heavily dependent on federal taxpayer dollars and federal cooperation. The ersatz 'entrepreneurs' like Thiel, Musk, Ellison, and others are all heavily subsidized by federal contracts and federal programs that continue to build partnerships between Silicon Valley, Langley, and the Pentagon. Without these nonstop subsidies—further fueled by ZIRP which funnels easy money to these politically favored industries—the AI panopticon would be years behind where it is now. In truth, the surveillance state is where it is because conservatives have spent so many years demanding that it get bigger. Whether it’s in the name of anti-terrorism or anti-immigration, the result is the further shredding of our privacy and the Fourth Amendment in the name of fighting the latest foreign bogeyman. Trump is just the latest manifestation of the same police-state impulse we witnessed in the Bush years. Worse yet, the current MAGA crop will repeat their own version of what we heard during the Bush years: you’re either with the president, or you’re with the terrorists.' Thanks in part to these conservative collaborators, the technocracy of total surveillance is coming. It will be wrapped in an American flag and proclaiming 'America first.'

Kyiv Plays Games With Russian Gas Transit – OpEd	The dataset by the Brussels-based think tank Brugel aggregating the data on European natural gas import flows and storage levels puts in perspective Ukraine’s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas to Europe. The statistics reveal that as of end-2024, Russia had become the second largest gas supplier to the EU after Norway, overtaking the United States — now, that’s 3 years into the Ukraine war and the Western ‘sanctions from hell’ notwithstanding. In particular, in December 2024, Russian LNG was delivered to Europe in an amount of 2.16 billion cubic meters — an all-time record since 2019. The European Union’s import of Russian LNG in 2024 amounted to almost 21.5 bcm against 17.8 bcm a year earlier and 19 bcm in 2022. What does this mean? First, EU countries find its irresistible to source LNG from Russia, which is reliable, abundant and cheap. Second, Ukraine’s decision, coming in the middle of the winter heating season, will trigger a price spiral for natural gas on the whole in Europe, but in immediate terms only. To borrow the words of Ralph Nader, if the use of solar energy has not been opened up, that’s because the (Russian) oil industry does not own the sun! Third, ensuing from the above, the demand of Russian LNG will only increase. Fourth, there is widespread discontent in European industry that the US suppliers have taken advantage of gas shortage in Europe due to the sabotage by the Americans, with help from Ukrainian henchmen, of the Nord Stream pipelines (which directly connected Russian source to German ports bypassing Ukraine). Big Oil subsequently sold LNG to Europeans twice or thrice the price in the US domestic market and made windfall profit. (here) Fifth, the skyrocketing gas prices will further shoot up the cost of production in European economies, especially Germany’s, which is also heading for parliamentary election on February 23. Sixth, there is bound to be resentment in the European mind that Ukraine is ‘biting the hand that feeds it.’ In Germany, there is already an undercurrent of opinion that energy ties with Russia ought to be revived for economic recovery, a stream of opinion that may swing the political fortunes of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) which is not only a far-right and right-wing populist political party but also Eurosceptic and calls for improving ties with Russia. On the other hand, if the set-up in Kiev hopes to please Big Oil, things are only likely getting more complicated in the transatlantic relationship under Donald Trump. Elon Musk, tech billionaire and close advisor to Trump penned an opinion piece last week supporting the AfD. Musk since doubled down and Vice President-elect JD Vance took to X to call Musk’s op-ed 'interesting.' Vance wrote: 'I’m not endorsing a party in the German elections, as it’s not my country and we hope to have good relations with all Germans. But this is an interesting piece. 'Also interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite, but AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.' According to Pew Research Centre, nineteen percent of German adults have a positive view of the AfD and the party is running second in opinion polls. Besides, AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance like Trump’s in relation to the US. Plainly put, the famous line of late American philosopher and social critic Eric Hoffer comes to mind — 'People who bite the hand that feeds them usually lick the boot that kicks them.' In this respect, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova’s statement on January 2 is to the point: 'The responsibility for the shutdown of Russian gas supplies lies entirely with the United States, the puppet Kiev regime and the authorities of European countries that sacrificed the wellbeing of their people in order to provide financial support to the US economy. 'The cessation of the supplies of reasonably priced and environmentally friendly energy from Russia not only weakens Europe’s economic potential but is also negatively affecting the living standards of Europeans. The geopolitical background of the Kiev regime’s decision is perfectly clear. It is the US – the key sponsor of the Ukraine crisis – that is the main beneficiary from the redistribution of the European energy market.' But that is a pipe dream. What cannot be overlooked is that Russia also used to sell oil to Germany at discounted price anchored on long-term agreements. President Vladimir Putin once disclosed a state secret that Germans even used to sell surplus Russian gas after its own use to third countries, especially Poland, to make a tidy profit to subsidise its domestic price. Apparently, given the centrality of Russian-German energy alliance in Russia’s strategic calculus, Moscow looked away. Such considerations probably weighed on Gorbachev’s mind too when he green-lighted German unification, ignoring Margaret Thatcher’s angst and France’s preference that the two German States (FRG and GDR) merely developed good relations, at most in the form of a confederation. (France was acutely afraid that Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost would persuade Germans to accept neutrality as the price of reunification.) These are indeed moments when one fails to understand such 'sentimental' Russian attitudes — be it on German unification or selling gas to Europe at discounted price, or the unilateral disbandment of Warsaw Pact (which, again, Thatcher thought was a rushed, premature decision.) This is rather intriguing since the Russians know better than any country, being the victim of waves of Western aggression in its tortuous history, that politics is hard ball. In the final analysis, Ukraine must be held responsible for this vengeful decision. But Kiev has expressed readiness to discuss preserving transit with Europeans. What emerged from the recent visit of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico to Moscow and his one-on-one with Putin is that Europe is ready to move the turnover point for Russian gas in Ukraine. He claimed Putin nodded consent, too. Putin told the media after the talks, 'Regardless of the war, our supplies were regular and we paid, and still pay… money for transit.' Actually, Ukraine gets $1 billion annually as transit fee! Putin added that Moscow is also ready to supply gas to Europe through Poland, using the existing Yamal-Europe route. 'All it needs is just pushing a button'. The Russian government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta quoted expert opinion that business circles are likely to initiate talks on resuming transit and, in fact, gas companies from Central Europe have already taken the first steps by signing a declaration supporting gas transit via Ukraine for 2025. Valery Andrianov, an associate professor at the Financial University under Russian Government told the daily that overall, halting supplies via Ukraine is not likely to cause a substantial gas deficit in Europe, as this has already been factored into gas prices, so it won’t be a surprise for the gas market. However, any interruption in supplies will increase the instability of the European gas market, making it more dependent on various external and largely uncontrollable factors, such as gas prices in Asia, delivery destinations of American LNG, or production dynamics on the Norwegian shelf.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3HUTVaKJglEb	2025-01-03T15:49:35-08:00	
Best Bet For 2025: Stronger Trade Ties Between Europe And China –...	One development for 2025 that can be seen clearly in the crystal ball is improving trade ties between China and Europe. The reason this is a virtual certainty is Donald Trump is doing everything he can to convince the world that, under his leadership, the United States is an unreliable trading partner. He already worked hard to establish this point in his first term when he arbitrarily slapped tariffs on various imports from Canada and the European Union. His ostensible rationale was national defense, but no one outside of Mar-a-Lago could take that one seriously. We worried that we may not be able to get steel from Canada if the US is engaged in a war with another country? Or maybe we’re worried we will be at war with Canada, and they will cut us off. But Trump is showing that the craziness will get even worse in his second term. Before even taking office Trump made strong demands that Canada and Mexico essentially do things they are already doing (block drug shipments and restrict the flow of immigrants) or he will slap 25 percent taxes on all the goods we import from them. This is bizarre from many angles, but most notably because Trump’s proposed import taxes would be a flagrant violation of the trade agreement he negotiated with Mexico and Canada just four and a half years ago. If Trump can just toss into the garbage a trade deal with two of our closest allies — one that he widely trumpeted at the time — then what would be the value of any deal he would strike with European countries? Clearly Trump does not feel bound by his commitments and there is no one in the US political structure who can force Trump to adhere to agreements made by the government, even when it was Trump himself who made the deal. This is the way Trump has always done business. He routinely reneged on his commitments and often refused to pay contractors after they had done work on his projects. Many contractors would insist on payment in advance from Trump because they knew they would have a tough time collecting after the fact. If the US is not going to be a reliable trading partner for at least the next four years, and possibly many more years into the future, Europe would be wise to look elsewhere. And there is one obvious elsewhere: China. China’s economy is in fact already considerably larger than the US economy and growing far more rapidly. This fact is obscured by the tendency in the US media to use exchange rate measures of GDP, rather than purchasing power parity (PPP) measures. An exchange rate measure simply takes a country’s GDP, measured in its own currency, and then converts it into dollars at the current exchange rate. By contrast, a PPP measure uses a common set of prices to assess the value of all the goods and services produced in each country. This would mean that we apply the same price for a car, a computer, and a haircut, in both the US and China. Economists would usually argue that for most purposes the PPP measure is more useful. By this measure, China’s economy grew larger than the US economy roughly a decade ago. It is now almost 30 percent larger, and according to I.M.F. projections will be more than 40 percent larger by the end of the decade. It’s not clear why the U.S. media insists on using the exchange rate measure of GDP in reporting that routinely refers to China as the world’s second-largest economy, perhaps it’s just nationalistic chauvinism. In any case, that call reflects political biases not realities in the world. The larger size of China’s economy makes it a more attractive trading partner in any case, but it is also more likely to stick to its commitments than the United States as long as Donald Trump is in charge. For this reason, we can be fairly certain that Europe will be looking to shore up its trade relations with China as Donald Trump puts on his clown show in Washington and Mar-a-Lago.

Robert Reich: The Only Real Firewall Against The Trump Regime – O...	As a practical matter, where will we find a firewall against the excesses of the Trump regime? The federal courts. You might say it doesn’t matter because the Supreme Court will rubber-stamp whatever Trump and his cronies want to do. Not so. The Supreme Court didn’t support all of Trump’s moves in his first administration (remember Trump’s Muslim ban?). More importantly, fewer than 1 percent of federal cases ever reach the Supreme Court. Given the amount of federal litigation likely to be created by the upcoming Trump administration, the Supreme Court probably won’t be able to deal with even 1 percent. Most disputes will be decided instead by 1,457 federal judges across 209 courts in the federal court system. Most of these federal judges were appointed by Democratic presidents. Of the 680 federal district court judges, 370 were appointed by Democrats compared to 267 by Republicans. Of the 179 federal courts of appeals judges, 89 were appointed by Republican presidents and 89 by Democratic presidents. Judges appointed by Democratic presidents hold the majority of seats on seven of the 13 regional courts of appeal. (Biden nominated and the Senate confirmed 235 federal judges — a quarter of all federal judges, and one more than Trump.) *** Examples of federal litigation we can expect: 1. Trump has promised to withhold, by executive action, birthright citizenship from people born in the United States to parents who are undocumented immigrants. Yet the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' The restriction, at the time of the amendment’s adoption in 1868, was widely understood to exclude foreign diplomats and native tribes. American Indians later started receiving birthright citizenship under a law passed in 1924. 2. Trump says he’ll refuse to spend money that Congress has authorized. 'When I return to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court,' Trump has said. 'With impoundment, we can simply choke off the money.' Wrong. Congress restricted impoundments in 1974 in response to Nixon’s efforts to unilaterally alter domestic programs. Trump’s OMB is expected to argue that the 1974 Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional. But the Constitution assigns Congress the 'power of the purse' to control taxation and spending. 3. Trump wants to revive a policy from late in his first term making it easier to fire tens of thousands of civil servants despite Biden’s moves to bolster their protections. When Trump does this, unions representing federal workers will appeal to the federal courts. 4. Trump will seek to raise tariffs across the board, arguably a move that requires congressional action. To impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, as Trump says he wants to do, would require his reliance on an emergency powers law that’s the basis for U.S. financial sanctions, but not the basis for tariffs. Such executive action would almost certainly be challenged by affected businesses. 5. Trump will try to erode Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without congressional approval. Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-chair (with Elon Musk) of Trump’s so-called 'Department' of Government Efficiency, asserts that he and Musk could cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without Congress’ approval. 'The executive branch has no obligation to send out a payment if it is wasteful,' he said. I doubt they’ll try to take on these popular programs head-on. More likely, they’ll try to alter eligibility or, as in the case of Medicaid, impose work requirements and make block-grants to the states. Where will this issue be decided? Again, in the federal courts. 6. Trump will seek to undo thousands of regulations through an executive order instructing agencies not to enforce them. Musk and Ramaswamy have already boasted that this is what Trump will do. The Administrative Procedure Act requires, however, an open process if agencies want to adopt or rescind regulations. Musk and Ramaswamy’s moves (via Trump) will be instantly appealed to the federal courts. 7. DOGE’s secrecy itself will be challenged. The Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 requires outside groups advising the executive branch to hold open meetings and include a range of perspectives. (The federal appeals court in Washington upheld the requirements during the first Trump administration, when a veterans group sued the Department of Veterans Affairs for relying on a trio of advisersbased out of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club.) Where will this be decided? The federal courts could order disclosures or even bar agencies from using recommendations from advisers who broke the rules. *** Trump’s incipient administration is already laying plans for this tsunami of federal litigation against the regime. 'Those who seek to delay or stall [Trump’s] agenda by filing litigation against the Trump administration will be subverting the will of the tens of millions of Americans who just reelected President Trump,' said Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. Rubbish. In light of Republican control over the White House and both chambers of Congress, litigation in the federal courts may be the only way to protect the rights of the tens of millions of Americans who didn’t elect Trump and even of many who did. Given that most of this litigation will be decided not by the Supreme Court but by federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents, there’s a fair chance that many of Trump’s initiatives will be found to be illegal.

Venezuela Puts A Price On The Head Of Exiled Opposition Candidate	(EurActiv) -- Venezuelan authorities announced Thursday (2 December) they are offering $100,000 for information leading to the capture of exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who insists he beat President Nicolás Maduro at the polls. Police published on social media a photo of the previously little-known ex-diplomat with the word 'wanted' under the image He fled to Spain in September after Maduro claimed victory in the 28 July election and cracked down hard on dissent. González Urrutia, 75, vowed to return to his troubled, economically distressed country to be sworn in as president on January 10 instead of Maduro, who is due to take the oath of office that day. Judicial officials told AFP that the wanted poster with Gonzalez Urrutia's face would be displayed at airports and police checkpoints around the country. Spain granted González Urrutia asylum on 20 December after Venezuela announced charges of conspiracy and racketeering against him. Venezuela declared Maduro the winner of a third six-year term in the July vote but the opposition cried foul, saying it has detailed polling station numbers that show Gonzalez Urrutia won handily. The government has resisted intense pressure at home and abroad to release vote results that prove its claim of victory. Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested. Three detainees died in prison, and nearly 1,400 of those originally arrested have been released. Maduro is a former bus driver hand-picked by the late socialist icon Hugo Chaves to succeed him upon his death in 2013. Maduro has overseen the oil-rich country's decline into economic ruin and been accused of acting like a harsh left wing dictator as he cracks down on dissent and clings to power. Only a handful of countries, including Venezuelan ally Russia, have recognized Maduro as the winner of the July election. The United States and the European Parliament have recognized González Urrutia as 'president-elect.' In October 2024 the European Parliament announced Venezuelan opposition leaders María Corina Machado and Edmundo González Urrutia as joint winners of this year’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the EU’s highest human rights award.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3PwEODyNaIi_	2025-01-03T15:44:44-08:00	
Biden Blocks Japan’s Nippon Steel From Buying US Steel	By Patsy Widakuswara President Joe Biden has made good on his months of public opposition to the proposed purchase of American company U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel, announcing Friday he is blocking the $14.9 billion takeover. The acquisition would 'place one of America’s largest steel producers under foreign control and create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains,' he said in a statement. He did not elaborate on how the deal would jeopardize national security. The collapse of the proposed acquisition represents a victory for the United Steelworkers union. Based in Pennsylvania, an electorally crucial swing state, the union in March endorsed Biden, who at that time was still running for reelection. 'This was clearly a political decision that President Biden had been chewing over for a long time. He is determined to demonstrate that he's going to protect American workers, and particularly in the steel sector,' said Matthew Goodman, director of the Council on Foreign Relations' RealEcon initiative, which explores the U.S. role in the international economy. 'It is an important sector, and it is subject to unfair trade practices, but it's hard to really understand the national security logic of blocking this transaction,' he told VOA. Federal law gives the president power to block a transaction based on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and made up of other Cabinet members. Last month, CFIUS failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby declined to clarify Biden's decision making based on the CFIUS process. 'The committee of national security and economic experts assessed that there was a security risk,' Kirby told VOA during his briefing Friday. The president made the decision based on 'his concurrence with that assessment and the risk that he saw, and that this is very much about keeping a critical company in American hands.' Biden made the announcement in his remaining days in office, despite some analysts and advisers warning that his rejection of the deal could damage relations with Japan, a key U.S. ally and trade partner — especially with a looming trade war under the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed to slap high tariffs on trading partners. 'We need allies especially in the war — a potential war against China,' said John Ferrari, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'Japan is a staunch ally in the Pacific. They have prowess in ship building and in manufacturing, and so we need them,' Ferrari told VOA. 'Allowing them to invest in the United States would make us stronger.' President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to come to power on Jan. 20, also opposes the acquisition. In a November social media post, he vowed to block the deal and to use tax incentives and tariffs to grow U.S. Steel. Both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have vowed to pursue legal action, saying that the U.S. government failed to follow proper procedures in considering the acquisition. 'The President’s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,' the companies said in a statement. 'Following President Biden’s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.' The White House dismissed U.S. Steel's warning that it may have to close steel mills if the deal with Nippon Steel fell through. 'The president is confident that domestic steel and domestic steel workers are going to continue to thrive because of the work that he's done, because of the commitment that he has to this industry,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during her Friday briefing. The announcement by Biden followed other protectionist moves by the administration. Last year, Biden tripled tariffs on steel imports from China. 'For too long, U.S. steel companies have faced unfair trade practices as foreign companies have dumped steel on global markets at artificially low prices, leading to job losses and factory closures in America,' he said in his statement Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3LkoLCavJtlc	2025-01-03T15:42:00-08:00	
South China Sea: 5 Things To Watch In 2025	The South China Sea has become one of the world’s most perilous geopolitical hot spots in recent years, with China stepping up the reinforcement of its expansive claims and countries from outside the region getting increasingly involved. Here are five areas to watch in 2025: Taiwan Strait The situation in the Taiwan Strait has been becoming notably more tense, with nearly 3,000 incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone between January and November 2024, as well as two major military exercises - Joint Sword A and B – coinciding with important political events on the self-ruled island. Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated in his New Year message that the unification of Taiwan was 'inevitable.' 'China will continue to hold exercises in 2025 if senior Taiwanese officials visit the United States or top U.S. officials visit Taiwan,' said Shen Ming-Shih, a research fellow at the top Taiwan government think tank, the Institute for National Defense Security Research (INDSR). Chinese military exercises such as joint fire strike, joint blockade, and joint anti-access and area denial will continue, but they will become less effective as Taiwan develops effective countermeasures, Shen said. Another INDSR research fellow, Ou Si-Fu, director of the Division of Chinese Politics, Military and Warfighting Concepts, told Radio Free Asia that China was not ready for a full-on war with Taiwan. 'Xi is not confident with his army,' Ou said, pointing to recent sackings in the top ranks of the People’s Liberation Army. 'The PLA has not fought a real war in a long time, so an imminent invasion of Taiwan is not expected,' the analyst said. 'They may be preparing their forces, but we are preparing, too.' Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te said in his New Year message that his government would increase the defense budget and strengthen military capabilities. Scarborough Shoal Latest developments at the chain of reefs in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone but under China’s de-facto control are worrisome. Just before the New Year, the PLA Southern Theater Command conducted large-scale combat readiness drills at the shoal that involved both naval and air force troops. China’s coast guard is maintaining a strong presence in the area, as is its maritime militia. A month earlier, Beijing announced a set of baselines around the Scarborough Shoal to define its territorial waters and airspace – a step seen as illegal by many but used by China to justify its actions against the Philippines and its ally the United States. The Chinese coastguard in early December fired a water cannon at a Philippine fisheries bureau boat taking supplies to fishermen in the shoal, saying it 'dangerously approached' Beijing’s territorial waters. 'You cannot draw baselines if you don’t own the features,' said former Philippine Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio. He suggested that the Philippines should challenge China’s announcement at an international tribunal. Scarborough Shoal is unoccupied and there are no structures on it but that may change in 2025, given Beijing’s assertiveness. Philippine forces have been removing Chinese floating barriers around the reefs but access by Filipino fishermen to their traditional fishing ground remains restricted. The Philippines is believed to be considering a new legal case against China for its violations of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea but since Beijing refused to take part and rejected the ruling of the 2016 U.N. arbitral tribunal, there is little chance it will participate. Second Thomas Shoal Throughout 2024, China and the Philippines were engaged in stand-offs at the Second Thomas Shoal, also inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, where Manila deliberately grounded an old warship in 1999 to serve as an outpost. In the last few years, China’s coast guard has been blocking and disrupting Philippine resupply missions to the ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, and the troops stationed there. On June 17, 2024, in an unprecedented confrontation, China coast guard personnel, armed with pikes and machetes, punctured Philippine boats and seized firearms during a Philippine rotate and resupply mission, wounding a Filipino sailor. Both sides later called for de-escalation. On Dec. 12, China said it had granted permission to the Philippines to resupply the 'illegally grounded' warship on Second Thomas Shoal on a humanitarian basis. But the June 17 incident showed that the situation could easily escalate into conflict, especially given the proximity of Second Thomas Shoal to a Chinese naval base on Mischief Reef, an artificial island that China built and has fully militarized. Manila and Washington signed a Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951 under which both parties are obliged to support each other in the event of an armed attack. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in November revealed that the U.S. military had set up a Task Force Ayungin, the Filipino name for the Second Thomas Shoal. Chief of the Philippine armed forces, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told an RFA reporter in Manila that his country was pursuing a three-pronged strategy when it comes to maritime defense: to establish an effective presence; to create effective deterrence and modernize military equipment; and to leverage alliances and partnerships with like-minded nations. Beijing, however, is not expected to give up its demand that Manila removes the BRP Sierra Madre and leave the disputed shoal. For its part, the Philippines is determined to defend it. 'We’ll never abandon our territory at Ayungin,' insisted Col. Xerxes Trinidad, the Philippine armed forces’ spokesperson. Vietnam’s island building Vietnam’s island building in the South China Sea has reached a record, with the total area created in the first six months of 2024 equaling that of 2022 and 2023 combined, according to a study by the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI). Between November 2023 and June 2024, Hanoi created 692 new acres (280 ha) of land across a total of 10 features in the Spratly archipelago. Vietnam’s overall dredging and landfill totaled about 2,360 acres (955 ha), roughly half of China’s 4,650 acres (1,881.7 ha). 'Three years from when it first began, Vietnam is still surprising observers with the ever-increasing scope of its dredging and landfill in the Spratly Islands,' AMTI said. Vietnam occupies 27 features and has been carrying out large-scale reclamation works on some over the past year. A new 3,000-meter airstrip is nearly finished on Barque Canada reef, where the total landfill area more than doubled in one year to nearly 2.5 square kilometers, or 617.7 acres, by October 2024. Vietnam has had only one airstrip on an island called Spratly, measuring 1,300 meters, but besides Barque Canada, AMTI said that 'it would be unsurprising' if Hanoi also considers runways on Pearson and Ladd reefs. New bases and runways 'would give Vietnam a position on the other side of China’s ‘Big Three’ islands,' said Tom Shugart, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. He was referring to China-developed Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs, which are the largest artificial islands in the South China Sea. The next four largest are all newly expanded Vietnamese reefs. 'Its progress in the last five months suggests that Hanoi is determined to maximize the strategic potential of the features it occupies,' said AMTI, adding that 'it remains difficult to say when the expansion will end—and what new capabilities Vietnam will have once it has.' Code of Conduct in the South China Sea Malaysia is taking over as chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, from Laos this month and every time the chair changes hands, the question of a legally binding code of conduct (COC) for all competing parties in the South China Sea surfaces. China and ASEAN countries have been negotiating a COC after reaching an initial Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002. More than two decades later, it seems many obstacles remain despite Beijing’s repeated assertions that the consultation process is going well and agreement is close. Premier Li Qiang told an ASEAN summit in October that China and the bloc were 'striving for early conclusion' of the code of conduct. China and five other parties, including four ASEAN countries – Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam – hold conflicting claims over parts of the South China Sea but China’s claim is by far the most expansive, covering nearly 90% of the sea. China is adamantly against what it sees as 'a politicization' of the COC, as well as any 'external interference' in the matter. Yet its assertiveness has prompted some countries to seek a counterweight from outside ASEAN. 'Negotiations on the COC continue at a snail’s pace,' former Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon told Reuters news agency in October. 'An agreement seems impossible,' said Philippine legal expert, former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio. 'China will never agree to some provisions, Vietnam to some others and so on. The target of concluding the COC by 2026, therefore, was 'unrealistic,' he said. One of the underlying obstacles is ASEAN’s own division and weakness. 'ASEAN could strengthen its collective bargaining power by aligning the interests of its member states and speaking with a unified voice in negotiations with external powers like China,' said Isha Gharti, a public policy professor at Thailand’s Chiang Mai University. It remains to be seen how the new chair Malaysia will seek to raise a collective ASEAN voice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3Lzdeg1qAiu3	2025-01-03T15:36:05-08:00	
US Law Enforcement Warned To Watch For New Orleans Copycat Attack...	The U.S. Homeland Security Department and the FBI are warning federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to be vigilant for potential copycat incidents inspired by the New Year’s Eve truck-ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people. In a joint intelligence bulletin released Friday, federal authorities warned the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for 'potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe.' The bulletin said such attacks 'are likely to remain attractive for aspiring attackers given vehicles' ease of acquisition and the low skill threshold necessary to conduct an attack.' The federal bulletin noted that since 2014, the Islamic State terror group has been promoting the use of vehicles in terror attacks, followed by attacks with secondary weapons, as a method to cause mass casualty incidents. The joint bulletin advised law enforcement agencies to look for danger signs, such as fraudulent documents or credit cards used to rent vehicles, or signs of 'pre-operational surveillance,' such as automobiles parked in odd locations or suspicious activity near an event location. The FBI released three photos Friday of the now deceased suspect in the attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, taken from surveillance video about an hour before the deadly Bourbon Street attack. They also released a photograph of a blue ice chest that was found near the scene containing an improvised explosive device. The photos were released along with a statement soliciting information from any member of the public who might have passed Jabbar on the street or saw the cooler like the one in the photo. The White House announced Friday that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to New Orleans on Monday to visit with families and community members affected by the attack, as well as meet with officials on the ground. In a briefing Thursday with reporters, FBI officials said they believe Jabbar, who was killed at the scene in a shootout with police, acted alone in the New Year’s attack and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia, with the agency’s counterterrorism division, said they concluded Jabbar had no accomplices following hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls, social media accounts and electronic devices. Officials reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. The attack occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m. On Tuesday evening, just hours before the attack, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag also was found in the vehicle after the attack. 'This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,' Raia said. Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends but worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said. 'He was 100% inspired by ISIS.' The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the truck and shot at responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the driver, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, the police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and an explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with other explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' he said. In the same post, Trump also falsely suggested that the suspect was an immigrant. VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin and VOA reporter Liam Scott contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3LZukjJeStd9	2025-01-03T15:30:39-08:00	
Zelenskyy Says Trump Could Be ‘Decisive’ In Ending War	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised interview broadcast on January 2 that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's 'unpredictability' could help end the war with Russia. Trump, who is set to be inaugurated on January 20, has said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office. Ukraine and other European countries have been skeptical about the claim and are concerned that a deal drafted by Trump could force Ukraine to give up territory to Russia in exchange for peace. Zelenskiy said in the interview that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is afraid of Trump, who he said could be 'decisive' in ending the war. 'He's very strong and unpredictable, and I would really like to see President Trump's unpredictability apply to Russia,' Zelenskiy said in the interview with Ukrainian TV. He also said Trump promised in a recent conversation that one of his first meetings after the inauguration would be with Zelenskiy. The Ukrainian leader has sought to build bridges with Trump amid concerns he could slow U.S. military aid or halt it entirely. Zelenskiy met Trump in Paris last month to discuss the war, and the idea of deploying European peacekeeping forces to monitor a potential cease-fire reportedly was on the agenda. Zelenskiy said in the interview that he supports the idea of France deploying peacekeepers to guarantee a cease-fire but said 'France alone is not enough' and stressed this would need to be a step toward joining NATO. 'We support this initiative, but. We would not want it to be one or two countries if it comes to this initiative. It should definitely be on the way to NATO,' Zelenskiy said. The idea of European forces in Ukraine is supported by some countries that have not yet spoken about it publicly, Zelenskiy said. But there are no specifics yet, he said, and a deployment of several thousand 'demonstrative' soldiers would not work. There must also be naval and aviation support, he said. Russia is against the deployment of Western peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the conflict, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this week. In an interview published on December 30, Lavrov said Moscow was 'not satisfied' with that idea and others being proposed by Trump, including postponing Ukrainian NATO membership for 20 years. Zelenskiy, who was interviewed together with his wife, Olena Zelenska, also discussed important achievements by the military in 2024, including the defeat of Russian plans to occupy Kharkiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya and the incursion into Russia's Kursk region. He acknowledged Ukraine's army is fatigued amid Russia's relentless assault on the front line but said the military 'will do everything to stabilize the front in January,' promising this should happen with the help of weapons due to arrive and with the return of Ukrainian military personnel who are training abroad. Asked about elections, which have been postponed because of the war, Zelenskiy said he didn't know whether he would run for a second term but added that presidential and parliamentary elections are possible after martial law is lifted. He suggested that this could even happen in 2025 if Ukraine manages to end the hot phase of the war in a strong position.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3EVSH0qoyici	2025-01-03T15:27:25-08:00	
Brazil Assumes BRICS Presidency As Bloc Expands	By Lucas Pordeus Leon On Wednesday (Jan. 1), Brazil assumed the BRICS rotating presidency for the fourth time, coinciding with the bloc's expansion to include at least nine new members by 2025. Brazil aims to prioritize global governance reform and sustainable development with a focus on social inclusion. Under the motto Strengthening Cooperation in the Global South for More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance, Brazil faces key challenges, including integrating new members and advancing the development of a local currency payment system to replace the dollar in trade among member countries. In early 2025, the BRICS bloc will welcome at least nine new members: Cuba, Bolivia, Indonesia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan, as confirmed by Russia via the state news agency Tass. Russia held the BRICS presidency in 2024. Professor Paulo Borba Casella, an international law expert from the BRICS Study Group (GEBRICS) at the University of São Paulo (USP), told Agência Brasil that a key challenge for the bloc's presidency is establishing a cohesive dynamic for the expanded BRICS. 'There are over a hundred working groups in a wide range of areas. We'll have to see how Brazil can contribute to making the BRICS function in its new configuration, with ten member states and a dozen more associated states. How will it work? No one has seen it yet, and no one knows,' Casella pondered. In total, thirteen countries have been invited to join BRICS. Nigeria, Turkey, Algeria, and Vietnam are also expected to confirm their participation. The decision to include new members was made in October 2024 during the 16th BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, where the new category of bloc partners was established. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm in which category the nine countries will join the group—whether as partners or full members. Unlike full members, partners can participate in meetings and events but do not have voting or veto power, as BRICS decisions are made by consensus. By 2024, the bloc had already welcomed five new full members, bringing the total to ten countries. Previously consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, BRICS expanded in the past year to include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi Arabia has not officially joined the group, it has participated in all of the meetings. Importance of BRICS Professor Maria Elena Rodríguez, coordinator of the BRICS research group at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC), noted that during Brazil's last presidency of the bloc, the government did not place much emphasis on BRICS—an approach she expects to change this year. 'The previous summit under the Brazilian presidency took place during the Bolsonaro government, and it was marked by a lack of significance and ambition. Now, BRICS is much more consolidated. Brazil must be well-prepared and demonstrate concrete progress, such as in negotiations involving local currencies. We need an agenda that helps elevate both Brazil and the Latin American continent within BRICS,' she said. Trump and BRICS The initiative to replace the dollar with local currencies has prompted US President-elect Donald Trump to threaten countries that abandon the American currency with higher taxes on their exports. According to Paulo Borba Casella, a professor at the University of São Paulo (USP), Trump cannot impose tariffs on all BRICS countries without harming the US economy. 'He's playing to the domestic electorate to make a point, but it's nonsense because the international system doesn't function solely through threats,' he said. Given Trump's behavior, Casella believes that forums like BRICS are gaining importance. 'It may be the role of BRICS to counter a rather petty and crude discourse from the point of view of international relations, such as Trump's style,' he added. BRICS has emerged as an alternative platform for dialogue and the integration of countries dissatisfied with the US-led, dollar-dominated international order. With its ten current full members, BRICS represents over 40 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the world's GDP by purchasing power, surpassing the economic influence of the G7, which includes the world's most industrialized nations. A key demand of the group is the reform of global governance, calling for greater representation of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in institutions such as the UN Security Council, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and financial organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3HFkfDZIGQ90	2025-01-03T15:25:34-08:00	
The Realms Of Doxa And Episteme In The Global Landscape – OpEd	A Metaphor for Global Politics and Journalism Doxa, the realm of common opinion and culturally contingent beliefs, serves as the starting point for collective understanding, often influenced by tradition and subjective experience. Episteme, by contrast, is the domain of justified, evidence-based knowledge, constructed through rigorous inquiry and logical reasoning. We can say that Episteme is a concept that is casually referred to objective truth and Doxa refers to opinion based truth. Together, these concepts provide a framework for examining how societies form, challenge, and refine their views. While the two realms seem distinct, they are deeply interconnected. Opinions formed in the Realm of Doxa often inspire the questions that guide us toward Episteme. Conversely, knowledge discovered in the Episteme must be effectively communicated back to the Doxa for it to have a meaningful impact. This knowledge, when disseminated through journalism, has fueled policy actions like the Paris Agreement. However, this interplay is fraught with challenges. False narratives from the Doxa can undermine the credibility of evidence-based knowledge. For instance, anti-vaccine movements, fueled by misinformation, have led to declining vaccination rates in certain regions. A 2023 World Health Organization report noted that measles cases surged by 80% globally due to vaccine hesitancy, emphasizing the need to bridge the gap between the realms effectively. Journalism’s primary role is to bridge the divide between Doxa and Episteme, translating the chaos of public opinion into actionable knowledge. Yet, this role has become increasingly complex in the digital age. The proliferation of 'fake news' and opinionated reporting has blurred the lines between fact and opinion. A Reuters Institute report in 2022 highlighted that only 42% of global audiences trust the news they consume. Despite these challenges, journalism remains pivotal in guiding societies toward informed decisions. Initiatives like fact-checking platforms (e.g., PolitiFact and Snopes) and investigative organizations (e.g., ProPublica) aim to counteract misinformation. They act as the modern-day seekers of Episteme, sifting through the noise to uncover the truth. The interplay of Doxa and Episteme is vividly illustrated in the global political and journalistic landscape, where public opinion and evidence-based reporting often clash or converge. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro’s dismissal of scientific warnings about COVID-19 and Amazon deforestation reflects how political leaders can manipulate the Doxa to suit their agendas, undermining trust in empirical knowledge. Meanwhile, in Hungary, state-controlled media under Viktor Orbán has blurred the lines between propaganda and journalism, weaponizing Doxa to stifle dissent and consolidate power. Contrastingly, journalists in regions like the European Union have sought to bridge the gap between belief and truth through initiatives like the European Digital Media Observatory, which combats fake news and promotes media literacy. These examples underscore how the struggle to balance Doxa and Episteme shapes not only public discourse but also the very fabric of governance and societal trust. The allegory of Doxa and Episteme challenges global leaders and journalists to uphold their responsibilities as navigators between belief and truth. Political leaders must ensure that policies are grounded in evidence while remaining sensitive to the voices of their constituents. For instance, New Zealand’s response to COVID-19 under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern exemplified this balance. By combining transparent communication with adherence to scientific advice, the country managed to maintain public trust and achieve relatively low infection rates. Last but not least, Pakistan, former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his political party, PTI, have leveraged misinformation and emotional narratives to challenge state institutions and rally public support. Through claims of political victimization and unverified conspiracy theories, they have fostered a divisive Doxa that undermines trust in democratic processes and the judiciary. Journalists, meanwhile, must commit to ethical storytelling and rigorous investigation. Training programs to enhance media literacy among citizens could empower audiences to discern fact from opinion. Furthermore, technological advancements like artificial intelligence can be leveraged to detect and counteract misinformation in real time. The journey from unexamined belief to evidence-based knowledge is not just a philosophical exercise but a practical imperative for global politics and journalism. By embracing this journey, societies can aspire to governance and journalism that not only reflect but elevate the human condition. It is a path that requires courage, discipline, and unwavering commitment to the truth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3Ki6pnQp13G1	2025-01-03T15:23:44-08:00	
Sentencing Of Hong Kong Democrats Just The Latest Legal Blow – An...	By Brendan Clift On 19 November 2024, a Hong Kong court sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists to jail terms between four and 10 years for conspiracy to commit subversion, an offence under the national security law Beijing imposed on the region in mid-2020. The 47 charged — a diverse group including lawmakers, academics, unionists, campaigners and community leaders — had participated in unofficial primary elections held by the pro-democracy camp in late 2020, with the aim of winning the maximum number of available seats at the next Legislative Council election to improve leverage over the government. More than 600,000 people voted in those primaries — almost 10 per cent of Hong Kong’s population — less than a year after the pro-democracy camp won a landslide victory in the 2019 District Council election, tripling its seats and ousting many pro-establishment politicians amid a record voter turnout. These votes revealed high levels of political engagement and support for opposition politicians at the same time as widespread and often unruly anti-government protests unfolded in Hong Kong. The government likely saw this combined movement as an existential threat that must be decisively put down. The ‘Hong Kong 47’ were not the first diverse opposition collective to be prosecuted — the 2019 ‘Umbrella Nine’ are a notable earlier example — but these proceedings were unprecedented in their scale. Sixteen defendants pleaded not guilty and stood trial before three specially selected ‘national security judges’ in the Court of First Instance. Fourteen of those were convicted, eight of whom plan to appeal their convictions and sentences. Western democracies criticised the Hong Kong 47 sentences and the handling of the cases overall, with Australia expressing ‘strong objections’ and the United States foreshadowing new visa restrictions on Hong Kong officials. Amnesty International called the affair ‘a ruthless purge of the opposition’ — an accurate assessment, given that the Hong Kong 47 included almost all pro-democracy candidates who were readying to contest the next Legislative Council election. In response to these critiques, the Hong Kong government issued a lengthy statement just one day after the sentences were handed down, condemning the ‘untruthful smearing and unscrupulous attacks’ coming from overseas. The statement labelled criticisms ‘typical despicable political manipulation’ and urged outsiders to ‘stop interfering in China’s internal affairs’, distinctive phrasing that confirms Beijing is now running the Hong Kong government’s public relations. National security laws are common worldwide, but Hong Kong’s is unusually strict. The subversion offence goes beyond the more common (but still controversial) offence of sedition by criminalising acts that merely disrupt or undermine the government. Its inchoate ‘conspiracy’ form attaches a harsh criminal penalty to a speculative disruption — and in this case, one that is an ordinary part of democratic politics, where legislative majorities rule. That is not even to mention the national security law’s presumption against bail, cancellation of trial by jury and mechanism to transfer major trials out of Hong Kong and into mainland jurisdiction. Also unusual by international standards is the Hong Kong government’s strong appetite for prosecution, which has included reviving long-abandoned criminal laws. In August 2024, editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted under a colonial sedition law that had lain dormant since 1967, after they published interviews and opinion articles on Hong Kong’s political malaise. Hong Kong’s courts continue to apply established judicial methods, like the principle that penal provisions are to be construed narrowly. But the impulse to protect civil and political rights is cooled by strict legislation and the political reality that Beijing has no more patience for regional autonomy. Courts in authoritarian contexts fear to assert themselves lest they be placed under further constraints. Hong Kong’s judiciary has already suffered several blows, including the resignation of foreign judges and the indefensible requirement that judges in national security cases are to be politically selected, which does little to dispel the impression that defendants may not receive a fair trial. The government and the courts make a virtue of long, detailed judgments which often run into the hundreds of pages, but conversations with local journalists suggest that all this judicial ink does little to clarify the safe ground for critical expression, nor does it convince the public that these laws and the decisions made under them are legitimate. The rule of law remains, but in diminished form. Hong Kong is open for business, but not for politics. The Legislative Council has already been reconfigured to prevent pro-democrats from being elected, and the Hong Kong 47 case shows that wider democratic behaviours have been criminalised. Meanwhile, changes to the education system are attempting to reprogram the population to accept political disempowerment. Despite the political persecution playing out in Hong Kong, news cycles are brief and, with no shortage of war and turmoil elsewhere in the world, limited attention is being paid to China’s peripheries. The world might take more notice if Beijing sent in the tanks, as some speculated they might. As it is, Hong Kong’s freedoms are experiencing a less dramatic, but similarly destructive, death by a thousand legalistic cuts.

Ignoring A Leopard’s Spots: The UK, Syria And Courting Dictators ...	Moral evangelists in power preaching about democracy and human rights resemble dowdy advocates of family values. When given a chance, they will wander, leaving their principles aside like unwanted impediments. This was certainly the case regarding various Western powers and their relationships with secular authoritarian powers in North Africa and the Middle East. For a stretch, leaders such as Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein were indispensable in keeping fiery Islamic fundamentalists in check, usually through means of killing, torture and detention. In doing so, sectarian and tribal divisions were patched up, keeping revolution at bay. Business could be undertaken, the corporations of the West kept happy. In time, these same figures fell out of favour in the most expeditious fashion. Gaddafi and Saddam became tabloid villains and cartoon grotesques, worthy of overthrow for their sudden threats to international security and butchering their own people. The idealogues in Washington and Downing Street seized the day with a canned, stupid enthusiasm, placing the grey world upon a Procrustean bed of values. In 2004, Bashar al-Assad, now the former leader of Syria, was not regarded as a despot crying out for overthrow by democracy inebriates. The list of achievements his regime did boast, however, was one of torture and the crushing of dissent, a specialty of his father Hafez’s three-decade rule. Having come to power in 2000, there were suggestions, coming largely from Britain, that a fruitful relationship might be formed with Bashar. UK diplomats were most enthused of all by these Levantine prospects, expressing admiration, according to documents obtained by Declassified UK in 2021, at Bashar’s 'desire for modernisation' and the continuing 'drive against corruption, instigated before his father’s death'. They also swooned at Hafez’s record (the Hama massacre of 1982 is skipped over), one that saw 'improved living standards, especially among the rural population'. A convinced UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, just over a month after the September 11, 2001 attacks on US soil by Al Qaeda operatives, made the first trip by a British leader to Syria. This was followed by a visit by Bashar and his wife, Asmaa, which also involved an audience with the late Queen Elizabeth II and the then Prince of Wales, the current King Charles III. The desire to engage Damascus was further invigorated by problems posed by the dottily catastrophic invasion of Iraq in March 2003 by US-led forces, charged with finding weapons of mass destruction they never did. The swift defeat of Iraq’s military forces in conventional combat, along with Saddam’s hurried exit, did little to stimulate peaceful instincts and turn swords into ploughshares. A fractured Iraq, sundered by faction and sect, became a beacon for jihadist causes. The group Baghdad had been baselessly accused of cavorting with, Al Qaeda, became a genuine threat to US troops and their allies. Foreign fighters, including a certain Islamist Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now famed as the man who overthrew Assad, hit his strides with them. In 2004, he was, along with associates, on the verge of establishing an Iraqi branch of the organisation. A worried Blair was desperately on the search for allies. Prior to Blair’s journey to Washington to meet President George W. Bush, a briefing note by the government released on December 31, 2024 by the UK National Archives charts the nature of Downing Street’s interest: 'Our primary concern remains the flow of terrorists into Iraq through Syria. We are pushing the Syrians hard to accept a visit from a team of senior officials from the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office], SIS [Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6] and MOD [Ministry of Defence] to address the issue.' Additionally, it was also hoped that 'an intelligence relationship which we hope will bear fruit' might arise. Then British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sought out the offices of his counterpart Farouk al-Sharaa, writing to him 'urging early cooperation on stemming the flow of terrorists entering Iraq through Syria.' The released note does little to indicate whether the Assad regime provided any such assistance, though some contextual relevance of this point was provided in October 2004 when talks were held between Straw and al-Sharaa. The Syrian foreign minister was particularly keen to swat any suggestions, largely coming from Washington, that Syrian territory was being used as a staging ground for a Sunni insurgency in Iraq led by former senior Ba’ath Party official Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed. While concerns were expressed about recruits crossing into Iraq from Syria, Bashar’s regime, along with those in Egypt and Libya, opened another front of cooperation to Bush and Blair. The regimes in question offered useful sites of collaboration in interrogating and torturing individuals suspected by Western intelligence agencies of being terrorist suspects. The British proved particularly sordid in this regard, bookishly seeking assurances from various governments via 'memoranda of understanding' that they would not, when receiving such suspects, be tortured. It was almost axiomatic that countries with true and tried records of torture were ones happily agreeing to reassurances they had no interest in observing: Jordan in August 2005; Libya in October that year, and Lebanon a month later. A chilling observation by former CIA operative Robert Baer to the New Statesman in May 2004 is worth recalling: 'If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want them to disappear – never to see them again – you send them to Egypt.' In an echo of history, the current UK government has found a new man of transactional worth in Damascus. The great usurper, Jolani, has taken Bashar’s place. His Al Qaeda and Islamic State past is being strategically sanitised, the revolutionary made good and useful. The assurances (that word again) of his Islamist group, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), itself a jihadist organisation of various iterations, including the Nusra Front, have been noted by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. These include a commitment to protecting the rights of minorities in Aleppo, Hama and Damascus, and an undertaking 'to co-operating with the international community over monitoring chemical weapons.' Lammy promises that HTS will be judged 'by their actions', their conduct monitored 'closely' in terms of how they treat civilians under their control.

The Five Central Asian Countries Remain Shaped By The ‘Soviet Str...	By Zhou Chao Independence is not only about the formal sovereignty of a nation but also about economic structural constraints. In Central Asia, this economic structure is what ANBOUND’s founder Mr. Kung Chan refers to as the 'Soviet structure'. Mr. Chan points out that, even today, and perhaps into the future, this 'Soviet structure' continues to deeply influence the long-term stability and security of the Central Asian region. A significant feature of the Soviet-era economic system was its strong planned nature. In the Central Asian region, Kyrgyzstan is an agricultural country, with agriculture being the backbone of its economy, accounting for 36% of its GDP. Uzbekistan is the world’s sixth-largest cotton producer and the second-largest cotton exporter. According to past data, 28% of Uzbekistan's workforce was in agriculture, which contributed 24% to its GDP. Tajikistan is the poorest country in Central Asia, with a low GDP; in 2006, its GDP was only 80% of what it had been in 1990. The country’s economy is also heavily reliant on agriculture and livestock. Thus, several key countries in the Central Asian region, influenced by the 'Soviet structure', have their economies and productive forces focused on water-intensive agricultural sectors, and this situation has not fundamentally changed. However, since the Soviet era, water scarcity has always been a significant challenge. The five Central Asian countries are located deep in the heart of the Eurasian continent, making it difficult for oceanic moisture to reach the region. As a result, the average annual precipitation in Central Asia is generally below 300 millimeters. In areas near the Aral Sea and the deserts of Turkmenistan, the annual rainfall is even as low as 75-100 millimeters. Only in the mountains and the southern slopes of the Fergana Valley does precipitation increase slightly, reaching 1,000-2,000 millimeters. Along with the low rainfall, evaporation is exceptionally high. For example, the annual evaporation rate from the Amu Darya Delta can reach 1,798 millimeters, which is 21 times the local precipitation. The five Central Asian countries not only face water scarcity, but the distribution of water resources is also extremely uneven. The southeastern part of Central Asia is home to the towering Tian Shan Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, where glaciers and snowfields serve as the most important sources of water. During the spring and summer, the melting ice and snow feed the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, which flow from southeast to northwest through the Turan Plain, passing through deserts and steppes, and eventually drain into the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya, which originates in the Tian Shan Mountains, is 2,212 kilometers long and flows through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. Its basin area is 219,000 square kilometers, with an average annual runoff of 33.6 billion cubic meters. The Amu Darya, on the other hand, originates in the Hindu Kush Mountains, stretches 2,540 kilometers, and flows through Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Its basin area is 465,000 square kilometers, with an average annual runoff of 43 billion cubic meters. Due to differences in the origins and lengths of the countries through which they flow, the two major rivers exhibit imbalances in terms of both flow and hydroelectric potential. In terms of flow, 43.4% originates in Tajikistan, 25.1% comes from Kyrgyzstan, 2.1% is from Kazakhstan, 9.6% is from Uzbekistan, and 1.2% comes from Turkmenistan. The upstream countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan contribute 68.5% of the flow. As for hydropower resources, Tajikistan accounts for 70%, and Kyrgyzstan accounts for 21%, totaling 91%. It is clear that both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan hold a dominant position in terms of both flow and hydroelectric resources. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the five Central Asian countries frequently clashed over water resources. Since 1990, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have fought over land and water in the Osh region, resulting in 300 casualties. In 1992, due to disputes over cross-border rivers between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan sent airborne troops to the Kyrgyz border, using force to pressure Kyrgyzstan. In the winter of 2000, Kyrgyzstan had to increase the water discharge from the Toktogul Reservoir to meet its domestic electricity needs after Uzbekistan stopped supplying natural gas. This resulted in large areas of Uzbekistan's cotton fields turning into swamps. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, management failures at the Toktogul Dam caused water shortages in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, leading to prolonged electricity shortages in Kyrgyzstan. The ensuing instability in Kyrgyzstan ultimately led to the downfall of then-President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, highlighting the highly political nature of water resource issues. In recent years, disputes over water resources among the five Central Asian countries have been rarely heard of. The five countries have also repeatedly expressed their intention to strengthen coordinated management and use of water resources, as well as to enhance consultation on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations. The situation regarding the water crisis seems to be showing signs of easing. However, researchers at ANBOUND believe that, based on a combination of historical and current factors, the water crisis in Central Asia is far from being truly alleviated. In the current and next 3-5 years, the water crisis will continue to disrupt the stability of the region's situation. First, the basic situation of the water crisis in Central Asia has not undergone any real change. As for the basic water resource situation in the five Central Asian countries, the state of water scarcity and the uneven distribution of water resources has not changed in any meaningful way. This inevitably means that the scarcity of water resources and the competition for them will not see any real easing. Due to economic development, the water crisis in the five Central Asian countries continues to worsen. The natural population growth rate in these countries is high, and the population structure is young, hence there is a strong and constant demand and consumption of natural resources. Rapid population growth means that there is a decline in per capita resource availability, and the shortage situation is becoming increasingly prominent. At the same time, in recent years, these countries have been actively attracting foreign investment, especially from China, to develop manufacturing industries, with plans for factories such as BYD's. The call for building data centers is also growing. Industrial production and data computing both require large amounts of water, which exacerbates the already limited water resources in the five Central Asian countries. Moreover, water pollution in Central Asia has been increasingly severe over the years. Data shows that in 2018 alone, sewage flowing into the Amu Darya River accounted for 35% of its total flow, with an even higher proportion in downstream Uzbekistan. Ecological deterioration means that the already scarce water resources are even less available for human use. Secondly, there has always been a lack of a strong and comprehensive mechanism for coordinating water resources and addressing the water crisis between the five Central Asian countries. During the Soviet era, through the construction of a series of water infrastructure and coordination of electricity resource distribution, the Soviet Union carried out a series of resource allocations and division of labor among the five Central Asian countries, establishing a water resource distribution mechanism between upstream and downstream regions. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the original coordination mechanism no longer existed, and water resource allocations, once an internal issue, became an international one. To fill the order vacuum created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in October 1991, the five Central Asian countries signed an agreement on cooperation in joint management, use, and protection of interstate sources of water resources. This agreement decided to establish the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC), whose main responsibilities included water resource allocation, water body operation and water quality monitoring, and the design and repair of hydraulic facilities in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins. However, the ICWC was unable to intervene in the domestic water policies of the countries, ultimately becoming an organization that only provided water resource information to the countries. Furthermore, the ICWC was not trusted by the other four Central Asian countries, as its personnel was largely from Uzbekistan. The repeated calls by the five Central Asian countries at international forums to address the water crisis in the region also highlighted the weakness of their internal coordination mechanisms. This lack of an effective regional leadership mechanism to address and resolve the water crisis makes it difficult to prevent the issue from fermenting and worsening. At the ICWC conference held at the end of April 2024, after experts from the five countries expressed their views, they have yet to reach a consensus, and an effective coordination mechanism remains elusive. Furthermore, international forces have long been hindering the efforts of the five Central Asian countries to address the water resource crisis. In recent years, international NGOs in Central Asia have become increasingly active, and most of these organizations have Western backgrounds. When it comes to environmental issues related to water resources, multinational NGOs often focus on aspects such as environmental protection and cultural heritage preservation. For instance, the Kyrgyz government planned to exclude the Chatkal River floodplain from the Besh-Aral State Nature Reserve to build a series of hydropower plants. The 'Rivers Without Boundaries' coalition issued a call to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, urging the Kyrgyz authorities to halt the plan. Environmentalists have also expressed concern about the Kyrgyz government's approval of gold mining and infrastructure development in the protected area. In response to Kazakhstan's new reservoir construction plan at the end of last year, relevant NGOs have argued from various perspectives that the plan is not feasible, and have organized petitions from local citizens to interfere with the process. In recent years, the five Central Asian countries have actively sought to attract Western capital, while the influence of international NGOs has steadily grown. The obstructive actions of these NGOs could undermine the efforts of the five countries to tackle the water crisis, further intensifying the situation. In November last year, the Eurasian Development Bank of Kazakhstan released a report stating that the five Central Asian countries will face a severe water crisis by 2028-29. In February this year, some analyses pointed out that due to increased irrigation demand, outdated infrastructure, and decreased water flow, the water consumption in the five Central Asian countries has risen sharply, surpassing the capacity of the main rivers, and the water crisis is imminent. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan even upgraded their river monitoring equipment in mid-February 2024 to closely monitor changes in flow. In this context, the lack of an effective coordination mechanism, coupled with the disruptive actions of international NGOs, will deepen the existing water crisis, potentially leading to regional conflict or even instability. The Soviet planned economy shaped Central Asia's focus on agricultural production, but this 'Soviet structure' has been severely impacted by water scarcity. Although the countries have gained independence in terms of national sovereignty, their economies remain tightly bound to water resource issues. This structure has not been loosened, as all the countries are still reliant on the basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, meaning they remain structurally interconnected. As long as the countries in Central Asia cannot break free from this 'Soviet structure', their independence in terms of national governance will only apply to political power, while their economic integration and shared dependence on water resources will continue to make the region a potential place of conflict and discord. Final analysis conclusion: ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out as early as ten years ago that the competition for water resources would become a significant cause of future conflicts. In the five Central Asian countries, where water resources are scarce and unevenly distributed, the combined effects of numerous adverse factors will make this issue highly prominent and will continue to disturb the stability of the regional situation.

Rare Earth In Myanmar: Economic Opportunity Or Environmental Cost...	By Naw Seng Myanmar’s rare earth mining industry sits at the intersection of short-term opportunity, environmental degradation, and geopolitical conflict, shaping the future of local communities and global rare earth supply chains. Key takeaways Some local communities stand to gain economically from rare earth mining, which generates jobs and raises wages for workers, who make roughly twice the national average. Risks associated with these opportunities include potential health risks from dangerous conditions at work, lack of regulatory oversight, and exploitation by foreign corporations. Local communities, the Myanmar military (SAC), and foreign companies, particularly from China, significantly impact the country's rare earth mining sector. Increased conflict and instability could result from the struggle to control these valuable resources, especially between the military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Deforestation, destruction of soil, and water pollution are the major environmental problems brought on by rare earth mining's uncontrolled nature. These effects put communities' long-term health and nearby ecosystems at risk. Sustainable practices and efficient governance are essential to balance economic development and mitigate these issues. 1. Overview of Rare Earth Elements The rare earth elements are divided into two groups, which are Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE-La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE-Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y). The 17 chemical elements known as rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many high-tech devices, such as smartphones, electric cars (EVs), and renewable energy sources. Rare earth elements are necessary to produce many goods, especially in the energy and technology industries. As the world moves toward clean energy and cutting-edge technologies, the demand for rare earth elements (REEs) is predicted to circle, possibly increasing three to seven times by 2040. With more than 58% of the world's supply, China controls most of the rare earth market, although Myanmar is making a growing contribution. Additionally, According to Investing News, globally, the producers of Rare earth are in first place, China with 68%, second place, Australia with 10%, Third place, USA 9%, and fourth place, 8% Myanmar, abundance of heavy rare earth element (HREE) deposits has made it a major player in the global rare earth supply chain. The stakeholders in Myanmar's rare earth mining industry—mostly from Kachin State—the economic consequences and the social and environmental effects of this profitable industry are covered in this analysis. 2. The Stakeholders in Myanmar's Rare Earth Mining 2.1. Local Communities Rare earth mining operations in Myanmar directly impact local communities, especially in Kachin State. There are negative impacts, such as social unrest and environmental weakening, even though some locals profit from employment prospects and higher incomes—earning much more than the national average. According to reports, local laborers can make about $600 a month, roughly twice the average salary in Myanmar. However, considering that mining operations are unregulated, the long-term viability of these jobs is uncertain. 2.2. Chinese Companies Chinese businesses are mainly involved in Myanmar's rare earth mining industry. One of the studies contradicts the belief that rare earth mining has decreased in China and increased in Myanmar. It shows a 130% increase in extractive mining area on the Chinese side and a 327% increase in surface mining area extraction on Myanmar's side. According to Voice of America, since 2014, they have been actively engaged in mining activities, making significant investments in areas such as Chipwi, Panwah, and Kanpaitee Townships. Since the Chinese government has long dominated the world market for rare earths, Chinese companies have looked to Myanmar to secure their supply chains as domestic production has been challenged. In 2014, Myanmar exported only $1.5 million, and by 2021, it had reached $ 780 million and found over 27,00 mining pools. ISP Myanmar reported that China imported rare earths from Myanmar, valued at almost $900 million in 2023 alone. 2.3. Myanmar Military and Local Governments The rare earth mining sector and Myanmar's military government, the State Administration Council (SAC), have a complicated relationship. Although the SAC has declared that rare earth mining is not officially allowed, mining operations have continued because the prohibitions have not been effectively enforced. The military uses the money from these operations to support its operations during ongoing conflicts, 'Civil War.' Similarly, Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) spokespersons had mentioned 'strict rules' regarding the Rare Earth mining companies due to the environmental shocks and ecosystems. Even though the KIO Chairman General N-Ban La met with residents, more than 1500 residents in Mai Ja Yang, he said, 'Rare earth mining will stop.' On the other hand, General N-Ban La said that 'the mining had been intended as a way to fund development projects and procure weapons for its war against the military junta.' This is evidenced by the local administration unit from Salingyi under the command of the National Unity Government (NUG), warning businesses like Wanbao Mining to stop working with the SAC. 2.4. International Corporations International companies indirectly profit from Myanmar's rare earth mining, especially those in the automotive and technology industries. Businesses in the West depend more on rare earth elements (REEs) to produce high-tech goods like electric cars as the demand for these minerals rises. According to industry experts, heavy rare earths from Myanmar will almost certainly be used in EV motors, underscoring the interconnection of global supply chains. 3. Economic Implications 3.1. Revenue Generation According to Global Witness, Myanmar's rare earth mining industry has grown to be a significant source of income. By 2021, the nation's rare earth exports to China had hit 780 million, up from just 1.5 million in 2014. Although this revenue infusion is essential for a nation dealing with economic difficulties, it questions whether such practices can be continued. The economic situation is made more difficult by the SAC's confidence in mining profits to finance its military operations. 3.2. Employment Opportunities This briefing paper series from the University of Warwick describes the various job categories in the rare earth mining industry. Men comprise most of the workforce in rare earth mining regions, though women work in some capacities, most notably as chefs and 'water watchers.' Jobs in the local economy, such as operating guesthouses, chopping firewood, and offering transportation services, are brought about by rare earth mining. Additionally, migrant workers generate demand for products frequently imported from China, such as clothing, cigarettes, snacks, alcohol, and toiletries. In isolated locations with high cash flow, some business people open local prostitutes, gambling establishments, and drug stores, all of which are unethical but profitable. However, these positions frequently carry risks, such as the possibility of being taken advantage of by foreign corporations and exposure to dangerous working conditions. Workers might not receive sufficient benefits or protections due to a lack of regulatory oversight. 3.3. Trade Relations with China China, the world's largest producer of rare earth minerals, is the leading destination for Myanmar's exports. Military conflicts and political tensions complicate trade dynamics between China and Myanmar. For example, China's trade restriction caused mining operations in Kachin State to temporarily halt due to the recent KIA taking over many rare earth mining areas. Myanmar's economy is significantly at risk from this dependence on a single market if geopolitical tensions increase. 4. Environmental and Social Impacts 4.1. Environmental Degradation Significant environmental effects result from the extraction of rare earth elements. Rare earth mining (REE) in China and Myanmar has caused environmental degradation and social harm. Despite high global demand, surface mine extents increased by 211% from 2005 to 2020. Land degradation and small-scale mining in areas like Kachin State indicate potential negative impacts on water resources. Mining operations negatively impact local ecosystems and communities. Concerns regarding the effects of mining on nearby communities and wildlife have been voiced by church leaders in Kachin State's Bamaw Diocese, according to a Union of Catholic Asia News report. These activities’ unregulated status worsens environmental decline, which has long-term effects on the area. Although in situ leaching is less expensive, doesn't involve excavation, and doesn't cause deforestation, it can lead to landslides and soil contamination. Comprehensive environmental assessments and regulations are necessary for proper management. 4.2. Social Disruption Concerns regarding drug use and migrant populations have arisen as a result of mining in Kachin State. Rural areas have changed, which has brought jobs. However, the loss of land, environmental harm, and pollution of rivers and streams also present new risks to livelihood. Farmers find it difficult to sell their products near mining sites, and water shortages impact farming livelihoods. Additionally, the Chipwe/Pangwa area is experiencing broader impacts from the rare earth mining boom, including sexual violence, rising drug use, community tensions, armed actors' control, and rural-to-urban migration. The situation has been made more difficult by the involvement of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar Military in those areas. The more significant conflict over controlling the region's valuable resources is reflected in the KIA's interest in creating its rare earth mine benefits. This competition may further impact local communities if there is increased violence and instability. 4.3. Health Risks Exposure to toxic substances used in rare earth extraction puts workers' health in the rare earth mining industry at risk. These risks are made worse by the absence of regulation and oversight in Myanmar's mining sector, risking locals' and employees' health and safety. Insufficient information on how mining operations affect health is essential for comprehending and reducing negative consequences. A more substantial evidence base requires evaluating local health data and assisting researchers and CSOs in gaining expertise, which raises questions about the long-term effects on community health. 5. Future Prospects 5.1. Regulatory Challenges Given the continuous political unrest and conflict, the future of rare earth mining in Myanmar is unclear. The SAC's inability to enforce mining laws questions the industry's viability. Furthermore, increased analysis of Myanmar's mining practices may result from international pressure for ethical mineral sourcing. If a company is discovered to be involved in environmental degradation or human rights violations, its reputation may be at risk. 5.2. Global Demand for Rare Earths Myanmar's position with an 8% contribution (4th place) in the supply chain might become even more crucial as the demand for rare earth elements rises globally. However, there are drawbacks since the nation has to balance social and environmental obligations and economic gains. If not handled appropriately, the possibility of more investment in the industry could result in more illegal exploitation. 5.3. Potential for Conflict Potential escalation of civil war in Myanmar may result from the struggle for control of rare earth resources. Increased violence and instability in the area could result in the KIA and SAC trying to take control of mining operations. Establishing a stable and sustainable mining industry needed to reflect on the Environmental Impact assessment plans (EIA), which were made more difficult during the ongoing conflict. Conclusion The rare earth mining operation in Kachin State, Myanmar, presents a complex trap of benefits and challenges. While some local communities, Chinese companies, and international corporations stand to gain economically, environmental and social costs to the local community cannot be overlooked. As the global demand for rare earths grows, Myanmar's role in this sector will be essential. Still, it must navigate the complicated balance between economic development and sustainable practices. The future of rare earth mining in Myanmar will depend on effective governance, responsible corporate practices, and the well-being of local communities.

The Crisis In Iran’s Shared Oil And Gas Fields – OpEd	Due to its geographical position and massive oil and gas reserves, Iran is one of the key energy players in the world. Iran holds 10% of global oil reserves and 18% of the world’s natural gas reserves. Forty-two percent of Iran’s gas reserves are shared with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Qatar, while 14% of its oil reserves are shared with Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, the UAE, and Iraq. On September 1, 2022, Iran Think Tanks website wrote, 'In more detail, Iran possesses 30 shared hydrocarbon fields, including both oil and gas, with Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, and Turkmenistan. These include 13 fields in the Persian Gulf, two in the Caspian Sea, and 15 on land. South Pars, the world’s largest gas field, and the giant Azadegan oil field are among the prominent fields in this list.' Shared Fields: Lost Opportunities One of Iran’s most important shared fields is the South Pars gas field, which is shared with Qatar. This field, the largest gas field in the world, supplies nearly 70% of Iran’s gas production. The declining pressure in the Iranian section of this field has sounded a serious alarm for the country’s energy future. Meanwhile, Qatar, with extensive investment and the use of advanced technologies, has managed to exploit a significant portion of this field’s capacity. In other shared oil fields, such as the Arash field, the situation is even more dire. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are rapidly advancing in this field. Similarly, in the West Karun fields, Iraq has reached exploitation by signing major contracts with international companies the peak of shared resource. Bureaucratic Processes and Delays in Issuing Permits One of the key factors contributing to the success of neighboring countries in developing shared fields is active energy diplomacy. The religious fascism ruling Iran has failed to establish bilateral, peaceful, and neighborly relations with neighboring countries. According to Erfan Afazeli, Secretary General of the Federation of the Oil Industry, one of the main reasons for Iran’s backwardness is the complexity of bureaucratic processes and the lengthy time required to issue permits. Energy expert Farzin Savadkouhi believes that Iran’s backwardness in developing shared fields is the direct result of the regime’s incorrect policies. Modern Technologies and Technical Knowledge One of the key factors in the development of shared fields is the use of advanced technologies and technical knowledge. Qatar, through investments in pressure-boosting technologies, has managed the pressure decline in the South Pars field. It should be noted that these delays stem from the policies of the regime. The regime’s priority has always been advancing the drone and missile industry and striving to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Red Alert and Emergency Conditions' The lack of development in shared fields has serious consequences for Iran’s economy. The reduction in oil and gas revenues, aside from directly impacting the national budget, exacerbates economic and social crises. Moreover, the loss of shared resources to neighboring countries weakens Iran’s position in the global energy market. The continuation of the current situation will only harm future generations and squander golden opportunities to exploit Iran’s vast energy resources. On December 23, Jahan-e Sanat news website quoted Savadkouhi as saying, 'There is no doubt that the development of shared fields should be prioritized because the current state of energy in the country is a red alert. We are in an emergency… The more this issue is delayed, the greater the harm to future generations.' Considering the above, is there any solution to save Iran, its national resources, and the fate of future generations other than overthrowing this anti-Iranian regime?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWerQvePz50ByWWAA2CCqklM	2025-01-02T16:27:48-08:00	
Xi Jinping’s Talk Of ‘Rainbows’ Belies Simmering Public Anger Ove...	By Alan Lu and An Ke Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed the new year with an upbeat speech to the nation complete with rainbows, claims of economic recovery and concern for the struggles of ordinary Chinese that commentators said belied simmering public anger over his handling of the economy. 'Together, we have experienced winds and rains and seen rainbows,' Xi told the nation in a speech marking the start to 2025 on Wednesday. 'China’s economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory ... Splendor adorns our motherland, and starlight graces every home,' he said. Xi’s speech name-checked his signature Belt and Road program and the China-Africa summit, as well as the country’s bid to produce cutting-edge technology in the face of U.S. export bans. China’s huge haul of gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics and the 25th anniversary of the handover of Macau were also named as milestones in 2024. But Xi’s speech came as many ordinary people in China are struggling to get by, commentators told RFA. At the end of last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs ordered cash-strapped governments at every level to issue one-off payouts to the nation’s poorest people over the New Year holiday. 'The notice encourages local governments with conditions to issue relief funds or increase one-time living subsidies in advance on the eve of New Year’s Day and Spring Festival, and ... that temporary price subsidies be issued to minimize the impact of price increases on the basic lives of people in need,' state news agency Xinhua reported. All local governments are required to identify the poorest families, including those who hadn’t met previous criteria for needing state assistance, the report said. 'We need to implement minimum social security, assistance and support for the extremely poor ... and put an end to perfunctory responsibilities, buck-passing, and procrastination,' the ministry said in a recent directive. Focus on internal matters Xi’s speech, while making its now obligatory pledge to ‘unify’ with democratic Taiwan, was more focused on domestic challenges, analysts told RFA Mandarin, and alluded to 'uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones.' 'We grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident,' Xi said. 'Xi Jinping’s remarks focused more on internal matters, highlighting [China’s] achievements,' Chen Ming-Chi, associate professor at the Center for Contemporary China at Taiwan’s National Tsinghua University told RFA Mandarin. 'Cross-strait issues were mentioned comparatively less.' But he said Xi’s 'red lines' remain the same, citing Beijing’s territorial claim on Taiwan, its rejection of Western-style democracy, Chinese Communist Party rule and China’s 'right to development.' He said Xi will be looking to uphold those key interests throughout the transition to the Trump administration. 'As Trump prepares to take office, China’s approach is to uphold its red lines and define its boundaries while not ruling out the possibility of dialogue,' Chen said. Xi has said he’s ready to work with the Trump administration, but has also warned that both countries stand to 'lose from confrontation,' as Trump announced plans to impose tariffs of at least 60% on Chinese imports. ‘Worst year’ to come Political commentator Lam Fei said people have never felt as hopeless going into a New Year as they do entering 2025. 'On the eve of 2025, the true public mood seems to be one of reluctantly waiting for the worst year in nearly half a century to arrive,' Lam wrote in a Jan. 2 commentary for RFA Cantonese, adding that Xi’s speech appeared to nod to the struggles of ordinary people. 'It seems that [Xi] finally realized the kind of hardship people have been going through in the two years since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted ... so it was hard for him to keep on playing the nationalist card,' Lam said. 'For the general public, merely surviving is becoming their overriding task, and this also sets the social tone for 2025.' 'People no longer expect freedom and democracy, they just want to survive the coming year.' Women have it tougher than anyone, Lam said, citing longer working hours and a greater burden of unpaid labor caring for children and the elderly. 'They also suffer more domestic violence ... as well as widespread gender discrimination in the workplace,' Lam said, adding that millions of women have taken to sex work or similar industries to make ends meet, in a political environment that is extremely hostile to women’s rights. Targeting dissent Veteran political commentator Hu Ping said Xi is unable to tolerate any public criticism of his handling of the economy, with any dissenting comments swiftly deleted from social media. He cited a Dec. 24 Weibo post by top economist Ren Zeping, who quoted a self-critical edict from a Han dynasty emperor from 89 BC, in which the emperor regrets his 'reckless' behavior that had caused the people to suffer. The post was deleted from Ren’s Weibo account after it went viral, with many online comments assuming it was a veiled criticism of Xi’s economic policies. Last month, censors took down a speech that went viral from economist Dong Shanwen, who warned that youth unemployment was tanking the economy, and that official growth figures had hugely underestimated the problem. 'The reason why supreme leaders [of the Chinese Communist Party] are the supreme leaders is that they are regarded as the embodiment of truth and the representative of the correct line,' Hu wrote in a recent commentary for RFA Mandarin. 'This means that any viewpoints and opinions that are different from those of the great leader are wrong by definition.' 'Anyone who insists on different political views is anti-party by definition and incites subversion of state power,' he said. 'If an emperor admits his mistakes, he is still an emperor. But if a Communist Party leader admits his mistakes, he will most likely be a leader no more,' Hu wrote, adding that the admission of mistakes is generally followed by a fall from grace. 'This is why Xi Jinping doesn’t want any talk of imperial edicts of repentance,' Hu said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWerQvePz50Byfz2oFCvJ_OI	2025-01-02T16:26:25-08:00	
AI In Malaysia’s Education – OpEd	As Malaysia prepares to embrace AI in education, educators need to equip themselves with the skills necessary to navigate this evolving landscape. By doing so, they can become effective advocates for their students and the future of Malaysian education. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in education presents significant opportunities and advantages, yet it also introduces challenges and potential drawbacks. With Malaysia moving towards incorporating AI into its educational system, especially following recent remarks by the Minister of Higher Education, Datuk Seri Dr. Zambry Abdul Kadir, it is essential to consider both the benefits and the risks carefully. AI can enhance teaching support, personalize learning, and streamline administrative tasks, but it also raises ethical concerns around bias, misinformation, and the evolving roles of educators. The intersection of AI and education in Malaysia is a dynamic landscape where innovation and caution must coexist, requiring a thoughtful approach to its adoption. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines, systems, or software capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to simulate or replicate human cognitive functions and adapt to new information and situations. The development of AI has progressed significantly over the decades, from early examples like Theseus, a remote-controlled mouse in the 1950s that could navigate a maze and remember the path it took, to today’s advanced AI applications powered by increased computing power, cloud technology, and access to large datasets. AI is now used in various fields, including conversational agents like ChatGPT, driverless cars, medical diagnostics, and dynamic pricing models, making its potential in education both exciting and concerning. In the context of Malaysian education, AI presents both pros and cons. On the downside, one of the primary concerns is bias. AI systems are only as reliable as the data they are trained on, and if this data contains biases, AI tools could perpetuate stereotypes and social inequalities, which is a significant concern in Malaysia's diverse society. For instance, biased grading algorithms could unfairly impact students based on race, gender, or socioeconomic background. Additionally, AI can generate errors and misinformation, providing inaccurate or outdated content that can mislead students and educators. This necessitates a critical approach to evaluating AI-generated information rather than accepting it at face value. Another drawback is the potential for cheating, as students can easily use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate essays, answer quizzes, or complete assignments, raising concerns about academic integrity. Although AI detectors exist, they can sometimes mistakenly flag original student work as AI-generated, complicating the situation for educators. Moreover, excessive reliance on AI could lead to reduced human interaction in learning, which may result in students feeling isolated. This is particularly problematic in Malaysia, where cultural values emphasize communal learning and personal connections, and such isolation could negatively impact student engagement and retention rates. Lastly, there are concerns about job displacement among educators, as the use of AI raises questions about the future of traditional teaching roles. On the positive side, AI can greatly assist educators by streamlining tasks such as lesson planning and grading, allowing Malaysian teachers to focus more on engaging with students and providing personalized instruction. AI can also offer instant support to students, helping them with difficult concepts when teachers are unavailable, which is particularly valuable in resource-limited Malaysian schools. Furthermore, AI-powered platforms can deliver individualized learning experiences by tailoring content to meet the diverse needs of Malaysian students, including those from different linguistic backgrounds. Enhanced contextual learning is another benefit. AI tutors can simulate interactions with historical or literary figures, providing students with immersive and engaging learning experiences that align with Malaysia’s educational goals of fostering critical thinking and creativity. Additionally, AI can analyze student performance data to provide personalized feedback and support, helping educators identify struggling students and develop effective interventions, thus enhancing the overall learning experience. Balancing the benefits of AI in Malaysian education with its potential drawbacks requires careful planning, ongoing evaluation, and thoughtful consideration of how AI can best be integrated into the educational system. While AI has the potential to empower educators, and accelerate learning, and personalized educational experiences, the risks of bias, misinformation, and student isolation must be addressed to ensure a positive impact on students and teachers alike. As Malaysia prepares to embrace AI in education, it is crucial for educators and policymakers to thoughtfully explore AI’s potential and align its integration with national educational goals and values, equipping educators with the skills necessary to navigate this evolving landscape and become effective advocates for their students and the future of Malaysian education.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8kf48SBuAMXq	2025-01-02T08:54:45-08:00	
A New Era: Ukraine Halts Gas Transit, Ending Russia’s Energy Domi...	For more than two decades, Russia has used its energy resources as a tool to exert pressure on Eastern Europe. As part of this strategy, President Vladimir Putin poured billions into the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline to bypass Ukraine. However, Ukraine has now taken a historic step by halting Russia’s ability to export gas directly to Europe, effectively ending Moscow’s long-standing dominance in the European energy market. As of 1 January 2025, gas transit from Russia to Europe via Ukraine has ceased entirely. Ukraine’s Naftogaz declined to renew its transit agreement with Russia’s Gazprom, which had been in place since 2019. This decision marks the end of a five-decade-long energy partnership. Europe’s Energy Transition The collapse of Russia’s dominance in the energy market is the result of Europe’s efforts to diversify its energy sources. However, this shift has increased Europe’s reliance on more expensive US liquefied natural gas (LNG). Rising energy costs, particularly during winter, are expected to place a significant financial burden on European consumers. Faced with the loss of the European market, Moscow is pivoting towards Asia, particularly China. However, these new agreements are far less lucrative than previous sales to Europe. The resulting decline in energy revenues significantly hampers Russia’s ability to fund its military operations, including its ongoing war in Ukraine. The Strategic Role of Ukraine and the US Ukraine’s decision to halt transit will result in a substantial loss of revenue, but it hopes to mitigate this through financial aid from the United States. Critics argue that this move is also part of a broader US strategy to pressure countries like Slovakia and Hungary, which have resisted purchasing American LNG in favour of alternative energy sources. Russia’s weaponisation of energy has ultimately backfired, delivering a significant blow to Moscow’s influence. Europe has taken a critical step toward reducing its dependence on Russian gas, bolstering its energy security. However, this new reality comes with higher costs, which will likely be borne by European citizens. As Europe navigates its energy crisis, supporting vulnerable countries like Moldova and ensuring transparency in energy policies will be crucial for maintaining stability and security across the continent. Türkiye’s Strategic Role With the Nord Stream pipelines decommissioned and Ukrainian routes closed, the Turkish Stream pipeline now serves as the only remaining connection for Russian gas to reach the European Union. This development underscores a recurring theme: Europe’s increasing dependence on Turkey for strategic issues. From immigration to energy, the continent now finds itself reliant on Ankara’s cooperation to address critical challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8p69GrtU_Ua2	2025-01-02T08:53:24-08:00	
The Islamic State And Europe – Analysis	By Jason Wahlang The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), located in Afghanistan, has focused on recruitment and mobilisation from around the region, including Central Asia and the Caucasus. It has also made overtures to supporters in Europe to commit acts of terrorism across the European continent.1 The ISKP has threatened to carry out attacks against events such as music concerts and sports events. This is, however, not a new tactic of the Islamic State, as the group or its various vilayets have attempted attacks on sporting events before. In 2015, it carried out attacks at the Stade De France and the Bataclan Theatre that led to the death of 131 people and injured over 400. Attacks by ISIS members/sympathisers have also occurred in Dortmund, Germany (2017) and in Brussels, Belgium (2023). On 23 August 2024, in the German city of Solingen, three people were killed in a knife attack by an Islamic State supporter. The threat posed by ISKP sympathisers have raised concerns in European countries. Islamic State Motives The IS, across its various vilayets, has drawn motivation from past events or current geopolitical complexities. Its 22 March 2024 attack on the Crocus City Hall in Moscow was attributed to Russia’s past military campaign in Afghanistan, its involvement in Syria and its actions in Chechnya. The IS has called for lone-wolf attacks against Jews and Christians in Europe in response to Israel’s military action in the Gaza Strip.2 It has urged its followers and sympathisers to take 'practical steps to fight the Jews'.3 IS propaganda mouthpieces highlight Western military support for Israel.4 The group uses past incidents such as the Bosnia massacres after the collapse of the Yugoslav state to radicalise individuals. It also glorifies incidents such as the 2015 Paris attacks, to create new narratives and recruit new cadres. IS propaganda outlets justified the killing of two Swedish citizens in Belgium in 2023 on account of the controversial Quran burning incidents in Sweden and Denmark. Pro-ISIS Al-‘Adiyat Foundation, an online media organisation, has targeted the Swedish leadership for allowing Quran burnings and asked people to attack the ‘crusaders’ in Sweden and across Europe.5 Islamic State Propaganda The Islamic State has been actively using social media platforms such as Telegram and other tools to spread its ideology and attempt to radicalise individuals. Different social media outlets, including TikTok and Telegram, along with its own magazines such as the Voice of Khorasan, have been used to spread its message. Since 2022, the Al-Azaim Foundation, which is run by the ISKP, has aggressively ramped up media production in multiple languages, including English.6 The Islamic State has focused on using various local languages to further its propaganda, as evident from multiple propaganda pieces in Tajik, Arabic, Pashtun, Bengali and Hindi which the group uses to connect with individuals living in Europe and the West. The group has published books, magazines and translations of its media material and provided subtitles and voice narration in English to connect with a large international audience.7 This is done mainly through the Voice of Khorasanmagazine, the flagship publication, with the objective being to connect with more radicalised elements in Europe and the West. Apart from the Voice of Khorasan, the Islamic State has also used the I’Iam Foundation to spread propaganda in Europe. Unlike the Al-Azaim Foundation,8 the I’Iam Foundation acts as a dark web channel and sets up crypto wallets to raise funds. It acts as a repository and distribution channel for its propaganda and collects cryptocurrency funds for operations.9 The I’Iam Foundation also acts as an archive of the Islamic State’s past print and video media content in various languages in addition to the regular translations of the newly added materials. The group has posted propaganda in various European languages, such as French and Spanish, to radicalise and further the cause of the IS. Another major outlet used by the Islamic State has been a coalition of independent propaganda collective called the ‘Fursan al-Tarjuma’ (Knights of Translation). The collective created in 2023 has merged 14 Islamic state entities, including Al-Azaim, to produce propaganda in 18 languages, including in English (Halummu) and in French (French Centre Mediatique An-Nur), which are both jihadi translation services used by the Islamic State.10 Government Responses One of Europe’s steadfast reactions to the Islamic State threats has been to raise the terrorism alert level. In August 2023, Sweden raised its threat level to 4, in the aftermath of the Quran burning incidents. The Netherlands also raised its terrorism alert level to 4 in December 2023. Threat level 4 is the second highest response level to a threat situation on a five-tier scale. Spain has maintained a level 4 security alert since the 2015 Paris attacks. Countries such as France and the United Kingdom have deployed additional security personnel to protect large gatherings, including sporting events. The ISKP issued threats against Germany, which hosted the EURO football tournament in the summer of 2024. In recent times, European countries have taken significant actions to counter the threat posed by IS propaganda activities. Germany, Spain, Netherlands, Iceland and the US took down IS propaganda websites in June 2024. Seven radicalised individuals were arrested. The propaganda outlets focused on French, English, Spanish, German and Danish content.11 The European Union has also put counter-terrorism as a priority with member states working closely with one another to prevent terror attacks and ensure safety of the population. These efforts have been prevalent since the terror attacks in Paris in 2015, and extra efforts were made in 2020 post attacks in Germany, France and Austria. With rising terror attacks in Europe since 2023, the member states have upped the ante and ensured there is effective information sharing to track terror activities.12 There is also cooperation with non-EU countries such as the Western Balkans, North Africa, the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa.13 There is increased intelligence collaboration and monitoring the activities of IS-affiliated suspects living in Europe. Collaboration and information sharing will continue to determine the long-term success of curbing terrorism in Europe, especially given the pan-European focus of the Islamic State.

The Likely Lads: Why Merz’s New Political Generation Will Decide ...	By Timo Lochocki In February 2025, Germany will hold a federal election—and polls indicate that the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) allies are likely to triumph. The change will usher in a generational shift of decision-makers in Berlin, which could see the country turning away from its supranational outlook and instead leading new intergovernmental alliances comprising of north-eastern European state groups, such as Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden. It could even stretch to non-European Union states like Norway and the United Kingdom. But this new approach does not so much stem from 69-year-old likely CDU chancellor Friedrich Merz as from the party’s leading figures. They are, by and large, much younger than Merz and view Germany’s role in Europe in a more self-assured way than previous generations of CDU politicians. Should Merz triumph, the new German government will have a mandate to pursue a foreign policy based on integration steps concerning defence spending and debt-sponsored innovation policies. Eventually, Germany will be less likely to aim for the broad supranational alliances it previously developed to ensure no state was left behind. Instead, a ‘two-speed Europe’ is likely—although it come at the cost of alienating Germany’s core EU partner, France. Competing visions Ever since German chancellor Olaf Scholz was sworn in three years ago, his ‘traffic light coalition’—comprising of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens, and the Free Democratic Party—lacked a clear leading party and had low public approval. In the absence of coherence, his government seemed less inclined to account for the interests of its European partners in foreign policy decisions. For example, the coalition approved a serious domestic economic stimulus package to cushion economic losses due to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. However, it did not consult Germany’s main European partners prior to its implementation, despite the package having a substantial effect on their economies. In contrast, former chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’— comprising the CDU, the CSU, and the SPD—enjoyed high public approval during her entire tenure. Now election polling shows the CDU and CSU in the lead once again, with between 30% and 32% of the vote. Indeed, as many people support the CDU and CSU as support the parties of the entire former traffic-light coalition, put together. These numbers indicate that the conservatives—with potential chancellor Merz at the helm—will win the election. Those who support ceding national power to the EU’s institutions might read this as a return to the supranationalism Germany exercised under Merkel. But trying to work out Merz’s whole personality requires slotting many seemingly contradictory aspects together; and this complexity in his character traits reflect in his politics. Some commentators argue that Merz is too pro-American and too spirited; too inclined to aim for one big partner like the United States, instead of forging compromises with many smaller European countries. During his interviews in the election campaign, he suggests going into debt to finance the German armed forces; but he also remains a fiscal hawk, a proponent of the famous-infamous 'black zero'—in other words, Merz is advocating for Germany to not take on any debt. This contradictory stance may herald the revival of a conflict with southern European economies over debt mutualisation. It is likely that, under Merz, Germany will instead act more in accordance with its short-term interests, building ad hoc intergovernmental alliances—such as with northern European states—in order to achieve this. Voters casting their CDU ballot in the hope of a more inclusive, supranational German leadership might be disappointed. Generational shift Merz is not the bearer of the coming change: he is part of an older generation of German leaders that is keen on power-sharing with EU institutions in Brussels. They understand modern German foreign policy also in the context of atonement for the atrocities committed during the second world war; Europe based its vindication on ensuring that Germany was denied a too-strong leadership. In turn, this relegated power to Brussels. However, the younger and more conservative Germans are, the less they are willing to link current German foreign policy with the impact of the second world war. This was apparent in the Eurozone crisis in the 2010s, where Germany rejected Greece’s demand that Berlin pay further second world war reparations; it became even clearer during the migration crisis in 2015, as international observers linked Europe’s hospitability towards refugees with the Holocaust. However, in their rhetoric, hardly any German politician made this explicit connection. The likely lads Furthermore, apart from Merz, the CDU’s leaders are generally younger—the powerful leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wüst, is 49; the informal leader of the CDU’s conservative wing, Jens Spahn, is 44. Politically socialised in a reunified Germany, this new generation refers to their country as a clear leader in both Europe and the EU. Their parents were born after the second world war, while their grandparents—who might retain some connection to the post-war order—have long since passed away. Consequently, they lack the ties which defined previous generations of German leaders. To them, restraint is a foreign policy concept not rooted in personal conviction. Their likely influence on Germany’s future foreign policy is reinforced by changing societal perceptions of the second world war, which is losing clout as the prime defining feature of Germany’s past. Instead, it is increasingly considered as just one aspect, superseded by democratic Germany’s success. Now, among younger and more conservative voters, there is a broad desire to see Germany acting more in its immediate national interest; for instance, by forging alliances with countries outside of the EU. This is also reflected in the rise of the AfD. Wüst alone represents at least one-third of the entire CDU’s political power, through his leadership of its chapter in the German state where it could have the most influence, North Rhine-Westphalia. For his part, Spahn leads the party’s informal but more conservative wing, which flirts with nationalist positions, in particular during migration debates. However, Merz needs the faction on board to decide any major future German foreign policy commitments. Ultimately, both Spahn and Wüst are heavyweights. They have the political credibility and rhetorical power to make the country’s wider conservative-leaning voters either back or oppose changes to German foreign policy. Two-speed Europe Germany pursuing a strategy based largely on its short-term national interests makes ongoing supranational integration unlikely. However, sometimes Germany’s focus on intergovernmentalism for its own interests can lead to greater integration leaps—for example, the 2022 European Sky Shield Initiative, which Germany led, as well as its swift purchasing of anti-aircraft defence systems for Ukraine. In reaction to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, Germany forged these schemes with some European partners—albeit against the will of France, Italy, and Poland. As such, appealing to short-term German political, economic, and security interests will be key for European partners that wish to retain a strong connection with a Merz government. Europeans should now stop expecting Germany to act in response to its action in the second world war, in particular when it comes to restraining its national power. Instead, Germany’s involvement in future European integration will be more entrenched in German realpolitik. The main advantage of a ‘two-speed Europe’ is that it could be a mere pause; a bridge, until the entire EU follows the example of the north-eastern group and makes greater steps towards integration. The arrival of the Schengen Agreement in 1985 is a good example of how this spill-over effect can impact the whole of Europe. The greatest disadvantage, however, lies in its polarising potential. Merz’s future foreign policy strategy is likely to alienate France and Italy, which are two countries already struggling with their currently limited impact on the European theatre. China and Russia could happily boost this spat by fueling nationalism and national inferiority complexes in both countries. * But the EU is well-practiced at internal diplomacy. Its decision-makers should know to embrace the German leadership whenever its policy is backed by implementable proposals that are shared by a large group of states and credible financial investment; and to let it peter out when it is just cheap talk. But the EU must not be offended by daring proposals to avoid exacerbating inner-European frictions. In short, Europeans should only react if a Germany under Merz puts its money where its mouth is and pursues a more self-assured foreign policy to achieve substantial integration leaps—even if this bold approach raises a few eyebrows at first.

China’s Silence Over Russia–North Korea Ties An Opportunity For T...	By Alexander Richter Relations between North Korea and Russia have developed rapidly over the course of 2024. For the first time in two decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea, culminating in a mutual defence pact. As a result of ever-closer relations, North Korea sent 10,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russia against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. This alliance has alarmed officials in Washington and Beijing. Sensing China’s unease with the developing security partnership between Russia and North Korea, the US State Department and European officials have urged China to leverage its influence to halt Pyongyang’s deployment of troops. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has so far remained silent and it is unlikely that US diplomatic pressure on China will persuade North Korea to change course. Instead, US diplomatic efforts should be oriented towards building international consensus with other states to delegitimise North Korean activities. To China, North Korea is both a strategic asset and liability. Historically, China and North Korea have maintained a close partnership, signing a mutual defence treaty in 1961 that remains in place today. China accounts for 90 per cent of all trade with North Korea and is an economic lifeline for the Kim regime. But China also views North Korea’s nuclear program as a destabilising force and has supported various efforts to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. Russia and North Korea’s security partnership exacerbates China’s insecurities. As Beijing is forced to share influence over Pyongyang with Moscow, North Korea has more room to improve its nuclear capabilities with Russia as an alternative benefactor of security and trade. North Korea’s deployment of troops will also draw unwanted attention from the United States and Europe — an outcome China seeks to avoid. Despite these frustrations, Beijing highly values its relationships with Russia and North Korea. China has been instrumental in propping up Russia’s defence industrial base and softening the impact of economic sanctions by exporting US$300 million worth of dual-use materials necessary for Russia’s weapons production. Although China has held back on directly supplying lethal aid to Russia to avoid triggering Western secondary sanctions, China does not want to see Russia defeated as it remains a strategic deterrent and partner against US coercion. It will certainly work in Beijing’s favour if North Korean soldiers strengthen Russia’s capability without costing China and risking external economic repercussions. Historically, China’s economic and diplomatic pressure has primarily been geared towardsNorth Korea’s nuclear program. But China refused to condemn North Korea for shelling Yeonpyeong Island, which killed four South Koreans, or for launching a torpedo at a South Korean warship that killed 46. This suggests that China is unlikely to condemn North Korea for the far less destabilising action of sending ground forces into Russia’s Kursk region. China’s lack of action so far indicates that North Korea’s troop deployments and engagement with Ukrainian forces do not place China’s ‘strategic security and core interests’ under threat. China almost certainly does not share the US view that North Korea’s support is ‘a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security’. Instead of unilaterally exerting diplomatic pressure, the United States should take this opportunity to shape norms by promoting territorial sovereignty and delegitimising North Korea’s military assistance to Russia. US–China relations are increasingly dominated by a power politics mindset in which China views the United States as bent on maintaining hegemony, resulting in disillusionment with good-faith diplomacy. Building a broad coalition of states to condemn North Korea’s troop deployments can signal to Beijing that the objective of withdrawing North Korean troops reflects the genuine concerns of the international community, rather than a strategy by Washington to advance US interests in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Part of China’s strategy to shape the global order is to portray itself as a leader and backer of the Global South. As much of the international community opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has an opportunity to build support among the Global South and co-opt China’s attempts at leadership. But many Global South countries rely on Russia economically and are unlikely to be receptive to US advances in condemning North Korea’s troop deployments in Russia. Some states, such as Niger’s new military junta, receives direct military support from Moscow. Others are economically dependent on Russia and prefer to balance relations, like India, who has expressed discontent yet has not explicitly condemned Russia’s invasion. The United States should identify countries in the Global South that are not susceptible to Russian coercion. It could engage with Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia to coordinate multilateral statements condemning North Korea’s deployment of forces. Southeast Asian states have criticised the United States for making them ‘pick sides’ in the US–China rivalry. But while picking sides in the US–China context could mean losing out on Chinese investment, Russia does not possess this influence in Southeast Asia. Diplomacy alone will not ensure Ukraine can end the war on favourable conditions or prevent North Korea from sending troops to Russia. Still, a concerted diplomatic effort to build international consensus condemning North Korea is essential in creating favourable political conditions to support Ukraine and dissuade other states from backing Russia.

Health For Humans: Behavioral Prescriptions – Analysis	By Nimisha Chadha The 21st century is governed by economic theories built on assumptions that do not always reflect reality. One such assumption is that of the Homo economicus—a perfectly rational individual who always maximises utility. While Rational Choice Theory presumes all individuals to be homo economicus, humans are only partly rational. Behavioural economics, a subset of behavioural science, is an interdisciplinary field that draws from psychology, neuroscience, anthropology, sociology and political science, among others, focusing primarily on decision-making and the impact of psychological factors on economic behaviour. In a complicated, fast-paced world, instinctive decisions using heuristics (rules of thumb) and mental models (shaped by socioeconomic and cultural influences) that have evolved over centuries aid faster decision-making, reducing cognitive load. Simultaneously, however, the lack of deliberate thinking often leads to systematically sub-optimal decisions. By incorporating psychological models in economic frameworks, development challenges can be better addressed. Application of behavioural insights Recognising human limitations, behavioural scientists use 'nudges,' which Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, defines as subtle changes in choice architecture (the context in which individuals make decisions) that alter behaviour predictably without restricting choice or significantly changing economic incentives. In Chicago, painting white stripes progressively closer together on roads approaching sharp turns created an illusion of speeding, reducing accidents by 36 percent. Brazil leveraged soap operas with strong female leads to boost women’s education leading to an 11 percent decline in fertility, demonstrating the potential of small, cost-effective changes to address complex challenges where traditional interventions fail. We are all surrounded by nudges—intentional or unintentional. By leveraging them, policies can be improved for societal benefit. Globally, over 600 behavioural insights or 'nudge' units have been established in governments, businesses, nonprofits, research centres and multilateral organisations, showcasing their growing relevance in policy development. Public health interventions in India In healthcare, the most challenging issues are often behavioural rather than medical, such as inadequate uptake of preventative care and indulging in high-risk behaviours like tobacco consumption—explained by 'Hyperbolic Discounting,' a heuristic, according to which, when choices and results are separated by time, the change in present utility is given more weight compared to the change in future utility. Tailored behaviour-centric policies can serve as a new prescription to current challenges, improving health outcomes. In 2019, NITI Aayog established the Behavioural Insights Unit (BIU) which aims to combat unconducive behaviour through the use of evidence-based solutions, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, state BIUs were set up in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to conduct on-ground research and test behaviourally-designed interventions. Currently, in collaboration with development partners, behavioural insights are being applied to boost the Aspirational Districts Programme in India. While India has made significant progress on the supply side (i.e., health infrastructure), behavioural constraints from the demand side (i.e., consumers) cause hindrances. For example, despite the provision of free iron-folic acid tablets by the government, their uptake remains low because of mental models of misconceptions and mistrust. In Madhya Pradesh, scratchable calendars were used to encourage pregnant women to take tablets daily, revealing a healthy baby upon adherence. Expectant mothers were also provided with a kit comprising the necessities for new mothers to reduce the cognitive load on them. In Maharashtra, glitter was used to illustrate the spread of germs when children shook hands, making the concept more salient for them, resulting in observed positive changes in children’s attitudes towards handwashing. During COVID-19, the gaming application Ludo King was used to promote COVID-appropriate behaviour using elements such as 'mask mode' and digital advertisements, helping change beliefs relating to mask effectiveness for 27.5 percent of the people and increase in intention to engage in safe COVID behaviours. These interventions represent the wide applicability of behavioural insights across age groups and differing socio-economic contexts, showcasing its immense scope in the Indian context. Way forward for India With the establishment of the BIUs in India, which is also the first BIU in South Asia, a dual responsibility falls upon it in introducing evidence-based insights not only within mainstream Indian policies but also contributing to the behavioural science community globally. Despite the implementation of some innovative interventions, gaps persist. In this regard, some recommendations are discussed below. Behavioural interventions, while cost-effective, raise ethical questions about autonomy and consent. Policymakers must ensure transparency to uphold individual autonomy and safeguard choice. Furthermore, interventions should align with societal norms and values to enhance acceptability and avoid marginalising vulnerable groups. Poorly designed choice architectures may have unintended consequences and risk reinforcing stereotypes or exacerbating inequalities, making inclusivity and cultural sensitivity critical. Sustainability is another challenge. Nudges often lose efficacy over time as their novelty wears off. Rigorous monitoring and evaluation are essential to assess long-term impacts and refine interventions. Ethical frameworks and ongoing research can help strike a balance between effectiveness and ethical responsibility. In India, the inclusion of behavioural components in Centrally Sponsored Schemes remains limited according to a 2022 evaluation by the BIU. Additionally, a study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), involving 60 nudge units from 23 countries, found that behavioural insights are often applied later in the regulatory process to address gaps. Moving forward, by adopting a proactive approach and incorporating behavioural insights during the initial stages of policy development, biases that undermine policy effectiveness can be better targeted. Within the domain of Indian public health, the centrally funded schemes primarily resort to Information, Education, and Communication strategies with limited fund allocation for behavioural channels. An experiment demonstrated that just providing information for widow pension schemes does not translate to increased applications, and accompanying behaviour change components are key to translating information into action. Moreover, many interventions are restricted to the regional level, indicating a potential for tailored expansion to state and national-level policies. Further, along with Bihar and UP, BIUs should be established in other states as well, considering the cultural diversity in India. Additionally, limited monitoring and evaluation are being conducted. Empirically tested interventions help identify gaps, assess impact in the short and long run, and accordingly scale successful interventions. Furthermore, nudges may not always be ideal, and analyses must be conducted to evaluate their net welfare effect. While the sectors of Health, Women and Child Development and Rural Development have been increasingly utilising behavioural insights, their application in domains such as social inclusion and labour markets is limited, both of which are social determinants of health. Further, nudges alone cannot resolve all issues. An intervention called 'Community-Led Total Sanitation', which aimed to create a defecation-free community in India and Indonesia in 2007 held public group discussions at sites of open defecation as a 'walk of shame' reducing open defecation by 7 percent in Indonesia and 11 percent in India. In India, it was combined with a subsidy for toilet construction, leading to 20 percent more toilets being built compared to Indonesia. This suggests that adequate resources and infrastructure are also essential and behavioural tools must be used as complements rather than substitutes for broader policy measures. The scope on the supply side also extends to physician behaviour as demonstrated by a study indicating improvement in patient safety and quality of care. A significant issue in India is that the community health workers often feel undervalued. Research suggests that recognition through social cues can boost morale and performance, strengthening social connections and triggering a sense of social approval. A 2010 Institut Public de Sondage d'Opinion Secteur survey found that the public acceptability of nudges is higher in less wealthy nations, including India; however, support for outright prohibitions on certain behaviours, such as smoking, is high as well. By fully understanding the level of acceptability and consequent experiences for people, policymakers can better assess the value of such interventions. To ensure that nudges do not adversely impact welfare by misuse through institutions, outlining laws and guidelines may be beneficial, such as the one by the Reserve Bank of India, requiring authentication for recurring transactions, targeting the default setting of automatic payment renewal, based on the status-quo bias, according to which, individuals tend to go for default options. Furthermore, by learning from global best practices, India can consider implementing similar policies. In terms of organ donation, for example, India faces a wide gap between demand and donors. By learning from countries such as Spain and the US, which have been successfully using behavioural tools to increase organ donations, India can combat such challenges. Additionally, the promotion of organ donation by Apple, in collaboration with Donate Life America, increasing registrations by over 6 million in the US, displayed the potential of public-private partnerships. Through global collaborations, the sharing of knowledge products and best practices can be facilitated, further advancing research. In conclusion, while cognitive biases are deeply ingrained, they can be addressed through context-specific behaviour-centric policies. Moving forward, as India continues to integrate behavioural tools to complement traditional policy approaches, it can create a resilient, equitable and effective public health system that addresses challenges for humans, not just homo economicus.

Facets Of Buddhist Life In Ancient Sri Lanka And India – Analysis	British historian William Dalrymple unravels interesting facets of Buddhist society before Christ It is generally accepted that Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in 247 BC when the Indian Buddhist Emperor Asoka (304–232 BC) sent his son Mahinda and daughter Sangamitta to preach the doctrine enunciated by Siddhartha Gautama six centuries earlier. Both Mahinda and Sangamitta were members of the Buddhist order, whose mission was to spread the faith far and wide. . Mahinda's first achievement in Sri Lanka was the conversion of the then King of Anuradhapura, Devanampiya Tissa, in 250 BC. The two had met accidentally in the forests of Mihintale near Anuradhapura, where Devanampiya Tissa was hunting. Upon conversion, the King inspired his subjects to adopt Buddhism. Mahinda's sister, Sanghamitta, followed Mahinda with the sampling of the sacred Bo tree from Buddha Gaya, under which the Buddha got Enlightenment. The sapling was planted in Anuradhapura, giving the converts in the island a focus and a direct link with the Enlightened One. However, according to British historian William Dalrymple, author of The Golden Road, Bloomsbury, London, 2024, Buddhism was by no means new to Sri Lankans when Mahinda came. Dalrymple says that King Devanampiya Tissa was a friend of Emperor Asoka's even before Mahinda's arrival. He would have known about his friend Asoka's faith. The two monarchs were in fact 'intimate friends, united by faithful affection,' Dalrymple says. It was Asoka who had asked Devanampiya Tissa to seek refuge in the Buddha as he himself had done. Further, as a token of friendship and camaraderie, Asoka had sent Devanampiya Tissa appropriate gifts during his re-coronation. Pointing out to very early links between Sri Lanka and Indian Buddhism, www.factsanddetails.com says that from the time of the arrival in Sri Lanka of Prince Vijaya from Bengal (in 543 BC), there had been a constant intercourse between India and Sri Lanka. Some of the South Indian Pandyan families, who came to Sri Lanka, had originally belonged to the Madhyadesa, the Indian region lying between the Himalayas in the North and the Vindhya mountains at the Centre. This vast area was traversed by the Buddha during his wanderings spread over 80 years. The people in these areas came under the sway of the Buddha. At least some of the Pandyas who migrated to Sri Lanka from the Madhyadesa might have been Buddhist and it was likely that they had spoken about Buddhism to the islanders. Some scholars like Hermann Oldenberg and G.P.Malalasekera however, believed that Buddhism came to Sri Lanka from Kalinga (present-day Odisha) through the sea route. Be that as it may, what is undisputed is that it was Mahinda (who became an Arahant later) and his first convert, King Devanampiya Tissa, who gave Sri Lankan Buddhism an organizational structure which helped the faith spread far and wide. The 20th century Sri Lankan monk, Walpola Rahula, even went to the extent of describing Arahant Mahinda as 'the father of Sinhalese literature' because he had translated and written a commentary on the Tripitaka in Sinhala, turning it into a literary language. Mahinda is also credited with introducing the culture of the Mauryan (Asokan) Empire to the island, along with its architecture. Cave Temples King Devanampiya Tissa set up the first monastery and a grand stupa to house the Buddha's relics in his kingdom. And Dalrymple adds that it was at Anuradhapura (the second largest city in South Asia after the Asokan capital of Pataliputra) that the Buddha's teachings were committed to writing on palm-leaf folios. That was in 50 BC. Subsequently, hundreds of monasteries were built across the island. In the Rajagala area of Ampara district, recent excavations revealed 593 archeologically important remains dating back to the First Century BC. According to UNESCO, apart for these, there are about 70 inscriptions in Rajagala, out of them the most important inscription is the one stating that the relics of Arahant Mahinda were enshrined in a stupa in the premises. This is the only inscription in Sri Lanka to identify the presence of Arahant Mahinda in the country. Growth of Monastic Culture The Buddha had urged the monks in the Sangha to go forth in all directions to spread the new doctrine, even saying that no two monks should go in the same direction. But the monks ceased to be peripatetic by the First Century BC, preferring to stay put in the rock caves in Central India, Dalrymple says. Due to this trend, more than 1000 rock cave dwellings came up in the hills overlooking the Western Indian coast for monks to live and preach Buddhism. These caves later grew into monasteries or Viharas. However, these early Viharas were more than meditation centres. They became places for congregational or community worship, the first in the history of Indian religions, Dalrymple says. The focus of attention in a monastery was the Stupa, housing the Buddha's relics. According to Dalrymple, the earliest sculptures in stone in India, were not Hindu, but Buddhist. This is because Vedic Hinduism was either 'aniconic' (without idols) or the Vedic Hindu idols were made of perishable material like wood. It was at the time of Asoka that stone temples with stone carvings came into being in India. And all religions existing in India at that time, adopted stone carving. The symbolism of the various faiths in India were adopted by all religions. Indian religions tended to be syncretic. For example, ferocious lions, snakes and male and female demons figured in the temples of all religions, including Buddhism. The coexistence of human and animal figures represented in Buddhist sculptures reflected the Buddhist view that humans and animals did not belong to different worlds but to one integrated world. In the Buddhist view, both humans and animals have a place in the cycle of birth and rebirth in which one could be an animal in one birth and a human in the next. Monks-Traders Link In India, Buddhist monasteries and the expanding trading community got inextricably linked. Indian traders lavished the monasteries with money and other offerings and the monks gave them blessings as well as an ideology which legitimised trading as a noble profession and not one to be scorned. The other notable aspect of early Buddhism in India, according to Dalrymple, was that Buddhist monks here were not 'ascetic' practicing severe self-abnegation. Given their ties with trading guilds, the monasteries soon became beneficiaries of the growing trade networks of South, South East and Central Asia. The monasteries were not only wealthy due to the donations given by merchants but were lending money for interest, as banks do today, he says. According to Dalrymple, in one of the early Buddhist texts, the Buddha himself had enjoined that 'endowments for the sake of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Community, must be lent on interest and the they required dated, witnessed and written contracts.' Some early Buddhist scriptures even have currency conversion! The Buddha was open to the accumulation of wealth which, in his view, was a 'necessary evil' until Nirvana (total liberation) was achieved. Monks were lauded for their business acumen as well as their wisdom. Buddhists saw wealth as a sign of 'good karma' and poverty as a sign of 'bad karma.' In Buddhist mythology, Bodhisattvas 'saved' merchants form shipwrecks, robbers and 'sea monsters'. A Bodhisattva is a compassionate deity who has reached the highest level of enlightenment but chooses to delay entry into paradise to help others. The First Century BC, during which Buddhism had spread far and wide across continents, was also a 'terrific' period of urban growth and international trading networks. The flourishing Indo-Mediterranean trade brought enormous prosperity to India's Western coast, especially. Contrast with Vedic Hinduism The Buddhist attitude to international trade and money-making was in sharp contrast to Brahminical or caste-ridden Hinduism which frowned on trade, especially international trade across seas, because travel across the seas could mean eating and living with non-Hindus and losing caste as a result. Caste taboos shackled Hindu traders but Buddhist traders were free from these, hence the close link between Buddhism and international trade in ancient India. In the Buddhist India, due to the absence of fuss about 'pollution' all foreigners, Buddhists as well non-Buddhists, were welcomed. And Buddhist monks took the ideas of the Buddha to much of South, South East and East Asia taking both the land and the sea route. Indeed, the Buddhist era in India was a progressive and glorious era, not just for itself but for the whole of Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8tRB809r9qnu	2025-01-01T16:13:41-08:00	
Influx Of Foreign Fighters Boosts Islamic State’s Presence In Som...	The Islamic State group has doubled its presence in Somalia in recent months due to an influence of foreign fighters, many of them coming from countries in Africa and the Middle East, according to the United Nations. The U.N. Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia estimates IS-Somalia now has 600 to 700 fighters. The expansion has enabled IS to expand its operations and challenge al-Shabaab, which is affiliated with IS’s rival al-Qaida. IS-Somalia has taken over some former al-Shabaab territory in the mountains of northern Somalia. Fighters are coming from Ethiopia, Morocco, Syria, Sudan, Tanzania and Yemen. In most cases, they enter Somalia through its northern Puntland state, which shares a border with Ethiopia and lies 300 kilometers across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Islamic State’s Yemen Province, which formed in 20014, has been engaged in Yemen’s civil war since 2015. The expansion of Islamic State in Somalia coincides with that group’s growing prominence among the broader IS organization. IS-Somalia has also become a key source of funding for IS operations in Africa. 'Despite being relatively limited inside Somalia compared to its rival in al-Qaida’s al-Shabaab, the Islamic State’s Somalia Province is punching well above its weight internationally and has become one of the Islamic State’s most important global branches,' analysts Caleb Weiss and Lucas Webber wrote for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. IS-Somalia took shape in 2015 after al-Shabaab fighters left that terror group and pledged allegiance to IS. After suffering military defeats by state and federal forces, IS-Somalia made progress expanding its presence in the Bari region of Puntland and attracted foreign fighters, according to the U.N. report. IS-Somalia now has footholds in the Balidhidin, Hunbays, Iskushuban and Qandala districts of the Bari region, according to the U.N. Bari makes up the northern tip of Somalia and lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Bari is the home of the port city of Bosaso, which both IS-Somalia and al-Shabaab use to import fighters and equipment. Both run extortion operations at the port and, to date, neither has been able to take complete control of the facility. 'IS’s small size and basing in more remote areas will continue to prevent it from exerting the level of physical control necessary to uproot al-Shabaab’s financial networks,' analyst Liam Karr wrote earlier this year for the Institute for the Study of War. In August, Puntland authorities intercepted five kamikaze drones that they believe entered the country through Bosaso, bound for either IS-Somalia or al-Shabaab fighters in southern Somalia. At the time, Puntland authorities described the seizure as a significant blow against terrorists in the country. Bosaso’s port is a major source of funding for IS-Somalia, which generates hundreds of thousands of dollars each month through extortion operations despite continued pressure from al-Shabaab, according to the U.N. IS-Somalia uses some of those resources to support terrorist groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. As part of its effort to recruit foreign fighters to Somalia, IS’s media arm is creating propaganda videos in the major languages of Ethiopia, such as Amharic and Oromo. Observers say the arrival of more foreign fighters to Somalia is potentially a threat to other countries. Foreign fighters are often hardened ideologues uninterested in the parochial issues that often motivate local militants, according to Karr. Their goal is to launch larger-scale attacks beyond Somalia’s borders. 'An influx of foreign fighters would increase the risk that the group develops external attack aims,' Karr wrote. 'Many foreign fighters have also demonstrated interest in returning to their countries of origin to organize attack plots after being further radicalized in an active conflict theater.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8nx9MCMotad2	2025-01-01T16:10:44-08:00	
Far From Ignorant: The European Union, Arms Exports And Israel – ...	While international law can, at times, seem an ephemeral creature, vulnerable to manipulation, neglect and outright dismissal, its strictures can surprise. The evolving body of law stripping back the immunity of heads of state for gross human rights abuses, the potential complicity of third parties and powers in aiding such heads of states and their armies, are salutary reminders to politicians and officials the world over: mind your obligations, abide by your duties. Few more onerous obligations exist in this canon than the prevention and punishment of genocide, as outlined by the United Nations Genocide Convention. While claims that it is taking place against the Palestinians as a feature of Israeli policy have been dismissed by the United States and a core group of ministers in the European Union, the human rights fraternity are increasingly convinced: genocide is, and has taken place, in Gaza. Even if genocide were not ultimately found to be taking place by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the South African lawsuit against Israel, the broader scope of war crimes and crimes against humanity would be hard to rebut, from policies of deprivation and starvation, to the hefty civilian death toll. This makes the continued arms sales to Israel not only problematic, but potentially criminal in a secondary liability sense. As with the United States, the EU adopts a preferential approach to Israel on the issue of imposing arms embargoes, leaving the matter to individual member states. In no small part is this due to the EU being Israel’s second largest arms supplier after the US. The European External Action Service’s COARM database reveals that between 2018 and 2022, EU member states sold arms to Israel to the value of 1.75 billion euros. As reported in Al Jazeera, certain states – Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium’s Wallonia – have made chirpy announcements on suspending arms transfers to Israel, though these have been tardily followed up. In any case, the measures are only temporary or partial in nature, a form of decorative diplomacy. While the European Union dithers and stalls on responding to this subject, despite the ICJ’s interim rulings that there was a risk of irreparable harm to the Palestinian right to be protected from genocide, bureaucrats have been busy. The EU special representative for human rights, Olof Skoog, has been particularly prominent in this regard in penning a harsh assessment of the conflict for EU ministers ahead of their November 18 council meeting. This was intended to inform debate about a proposal by the then EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on whether political dialogue should be suspended with Israel. Borrell had hoped such a decision would bring pressure to bear on Israel to adhere to international law. The move encountered resistance, with Germany promising ahead of time it would oppose it. Little surprise, then, that the ministers eventually opposed Borrell’s suggestion, along with any move to ban arms sales to Israel. Skoog’s assessment, obtained by The Intercept, runs the whole gamut of evidence on the warring conduct by Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah since October 7, 2023 when the Hamas-orchestrated assault killing of 1,200 people precipitated the current, unceasing phase of conflict. The origins of the paper are found in a request made in February 2024 by Spain and Ireland to the European Commission on whether Israel’s military actions in Gaza violated the human rights provisions of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In October, the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was still waiting for a response. 'The European Commission must respond once and for all to the formal request by two European countries to suspend the association agreement with Israel if it is found, as everything suggests, that human rights are being violated,' the Spanish PM told an event held in Barcelona. With the European Commission refusing to entertain the matter, Skoog was commissioned by the European External Action Service to conduct a review. This led to an initial assessment in July, one that was subsequently updated in November. Skoog takes Hamas and Hezbollah to task but lashes the Israeli Defense Forces for failing to adopt a sterner, more discriminating position between civilian and military objects. 'Given the high level of civilian casualties and human suffering, allegations focus mainly on how duty bearers, including the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), have seemingly failed to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects against the effects of the attacks, in violation of the fundamental principles of IHL [international humanitarian law].' As with a burgeoning number of reports, legal submissions and the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, the 'dehumanizing language' used by Israeli officials vis-à-vis Palestinians draws special attention. 'Incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence – such as that made in statements by Israeli officials – constitutes a serious violation of international human rights law and may amount to the international crime of incitement to genocide,' Skoog notes. On the subject of arms sales, the suggestion is made that export licenses be denied in cases where 'there is a clear risk that the military technology or equipment to be exported might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law.' From the standpoint of culpability, this is significant. As Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister and secretary-general of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 reasons, EU ministerial ignorance can hardly be pleaded in this case were the ICC to find Netanyahu and Gallant guilty of violating International Humanitarian Law. 'The world now knows that they knew they were in breach of international law because they were explicitly told so by the EU’s own special representative on human rights. History will judge them harshly. And perhaps so will the ICC.' Lawyers across Europe are already drafting their briefs in anticipation, even as reputations get shredded and people continue dying.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8vhwhj6GpDnW	2025-01-01T16:09:06-08:00	
Arnold Rüütel, ‘A Washington For Estonia,’ Dead At Age Of 96 – Op...	At the age of 96, Arnold Rüütel passed away on Tuesday. He served as a senior official in the Estonian SSR during the occupation and later, in a variety of roles, including president of the Estonian Republic, played a key role in helping his country recover its rightful place in the world as part of the West. In reporting his death, Postimees noted that he had 'not a few supporters and ill-wishers,' with many in both camps focusing only on one aspect of his public activities and ignoring the others (rus.postimees.ee/8161935/bolshaya-galereya-umer-eks-prezident-arnold-ryuytel-tyazheloves-i-dolgozhitel-estonskoy-politiki). Many Estonians, especially in the emigration, could never forgive him for statements issued in his name attacking them and defending the Soviet Union; while many others, never forgave him for his role in ending the occupation of Estonia and leading his country into NATO and the European Union. That divide has prevented many from seeing him as a man in full. But that is changing and I believe will continue to change. Almost a decade ago, I was asked to write a comment about his life for a book Peeter Ernits put together (Viimane Rüütel (Tallinn, 2017). I entitled my submission 'A Washington for Estonia.' In it, I pointed out that it typically takes three kinds of people to make a successful national revolution, the philosophers who explain why it is necessary, the firebrands who lead the people to make it possible, and the members of the ancien regime who recognize the justice of the pursuit of revolutionary goals and make their institutionalization possible. Not surprisingly, in the US and almost all other cases, the philosophers and the firebrands get the better press at least initially. Their stories are more unambiguous and easier to tell, and they dominate the initial histories of the revolution. But over time, it becomes obvious that it is often officials who rose in the old regime but changed sides who are the more important. Arnold Rüütel was neither a philosopher nor a firebrand and so he has often been more criticized and less appreciated that those who were one or the other or even in some cases both. But with time, his role as a bridge who made the passage from the old to the new possible is being recognized. I believe that trend will continue. For more than 30 years, I have been proud to count myself his admirer and friend. I will miss him; and I believe that as time passes, ever more people will come to recognize just how enormous his contribution was however contradictory it has sometimes been presented.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8ubfkhDygXIg	2025-01-01T16:06:22-08:00	
Hold Ukraine Accountable For Corruption, Misspent Aid – OpEd	The shame of American military assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan is that while our troops and their local allies were fighting bravely, the leaders of our so-called allies were getting rich. We have seen something even worse in Ukraine: While Ukrainian military personnel and civilians fight valiantly in a fierce contest for independence, Ukrainian leaders have gotten fabulously wealthy. The American shame is that the U.S. heedlessly expanded NATO to the borders of Russia, and then, after Russia pushed back, enabled and funded the cynical maladministration by the Zelensky government, which will go down in history as one of the greatest examples of waste and theft of Western aid. What’s more, Ukraine’s casualties have permanently altered the country’s demography and will limit its prospects for economic recovery, leaving the country 'wrecked' and the scene of a future 'frozen conflict,' per Professor John Mearsheimer. The sheer scale of waste and fraud will only be revealed by independent investigations after the war’s end. The Zelensky government uses the war to quash media stories that dare to question Ukrainian spending of our taxpayer dollars. Still, many brave Ukrainian journalists and officers have exposed scandals of overpricing, shoddy equipment and embezzlement at the highest levels of Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration. They have risked being labeled as Russian saboteurs or sent to certain death at the front lines for reporting the truth. The real crime of the Zelensky administration, however, began in late 2023. In a November 2023 article for The Economist, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, then commander in chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, said that without a substantial technological edge, Ukraine would face a stalemate. He said traditional attritional strategies were insufficient to overcome the numerical advantage of the Russian forces. Zaluzhnyi emphasized several key points: Stalemate on the front lines: The war had reached a deadlock, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces locked into positions reminiscent of World War I trench warfare. He noted, 'There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.' Need for technological advancement: To break this stalemate, Ukraine required significant technological innovations. He highlighted the importance of drones, electronic warfare, anti-artillery capabilities, demining equipment and robotics. Zaluzhnyi stated, 'In order for us to break this deadlock, we need something new—like gunpowder once was, which the Chinese invented and which we are still using to kill each other.' Limitations of attritional strategies: Zaluzhnyi acknowledged Ukraine had miscalculated by assuming that inflicting heavy casualties on Russian forces would stop them. He noted that Russia had suffered at least 150,000 dead yet continued its aggression, indicating that such losses did not deter Russian leadership. In other words, it was time to focus on diplomacy. But Zelensky had no interest in diplomacy, because ending the war would mean ending the state of emergency, new elections and a change in the structure of international assistance. In his own political interest, he ousted Zaluzhnyi and continued a war he was warned would waste lives and money without result. In the end, Zaluzhnyi was too optimistic; lives and money were indeed wasted, but they did not achieve a stalemate. Russia regrouped and gained territory. Zaluzhnyi was not the only one warning about dynamics on the battlefield. In April 2024, the leadership of Ukraine’s military intelligence participated in a series of roundtable discussions at Washington think tanks and policymakers. A former American diplomat familiar with the visit told this author, 'They expressed their reservations about continuing full scale conventional warfare. They were concerned that Ukraine had lost momentum and would be overwhelmed. They advocated instead for increased asymmetric warfare inside Russia to gain an upper hand in negotiations to end the war.' The result of this engagement was that the chief of military of intelligence, Kyril Budanov, was muzzled by Team Zelensky in a series of media attacks in pro-government websites. His key deputies were fired without his consent, weakening his agency. The waste and corruption only spread from there. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala championed a European munitions initiative that wasted billions more dollars. Zelensky and his ambassador to the Czech Republic infamously praised Fiala even as the Czech munitions initiative procured overpriced and faulty shells that resulted in the maiming of Ukrainian soldiers and destruction of battlefield equipment. More scandals arose, involving Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustam Umerovand Ministry of Defense procurement official Oleksii Petrov buying faulty equipment for astronomical prices. These have been extensively reported by Ukrainian media. While Zelensky prevented his military commanders from openly speaking the truth about Ukraine’s chances to break through the stalemate, his loyalists at the Defense Ministry misspent record amounts of money in record time. They also tapped into assistance in kind, another lucrative source of enrichment. And in a case where corruption has merged with treason, weapons sent to Ukraine for its defense were diverted to Nigeria’s Lake Chad region, 'bolstering the strength of terrorist groups.' There are also unconfirmed reports that weapons donated to Ukraine have wound up in the hands of criminal gangs in Sweden. Zelensky and his administration should answer to the Ukrainian people for lives and territory lost because he silenced his military commanders. And they should also be held accountable by the U.S. Congress for the lost billions of American taxpayer dollars. (Total aid from the U.S. and its Western allies totals $260 billion.) It’s past time Washington stopped letting corrupt foreign officials steal American aid.

Imperial Hubris (And Its Consequences) In Syria – OpEd	The Syria story, it seems, is not so simple as ‘President Assad fell’ and the ‘technocratic Salafists’ rose to power. At one level, the collapse was predictable. Assad was known to have been influenced by Egypt and UAE for some years past. They had been urging him to break with Iran and Russia, and to shift to the West. For some 3-4 years he had been incrementally signalling and implementing such a move. Iran especially faced increasing obstacles over operational matters in which they were co-operating with Syrian forces. His shift was meant as a message to Iran. The financial situation of Syria – after years of U.S. Caesar sanctions, plus the loss of all agricultural and energy revenues seized by the U.S. in occupied north-east Syria – was catastrophic. Syria simply had no economy. No doubt, reaching out to Israel and Washington was presented to Assad as the only practical exit to his dilemma. ‘Normalisation’ could lead to the lifting of sanctions, they implored him. And Assad, according tothose in touch with him, (even at the eleventh hour before the HTS ‘invasion’) was believing that Arab States close to Washington would have opted for his continued leadership, rather than see Syria fall prey to Salafist zealots. To be clear: Moscow and Tehran had warned Assad that his army (as a whole) was too fragile, too underpaid, and too penetrated and bribed by foreign intelligence services, to be expected to defend the state effectively. Assad also was warned repeatedly about the threat from Idlib jihadists planning to take Aleppo, but the President not only ignored the warnings – he rebutted them. He was offered a very large external military force not once, but twice, even in ‘the last days’, as Jolani’s militia were advancing. Assad refused. 'We are strong', he told an interlocutor on the first occasion; yet shortly afterwards, on a second occasion, he admitted: 'My army is running away'. Assad was not abandoned by his allies. It was by then too late. He had flip-flopped once too often. Two of the principal actors (Russia and Iran) were frustrated and rendered unable to help – absent Assad’s consent. A Syrian who knew the Assad family, and who spoke with the President at some length just prior the Aleppo invasion, had found him surprisingly sanguine and unflustered – assuring his friend that there were forces enough (2,500) in Aleppo to deal with Jolani’s threats, and hinting that President Sissi might be ready to step in with aid for Syria. (Egypt of course feared Muslim Brotherhood Islamists taking power in a former secular Ba’athist state). Ibrahim Al-Amine, editor of Al-Akhbar, noted a similar perception by Assad: 'Assad seemed to have become more confident that Abu Dhabi was capable of resolving his problem with the Americans and some Europeans, and he heard a lot about economic temptations if he agreed to the strategy of exiting the alliance with the resistance forces. One of Assad’s workers, who stayed with him until the last hours before he left Damascus, says that the man was still hoping for something big to happen to stop the armed factions’ attack. He believed that 'the Arab and international community' would prefer that he remain in power, rather than Islamists take over the administration of Syria'. Yet, even as the Jolani forces were on the M5 highway linking to Damascus, the wider Assad family and key officials were making no efforts to prepare for a departure, or to warn close friends to think about such contingencies, the interlocutor said. Even as Assad was heading to Hmeimin en route to Moscow, no advice to ‘get out’ was sent to friends. The latter said that they did not know after Assad’s silent departure to Moscow who exactly, or when, ordered the Syria army to stand down and to prepare for transition. Assad briefly visited Moscow on 28 November – a day after the HTS attacks in Aleppo province and their swift advance south (and a day after the ceasefire in Lebanon). The Russian authorities have said nothing about the content of the President’s meetings in Moscow, and the Assad family said that the President had returned tight-lipped from Russia, too. Subsequently, Assad departed finally to Moscow (either on 7 December, after despatching a private plane on multiple flights to Dubai, or on 8 December) – again telling virtually nobody in his immediate and family circle that he was departing for good. What caused this out-of-character mindset? No one knows; but family members have speculated that Bashar Al-Assad had been seriously disorientated emotionally by the grave illness of his wife, Asma, to whom he is devoted. Put frankly, whilst the three main players could see clearly the direction events were heading (the fragility of the state was no surprise), nevertheless, Assad’s denial mindset and the consequent speed of the military dénouement was the surprise. That was the true ‘black swan’. What triggered events? Erdogan has for several years demanded that Assad firstly negotiate with the ‘legitimate Syrian opposition’; secondly that he re-draft the Constitution; and thirdly that he meet face-to-face with President Erdogan (something Assad consistently refused to do). All three powers pressed Assad to negotiate with the ‘opposition’, but he would not, and nor would he meet with Erdogan. (Both loathe each other). Frustration on these counts was high. Erdogan now indisputably ‘owns’ ‘former-Syria’. Ottoman irredentist sentiment is ecstatic and demanding more Turkish revanchism. Others – the more secular city dwellers of Turkey however – are less enthused by the display of Turkish religious nationalism. Erdogan however, may well be (or may soon be) experiencing buyer’s remorse: Yes, Turkey stands tall as Syria’s new landlord, but he is now ‘the responsible’ for what happens next. (HTS is plainly exposed as a Turkish proxy). Minorities are being killed; brutal sectarian executions are accelerating; sectarianism becoming more extreme. There is still no Syrian economy in sight; no revenues, and no fuel for the gasoline refinery (previously supplied by Iran). Erdogan’s espousal of a re-branded and westernised al-Qaeda always risked proving to be paper-thin (as the sectarian killings are cruelly demonstrating). Will Jolani manage to impose his al-Qaeda-in-a suit makeover across his heterodox followers? Abu Ali al-Anbari, al-Baghdadi’s top aide at the time (2012-2013), gave this scathing appraisal of Jolani: 'He is a cunning person; two-faced; adores himself; does not care about his soldiers; is willing to sacrifice their blood in order to make a name for himself in the media – glows when he hears his name mentioned on satellite channels'. In any event, one clear outcome is that Erdogan’s ploy has re-ignited formerly (and mostly) quiescent Sunni sectarianism and Ottoman imperialism. The consequences will be many and will ripple across the region. Egypt is already anxious – as is King Abdullah in Jordan. Many Israelis see themselves as the ‘winners’ from the Syrian up-ending – since the Axis of Resistance supply line has been severed at its middle. Israeli security chief Ronan Bar was most likely briefed by Ibrahim Kalin, Turkish Head of Intelligence, when they met in Istanbul on 19 November on the expected Idlib invasion – in time for Israel to institute the Lebanon ceasefire, and to obstruct the passage of Hizbullah forces into Syria(Israel immediately bombed all the border crossings between Lebanon and Syria). Nonetheless Israelis may discover that a re-kindled Salafist zealotry is not their friend – nor ultimately to their benefit. Iran will sign the long-awaited defence accord with Russia on 17 January 2025. Russia will concentrate on the war in Ukraine and stay aloof from the Middle East quagmire – to focus on the slow global restructuring that has been happening, and on the Big Picture attempt to have Trump in due course come to acknowledge Asian ‘Heartland’ and BRICS security interests, and to agree some frontier to the Rimland (Atlanticist) security sphere, such that cooperation on issues of global strategic stability and European security can be agreed.

How The McKinley Tariff Almost Destroyed The Republican Party – O...	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo President Trump’s first major speech on economic policy in 2017 was delivered in Lexington, Kentucky near the home of Henry Clay, the early nineteenth century leader of the Whig party and the epitome of a political tool of the moneyed plutocracy of the day. Clay championed Alexander Hamilton’s 'American System' of high protectionist tariff taxes that would plunder American consumers for the benefit of politically-connected businesses; corporate welfare for road- and canal-building and railroad corporations; and a national bank controlled by politicians who would use the bank to corrupt politics and solidify its supporters’ political power. It was really the rotten, corrupt, British mercantilist system of the eighteenth century against which the American Revolution was fought to secede from. As Edgar Lee Masters once wrote, Clay’s Whig party had no platform for its platform was 'political plunder and nothing else.' If your platform is indeed political plunder it is a good idea to keep quiet about it and don’t broadcast it. Proclaim to be selflessly serving all of humanity instead. To Hamilton and Clay such a system is not so bad if one is on the money-collecting end of the plunderers rather than the plundered, as the American colonists were. Lo and behold, President Trump has discovered a new political hero to idolize: President (1897-1901) William McKinley of Ohio whose election was orchestrated by the wealthiest man in Ohio (and the U.S.), John D. Rockefeller, who ran the Standard Oil Company out of his Cleveland home. President Trump’s new hero is his new hero because he was known in the U.S. Congress before being elected president as the most rabid Republican party protectionist in a party that was founded on the principle of protectionism (and of corporate welfare and a national bank) in the mid 1850s. The 1890 McKinley tariff was named after Representative William McKinley because of his notoriety as a tool of the Northern manufacturing plutocracy. It created the highest average tariff rate in U.S. history up to that point and targeted such items as wool and tin with especially high tariff taxes, some exceeding 100 percent. It caused such a spike in the prices of such items that in the next election the Republican party was wiped out, losing both houses of Congress and the White House, with the Democrat party having a 2-1 advantage in the House. McKinley himself was defeated and was installed by his Rockefeller handlers as the governor of Ohio. The Rockefeller cabal got McKinley elected president in 1896. One of his first 'accomplishments' in 1897 was to the political disaster of the McKinley Tariff Tax by signing the Dingley Tariff Tax which created another highest average tariff rate in history. McKinley was also a notorious imperialist, waging an imperialistic war against Spain (the Spanish-American War) during which the U.S. government conquered Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, leading the great William Graham Sumner to author his famous article, 'The Conquest of the United States by Spain.' The Spanish-American War, Sumner wrote, turned the U.S. into an imperialist power, just like the thoroughly corrupt and bankrupted Spanish empire. (All empires, by the way, view their populations as good for two things: as taxpayers and cannon fodder in the empire’s wars). As General Smedley Butler wrote, 'war is a racket,' and this war was fought for the benefit of various American politically-connected corporate racketeers. This was all achieved under the stewardship of President-elect Trump’s new heartthrob, William McKinley. Just recently the president-elect pledged to change the name of Mount Denali in Alaska back to Mount McKinley in honor of the hyper protectionist and imperialist who is his role model of the day. The majority of Alaskans are reportedly against this, preferring a native American Indian name for the tallest mountain in America to a crooked Rockefeller-connected Ohio political hack. McKinley was assassinated in 1901 and was succeeded by his mentally disturbed vice president, Theodore Roosevelt. About the author: Thomas DiLorenzo is president of the Mises Institute.

In New Year Message, Zelenskyy Puts Hopes In Continued US Support	(EurActiv) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Tuesday (31 December) that no one would give peace to his country as a gift, but he believed the United States would stand alongside Kyiv as it fights to stop Russia's 34-month invasion. Zelenskyy, in a slick 21-minute New Year video greeting to his compatriots, also said only a strong Ukraine could secure peace and earn worldwide respect. 'We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war, something each of us desires,' Zelenskyy said against a backdrop of the blue-and-yellow national flag, battlefield scenes and pictures of children. He recalled conversations with outgoing US President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump and 'everyone who supports us in the United States'. 'I have no doubt that the new American president wants and will be able to bring peace and end (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression,' Zelenskyy said. 'He understands that the former is impossible without the latter. Because this is not a street brawl where the two sides need to be pacified. This is a full-scale aggression by a deranged state against a civilised one. And I believe that, together with the United States, we are capable of the strength to force Russia into a just peace.' Russia, Zelenskyy said, was not to be trusted either in battle or in talks. 'If today Russia shakes your hand, it doesn't mean that tomorrow the same hand will not start killing you,' he said. 'Russians fear those who are free. What they don't understand. They fear freedom.' Biden's administration has provided by far the most military support for Ukraine among Western nations since the February 2022 full-scale invasion. Ukraine has been wary of Trump's criticism of aid to Kyiv and his pledge, during the US election campaign, to bring a quick end to the war, but Zelenskyy has expressed optimism about ensuring continuing US support. Ukraine has endured a difficult year, with Russian forces taking village after village in a quicker advance on the eastern front than since the beginning of the invasion. In recent months, Zelenskyy has said that any settlement to the conflict is predicated on receiving security guarantees from Western nations and Kyiv securing an invitation to join the NATO alliance, a notion Russia rejects out of hand. In his greeting, Zelenskyy said that in the past year, Ukraine had launched an incursion into southern Russia's Kursk region, staged long-range drone strikes against distant Russian targets and developed domestically produced drones and other weapons. 'Every day in the coming year, I and all of us must fight so that Ukraine can be strong enough,' he said. 'Only such a Ukraine is respected and heard - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.' Russia launches New Year drone strike Russia launched a drone strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Wednesday, wounding at least three people and damaging buildings in two districts, city officials said. Explosions boomed across the morning sky shortly after Ukraine's air force warned of drones approaching the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air-defences were repelling an enemy attack, and that two floors of a residential building had been partially destroyed in the strike. Debris had also damaged a non-residential premise in another neighbourhood, he said. Russia has carried out regular air strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities far behind the front line of its nearly three-year-old invasion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8pzOW6M4lkqH	2025-01-01T15:55:24-08:00	
Polio Poppycock – OpEd	Polio.' That is a common go-to word for trying to silence people expressing any concern about any vaccine. The emotion-centered tactic relies on people having great fear of polio and great reverence for the polio vaccine commonly understood to have vanquished the disease. Voilà, all vaccines are wonderous medical tools, and anyone who questions them must want children to be struck by the horror of polio. It is poppycock. But, it can be persuasive poppycock, so it is brought up in vaccine discussion. Children’s Health Defense staff posted this week a succinct answer to some of the polio and polio vaccine hype trotted out routinely to silence people challenging the party line regarding any of the many shots pushed by government, media, pharmaceutical companies, and medical establishment. The article has four sections. Each sets things straight regarding an aspect of polio or polio vaccines. Here are the sections’ headings to give an idea of the kind of information, likely surprising for a majority of Americans, provided in the article: Polio vaccines used in U.S. don’t prevent infection or transmission. Global polio vaccine campaigns can lead to ‘vaccine-derived’ polio outbreaks. Risk of paralysis from poliovirus infection is roughly 0.001%. All polio vaccines used today are genetically modified. The article also challenges an assertion in a recent Fortune article that '20 million people who would’ve otherwise been paralyzed by polio are walking today' because of polio vaccinations of children since 1988. That number, the article explains — even using data from the polio vaccinations backing World Health Organization (WHO) — is exaggerated well over 200-fold. During the coronavirus scare and associated crackdowns, many Americans became aware of the deception of repeated assertions that everyone should take the 'safe and effective' coronavirus shots. But, the deception goes further than a new experimental coronavirus 'vaccine.' All the lauded vaccine shots, including for polio, should be looked at fresh. Skepticism is justified, and its broad application can help build an improved understanding among the public about the risks and benefits of different shots, whether shots long in use like polio shots or potentially soon to be rushed into distribution shots such as for bird flu or another new disease du jour.

Pakistani Shi’ite, Sunni Leaders Reach Peace Deal To End Regional...	(RFE/RL) -- Shi’ite and Sunni leaders in northwestern Pakistan on January 1 signed a peace agreement to end tensions and establish a permanent cease-fire after clashes believed to be linked to a tribal land dispute killed more than 100 people in the past 90 days. A traditional gathering of ethnic, religious, and political leaders known as a Loya Jirga concluded in the regional capital, Quetta, after the parties signed the agreement. The meeting had taken place over the previous three weeks with the support of the provincial government. The agreement comes after an attack on November 21, 2024, on a passenger convoy in the Kurram district killed around 46 Shi’ites and four Sunnis. Fighting between Shi’ite and Sunni groups subsequently broke out, killing around 130 people and injuring more than 200, including the initial attack on November 21. An earlier attack on October 12, 2024, initially injured three people traveling to Kunj Alizu mountain before the gunmen attacked a convoy of passenger vehicles in the same area, killing 17. Malik Abdul Wali Khan, a participant in the Loya Jirga, told RFE/RL on January 1 that Shi’ite leaders had first signed the agreement. Twenty leaders representing Sunnis then added their signatures on January 1. Some of the remaining leaders would sign the agreement soon, Khan said. He added that after the peace agreement is signed by all the leaders attending the Loya Jirga, roads in the Kurram district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province that have been closed for nearly three months will be reopened and the government will be responsible for protecting them. Roads in Kurram have remained closed despite repeated calls from the public for them to be reopened. Though the two sides reached a cease-fire brokered by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on December 1, 2024, key public roads have not reopened, according to local residents. The road closures have led to severe shortages of essential goods, including food, medicine, fuel, firewood, and gas. The provincial government had previously decided to deploy about 400 special police officers to secure the Parachinar road in Kurram by setting up checkpoints every few kilometers. According to the agreement signed at the Loya Jirga, a strategy is to be developed within 15 days for the handover of weapons to the government. In return, the bunkers built by both sides in the area will be dismantled, and all people displaced by the unrest will be resettled back home. The agreement also says that future land disputes will be resolved through oral and written documents and says the government will take action against those who spread hate on social media.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8hF0AU-gMurN	2025-01-01T15:51:35-08:00	
FBI Investigating Deadly New Orleans Truck Attack As ‘Act Of Terr...	A driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year’s early Wednesday in New Orleans and opened fire, killing 15 people and injuring more than 35 others. The FBI said it is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and does not believe the driver acted alone. The bureau is looking at a 'range of suspects,' Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, said at a news conference. Investigators found multiple explosive devices in the French Quarter, The Associated Press reported, citing a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin. Among the devices were two pipe bombs hidden inside coolers and wired to detonate remotely, the bulletin said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said. The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday in New Orleans’ lively French Quarter district at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year’s Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said. The FBI identified the suspect as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas. 'An ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, and the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations,' the FBI, which is leading the investigation, said in a statement. The suspect served in the U.S. Army for years but had been out of the military for some time, officials said. Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. It also said the vehicle appeared to have been rented. More than 300 officers were on duty at the time of the incident, police said. U.S. President Joe Biden said he has been continually briefed on the attack. He has also been briefed on a truck fire near the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and has directed his team to offer any federal assistance needed, according to the White House. 'My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities,' Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X. The White House said it has been in touch with New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to offer support. 'The FBI is already on the ground supporting local law enforcement in the investigation and the President will continue to be briefed throughout the day,' the White House said in a statement. The Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also briefed on the attack. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,' Trump said. 'The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the bodies. Those injured in the attack were taken to five hospitals, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness department. 'As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of evil,' New Orleans City Councilmember Oliver Thomas said. In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident 'a horrific act of violence.' Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football’s Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials later confirmed Wednesday afternoon that the game would be postponed until Thursday night. Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL’s Super Bowl on February 9. New Orleans has experienced violence surrounding celebrations in the past. In November 2024, two people were killed and 10 others injured in two separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and a celebration attended by thousands of people, according to local media. And in February 2017, more than 20 people were wounded when a man who police said appeared to be intoxicated rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of onlookers watching the main Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8v60GFG68V6R	2025-01-01T15:45:46-08:00	
Robert Reich: The 20 Realities Of The American System – OpEd	As we come to the end of a difficult year, it’s important to establish a baseline for seeing how much worse Trump will make the American system starting January 20. Here are 20 current realities for where we are now — some brought on by Trump’s first term: 1. First, forget politics as you’ve come to see it as electoral contests between Democrats and Republicans. Think power. The underlying contest is between a small minority who have gained power over the system — really, an oligarchy of extraordinarily wealthy and powerful white men — and the vast majority who have little or none. Starting January 20, the oligarchy will be far more powerful. 2. Forget what you may have learned about the choice between the 'free market' and government. A market cannot exist without a government to organize and enforce it. The important question is whom the market has been organized to serve. Starting January 20, it will serve the oligarchy even more than it already does. 3. Forget the standard economic goals of higher growth and greater efficiency. The issues are who benefits from more growth and efficiency, and how we define growth and efficiency. Starting January 20, the major beneficiaries will be Trump, Musk, and other oligarchs. Growth will be defined to exclude climate change and wars over ever-decreasing arable land and fresh water. Efficiency will be defined as eliminating anything Musk and Ramaswamy define as wasteful, potentially including social spending that many Americans depend on. 4. Don’t be fooled by claims of 'corporate social responsibility.' Most of it is public relations. The oligarchy is opposed to what it calls 'woke'ism, or efforts to make corporations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. But much of so-called 'corporate social responsibility' is a sham anyway. Corporations won’t voluntarily sacrifice shareholder returns unless laws require them to. 5. Even then, be skeptical of laws unless they’re enforced and backed by big penalties. Large corporations and the super-rich ignore laws when the penalties for violating them are small relative to the gains for breaking them. Fines are then simply costs of doing business. Musk and Trump are Exhibits A and B. 6. Don’t assume that we’re locked in a battle between capitalism and socialism. We already have socialism — for the very rich. CEOs today earn more than 300 times what their typical employee earns (up from 60 times in the 1970s). CEOs who are fired by their boards nonetheless get golden parachutes worth large multiples of their giant yearly compensation. Meanwhile, 60 percent of the wealth of the nation is in the hands of heirs who never earned it. Most Americans are subject to the harshest capitalism of any advanced nation. 7. Don’t define 'national competitiveness' as the profitability of large American corporations. 'American' corporations are now global, with no allegiance to America. This includes Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla, which have major factories in, and sales to, China. 8. Real national competitiveness lies in the productivity of the American people. This depends on their education and health and the infrastructure linking them together. But we spend relatively little on the education of poor kids. We spend more per person than any other advanced nation on health care but with the worst results of any advanced nation; our infrastructure still lags way behind that of China. 9. Look at the structure of the economy, not the ups and downs of the business cycle. Economic reporting focuses almost exclusively on the business cycle: the dangers of inflation and recession. The focus should be on systemic, structural changes that have caused the wealth and power of a few to dramatically increase over the last 40 years at the expense of the many — such as labor laws and antitrust laws. Starting January 20, labor laws will discourage workers from organizing, and antitrust laws will allow monopolies to flourish. 10. Forget the old idea that corporations succeed by becoming better, cheaper, or faster than their competitors. They now succeed mainly by increasing their monopoly power, leaving consumers and workers with fewer alternatives. Expect far more mergers, acquisitions, and monopolistic practices after January 20. 11. Forget any traditional definition of finance. Think instead of a giant gambling casino in which bets are made on large flows of money, and bets are made on those bets (called derivatives). Trump and Musk can be expected to further deregulate finance. Keep your eyes especially on crypto and private credit. Both are likely to endure major crashes under Trump. 12. Don’t assume that the billionaire financial titans who run hedge funds and private equity funds have better means of predicting market movements than anyone else. They have better access to inside information than anyone else. The Securities and Exchange Commission has steadily allowed them to benefit from access to inside information. Expect the SEC to allow even more of this under Trump. 13. Don’t confuse attractive policy proposals with systemic changes. Even if enacted, attractive policies at most mitigate systemic problems. Solving those systemic problems requires altering the allocation of power. Starting January 20, the biggest systemic challenges — climate change, nuclear proliferation, and artificial intelligence — are likely to become far more threatening. 14. Don’t assume the system is stable. It moves through vicious spirals and virtuous cycles. We are already in a vicious spiral in which great wealth has morphed into political power to change the rules of the game — taxes, labor, antitrust, bankruptcy, and finance — in ways that make the wealthy even wealthier and often harm those who are not wealthy. Expect far worse after January 20. 15. Don’t believe the system is a meritocracy in which ability and hard work are necessarily rewarded. Today the most important predictor of someone’s future income and wealth is the income and wealth of the family they’re born into. Over the next 15 years, as wealthy boomers die off and leave their fortunes to their millennial children, America will witness the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in its history. Trump’s pending tax cuts will make all this worse; the oligarchy will become an aristocracy. 16. Don’t separate race from class. Racial discrimination is aggravating class divides, and wider inequality is worsening racial divides. But class is critical, and most Americans are in the working class — with no job security and wages only slightly higher than they were 40 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Starting January 20, the divide will widen. The middle class will shrink even further. The oligarchy will get even richer. 17. Forget the old distinctions between 'blue-collar' and 'white-collar' jobs. A four-year college degree, especially from a prestigious college or university, is now the most important marker of real opportunity. Don’t expect this to change under Trump, despite his populist rhetoric. 18. Think systemically. As noted, the incomes of most people are stagnant, and their jobs are becoming less secure. Combine these realities with climate change that’s intensifying competition for arable land and potable water around the world, generating larger flows of refugees and immigrants. This is allowing demagogues like Trump to fuel bigotry by blaming immigrants for the stagnant incomes and economic insecurity. After January 20, Trump has promised to deport at least 11 million people in the United States who are undocumented. 19. Understand the nature of power – who possesses it and why, how it is wielded, and for what purposes. Power means not being accountable for actions that hurt others but that increase your own power and wealth. Today’s most powerful include Trump, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, David Sachs, Rupert Murdoch, Jeff Bezos, Stephen A. Schwarzman, Jamie Dimon, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas. 20. Don’t treat power and wealth as separable. Great wealth flows from great power; great power depends on great wealth. Wealth and power are intimately connected to one another. After January 20, they will become one and the same. *** I don’t intend for these 20 realities to make you more cynical about the system or resigned to its intransigence. To the contrary, the first step toward changing the system is to understand it. We need to see where the system is today in order to have a baseline for measuring how much worse it will become under Trump and his lackeys in Congress and the Supreme Court. Seeing the system for what it is and what it will be under a second term of Trump will empower you to join with others to resist Trump, and eventually change the system for the better.

New Mekong Dam Project Sparks Concern In Laos And Thailand	Plans to proceed with a benefits-and-risks review of a proposed hydropower dam on the Mekong River have sparked concern in both Laos and Thailand about the impact on communities and the ecosystem. The U.S. $2 billion, 12-turbine Sanakham hydropower dam will be built about 155 kilometers (100 miles) west of the Lao capital of Vientiane, and 25 km (15 miles) upstream from Sanakham district of Vientiane province, near the Thai-Lao border. More than 62,500 people in Thailand and Laos will be forced to relocate due to rising waters, according to submitted documents. Lao residents say they have hardly had a chance to give feedback on the project. 'I’m so concerned that we’ll have to move to another village,' a Sanakham district resident told Radio Free Asia. 'They [the government] did not clearly explain it to us at all.' Dozens of hydropower dams have already been built on the Mekong and its tributaries, and there are plans to build scores more in the coming years. The Lao government wants to harness their power generation to boost the economy, which has been battered by soaring inflation and a weakening currency. Electricity generated by the dam, to be built by China-owned Datang (Lao) Sanakham Hydropower Co. Ltd. and Thailand’s Gulf Energy Development Public Co. Ltd., will mainly be exported to Thailand. Thailand’s Office of National Water Resources said on Dec. 17 that it would begin the consultation process during which Mekong River Commission member countries and other stakeholders review proposed projects to try to reach a consensus on whether or not they should proceed. The Thai National Mekong Commission is holding four public information forums about the dam for residents living in the eight Thai provinces along the Mekong River during the coming weeks. ‘Rushed ahead’ International Rivers, a group acting to protect rivers and the communities that depend on them, said there has been little up-to-date information publicly available about the project. 'It appears this process is being rushed ahead, with little regard for the needs of local residents to be able to make arrangements to attend the forums, let alone prepare and develop informed opinions about the project specifics,' the group said in a Dec. 21 statement. Villagers who will be affected by the dam don’t want to move, a resident of Kenethao district in Xayaburi province said. 'They don’t want to relocate at all [because] here they have their livelihoods,' he said. 'If they moved somewhere far away, what would happen to their lives? If they have no choice but to move, then they should get more compensation.' Phonepaseuth Phouliphanh, secretary general of the Lao National Mekong Committee, told Radio Free Asia that the project developer will take into consideration concerns raised about the dam. 'All project developments have both good and bad impacts which we cannot avoid,' he told Radio Free Asia. 'We have done research to ensure the impact is as little as possible.' After hearing the concerns from people in areas to be affected by the dam, the Lao government or the project developer will review and correct issues that may occur, he added. Thai concerns Meanwhile, some Thai residents and advocacy groups also oppose the construction of the dam. Channarong Wongla, a member of the Chiang Khan Conservation Group and Local Fisheries Group in Chiang Khan, a district in Thailand that will be affected by the dam, said other hydropower projects have already altered water routes and islands and caused erosion. With hydropower projects in the past, including Laos’ Xayaburi Dam, developers moved ahead with their projects regardless of the concerns raised by residents, he told International Rivers. 'Most importantly, for the Sanakham Dam project, the [Thai] ombudsman and the National Human Rights Commission have already provided a clear basis for a more precautionary approach recognizing the serious impacts on local people and ecosystems,' he was quoted as saying. A report by the ombudsman said there 'was still a serious lack of information on the transboundary impacts of the dam project and that clear commitments of accountability are required from both the developers and government agencies in Thailand,' he said. Construction of the Sanakham Dam was expected to begin in 2020, but was put on hold when government officials from Thailand’s National Mekong Commission raised questions about the impacts of the project and called for comprehensive technical studies on its environmental, social and transboundary effects, according to International Rivers. The 'snap decision' to schedule expedited public information sessions for the Sanakham Dam marked a distinct shift in the Thai government’s approach to the project, the group said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8pPJf0VOjsVH	2025-01-01T15:41:43-08:00	
How AI-Powered Drones Are Shaping The Future Of Warfare – OpEd	The landscape of modern warfare is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and drone technology. The integration of these technologies is not merely enhancing traditional military capabilities; it is fundamentally transforming the nature of conflict itself. As nations race to develop and deploy more sophisticated drone systems, the implications for military strategy, ethics, and global security are profound. The Evolution of Drone Warfare Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have been utilized in military operations for decades, primarily for surveillance and reconnaissance. However, recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East, have showcased their offensive capabilities. The early weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the effectiveness of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, which played a crucial role in countering armored assaults. Similarly, Hamas employed drones to target Israeli defenses, demonstrating their versatility as offensive weapons. As drone technology has evolved, so too has its application in warfare. Today's drones are equipped with advanced sensors and AI algorithms that allow for real-time data processing and autonomous decision-making. This capability enables drones to execute complex missions with minimal human intervention, marking a significant departure from their original role as mere reconnaissance tools. The Role of AI in Drone Warfare AI is at the forefront of this transformation. By enhancing data processing capabilities, AI allows drones to analyze vast amounts of information quickly and make split-second decisions on the battlefield. This capability is particularly critical in high-stakes environments where traditional command-and-control structures may be compromised. The integration of AI into drone systems has led to two major innovations: swarm intelligence and autonomous targeting. Swarm intelligence enables multiple drones to operate collaboratively, overwhelming enemy defenses through coordinated attacks. This tactic has been observed in various conflicts where swarms of drones have successfully penetrated sophisticated air defense systems. Moreover, autonomous targeting systems are being developed that allow drones to identify and engage targets without human oversight. This raises ethical concerns about accountability and the potential for unintended consequences in combat scenarios. As nations continue to refine these technologies, the prospect of fully autonomous weapons—often referred to as 'killer robots'—becomes increasingly realistic. Current Applications and Developments Recent developments in drone technology illustrate the rapid pace of innovation. For instance, companies like Helsing have introduced AI-powered attack drones capable of operating effectively in environments with electronic jamming—a common challenge in modern warfare. These drones can maintain target engagement even without continuous data connections, providing a significant tactical advantage. In Ukraine, the military has adapted its structure to incorporate drone warfare units across all branches. The introduction of first-person view (FPV) racing drones has enabled Ukrainian forces to conduct precision strikes against Russian tanks and troop formations. This shift highlights how drone technology can provide asymmetrical advantages in conflicts where one side may be outgunned by traditional artillery. The use of AI-driven algorithms also enhances drones' capabilities for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance. Drones can now autonomously navigate complex environments, identify patterns of life among enemy forces, and predict potential threats based on historical data analysis. This level of situational awareness is invaluable for modern militaries seeking to maintain an edge over adversaries. The Strategic Implications As drones become more sophisticated, their impact on military strategy is profound. The ability to deploy swarms of drones against enemy targets alters traditional notions of air power and ground warfare. Military planners must now consider how to defend against not just individual drone strikes but coordinated attacks involving hundreds or thousands of UAVs. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of drone warfare presents a compelling argument for their increased use. Drones are generally cheaper to produce than manned aircraft and can be deployed in greater numbers without risking human lives. This economic advantage may encourage nations to invest heavily in drone technology as a primary component of their military arsenals. The proliferation of drone technology also raises significant ethical questions regarding warfare conduct. The potential for autonomous weapons systems to operate without human oversight challenges existing international laws governing armed conflict. Advocacy groups have called for preemptive bans on fully autonomous weapons due to concerns about accountability and civilian casualties. Countermeasures and Future Developments As drone technology advances, so too do countermeasures designed to neutralize UAV threats. Nations are investing in electronic warfare capabilities that can jam or disrupt drone communications, rendering them ineffective during operations. Additionally, advancements in laser weaponry are being explored as potential solutions for intercepting swarming drones before they reach their targets. Looking ahead, the future of drone warfare will likely see further integration with other technologies such as robotics and machine learning. The development of hybrid systems that combine ground-based robots with aerial drones could create multi-domain operational capabilities that enhance battlefield effectiveness. Moreover, as countries like China and Russia ramp up their investments in drone technology, the global arms race surrounding UAVs will intensify. This competition will not only shape military strategies but also influence geopolitical dynamics as nations seek to assert dominance through technological superiority. The intersection of AI and drone warfare represents one of the most significant transformations in military history. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will redefine how wars are fought and won. While offering unprecedented advantages on the battlefield, they also pose ethical dilemmas that require careful consideration by policymakers and military leaders alike. The future of war is increasingly automated and reliant on artificial intelligence—a reality that demands new frameworks for regulation and accountability in armed conflict. As nations navigate this uncharted territory, the balance between leveraging technological advancements for security while safeguarding human rights will be critical in shaping the future landscape of warfare.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8qKA5KIhHLWI	2025-01-01T15:40:05-08:00	
End Of The Assad Regime: A Theory Audit – Analysis	By Dr. Philip Dandolov The ousting of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024, which happened as a result of a major offensive by the opposition forces, could at a first glance be regarded as representing a rather unexpected development, especially if one considers the speed with which the military-strategic and political circumstances changed on the ground. However, while the rapid loss of morale among many of the former president’s loyalists and the token resistance put up by them could have hardly been anticipated, there were certainly a multitude of signs since at least the early 2020s that the ruling Ba’ath Party was in a precarious position. On the one hand, one cannot disregard the preoccupation of important allies or ‘Black Knights’ (international sponsors offering various forms of assistance to autocratic leaders) of the Assad regime with other military conflicts. Hezbollah, the Lebanese paramilitary group and Iranian proxy force, which had in the 2010s played a decisive role in propping up the Ba’athists during critical junctures of the Syrian civil war, was in a significantly weakened position due to its war with Israel, while the Russian Federation has since early 2022 almost exclusively concentrated on its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. From a theoretical standpoint, these military engagements of Hezbollah and Russia have represented disruptions with regard to the notion of regional autocratic linkage, which has been recognized as one of the potential pillars of stability when it comes to authoritarian political systems. On the other hand, if we are to shift the focus to the situation within Syria, a number of critical risk factors for autocratic breakdown manifested themselves in the years preceding the Syrian opposition’s ‘Deterrence of Aggression’ military operation. How does the fall of the Assad regime measure up to theory? Many scholars suggest that the robustness of the security forces is a pivotal factor in determining whether or not an autocratic ruler is likely to survive episodes of large-scale unrest. In particular, comparativist Eva Bellin argued in 2004 that the unique resilience of authoritarianism in the Middle East was in large part connected to the 'robustness of the coercive apparatus.' The security forces’ strength can be evaluated by drawing on a number of measures, amongst which are the fiscal health of a regime, its ability to apply repression without seriously compromising international support, and the extent of the anti-government popular mobilization. It could plausibly be argued that in the case of Syria all of these ingredients have been part of the picture since the early 2020s. Firstly, even though there was a lull in the Syrian civil war following the March 2020 Idlib ceasefire, with Bashar al-Assad managing to maintain an uneasy peace in the areas under his control (about two thirds of the country’s territory), in the same timeframe the effects of US sanctions were becoming more strongly felt, perhaps to a degree also exacerbated by the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with some agencies estimating that at least 80% of Syrians were in need of humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, the worsening economic situation in Lebanon since 2019, as evidenced by the liquidity crisis in the country, which saw a plummeting of the GDP per capita, served to deprive the Syrian authorities of an important 'economic lung.' Many of the Syrian Army soldiers were not exactly insulated from the effects of these negative trends, with the poverty-related issues also causing food insecurity for the members of the armed forces. Thus, the intertwined factors of an unsatisfactory economic performance of the regime and a disillusioned security apparatus were certainly a feature of the Syrian political landscape in the years preceding the rebels’ successful offensive. As mentioned above, large-scale popular mobilization or at least passive support on the part of the general populace when it comes to the actions of anti-government forces also reduce the survival prospects of authoritarian regimes. There is some evidence that average citizens may behave strategically, relegating ideological concerns to the backstage, and show a willingness to cooperate with an extreme rebel movement if they feel that such a group is better-positioned to win a war and resist corrupting influences once it assumes power. In light of Syria’s negative economic indicators, it is worth considering that a pessimism-inducing economic situation may likely go hand-in-hand with grievances pertaining to real or perceived corruption. The willingness of religious moderates to band together with compatriots subscribing to a significantly more fundamentalist interpretation of the scriptures is not necessarily too novel of a development. Since the late 1990s, there have been instances in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen of leftists and liberals engaging in a constructive fashion with Islamists in order to pursue issues of common interest. In this regard, the power of political rebranding should not be underestimated. Even though Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the politically savvy leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamist political organization that is considered to be the vanguard of the anti-Assad opposition, has had a very checkered past and has been a far cry from a political moderate, he has certainly invested efforts towards throwing off the mantle of a jihadist and reinventing himself as a rebel statesman. In the summer of 2016 al-Julani severed ties with al-Qaeda, initially changing the Al-Nusra Front’s name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, and subsequently (in 2017) to the current HTS. Al-Julani explained that the main intention behind this move was to deprive external powers such as the United States or Russia of the justification to launch attacks, with Qatar likely playing a role in encouraging his hand. Even though there are ample grounds to doubt the extent to which the shift in ideological orientation could be considered to be genuine, HTS’ outreach to Syria’s diverse communities has been assessed as at least somewhat successful due to it being able to make inroads into some traditionally pro-Assad groups. For example, Ismaili Shias were supportive of or at least not too keen to oppose the rebel forces and there were even celebrations and chants for unity in Alawite strongholds such as Latakia. In the years prior to the offensive, the HTS militia had also displayed some tolerance towards religious minorities, such as Christians and members of the Druze community, in the areas under its control. A further point that the rebels have in their favor is that even though there are many competing factions and fissures within the HTS coalition, ranging from radical Salafists to Syrian nationalists associated with the Free Syrian Army, the rhetorical wiggle room for distancing from the more ideologically extreme fighters has not been in short supply. This is because the soldiers who consider Syria to be just one of many battlefields in a struggle to secure a global victory for Islamism and have steadfastly opposed the HTS’ rebranding effort are more likely to be of foreign origin. The HTS, which has previously been characterized as a relatively localized terrorist organization, has continued to emphasize the distinction between Syrian- and foreign-born fighters in its handling of incidents such as the burning of a Christmas tree on 24 December in Al-Suqaylabiyah, a town with a Christian majority. The HTS’ rebranding, whether reflective of true political maturation or pure pragmatism, has been important because it has arguably served to challenge the negative legitimacy cultivated by Assad, which has for a long time been regarded as the main saving grace of his government, mainly due to the perception that all of the alternatives to the Ba’ath Party’s rule were by definition significantly worse for the secularists and the religious minority groups in Syria. In recent decades there has also been a deepening of transnational bonds between national societies, contributing in certain instances to the 'diffusion of contention across borders.' While it is perhaps still too early to evaluate the salience of this phenomenon as it pertains to Syria, given that 2024 year has been notable for the relevance of the anti-incumbency factor in countries as different as the United States, France, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, the almost worldwide negative sentiment against political office holders may have played a small part in further emboldening the Syrian opposition or at least discouraging formerly pro-Assad Syrians from throwing their weight behind his government. What most Syrians are likely to cautiously hope for is that the inclusion-moderation hypothesis will prove its merits in the Syrian context, as a result of which the behaviorally and ideologically radical groups will not be in a position to dictate to or overly influence the agendas of the more moderate political forces, which could pave the way for a proper democratic transition.

Key Points Of China’s National Fiscal Work Meeting – Analysis	By Yang Xite From December 23 to 24, China's national fiscal work conference was held in Beijing, where the work report was delivered by the country's Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an. This conference serves not only as a comprehensive implementation and specific deployment of the ideals of the Central Economic Work Conference held earlier but also as a systematic arrangement for key financial tasks in 2025. As an important executive department of national economic policy, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)'s work plan not only concerns macroeconomic stability and social development but also guides local governments and relevant departments. Researchers at ANBOUND point out that the main theme of the conference is obvious: to fully implement the ideals of the Central Economic Work Conference and translate the established policy requirements into specific operational plans for the financial sector. Therefore, this is a typical meeting for execution rather than for innovation. The core task of this meeting is not to propose new policy breakthroughs, but to strengthen policy implementation, ensuring the efficiency of fund use and the achievement of policy objectives. Similar to the functions of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the MOF, as an important component of China's economic governance system, is fundamentally positioned as an executor and guarantor. Hence, the fiscal policy must not only align with macroeconomic regulation but also provide support for economic stability and high-quality development through precise policy measures and efficient coordination of resources. From the content of the meeting, the fiscal work for 2025 will focus on six key areas. These areas are not entirely new proposals, but rather the concretization of the tasks outlined in the Central Economic Work Conference, further emphasizing the characteristic of the policy being execution-oriented and implementation-focused. First is the expansion of the overall demand through greater financial spending intensity. In 2025, the core task of economic policy will be to expand national demand through increased spending. Against the backdrop of a complex and ever-changing international environment and growing external uncertainties, the importance of domestic demand in China has become more prominent. Hence, the policy will simultaneously focus on both investment and consumption, aiming to activate the economy's endogenous growth drivers by expanding effective investment and boosting consumption. On the investment side, the fiscal focus for next year will be on reasonably arranging the scale of bond issuance, using government investment to drive social investment and promote high-quality development. To cite some examples, infrastructure construction, new energy development, and industrial upgrading will become key investment directions. Particularly, major projects such as the enhancement of national comprehensive freight hubs and supply chain improvements will receive focus, with fiscal funds playing a guiding and supporting role. The consumption side is also an important lever for expanding domestic demand. The meeting explicitly proposed that the basic pensions for retirees, basic pensions for urban and rural residents, and fiscal subsidies for medical insurance should be appropriately increased, fundamentally enhancing residents' purchasing power. At the same time, the 'old-for-new' policy for consumer goods will continue to be deepened, stimulating residents' purchasing power, particularly in emerging consumer sectors such as green home appliances and smart devices, where fiscal subsidies may be further increased. Therefore, more policies aimed at directly stimulating consumption are likely to be introduced next year. In addition, fiscal spending may be further increased next year, with the deficit ratio expected to rise to 4.0% or higher. This will release more fiscal funds, providing greater policy space and operational flexibility for expanding domestic demand. Compared to special bonds and special government bonds, the use of deficit funds is more direct, with higher fund efficiency and faster results, helping to inject stronger momentum into China's domestic demand in the short term. Second, the objectives of the policy are to ensure and improve people's livelihoods, reflecting a people-centered development approach. Livelihood issues have consistently been a key focus of fiscal policy. The meeting emphasized the importance of prioritizing employment, supporting the development of education, improving the social security system, and addressing the urgent concerns of the public. In line with these goals, China's fiscal policy in 2025 will continue to increase investment in sectors such as education, healthcare, and pensions. It is worth noting that the meeting proposed improving the population development support policy system. Subsidies and support measures for families with two or more children are expected to be further expanded. This may include increasing the scope of pre-tax deductions for childcare expenses or directly providing childcare subsidies, thereby reducing the cost of raising children for families. At the same time, fiscal policies are expected to alleviate the living pressures of key groups such as unemployed youth and rural elderly people and boost consumer confidence and social expectations through direct subsidies and expanded employment support programs. In terms of employment, it is expected that policy support for enterprises to stabilize and expand positions will continue to be strengthened, such as by reducing costs for businesses, while also encouraging companies to prioritize the employment of key groups like university graduates. Third, the key role of fiscal policy in preventing and resolving major risks will be emphasized. The meeting pointed out that in 2025, such efforts will be concentrated in key areas, especially the potential risks related to local government debt and the real estate market. Regarding local government debt, it proposed implementing comprehensive debt reduction plans while enforcing financial discipline and resolutely curbing the accumulation of new hidden debts. It is foreseeable that 2025 will be a critical year for tackling and resolving the local debt issue. At the same time, the central government will further increase transfer payments to help local governments stabilize the 'three guarantees' (i.e., safe housing, healthcare, and education), so as to ensure that basic living standards, wage payments, and institutional functions are not affected. In addition, the real estate market remains a key focus of fiscal policy. The meeting clearly emphasized the need to halt the market's decline and maintain stabilization. In 2025, fiscal policy is expected to provide more targeted support to the real estate sector, such as establishing a real estate stability fund to ensure the delivery of housing, stockpile existing properties, and acquire land from property companies. These measures aim to ease cash flow pressures on real estate companies, prevent further deterioration of market expectations, stabilize the industry's fundamentals, and avoid risks from spreading to the financial sector and other areas. Fourth, focus will also be given to promoting the construction of a modern industrial system and optimizing the supply structure. Achieving high-quality development requires fiscal policy to focus more on supply-side reforms. The meeting pointed out the need to strengthen technological innovation capabilities, fully support the breakthrough of key core technologies, and push for the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. In 2025, fiscal policy is expected to invest more resources in supporting new productive forces. This means that fiscal measures will further increase support for original and disruptive technological innovations, such as through special funds for basic research and the development of cutting-edge technologies. In addition, support for manufacturing, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises that are specialized and innovative, will also be further strengthened. This may include policies such as research and development subsidies and tax incentives to help businesses reduce innovation costs. Fifth, support will be given to urban-rural integrated development. Urban-rural integration is a key strategy for addressing developmental imbalances. For instance, national food security and achievements in poverty alleviation are fundamentally about ensuring that people have sufficient food sources and enjoy a better quality of life. At the same time, rural development and new urbanization aim to modernize rural areas and make cities more inclusive, fostering complementary and coordinated growth between urban and rural regions. The goal of regional coordinated development is to allow each area to leverage its unique advantages, rather than focusing solely on one. This approach promotes not only economic integration but also social equity. Sixth, efforts will be made to strengthen high-level opening-up and ecological development. Opening up remains a key aspect of China's economic strategy and a driving force for future growth. Participation in global economic governance is important for gaining influence in rule-setting and engaging in multilateral and bilateral economic discussions. The Belt and Road Initiative and tariff policy adjustments are measures aimed at further integrating the country with the global economy. In terms of green development, fiscal policy will focus on sustainability by supporting a green and low-carbon transformation to balance economic growth and environmental protection. It is notable that this year's national fiscal work meeting unlike last year's, removed the expression of 'tightening the belts'. This suggests a shift in fiscal policy direction. This indicates that China's fiscal spending will be more active, targeted, and robust. It also signals the need for greater fiscal support to boost the economy, with an emphasis on increasing the domestic demand of the country. With a higher deficit ratio, increased special bonds, and financial support for local governments, more funds will be directed toward areas such as livelihoods, consumption, and employment. Final analysis conclusion: The key feature of China's national fiscal work meeting this year is more on the execution side rather than innovation. The fiscal policy for 2025 will focus on precise action more proactively, laying a solid foundation for the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the start of the 15th Five-Year Plan. The country's local governments will need to fully understand the meeting's directives to grasp the central government's policy direction for the effective implementation of these policies.

Bring India’s Defence Ministry Into The Space Commission – Analys...	By Chaitanya Giri Why does India pursue a ‘space program’ at all? Is it only to satisfy the scientific curiosity of its intelligentsia? Is it only to fulfil the harmless aspirations of its entrepreneurs to bring an economic windfall to the nation? If these are the only motives for the Indian government to pursue the space program, the high table known as India’s Space Commission—the tallest decision-making body on all matters space—with its current organogram, is perfectly fine. However, if you ask two more simple questions—Who takes care of defending India’s space assets? Who secures our sovereign realms from the strategic and tactical dangers emanating from orbital and outer space threats?—the current structure of India’s Space Commission warrants a re-assessment. In 2019, India established the Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the aegis of the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), with two other agencies, the Armed Forces Special Operations Division and the Defence Cyber Agency. It is, indeed, a fact that these are the initial formative years for the DSA, but does that mean it does not have a place in the Space Commission? This question is beginning to impact security thinkers and planners in the country tasked to monitor India’s comprehensive security needs. From their perspective, these are dangerous gaps that must be filled fast. The Indian government took some bold and long-pending decisions when it initiated the space reforms in 2020. The Space Commission, during these reforms, expanded its members and got new representatives: it invited the Chairman of the newly-created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Chairman-Standing Committee of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) Council, and the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister. Since its formation, the Space Commission has been overly civilian, with a majority of its representation being from the civilian space agency Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Even after bringing in new members, the inordinately civilian influence on the Commission remains to this day, as its chairman is also the Secretary of the Department of Space and Chairman of the ISRO. What’s more of a concern is that ISRO is genuinely not in a position to execute ‘space defence’ measures, as such activities may fall under the purview of militarisation, an attribute it does not want to be associated with as an institution. The DSA is not structurally part of the Department of Space, which is understood. Still, it is difficult to comprehend why there are no attempts to make it a part of the Space Commission. The conspicuous absence of representation from the IDS or the DSA in the Space Commission begs the question of whether the Commission is a civilian-economic body by design. If yes, we must live with the fact that there is no other equally empowered Commission where these many secretaries, academics, and the National Security Advisor (NSA) would come together to assist the DSA and IDS in building assets necessary for the ‘space defence’ of India. If the current ‘civilian’ Space Commission has no room for the DSA or IDS, then a separate defence ‘Space Commission’ be created. If two ‘space commissions’ are not viable, there is only one eventuality: the reform of the Space Commission with equal representation that takes into account the civilian, commercial and military aspects of India’s space activities. Such a reform would first warrant the participation of the Chief of the Defence Staff to plug in the tactical feed of the DSA, the next-to-come Indian Space Command and the Indian Space Force into the Space Commission. There are three reasons why this topic has come about now. First, in October 2024, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the third phase of the Space-Based Surveillance Project. The earlier two phases involved the launches of sets of four and six ‘spy’ satellites, respectively. The third phase features the launch of 52 ‘spy’ satellites, all managed by the IDS (read DSA) via the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). The civilian space agency will never build intelligence-gathering satellites. Even in the recent past, the electronic intelligence satellite, under Project Kautilya, was built by the Defence Research Development Organization. The 52 satellites, too, are likely coming from the domestic commercial space market. Second, the Ministry of Defence is fast emerging as a leading end-user, customer, and operator of space assets in India. It has begun to cultivate an ecosystem of commercial players and leading national R&D laboratories, which demands a separate infrastructure outside the civilian confines of ISRO. In the past couple of years, the Ministry of Defence’s Innovation in Defence Excellence, better known as the IDEX scheme, has financed several early-stage space companies under its ‘Mission DefSpace Challenge’ since 2022. This is only the beginning, and a large section of India’s commercial space enterprises will soon get business orders from the DSA and the forces. Third, the civilian and military space domains are not competitors but complement each other. The best example, which will be seen in the coming days, is the comprehensive operational role of the Indian Navyand the Indian Air Force in the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. This relationship will only strengthen in the future as Gaganyaan and Bharatiya Antariksha Station begin to take shape. Just like space technology is always dual-use, the country's commission overseeing the development, deployment, and domestic and external trade of space technology and its sciences must include one of its fast-growing end users. The Space Commission was established when ISRO and its parent body, the Department of Space, were solo space technology designers, builders, operators, and commercialisers. Now that this solo authority is a thing of the past, a ‘defence’ representation in the Space Commission is warranted.

A Brief Note On A Historic Proposal By Argentine President Javier...	By Jesús Huerta de Soto The President of the Argentine Republic, Javier Milei, has stated that he is going to present a legislative proposal to declare it an imprescriptible crime for the state and the central bank to monetize the public deficit and create inflation. Consequently, heads of state and of the government, ministers, central bank officials, and representatives who, in one way or another, decide, promote, or participate in the creation of money and the inflationary financing of the public deficit will be tried and sentenced as criminals. Moreover, these acts will be declared imprescriptible offenses, and thus, even if—due to possible political changes in the future—this legislation were to be repealed, its subsequent restoration would, ipso facto, mean the prosecution and conviction of those persons involved in inflationary policies. In short, the intention is to discourage, in advance, the action of any authority, public official, or politician who might, in the future, decide to resort to inflation to finance and achieve political, economic, social, or any other goals. The ratio legis of this new legislation is clear: it is grounded in the extremely severe damage done by inflationary policies in general. In the particular case of Argentina, such policies have been on the verge of causing raging hyperinflation, which only the efforts of the new President, Javier Milei, and the sacrifices borne by the Argentine nation since the fall of the former Peronist government have made it possible to roll back. This former government and those that preceded it are primarily responsible for the severe prostration, poverty, and economic and social crisis which today have placed Argentina—once one of the richest countries in the world—among the relatively poorer and less prosperous nations, despite its enormous potential in terms of human and natural resources. Below, we will take a look at the enormous damage done by money creation and inflationary financing of the public deficit. This harm very clearly justifies the criminalization and harsh punishment of all who, whether directly or indirectly, become promoters of, collaborators on, or the main participants in inflationary measures. We will consider—from least to most dramatic—the effects of public-deficit monetization. First, it constitutes a direct attack on the very foundations of the democratic system. Indeed, the essence of democracy rests on democratic control, with complete transparency, of both the expenditure budget and the different sources of public revenue, which must be known and voted on by citizens. Monetization—financing via the mere issuance of any amount of new money—of public expenditure is profoundly antidemocratic. It breaks the necessary link between transparent public expenditure and revenue, by—in a concealed and diluted way—placing the cost of the portion of public expenditure not financed with taxes on the shoulders of the mass of holders of monetary units. Gradually, and without noticing it at first, or knowing its cause, these people are affected as their money balances undergo a drastic relative drop in purchasing power. This phenomenon occurs both when the deficit is monetized directly—as has, de facto, been happening for years in Argentina—and when at least, to keep up appearances, the deficit is financed with new public debt that the bank of issue immediately purchases on a massive scale in the secondary market with newly-created money. The European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks—under the false pretext and 'legal umbrella' of carrying out just another monetary policy—have been proceeding in this way and have acquired up to one-third of all public debt issued so far by the different governments. Second, monetization of the public deficit clearly equates to removing the essential restraint placed on politicians by transparent, democratic control of the budget and its implementation. Indeed, if any public spending can be financed with inflation practically 'on the sly' and in an apparently painless (at least in the short term) way, political incentives will obviously and inevitably be biased toward wastefulness and populism in a 'binge of public spending' and brazen, indiscriminate vote-buying that destroys the very foundations of democracy and thoroughly demoralizes and corrupts the electorate and the citizenry. Argentina is a prime example of this very perverse phenomenon. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have adopted policies of de facto monetization of the public deficit that have given rise to the phenomenon as well (though on a smaller scale). For instance, the moment the ECB launched its ultra-lax 'monetary' policies of 'quantitative easing' and lowering the interest rate to zero, the different governments of the Eurozone immediately halted the necessary austerity measures and reforms they had implemented. No government is willing to bear the political cost of adopting policies as painful as they are necessary if the usual deficit that derives from avoiding them will cost nothing, take no toll on those in power, and even be financed, directly or indirectly, by money newly issued by the central bank, and at practically non-existent interest rates. Third and furthermore, we must point out that the new money never reaches all citizens equally. Instead, it is injected, in the best of cases, to pay invoices for public spending, and hence, the relative prices of the first goods and services thus financed rise. The first recipients of the money come out ahead, at the expense of all other citizens. In the worst of cases, which are, moreover, the most common, central banks disguise their direct monetization of the public deficit under the seemingly more orthodox cloak of purchasing, on a massive scale, public-debt securities (and even other, fixed- and variable-income securities) in the secondary (stock and bond) markets. In this case, the redistribution of income in favor of a few is even greater. It can even reach the obscene extreme of greatly enriching the holders of the corresponding financial assets, either because they sell their portfolio securities to the central bank at an artificially exorbitant price or because the widespread drop in interest rates (to zero or even less than zero, low levels to which the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank indeed forced rates) makes the market value of fixed-income securities, other assets, and capital goods skyrocket. That is not to mention the tremendous, negative impact which such drastic and crude manipulation of the interest rate exerts on the real productive structure. The interest rate is the most important price in any free market and, when it is manipulated in this way, it ceases to function efficiently as an essential guide to entrepreneurial decisions on the intertemporal allocation between the production of consumer and capital goods. Central banks typically use two processes to create and inject money into the economy: 1) credit expansion, generated by the fractional-reserve banking system under central bank direction; and, 2) 'open market operations' or monetization of the public deficit. In both cases, a manipulated and artificially-low interest rate sparks waves of erroneous and unsustainable investments that give rise to deep economic cycles and crises of financial instability. The fact is the manipulation and lowering of interest rates gives the appearance of profitability to investment processes which are really unsustainable, because they do not correspond to the true desires of citizens, as consumers and savers. Fourth and finally, once the effects described above have run their course, every inflationary process ultimately and inevitably results in the gradual, masked decline in purchasing power of the monetary units all economic agents use. This decrease in purchasing power amounts to an odious (inflation) tax that hurts everyone, particularly the most vulnerable and needy, and thus, all inflation invariably becomes an especially odious and regressive tax. In conclusion, the monetization of the public deficit causes very grave harm which actually far exceeds, both quantitatively and qualitatively, that done by currency counterfeiters, whose activity is considered a crime in every penal code in the world. (In Spain, for instance, it is punishable by eight to twelve years’ imprisonment in articles 386 to 389 of the Spanish penal code.) Therefore, full justification exists for President Javier Milei’s historic proposal to criminalize and even place no statute of limitations on the monetization of the public deficit and to punish it with imprisonment and even higher monetary fines for all the heads of state and of the government, finance ministers, members of parliament, and governors and members of central bank governing boards who—by act or omission—are responsible for the corresponding money creation. And, once again, the reason for this is the very grave harm—on both an individual and social level—which such money creation always causes. Therefore, we hope President Javier Milei can push through and complete this momentous change in the law as soon as possible. Above all, we hope that his example—along with the popular awareness of the perverse effects and severe damage that result from public-deficit monetization—will spread throughout the world, and will especially reach economic areas which, like that of North America and, particularly, the Eurozone, have inflicted upon their citizens a devaluation of their monetary units that—though it does not even come close to Argentina’s near hyperinflation—has expropriated from them. For instance, in a very few years, 20 percent of the purchasing power of all their money has been expropriated. We hope this will be the case and that—in a not-so-distant future—it will also be possible to criminally prosecute and hold personally accountable the governors of central banks (the ECB, the Federal Reserve, etc.) and the members of their corresponding boards of directors for failing to achieve their objectives and for the severe social and economic harm they have inflicted on the citizenry.

Read Between The Lies: A Pattern Recognition Guide – OpEd	When Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, announced during Event 201’s pandemic drill in 2019 that they would 'flood the zone with trusted sources,' few understood this preview of coordinated narrative control. Within months, we watched it unfold in real time—unified messaging across all platforms, suppression of dissent, and coordinated narrative control that fooled much of the world. But not everyone stayed fooled forever. Some saw through it immediately, questioning every aspect from day one. Others thought it was just incompetent government trying to protect us. Many initially accepted the precautionary principle—better safe than sorry. But as each policy failure pointed in the same direction—toward more control and less human agency—the pattern became impossible to ignore. Anyone not completely subsumed by the system eventually had to confront its true purpose: not protecting health or safety, but expanding control. Once you recognize this pattern of deception, two questions should immediately arise whenever major stories dominate headlines: 'What are they lying about?' and 'What are they distracting us from?' The pattern of coordinated deception becomes unmistakable. Consider how media outlets spent three years pushing Russiagate conspiracies, driving unprecedented social division while laying the groundwork for what would become the greatest psychological operation in history. Today, while the media floods us with Ukraine coverage, BlackRock positions itself to profit from both the destruction and reconstruction. The pattern becomes unmistakable once you see it—manufactured crises driving pre-planned 'solutions' that always expand institutional control. Mainstream media operates on twin deceptions: misdirection and manipulation. The same anchors who sold us WMDs in Iraq, promoted 'Russia collusion,' and insisted Hunter Biden’s laptop was 'Russian disinformation' still occupy prime time slots. Just as we see with RFK, Jr.’s HHS nomination, the pattern is consistent: coordinated attacks replace substantive debate, identical talking points appear across networks, and legitimate questions are dismissed through character assassination rather than evidence. Being consistently wrong isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Their role isn’t to inform but to manufacture consent. The template is consistent: Saturate media with emotional spectacles while advancing institutional agendas with minimal scrutiny. Like learning to spot a fake smile or hearing a false note in music, you develop an instinct for the timing: Money and Power: While the media fixated on January 6th, BlackRock and Vanguard quietly tightened their grip on the residential real estate market While coverage obsessed over Trump’s Twitter ban, Congress passed the largest upward transfer of wealth under cover of 'Covid relief' While breathless reporting tracked every move of the Johnny Depp trial, the Fed printed more money than in the entire previous century While media flooded us with Ukraine coverage, unprecedented restrictions on energy production reshaped the global economy While reporters breathlessly tracked Trump indictments, central banks accelerated plans for programmable digital currency Medical Control: While media focused on celebrity vaccine promotion, unprecedented numbers of young athletes collapsed on field While networks ran wall-to-wall coverage of school shootings, documents revealed Pfizer knew about hundreds of side effects While coverage fixated on anti-vax 'misinformation,' insurance data showed alarming excess death rates Digital Control: While media obsessed over Twitter content moderation, digital ID infrastructure was quietly built worldwide While coverage focused on TikTok privacy concerns, central banks accelerated digital currency development While endless AI chatbot debates dominated headlines, biometric surveillance systems expanded globally As these deceptions become more obvious, different forms of resistance emerge. The truth-seeking takes different forms. Some become deep experts in specific deceptions—documenting early treatment successes with repurposed drugs, uncovering hospital protocol failures, or exploring the impact of vaccine injuries. Others develop a broader lens for seeing how narratives themselves are engineered. Walter Kirn’s brilliant pattern recognition cuts to the heart of our manufactured reality. His tweets dissecting the United CEO murder coverage expose how even violent crimes are now packaged as entertainment spectacles, complete with character arcs and narrative twists. Kirn’s insight highlights a critical dimension of media control: by turning every crisis into an entertainment narrative, they divert attention from deeper questions. Instead of asking why institutional safeguards fail or who benefits, audiences become captivated by carefully scripted outrage. This deliberate distraction ensures that institutional agendas move forward without scrutiny. His insight reveals how entertainment packaging serves the broader control system. While each investigation requires its own expertise, this pattern of narrative manipulation connects to a larger grid of deception. As I’ve explored in 'The Information Factory' and 'Engineering Reality,' everything from education to medicine to currency itself has been captured by systems designed to shape not just our choices, but our very perception of reality. Most revealing is what they don’t cover. Notice how quickly stories disappear when they threaten institutional interests. Remember the Epstein client list? The Maui land grab? The mounting vaccine injuries? The silence speaks volumes. Consider the recent whistleblower testimonies revealing suppressed safety concerns at Boeing, a company long entangled with regulatory agencies and government contracts. Two whistleblowers—both former employees who raised alarms about safety issues—died under suspicious circumstances. Coverage of their deaths disappeared almost overnight, despite the profound implications for public safety and corporate accountability. This pattern repeats in countless cases where accountability would disrupt entrenched power structures, leaving crucial questions unanswered and narratives tightly controlled. These decisions aren’t accidental—they result from media ownership, advertiser influence, and government pressure, ensuring the narrative remains tightly controlled. But perhaps most striking isn’t the media’s deception itself, but how thoroughly it shapes its consumers’ reality. Watch how confidently they repeat phrases clearly engineered in think tanks. Listen as they parrot talking points with religious conviction: 'January 6th was worse than 9/11,' 'Trust The Science™,' 'Democracy is on the ballot' and, perhaps the most consequential lie in modern history, 'Safe and Effective.' The professional-managerial class proves especially susceptible to this programming. Their expertise becomes a prison of status—the more they’ve invested in institutional approval, the more fervently they defend institutional narratives. Watch how quickly a doctor who questions vaccine safety loses his license, how swiftly a professor questioning gender ideology faces review, how rapidly a journalist stepping out of line gets blacklisted. The system ensures compliance through economic capture: your mortgage becomes your leash, your professional status your prison guard. The same lawyers who prides themselves on critical thinking will aggressively shut down any questioning of official narratives. The professor who teaches 'questioning power structures' becomes apoplectic when students question pharmaceutical companies. The circular validation makes the programming nearly impenetrable: Media cites 'experts' Experts cite peer-reviewed studies Studies are funded by industry Industry shapes media coverage 'Fact-checkers' cite media consensus Academia enforces approved conclusions This self-reinforcing system forms a perfect closed loop: Each component validates the others while excluding outside information. Try finding the entry point for actual truth in this closed system. The professional class’s pride in their critical thinking becomes darkly ironic—they’ve simply outsourced their opinions to 'authoritative sources.' Most disturbing is how willingly they’ve surrendered their sovereignty. Watch them defer: 'I follow the science' (translation: I wait for approved conclusions) 'According to experts' (translation: I don’t think for myself) 'Fact-checkers say' (translation: I let others determine truth) 'The consensus is' (translation: I align with power) Their empathy becomes a weapon used against them. Question lockdowns? You’re killing grandma. Doubt transition surgery for minors? You’re causing suicides. Resist equity initiatives? You’re perpetuating oppression. The programming works by making resistance feel like cruelty. Something remarkable is happening beneath the surface noise: a genuine awakening that defies traditional political boundaries. You see it in the subtle exchanges between colleagues when official narratives strain credibility. In the growing silence at dinner parties as propaganda talking points fall flat. In the knowing looks between strangers when public health theatre reaches new heights of absurdity. This isn’t a movement in the traditional sense—it can’t be, since traditional movement structures are vulnerable to infiltration, subversion, and capture. Instead, it’s more like a spontaneous emergence of pattern recognition. A distributed awakening without central leadership or formal organization. Those who see through the patterns recognize the mass formation for what it is, while its subjects project their own programming onto others, dismissing pattern recognition as 'conspiracy theories,' 'anti-science,' or other reflexive labels designed to prevent genuine examination. The hardest truth isn’t recognizing the programming—it’s confronting what it means for human consciousness and society itself. We’re watching real-time evidence that most human minds can be captured and redirected through sophisticated psychological operations. Their thoughts aren’t their own, yet they’d die defending what they’ve been programmed to believe. This isn’t just media criticism anymore—it’s an existential question about human consciousness and free will. What does it mean when a species’ capacity for independent thought can be so thoroughly hijacked? When natural empathy and moral instincts become weapons of control? When education and expertise actually decrease resistance to programming? The programming works because it hijacks core human drives: The need for social acceptance (e.g., masking as a visible symbol of conformity) The desire to be seen as good/moral (e.g., adopting performative stances on social issues without deeper understanding) The instinct to trust authority (e.g., faith in public health officials despite repeated policy reversals) The fear of ostracism (e.g., avoiding dissent to maintain social harmony) The comfort of conformity (e.g., parroting narratives to avoid cognitive dissonance) The addiction to status (e.g., signaling compliance to maintain professional or social standing) Each natural human trait becomes a vulnerability to be exploited. The most educated become the most programmable because their status addiction runs deepest. Their 'critical thinking' becomes a script running on corrupted hardware. This is the core challenge of our time: Can human consciousness evolve faster than the systems designed to hijack it? Can pattern recognition and awareness spread faster than manufactured consensus? Can enough people learn to read between the lies before the programming becomes complete? The stakes could not be higher. This isn’t just about politics or media literacy—it’s about the future of human consciousness itself. Whether our species maintains the capacity for independent thought may depend on those who can still access it helping others break free from the spell. The matrix of control deepens daily, but so does the awakening. The question is: Which spreads faster—the programming or the awareness of it? Our future as a species may depend on the answer.

5 Absurd Examples Of Government Waste In 2024 – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll Defenders of fiscal sanity have received quite a surprise with Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). For the first time in what seems like forever, complaining about government waste has almost become…cool. To all of the newcomers to this issue, we’d like to extend a warm welcome. Whether it was the DOGE hype or Milei’s chainsaw that brought you in—or, you know, a quick glance at the national debt—we’re glad you’re here. We’d also like you to know about a tradition we have in these parts of the political compass. You see, long before there was DOGE and the chainsaw, there was Senator Rand Paul’s annual Festivus Report (and long before that was Senator William Proxmire’s Golden Fleece Award). Named after the fictional 'Festivus' holiday from Seinfeld, celebrated on December 23, the Festivus Report is a compilation of some of the most egregious examples of government waste from the year. Part of Festivus, you see, is the traditional 'airing of grievances.' This year marks the tenth edition of the Report, and as usual, it’s full of the most absurd boondoggles you’ve ever heard of. Here are some of the highlights. 1) Tax Dollars for…Pickleball? The Department of the Interior is apparently investing in pickleball. Specifically, it recently provideda $12 million grant for a 30-court pickleball complex in Las Vegas. Pickleball players in Vegas clearly benefit from this initiative. But is it really fair to force taxpayers in Connecticut to pay for sports complexes in Nevada? Bastiat’s famous comment comes to mind: 'Government is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else.' 2) Ghost Towns on the Government’s Dime One of the surprisingly large sources of government waste is money spent on maintaining empty or largely-empty government buildings. Senator Paul cites a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that identified nearly $10 billion in federal funds wasted on empty office space. 'Most federal offices are ghost towns, with 17 out of 24 agencies using only 25% or less of their space in 2023,' Paul notes. 'Even the busiest offices barely reach 50% capacity…The GAO calculated building capacity based on usable square feet per employee. It found that many of these buildings are just oversized, expensive storage units for empty desks.' 3) Promoting DEI Among Bird Watchers The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently spent close to $300,000 on what seems to be a DEI initiative for bird-watching groups. 'In yet another shining example of wasteful government spending, the National Science Foundation has decided that the world of bird watching needs a dose of diversity, equity, and inclusion,' Paul writes. 'To that end, they’ve approved a grant of $288,563 to create ‘affinity groups’ within ornithological societies—basically, birdwatching clubs—based on identity characteristics…The goal, they say, is to ensure that birdwatching communities are more ‘inclusive.’' Regardless of where you stand on DEI, this kind of spending should raise a red flag on fiscal responsibility grounds alone. Surely there are more pressing needs than this? (Do the birds care about the gender identity of the people watching them?) 4) Advancing Fertilizer Use in Foreign Countries The tragically misnamed United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spending money on, well, not only the United States. The 2024 Festivus Report highlights that the USDA is spending $20 million on the Fertilize Right initiative 'to advance fertilizer use in Pakistan, Vietnam, Colombia, and Brazil.' This was one of a number of items in the Report that involved American taxpayer dollars going to foreign countries. 5) Money for Circus Performances The 2024 Festivus Report highlights $365,000 that has been spent by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to promote circuses in city parks. Paul quotes the late David Boaz in his comments on this story: 'Government funding of anything means government control. As we should not want an established church, so we should not want established art.' Concentrated Benefits and Dispersed Costs Why does such government waste persist year after year? A significant part of the explanation traces back to the concept of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. Essentially, the beneficiaries tend to be a small, concentrated group, so they lobby hard for these outlays because they stand to gain a lot from them. Taxpayers, on the other hand, tend to be dispersed and only minimally affected by any single expense, so it’s not usually worth it for them to lobby against the spending, or even learn about it in the first place. Economist Gordon Tullock famously illustrated this concept with his fictional Tullock Economic Development Plan. The plan 'involves placing a dollar of additional tax on each income tax form in the United States and paying the resulting funds to Tullock, whose economy would develop rapidly.' Think about the incentive Tullock would have to advocate for this plan, compared to the incentive that an ordinary taxpayer would have to look into it and voice their objections. With campaign contributions and votes to be gained from the special interest beneficiaries, is it any wonder politicians often go for these kinds of wealth transfers? The ubiquity and stubborn persistence—year after year—of all this waste, combined with the economic theory that explains why it happens, suggests that there is a fundamental problem with the process of government as we know it. This is not, as many are itching to believe, a 'Democrat' problem or a 'Republican' problem. The degree of government waste changes very little with changing administrations. No, this is a problem with the government as such. To solve this problem, we need to ask not just who should run the government, but what the government should be allowed to spend money on in the first place, given what we know about its entirely predictable and repeatedly demonstrated propensity for waste and dysfunction. Milei has already started that conversation in Argentina. Let’s hope that with the new Trump administration and DOGE, that’s a conversation we can have here as well.

How Malaysia Is Descending Into ‘Banana Republic’ Status – Analys...	The barbaric public caning of a man, breaking the reverence of a Mosque in Terengganu, and the dismissal of criminal charges against high level politicians and family members have greatly tarnished the image of Malaysia. Malaysia now barbarically intimidates people guilty of moral crimes, akin to long forgotten desert tribal states, ultra vires of the constitution. Public onlookers are something akin to a circus in an environment something like Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. In Malaysia, the Forty Thieves get off from the judiciary, not only scot-free, but given the highest political positions in the land. The present prime minister was convicted and served a jail term for corruption, the current deputy prime minister was discharged from over 40 criminal charges, and the new Governor of Sabah, was also discharged from his criminal trials. The decline of Malaysia into something resembling ‘Banana Republic’ status didn’t just occur overnight. The events described above represent only the tip of the iceberg. The decay of governance within the Malaysian state has been going on for decades, being acerated over the last two years. This article argues why Malaysia could be categorised as a member of states referred to as ‘Banana Republics'. The balance of political power is now tilted towards the Malay rulers The British took great effort to establish the Malay rulers as the prime authorities on the area proclaimed as the Malay Peninsula. They (the British) used this authority to rule. Now the power of the Malay rulers is in a renascence. The Anwar administration has allowed the power of the rulers to increase through the introduction of the 3Rs (speech about race, religion, and rulers), where discussion about those subjects is taboo. This has effectively eliminated any criticisms of the monarchy. Without any public criticism, the monarchy now escapes any transparency and accountability concerning interference in government affairs and business dealings. The rulers’ actions can go beyond constitutional limitations without question. The monarchy now has a free rein, they have never experienced since federation. There are no constitutional checks and balances because of the lack of public accountability. The role of the monarchy in ‘who rules’ is now very powerful. This is especially the case as much of the ‘Malay vote’ is split, leading to ‘hung parliamentary results’, where backroom negotiation determines which group or coalition becomes the government. This is the legacy of GE15, which will be most likely repeated in GE16. Governments are now made upon deals and pledges, which anchors future government decisions. The above drastically changes the nature of democracy in Malaysia today. Democracy cannot be understood without factoring in the role and influence of the monarchy. Foreign investors must be aware of these facts in the business sectors these circumstances affect, particularly at state level. Major political parties practising fraudulent democracy A warped democracy exists within the very foundations of most of the major political parties. The ‘no contesting’ rule for the top party positions and deferring elections two or even four years makes a mockery of democracy. The result of the above, is that the same old faces dominate most political parties, and by extension governments. This inhibits change and protects a group of Malay political elites, who have been at the top of the national political scene for decades. Even the current prime minister was a deputy prime minister in a previous administration almost four decades ago. There are a number of political dynasties across the political spectrum, where leadership has become a family business. This severely hinders the off the rise of fresh faces to come into government. This isn’t seen in many other countries. With the Malay old guard still in command policy development, ideas have become so bankrupt. The New Economic Policy (NEP) has been turned into something ideologically apartheid, as a tool of domination, allowing the development of a very wealthy elite. Such policies are destroying Malaysian competitiveness internationally. No level playing fields in the economy With government linked companies linked companies (GLCs) combined have a market capitalisation of RM 952 billion, this is almost half the total capitalisation on Bursa Malaysia. Many GLCs are rent-seekers supported by artificial monopolies The hopes of diversifying the Malaysian economy are slim. The government relies on a low-cost base to attract investors. Although Malaysia is successfully attracting investment in data centres, massive rises in the electricity tariffs in 2025, could change the minds of future investors. In addition, the growing uncertainty of social media licensing, could act as a further deterrent. Monopolies in strategic foods like rice are preventing innovation. Cronyism at state level in land, construction, and infrastructure development are a deterrent to new players and new investments. Most major consortiums in major projects at state level are made up of locally based-crony companies. Such an environment fixated upon rent-seeking activities and favouring politically connected consortiums just isn’t helping develop new sectors and badly needed innovation. An International Institute for Management (IMD), World Competitiveness Ranking 2024, saw Malaysia fall to 37th position, out of 67 countries. This corresponds to many other indexes that have shown the decline of Malaysia’s productivity over the last decade. Although Malaysian FDI has dramatically increased over the last two years, this must be compared with the foreign direct outflows over the same period. Net direct foreign investment hasn’t changed very much over the last two years. This may indicate that many foreign forms are leaving to seek lower cost countries. There is a potential issue of capital flight here. Many foreign investors to Malaysia are still facing bureaucratic issues that don’t exist elsewhere. These include simple things like the difficulty of opening a bank account, obtaining a work permit, obtaining necessary business licenses, and use their own paid-up capital. One of the most absurd requirements in the freight forwarding industry is that foreign investors can hold 100% equity, while local non-Bumiputeras are only able to hold 49%. A country that cannot develop a competitive economy, is a country doomed to remaining third-world, and fall behind the rest of the countries in the region. Neighbours, Indonesia and Thailand have shot up in the IMD competitiveness rankings, leaving Malaysia behind. The roots of poor competitiveness in apartheid ideologies The NEP, which promoted a resurgence in Ketuanan Melayu or Malay superiority ideology has left its mark in the institutionalisation of apartheid in Malaysia. The bloated 1.7 million civil service is traditionally used as a voter base for Malay-centric governments. The current one no exception. With the continual practice of giving pay rises to civil servants before elections, with no improved productivity goals, has led the civil service into mass inefficiency. Governments depend upon the civil service more than the civil service depends upon the government, so leaders within the civil service have much bargaining power over elected governments. The truth is that the civil service, sometimes with elite appointed consultants is the group that actually formulates much public policy. Sitting executive branch government actually has less influence upon policy than most believe. That’s partly why, governments don’t look much different from one another, only the narratives. The nation requires much administrative reform to make it more competitive, but for the above political reasons, this is unlikely to happen. The other major area where apartheid has shaped the nature of the nation’s institution is education. Public education is a domain of Malay apparatchiks, who have over the decades produced curriculums irrelevant to the society of today. Standards have declined since the British 'O' and 'A' levels were abolished. Systems of grading don’t even begin to measure meritocracy, where students graduate in this sheltered environment. At some universities, no students are failed, leading to an overall sub-standard cohort of workers in the economy. One only needs to look at education in neighbouring countries. Intrinsic skills of critical thinking, are much higher in students from Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This is very much reflected in those respective nations’ competitiveness. Apartheid doesn’t create meritocracy. With the majority of Malaysia’s senior positions in government reserved for Malays, the nation is only utilising a little more than half of its talent pool. A crooked legal system Since Anwar Ibrahim has become prime minister, a number of high-profile court cases were terminated with a 'Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal' (DNAA), allowing the political elite defendants to walk free from the courts. These included the deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, former prime minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor. In addition, former prime minister Najib Razak had his prison sentence reduced by the pardons board from 12 years to 6 years, with a 75% discount on his fine reduced from RM 210 million to RM 55 million. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has acted as the government’s attack dog to investigate and humiliate Anwar’s former adversaries through call ups for interview regarding allegations in the Panama Papers, without laying any charges. The current modus operandi of the police is the bullying and intimidation of critics of the government with impunity. The police in collaboration with the MACC and the Islamic Development Department (JAKIM) conduct raids on citizens, rarely leading to any criminal charges ever being laid. Most of these raids are about public comments and moral issues not affecting third parties. Lawfare and persecution are now specialities of the state. A number of prominent opposition politicians have been dramatically arrested, while the press was accompanying the police and charged with draconian laws such as sedition. There is great conjecture as to whether the Attorney General’s Chambers has been purposely throwing cases involving political allies of Anwar and his ‘unity government’. This is as the judicial system is being used to attack and silence critics overseas. British journalist Claire Rewcastle Brown was sentenced to two-years prison in absentia over a book covering corruption in the 1MDB financial scandal. Malaysia clearly has a two-tier system of justice where politically aligned elites are ignored, while ordinary citizens receive harsh penalties for petty crimes. The Orwellian state The MCMC is becoming the most powerful government agency under the Anwar administration. The use of the MCMC’s powers have greatly increased since the ‘unity government’ came to power in 2022. The MCMC and its minister Fahmi Fadzil have been in the news on a weekly basis. Soon after becoming minister in early 2023, Fahmi said on live Tik Tok chat that if anyone criticized him, they should expect a ‘radio car’ outside there house. The MCMC has blocked a number of news and blogger websites that were critical of the government. notices to social media platform, over what the MCMC considers to be defamatory, fake or obscene. Malaysia fell 34 places, from 73 to 109 in the 2024 annual Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index. A social media licensing requirements commences on January 1, 2025, with most Big Tech platforms opposed to the new scheme. The MCMC has carved out a pseudo-judiciary role for itself, where it acts as investigator, judge, and punisher over Malaysia’s online environment. The mainstream media and most online news portals, with only a few exceptions, very rigorously practise self-censorship. Thus, the media today amounts to little more than a mouthpiece of the government. Towards a Banana Republic As the MCMC has been transforming itself into a cyber-gestapo, Muslims in Malaysia are becoming much more restricted about the way they can live, because of further encroachment by politicised Islamic institutions. Over the recent Christmas period Muslims were forbidden to attend any function with a Christmas tree present. Islam is being used as a means of control. With the opposition persecuted, the police, MCMC, and MACC weaponised to create a restrictive society, where citizens now live in fear. The Anwar regime is clearly neo-feudalistic, and widening the gap between the top wealthy elite and the middle classes. Ordinary Malays without ‘godfathers’, ‘cables’, or connections cannot expect to share any of the privileges the elite enjoy, under the pretext of positive discrimination towards Bumiputeras. The elites have a deep sense of entitlement, with crony corporations stripping natural resources such as forests for their own benefit, and selling off strategic assets to foreign companies at bargain basement prices. Those who criticise them face the full force of the law. The current leadership of the ‘unity government' are either convicted felons, or been released from corruption charges by courts under the current government. The economy cannot expected to become competitive if 30-40 percent of government spending disappears through leakage. These are the beginnings of a nation resembling what could be called a ‘Banana Republic’.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7GzTrPWtOTXg	2024-12-31T15:36:19-08:00	
Year In Review: A Tectonic Shift Has Only Just Begun – OpEd	As we’re approaching the final hours of 2024, it is a good time to take a step back and remember what this year taught us. History might not repeat itself, but it does rhyme, as the saying goes, and the past is always the best teacher to prepare us for the future. For many of our fellow humans, 2024 was yet another turbulent year, filled with terrible strife, war, death, pain and indescribable suffering. The two ongoing war fronts and the images that reach us all directly and live through our phones, have proven that war is indeed the health of the State. There is no other explanation as to why these conflicts are still raging and why the human death toll is still climbing to this day. Over the last year, humanity has once again been defeated by special interests, politicians, lobbyists and all kinds of other misanthropes. However, those who know me also know that I am a hopeless optimist. Even in the face of such destruction and carnage, I still believe in our shared human bond and I am convinced that in virtue, kindness and decency will eventually prevail. I also see the silver linings, faint as they may be. For example, this past year didn’t only bring us darkness: it will also proved to us that rays of light and hope still exist. Many brave individuals did their best to make difference, either though their actions or their words. A lot of others, that normally wouldn’t even dream of questioning the State narrative, whatever it might be at any given time, started to do so. Many of them realized that if the evidence of their own eyes doesn’t match the 'official version of events' that is being pushed by their governments and regurgitated by every mainstream media outlet, then they should rather trust the former. And we must all keep in mind that this is no small feat. Opposing these narratives or even asking questions about them is becoming more and more risky these days. As the notion of free speech now already seems like a thing of the past, as citizens in the West are getting fines and even prison time for social media posts and as any sort of dissent is being brutally crushed by any and all means available, raising basic objections and concerns is becoming a dangerous act of rebellion. However, thanks to the global interconnectivity and sense of borderless community that the internet has brought us, these rebellious voices can no longer be that easily stifled. Social media platforms may try to silence them, but they still find each other, they debate and learn from each other. This gives me great hope for the future, as like-minded, freedom- and peace-loving individuals can come together and empower one another to break free from the State’s shackles and they can leave behind the all the absurdities, the deception and the exploitation of the current system. They can cooperate, 'opt-out' of the sociopolitical and economic order that the State has to offer and build something much better, much more productive, innovative, and most of all, free. Over the last year, we saw a lot of steps in the right direction. Chief among them, is the the massive political shift in the US, but also in Europe too. The Trump victory was a reflection of the frustration of the masses that were being asked for way too long to reject the evidence of their own eyes. The economy was not booming as they were told, at least not for them. Inflation was not under control as their political and institutional leaders insisted. The average voter’s paycheck was shrinking as the stock market was soaring, fueling their justified anger and resentment toward the 'ruling class', those connected to the State and all its institutions. Crime, inequality, education and healthcare and other very long standing structural problems were also not getting better, as the politicians and the media insisted. This is why a clear majority of the US voting population decided to bring back President Trump. A lot of people around the world also rejoiced at the victory, believing it would mean better days ahead on the geopolitical front at least, as Trump has always maintained his intention to end both wars as soon as possible. However, we must all remember that the least of two evils is not the equivalent of good. Just because the extreme Left was defeated, with all their absurd economic and social interventions, as well as their hawkishness, it doesn’t mean that one should embrace Trump as some kind of messiah. He is still a politician, he sought power (quite fiercely as well) over others and he is still just one piece in an enormous State machine that really doesn’t care who wins the election. The machine hums along no matter who is in symbolically at the helm. This is a lesson that Europeans need to understand too, and everyone else for that matter. Freedom doesn’t come from above, it isn’t merely handed to us by some benevolent dictator. It comes from within, as it is the individual mind that must be liberated first and foremost. That is my wish to all of us for the New Year.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7FhdwK0ORpRD	2024-12-31T15:34:25-08:00	
The Czech Republic’s Shifting Support For Myanmar’s Democracy – A...	By Federica Cidale and Kristina Kironska The Czech Republic’s position as one of Europe’s most consistent supporters of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement shows signs of weakening. Junta representatives gained unprecedented access to prominent Czech officials in 2024, giving the military regime in Myanmar propaganda victories. The Czech Republic’s support for democracy in Myanmar stems from the early 1990s friendship between Vaclav Havel and Aung San Suu Kyi. In 1991, Havel nominated Aung San Suu Kyi for the Nobel Peace Prize — which she won — believing it would bring international attention to the people’s struggle against Myanmar’s military regime, which ruled the country from 1962. Havel also wrote the preface to Aung San Suu Kyi’s essay collection Freedom From Fear. He also provided material support to her party, the National League for Democracy party. The Czech Republic granted asylum to dozens of Myanmar refugees in the early 2000s. Non-profit organisations like Burma Center Prague emerged to support people in exile and, in the 2010s, to assist Myanmar’s transition to democracy. After the February 2021 military coup, the Czech Republic demanded respect for the November 2020 parliamentary election results and allowed the National Unity Government (NUG), the anti-junta shadow government, to open a representative office in Prague. It remains one of only two NUG offices in the European Union, with the other in France. The Prague office is headed by Linn Thant, a former student protester jailed after the 1988 uprising and granted political asylum in the Czech Republic in 2011. NUG engagement with Czech officials proved substantial throughout 2022. NUG Human Rights Minister Aung Myo Min urged Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Jiri Kozak to address Myanmar’s human rights violations at the UN Human Rights Council. NUG Foreign Minister Zin Mar Aung met with Czech Chamber of Deputies Speaker, Marketa Pekarova Adamova, who reaffirmed that only the elected civilian government held Czech backing. In 2022, the Czech Republic informal Parliamentary Group of Friends of Democratic Burma/Myanmar was founded, led by politician Josef Flek. On the second anniversary of the coup in 2023, the group pushed a resolution through the Czech Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee condemning the junta’s human rights violations and calling for international support of the democratic movement. France has shown similar commitment, with its Senate recognising the NUG as Myanmar’s official government in October 2021, consistently condemning the junta’s actions and engaging with NUG officials on several occasions. Germany strongly condemned the coup in February 2021 and engaged with NUG representatives to a limited extent. Other EU states have shown less interest in the issue. Italy and Spain condemned the coup but limited their response to collective EU actions. Most other EU countries avoided significant engagement with the junta. The Czech Republic initially restricted contact with junta representatives despite allowing their presence at the Myanmar embassy in Prague. It even downgraded its diplomatic relations, leaving its Yangon embassy without an ambassador. Similarly, the German embassy in Myanmar is now led by a charge d’affaires, effectively downgrading its diplomatic ties. A concerning shift emerged in 2024. Junta representatives have started meeting with prominent Czech officials.Htuann Naung, charge d’affaires at Myanmar’s embassy in Prague, attended two diplomatic meetings in January 2024, the first hosted by Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky and the second by Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil. Subsequent encounters included Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in February and Deputy Foreign Minister Eduard Hulicius in August, culminating in a handshake with Czech President Petr Pavel in October. The Global New Light of Myanmar, the junta’s mouthpiece, reported that Htuann Naung attended a Diplomatic Corps reception on Czech National Day and a State Decorations Ceremony on Czechoslovak Independence Day at Prague Castle. The junta uses photographs of Htuann Naung with Czech President Pavel at these events as propaganda to bolster its domestic and international legitimacy. The junta exploits such encounters to project legitimacy. It did the same when Htuann Naung met with Jakub Starek, a district mayor in Prague, in 2023. Though Starek emphasised the meeting’s non-political nature, the junta leveraged these photos as propaganda to validate its regime. This situation is concerning given the Czech Republic’s historical support for Myanmar’s democracy. While junta representatives gain visibility, NUG figures like Linn Thant face exclusion from high-profile events. The change risks undermining Czech solidarity with Myanmar’s democratic movement and demoralising democracy advocates who view the Czech Republic as an example of resilience against authoritarianism. Recent global crises in Ukraine and the Middle East might explain this position shift. These conflicts have diverted attention from Myanmar’s civil war in Myanmar, perhaps making Czech officials less mindful of their Myanmar encounters. The Czech position alone might not alter EU policy. The bloc adopted eight sanctions packages targeting the junta, suspended development funds and the ‘Everything but Arms’ scheme and its parliament supports the NUG. Yet Czech influence has been crucial in maintaining Myanmar’s presence on the EU agenda. Closer Czech ties with the regime could reduce EU allies advocating for Myanmar’s anti-junta resistance. This shift by a long-term democracy advocate risks damaging the EU’s credibility as a champion of global human rights and undermining its broader policy strategies.

Challenges And Opportunities For India In War-Torn Myanmar – Anal...	The unending war in North Myanmar between the Yangon-based military junta and the Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) is posing a serious challenge to India's security in its own North Eastern region comprising the States of Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur. The spill over from the war is disturbing the ethnic equilibrium in India's North East and also threatening its overall security, especially with a hostile China and an alienated Bangladesh being in close proximity to the scene of action. India has been supporting the junta despite the West's displeasure about the world's largest democracy not giving a helping hand to the struggling democratic movement in Myanmar led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. India has been supplying arms to Myanmar. It was the third-largest supplier of arms before the February 2021 military coup. And according to the UN, sales from Indian firms amounted to US$ 51 million in weapons and materiel for the junta since the coup. The other reason for India to support the military government is that the military could not be wished away in Myanmar politics given the history of the country in which the army, or the Tatmadaw as it is called, has ruled the country directly or indirectly since the 1960s. There is also a legitimate fear in India that the warring ethnic groups may balkanize Myammar, fomenting more chaos. The Bamar, who are the majority community in Myanmar, are entirely Buddhist. But most ethnic groups are mostly Christian. And the Rohingyas of Bengali origin in Arakan, are Muslim. They are together now but could well go at each other's throats once the junta is done away with. As pointed out earlier, EAOs operating on the India-Myanmar border, have links with kindred tribal groups in the North Eastern Indian States of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Local ethnic groups with cross-border social links have pressurised New Delhi to keep the border with Myanmar porous. For example, the Mizoram government has openly challenged the Indian Home Ministry's direction to barricade the border. India fears infiltration of gun runners and terror groups. In Manipur, the Christian Kukis attack the Hindu Meities with the help of the Chins and Zos from Myanmar as these are kindred tribes. At present these EAOs are kept under some control by the New Delhi-friendly junta in Yangon. But once the junta exits (after its military defeat), the EAOs will have a free hand to support movements of their kinsmen on the Indian side. For example, the Christian Kukis who have been battling the Hindu Meities in Manipur, are already getting the support of the Chin and the Zo tribes across the India-Myanmar border. The Kukis, Chins and Zos form one big ethnic conglomeration collectively called the Zo. Chin-Kuki gun-running across the boundary is on already. India-China Conflict India has, for long, supported the junta on the plea that if it did not do so, China would continue to enjoy a monopoly over the junta denying a place for India in Myanmar. Since the 2021 military coup, China has transferred military jets to the Junta. Indian officials had also confronted the junta over possible Chinese intelligence facilities on Myanmar's Coco Islands. China is said to be putting pressure on the armed groups in the Kachin and Shan states to make peace with the Myanmar junta. Kachin is Myanmar's northernmost State, bordering China. Shan State is also bordered by China. Given China's links with the junta, India should befriend the EAOs, some Indian commentators say. The EAOs are friendly with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which heads the National Union Government (NUG). The NLD and NUG are anti-China and pro-West. Zo Tum Hmung and John Indergaard in a paper published by the United States Institute for Peace urge India to intervene in Myanmar in its own interest. They also urge the US to support India in this venture. According to them, over 50,000 civilians have fled across the border from Myanmar's Chin State and Sagaing Region into India's North East. This should worry India, they point out. According to these commentators, the People's Liberation Army of Manipur and Manipur Naga People's Front, which are fighting the Indian government for greater autonomy, have used Myanmar as a staging ground for attacks in India. In November 2021 they ambushed a convoy of the Assam Rifles. The authors of the paper welcome White House's April 4, 2023 statement rejecting China's claims on the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh. Indo-US intelligence cooperation has the proven potential to check China's pressure tactics, they point out. More broadly, Washington should emphasize to New Delhi that a more assertive stance on Myanmar will blunt the expansion of Chinese influence in South Asia, they urge. 'The US Congress has shown real leadership on Myanmar, authorizing US$ 136 million in funding for pro-democracy groups and humanitarian aid with the BURMA Act of 2022,' Tum Hmung and Indergaard say. India's High Stakes India has a number of on-going development projects in Myanmar, but the most important among them is the Kaladan Multimodal Transport Transit Project (KMTTP). The objective of this US$ 400 million project is to transport goods from Kolkata port in West Bengal State to Mizoram through Myanmar, bypassing Bangladesh. Goods will be transported by ship from Kolkata and other places on India's eastern seaboard to Sittwe port in Rakhine State and then taken upstream along the Kaladan River to Paletwa in Chin State, from where they will be transported by road to Mizoram. India has already executed the dredging and construction of new jetties at Sittwe, and developed the Paletwa river port. Construction of the highway from Zorinpui in Mizoram to Paletwa has, however, been held up because of the war in that area, Swarajya says. This transit route is strategically and economically important for India because it offers a second and more secure route from West Bengal State in India to India's North Eastern States as compared to the existing one through the 'Chicken's Neck' corridor in North Bengal. The 'Chicken Neck' is a narrow corridor that can be easily closed by an invading Chinese army. And an anti-India Bangladesh can cooperate with China in closing the 'Chicken Neck.' Significantly, it was at Doklam near the 'Chicken Neck' that Indian and Chinese armies had a 73-day standoff in 2017. India has signed a number of transit protocols for the transportation of goods through Bangladesh. But given the on-going faceoff between the two countries after the ouster of the pro-Indian Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, transit through Bangladesh has become problematic. Hence the enhanced importance of the Kaladan project. India cosies up to EAOs Seeing the emerging scenario in Myanmar, India has started moving towards the rebel groups. Opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta attended a seminar in New Delhi on November 5 and 6, organized by the Indian Council for World Affairs (ICWA). The Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said on November 6 that the conference, was designed to 'help develop a Myanmar-led and Myanmar-owned solution to address the country's current challenges.' He went on to pledge India's 'steadfast support' for Myanmar's democracy and stability. With this, has India may have stolen a march over China. India's next steps are eagerly awaited by the pro-democracy groups in Myanmar. However, there is doubt about American backing given President-elect Donald Trump's inward-looking policies and his transactional approach in international relations. The Myanmar daily The Irrawaddy fears that if Trump strikes economically advantageous deals with China, he may turn a blind eye to Myanmar and to what Beijing is doing there. And the junta may still have the last word.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7DL56dlwcthD	2024-12-31T15:31:27-08:00	
How Questions Of Sovereignty And Security Are Fueling Instability...	By Jonathan Lessware As a piece of geopolitical theater, the timing was hard to beat. Chad’s foreign minister announced the end of military cooperation with France just hours after his French counterpart left the country. That it took place on Nov. 28, as Chad celebrated its Republic Day—a key date in its move away from French colonial rule—only added to the symbolism. On the same day, Senegal also suggested French troops should leave. It was a seminal moment in post-colonial relations between France and the Sahel—the belt of nations south of the Sahara that stretches across Africa. The departure of French troops from Chad and Senegal means France will no longer have a military presence in a region where it has long held sway. The political dynamics of the Sahel have been rapidly shifting in recent years, and 2024 was no exception. Chad’s decision to end its defense pact with France was one of the most significant events in a year that saw a continuation of the shift away from Western influence. In the past three years, France has withdrawn troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, as a wave of coups brought military regimes hostile to French influence into power. These governments have looked elsewhere—to Russia, China, and Turkiye—for defense cooperation, dealing a major blow to Western hopes of maintaining a security presence in a region that has become a melting pot for extremist groups. The year began with Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger announcing they would leave the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)—a regional bloc established to help maintain financial and political security. There is widespread concern that the shrinking of this influential bloc of nations will lead to further instability. Indeed, the backdrop for the past year of turmoil has been an ever-deteriorating security situation across the Sahel, with a growing number of civilians maimed and killed amid extremist insurgencies. Chad’s decision to end its defense cooperation with France came in stark contrast to the ambitious Sahel security policy it enacted more than 10 years earlier. In 2012, northern Mali was overrun by militants allied to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. As they expanded south toward the capital, Mali appealed to its former colonizer for help. In early 2013, France deployed 1,700 troops as part of Operation Serval. The initial mission appeared to work as the militants fled northern towns. But the insurgency soon spread to neighboring countries. In response, France expanded the operation in 2014 to include five states—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. It deployed more than 5,000 soldiers and rebranded it Operation Barkhane. Meanwhile, the insurgency grew, with militant factions aligning into two main groups: the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jama’at Nusrat Al-Islam wal-Muslimin and the Sahel branch of Daesh. The failure to suppress the militants in Mali in the long term was one of the reasons for the 2020 coup that led to a deterioration in relations with France. In 2022, President Emmanuel Macron withdrew French troops from Mali as Russian mercenaries increased their presence. A similar pattern followed in Burkina Faso and Niger, where populations turned against the French presence, military coups ensued, and France had to withdraw its troops. While Chad’s decision to evict French troops was not driven by a military coup, it came amid increasing hostility toward the French across the region. 'After 66 years since the independence of the Republic of Chad, it is time for Chad to assert its full sovereignty and redefine its strategic partnerships according to national priorities,' Abderaman Koulamallah, Chad’s foreign minister, said. 'This decision, taken after in-depth analysis, marks a historic turning point.' Many analysts feel this was a turning point of France’s own making, stemming from its neo-colonial policies that limited the sovereignty of Sahel nations. 'Since independence, France has intervened in Chad and other former colonies, providing regime survival packages and interfering in domestic politics,' Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told Arab News. There has been increasing hostility toward the region’s monetary system, which many view as a relic from the colonial era that allows France to maintain excessive control over their economies. The African Financial Community (CFA) franc monetary zone applies across 14 countries in West and Central Africa and is pegged to the euro. Critics say it strips those countries of an independent national monetary policy. This has fed growing resentment of the French presence in the region. 'The continued French interference in domestic affairs has created substantial anti-French sentiment in its former colonies,' said Laessing. 'No ruler in Africa can be seen close to France as they would face a public backlash. This was one of the reasons why Chad decided to end the military partnership with France.' The deteriorating security situation has added to that resentment. An attack by the extremist group Boko Haram near the border with Nigeria in October killed at least 40 Chadian soldiers. Opposition parties said the French presence had failed to prevent the attack. Reports preceding the French foreign minister’s visit in November suggested France was already planning a major troop reduction in African countries, including cutting numbers in Chad from 1,000 to 300. However, the full withdrawal from Chad means that the last operational French base in Africa will be in Djibouti on the Red Sea coast, which Macron visited on Dec. 20. For Chad, losing French military support is a significant concern for the multinational force battling Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin—an area that includes parts of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria. 'The withdrawal is good news for Boko Haram,' said Laessing. 'I don’t think that the US and Britain will be able to contribute to the Lake Chad force without French logistical support.' In 2019, French jets stopped a rebel column approaching the capital to topple then-President Idriss Deby. He was killed in 2021 in further clashes with militants and replaced by his son, Mahamat Deby Itno. 'Chad’s decision to expel French troops is a dangerous move for President Mahamat Deby because the main function of the French jets based in the Chadian capital is to protect the government against rebel attacks, which are frequent in this fragile country,' said Laessing. The two Mirage 2000-D fighter jets left Chad for France on Dec. 10. It was not just France that saw its position in the Sahel eroded in 2024. In March, Niger announced it would end military cooperation with the US. By mid-September, the withdrawal of 1,100 American troops was complete, ending an extensive counter-terrorism operation run out of two air bases. As the Americans left, the Russians moved in, with military advisers arriving from Moscow in May. In 2024, the growing alliance of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger represented a seismic shift in the region’s balance of power. As violence surged, a record 7,620 people were killed in the Sahel in the first six months of 2024—a 9 percent increase from 2023 and a staggering 190 percent rise from 2021. Many fear the geopolitical changes in the region will make Sahel nations even more unstable. With little hope of political or military solutions, the conflicts are likely to persist, leaving vulnerable populations in greater peril in the year ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7NzduguKaRuc	2024-12-31T15:30:02-08:00	
Post-G20 Rio: Promises To Address Root Causes Of Migration, Globa...	By Aline Barros As G20 leaders convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November, they set an ambitious goal to lift 600 million people out of poverty by 2030, highlighting the urgent need to address poverty and global health care — the root causes of migration and forced displacement. During the summit, experts said the world's 20 largest economies have the capacity to lessen the impact of the root causes through social policies and regional migration agreements. Experts like Paulo Illes, founder of the Center for Immigrant Human Rights and Citizenship, emphasized the importance of recognizing migration issues as legitimate. 'That must always be addressed from a human rights perspective,' Illes told VOA. 'Additionally, G20 leaders should acknowledge that migration also occurs due to structural issues such as poverty, environmental disasters, wars and conflicts.' Euclimar Fuentes, a Venezuelan migrant living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an example of how these issues converged. Born in Venezuela, Fuentes remembers a happy childhood there. 'We would go to the beach for breakfast as a family. Culturally, life was beautiful in Venezuela,' she told VOA. Her father’s retirement after years as a police officer gave the family a comfortable life. The situation in Venezuela deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic because of a combination of preexisting economic, political and social crises compounded by the global health emergency. 'It’s difficult when a family, a whole community, is left without food, electricity, energy or water. It’s hard to live in a country where you have nothing to eat,' Fuentes said. Her family’s challenges intensified when her son was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2020. 'We tried to treat him there, but it was hard,' she told VOA, adding that many children died in the same circumstances: no resources, no treatment, nothing to eat. 'We didn’t want him to be part of that system [and die],' she said. On December 26, 2020, Fuentes and her family left Venezuela. They considered different countries, including the United States, but because of her son’s illness and the path for humanitarian status, they chose Brazil, which according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is home to about 61,000 Venezuelans. G20 declaration The G20’s official declaration highlighted the need to address the root causes of displacement, including hunger and poverty. The U.N. estimates that 2.4 billion people worldwide live in poverty, a crisis that has increased migration, Brazilian Development Minister Wellington Dias said. 'But beyond the migration issue,' Dias told VOA, 'Hunger and poverty are not just problems for those who are hungry or living in poverty. It’s a problem for the middle class, for the wealthy, for rich countries and for wealthy individuals.' The declaration included creating the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to implement policies such as cash transfers to 500 million people, school meals for 150 million children, and health services for 200 million women and young children. Funding is expected to come from at least 40 nations, 13 global organizations and various nonprofits and foundations, managed through several financial institutions. 'It’s no longer just giving food baskets,' Dias said. 'We are talking about implementing a development plan that must address education, which is a key foundation for eradicating poverty, as well as health, the economy, job creation and infrastructure.' The U.N. noted that food insecurity, migration and displacement are intricately linked to climate change, natural disasters, conflicts and poverty — all major conversations at the G20 summit. The challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these connections, with health crises, economic hardship and displacement driving increased migration in the Western Hemisphere, Dias said. Steve Seide, a 22-year-old political science student from Haiti, also embodied the struggles faced by many migrants. He left his homeland in 2023 because of a lack of jobs and increasing security concerns. 'I chose Brazil because I heard of work opportunities and how welcoming Brazilian people are,' he told VOA. Seide’s journey to Brazil was dangerous and expensive. To reach his destination, he crossed without documentation into the Dominican Republic. 'The first time, I did not get in. But I went back to the border,' he said. After spending a month in the Dominican Republic, he eventually secured a humanitarian visa and is on a path to a stable life in Brazil. 'In life, you can’t stop. If you need to get somewhere, you have to fight until the end,' he said. Future response efforts The global response to the pandemic also took center stage at the G20 summit, where the United States spearheaded efforts to secure new contributions toward a $2 billion pandemic fund, pledging up to $667 million by 2026. The goal is to help developing countries prepare for and respond to future pandemics. However, U.S. participation in this initiative is subject to congressional approval. Member countries also agreed to establish 'a governance mechanism that integrates the key players in the global health security and financing ecosystem, with the World Health Organization at the center.' As G20 leaders sought to address the interconnected challenges of migration, poverty and global health, stories like those of Fuentes and Seide underscored the importance of international cooperation and sustainable solutions. 'When you have your home, your piece of land, your family, you don’t think about leaving,' Fuentes said, adding that being separated from her loved ones is still 'very hard.' 'It’s been three years, but it’s still hard. Leaving everything behind, not knowing when you’ll see your loved ones again — it’s a pain that doesn’t go away. … Leaving was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. But sometimes, it’s the only choice you have to protect who you love,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7AxB4abWU-yY	2024-12-31T15:28:16-08:00	
Robert Reich: How About If Canada Annexes Blue America? – OpEd	Trump wants to buy Greenland and annex Canada as the 51st American state. When I first heard these ideas I thought he was joking, but as with all things Trump, he’s not … quite. Last week, while naming a new ambassador to Denmark (which controls Greenland’s foreign and defense affairs), Trump made clear that his first-term offer to buy Greenland could, in the coming term, become a deal the Danes cannot refuse. He seems to want Greenland because of its strategic location at a time when the melting of Arctic ice is opening new commercial and naval competition. He’s also interested in Greenland’s reserves of rare earth minerals needed for advanced technology. But Trump isn’t stopping there. He also wants to annex Canada. This proposal appears more a public needling of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau than a serious plan. Yet Trump has continued to tease the idea of annexing Canada on social media. 'I think it’s a great idea,' he wrote in a recent post. This is all bonkers, of course. But as long as we’re considering changing national borders, why not do it in a more sensible way? How about the West Coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California becoming the 11th province of Canada? After all, the politics of these blue states would fit much better with Canada’s than with Trump’s America. Meanwhile, the New England states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and New York could become the 12th Canadian province, for much the same reason. While Trump is toying with the idea of annexing Canada, these blue American states should bid him goodbye and be annexed by Canada. Hell, Trump might just go along. He doesn’t like these blue states anyway. They all voted against him in 2016, 2020, and again in 2024. He’s been looking for ways of getting even. Why not simply disown them? Letting Canada annex these blue states would also simplify Trump’s war on undocumented immigrants, since many of them reside in these states. America First Legal, a nonprofit run by Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, has already written to local elected officials in California and New York warning them not to try to become sanctuaries — threatening that the officials could be personally 'criminally liable' if they refuse to support federal government efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants. But if California, New York, and other blue states were annexed by Canada, the problem disappears. Of course, this leaves the pesky question of whether Canada would accept America’s West Coast as its 11th province and New York and New England as its 12th? I’ll leave that question to Canadians.

North Korean Soldiers Fighting With Outdated Weapons, Ukrainian S...	By Park Jaewoo and Lee Sangmin North Korean soldiers are fighting with deteriorated supplies and outdated weapons and may have been carrying no food rations during their recent combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, a Ukrainian special operations sergeant told Radio Free Asia. Mykhailo Makaruk of the 8th Special Operations Regiment said he came to the realization after searching through uniforms of North Korean soldiers who had been killed in Russia’s Kursk region. 'They have no military food in their bags. They have some grenades but it’s not even the Soviet type,' Makaruk said in an interview with RFA on Friday that was conducted in English. 'It’s bullshit grenades. And they have lower level military medicine kits.' Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine in Kursk, according to Ukraine and the U.S. Ukraine has reported more than 3,000 North Korean casualties while South Korea estimates at least 1,100 North Koreans have been killed or wounded. In a briefing on Friday, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said there have been more than 1,000 North Korean casualties in the past week alone. The North Korean military has been mounting 'hopeless' attacks on Ukrainian forces in Kursk on the orders of the Russian and North Korean military leadership, Kirby said, adding that North Korean human wave tactics 'haven’t really been all that effective.' There have been no signs of an additional deployment of soldiers from North Korea, despite the recent high casualty numbers, the Pentagon’s Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters in Washington on Monday. 'Can’t say that we’re seeing more being sent, but that doesn’t mean that they won’t send more in the future,' she said. Cigarette lighters Makaruk said the North Koreans appear to have Soviet standards for training, and all of their equipment –- including Kalashnikov AK-47 rifles -– seem to have been provided by the Russians. That included smaller items, such as Russian cigarettes as well as multiple lighters that they may have been collecting as souvenirs or for use as barter currency, he said. Makaruk spoke to RFA after rotating from the combat zone to a rear Ukrainian military operations area. He said he also found ID cards that labeled the North Korean troops as 'non-combat soldiers' who were carrying out 'civilian occupations.' The Ukrainian military has previously said that North Korean soldiers are using fake ID cards with Russian-style names to hide their identities. The signature field on the cards seen by Makaruk contained just a handwritten Korean name that appeared to have been written with a different type of writing instrument. Makaruk didn’t provide any relevant documents or photos, and RFA was unable to independently verify his claims. Language barrier Meanwhile, a Russian prisoner of war said in a video released on Telegram that the North Korean military has its own command system separate from the Russian military. The prisoner, identified as Alyoshin Alexey, also said that there is a serious language barrier between the Russians and North Koreans, most of whom don’t speak Russian. There are no interpreters built into North Korean units, he said. The video was posted to Telegram on Monday by the pro-Ukrainian international civic group InformNaplam. Alyoshin Alexey said he is a member of the Russian Army’s 352nd Motorized Infantry Regiment and was active in Kursk when North Korean soldiers began appearing in the area on Dec. 10. There have been several friendly fire incidents between the two sides that have resulted in casualties, he said. Also, he noted that the North Korean military usually attempts to collect the bodies of dead soldiers from the battlefield possibly because they don’t want to leave evidence that could identify them as North Korean. Neither Russia nor North Korea have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops in the region. Earlier in December, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of burning the faces of dead North Korean soldiers to keep their deployment secret.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7JSdnWMRYJTU	2024-12-31T15:24:44-08:00	
Ukraine Says It Downed Russian Air Target With Sea Drone For Firs...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine claims that for the first time one of its sea drones has downed a Russian military target in the air during a day of intense attacks by both sides as the war edges closer to its three-year anniversary. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (GUR) said in a post on Telegram on December 31 that a Magura V5 sea drone equipped with missiles shot down an Mi-8 helicopter in a battle near Cape Tarkhankut on Crimea's west coast. Another Russian helicopter, the GUR said, was hit by fire but managed to return to a Russian airfield. 'GUR soldiers destroyed an air target for the first time in the world using a Magura V5 naval drone,' the intelligence agency said in the post, which had grainy video of what it said was evidence of the attack. The video has not been independently verified. The GUR claim came hours after air-raid sirens blared across Ukraine as Russia launched another countrywide massive air attack, with explosions heard in some parts of Kyiv. Warnings were issued in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, and Vinnytsya regions and local media said cruise and ballistic missiles launched in the attack. The Kyiv military administration reported that three private buildings and two cars in the Darnitsky district were damaged by falling debris as air-defense systems repelled the Russian missile strikes. There were no casualties, according to the head of the administration, Serhiy Popko. The head of the municipal administration in Shostka in the Sumy region, Mykola Noga, said 12 multistory residential buildings and two educational institutions were damaged, while several individual infrastructure facilities were destroyed. No information on possible casualties was given. A woman told RFE/RL at the scene that she and her husband ran into a hallway of their third-floor apartment after hearing explosions. She said they taped up a broken window before more explosions and damage occurred. 'We put a blanket [on the window], but it did not help,' she said. She described her home as 'half intact' and said the wind is blowing through it. She and her husband planned to spend the night at their daughter's home. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the nation later in an address to mark the new year that Ukraine must fight in 2025 to bolster its position both militarily and ahead of any talks to end Russia's three year invasion. 'Every day in the coming year, I, and all of us, must fight for a Ukraine that is strong enough. Because only such a Ukraine is respected and heard both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,' he said in his address. 'May 2025 be our year,' he added. 'We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war. This is what each of us wishes for.' Earlier on December 31, Ukrainian drones attacked an oil depot in Russia's Yartsevo district of the Smolensk region. Smolensk regional Governor Vasily Anokhin said the fire was caused by falling debris when the drones were shot down. 'As a result, a fuel spill occurred and flammable materials began to ignite. There is no threat to residential buildings,' he wrote on social media. The new attacks come a day after the United States pledged additional security assistance for Ukraine to help strengthen its defenses along the front line. The White House said in a statement on December 30 that the pledge includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package. Hours later, the Treasury Department announced a separate $3.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine in direct budget support. The announcements came as the White House ramps up support to the war-torn country before President Joe Biden's term ends next month. Biden pledged to continue ratcheting up support, but the package is likely to be the last brought forth during his administration amid concerns that President-elect Donald Trump will significantly reduce or halt arms supplies to Ukraine in order to push Kyiv to negotiate a peace settlement with Russia. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20. Russia has been pushing back Ukrainian troops on the front lines for weeks and claimed on December 29 to have seized another town in Ukraine's Donetsk region as it continues its long, bloody drive against the strategic -- but nearly destroyed -- southern logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Russia's Defense Ministry said on December 30 that its forces captured Novotroyitske, a settlement with a prewar population 6,300 about 16 kilometers south of Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian military did not comment specifically about Novotroyitske, but it said Russian troops had carried out 133 attacks on its positions, most of which were in the Pokrovsk area. Analysts have speculated on what the Kremlin forces' next steps will be for the city, a strategic logistics hub for Kyiv. The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said geolocation data suggested the Russian military was about 10 kilometers from the border of the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin may be putting pressure on the Russian military command to advance to the border, and not to cover Pokrovsk at this time,' it wrote. In an interview with RFE/RL, Viktor Muzhenko, the former Ukrainian military commander, said any truce between Kyiv and Moscow that leaves swaths of Ukrainian territory under Russian control would represent a victory for the Kremlin and 'fully compensate [it] for its costs of the war.' Muzhenko, who led the military from 2014-19, said the situation with the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions and parts of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions is 'critical' -- 'not only for the loss of territories, but also [the loss of] half of the resource base of Ukraine.' The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said late on December 30 that during the day, some 153 combat clashes occurred on the front lines as Russia presses forward. The ISW estimates territorial gains by the Russian army in 2024 reached about 3,300 square kilometers. Counterattacks by Ukraine also took place in 2024, though only a few square kilometers of Ukrainian territory was recaptured. The bulk of the Russian advances, it said, took place at the end of the year, when Russian troops captured 20 to 30 square kilometers per day, the ISW said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7L0azLbRlgyM	2024-12-31T15:22:50-08:00	
US Treasury Says Chinese Hackers Stole Documents In ‘Major Incide...	(EurActiv) -- Chinese state-sponsored hackers breached the US Treasury Department's computer security guardrails this month and stole documents in what Treasury called a 'major incident,' according to a letter to lawmakers that Treasury officials provided to Reuters on Monday. The hackers compromised third-party cybersecurity service provider BeyondTrust and were able to access unclassified documents, the letter said. According to the letter, hackers 'gained access to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users. With access to the stolen key, the threat actor was able to override the service’s security, remotely access certain Treasury DO user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users.' The Treasury Department said it was alerted to the breach by BeyondTrust on 8 December and that it was working with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to assess the hack's impact. Treasury officials didn't immediately respond to an email seeking further details about the hack. The FBI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while CISA referred questions back to the Treasury Department. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected any responsibility for the hack, saying that Beijing 'firmly opposes the US's smear attacks against China without any factual basis.' A spokesperson for BeyondTrust, based in Johns Creek, Georgia, told Reuters in an email that the company 'previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024' involving its remote support product. BeyondTrust 'notified the limited number of customers who were involved,' and law enforcement was notified, the spokesperson said. 'BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts.' The spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the company's website on 8 December sharing some details from the investigation, including that a digital key had been compromised in the incident and that an investigation was under way. That statement was last updated on 18 December. Tom Hegel, a threat researcher at cybersecurity company SentinelOne said the reported security incident 'fits a well-documented pattern of operations by PRC-linked groups, with a particular focus on abusing trusted third-party services - a method that has become increasingly prominent in recent years,' he said, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7GxLSrgo37j0	2024-12-31T15:20:00-08:00	
Malaysia’s Sabah State Arrests Artist Over Caricature Despite PM ...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Parties in Malaysia’s ruling coalition and free speech activists have slammed the arrest of artist-activist Fahmi Reza in Sabah on suspicion of sedition for a caricature criticizing the appointment of a politician once accused of graft as the state’s next governor. Fahmi was remanded for a day by a Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, following his arrest a day earlier in the Malaysian Bornean state under the colonial-era Sedition Act, Sabah Police Commissioner Jauteh Dikun told BenarNews. 'Fahmi is currently under detention,' Jauteh said, adding Fahmi was remanded so police could conduct an investigation. Local media reports said the activist was being investigated for allegedly insulting the Sabah governor with his satirical artwork. The youth wing of the People’s Justice Party (PKR) noted that party chief and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had stated that Fahmi should not be arrested for his caricature. Fahmi’s sketch shows Musa, who’s from ruling coalition member-party UMNO, dressed as a governor and with a 100-ringgit note clenched between his teeth. 'The Prime Minister himself has publicly stated that he does not support the arrest or prosecution of Fahmi Reza in relation to his artwork,' said a statement by PKR Youth. 'Fahmi Reza has merely expressed his views and criticisms through his art and satire. Can this truly be considered a crime?' On Dec. 21, Anwar stated at a press conference that cases such as cyberbullying, pornography, or abusive behavior should be punished. 'However, in cases like Fahmi Reza’s, I want to tell … police: Just leave it, lah,' the PM said. 'I don’t believe [Fahmi] should be charged or arrested …. Criticizing the government or me is fine.' Fahmi, a graphic artist, has run into trouble with Malaysian authorities in the past over his satirical art pieces that skewered leaders, including Najib Razak when he served as PM. ‘Controversial acquittal’ Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, Malaysia’s king, appointed Musa as Sabah governor on Dec. 17 to replace the current ceremonial head of the state, starting on Jan. 1, 2025. Musa’s 15-year tenure as Sabah chief minister, from 2003-2018, was overshadowed by allegations that he had accepted U.S. $63 million in bribes for logging contracts, though all charges were dropped in 2020. Still, anti-corruption activists and many Malaysians on social media criticized the appointment of Musa, who was controversially acquitted in the logging case after the Attorney General’s Office withdrew 46 corruption charges against him without stating a reason. The acquittal came after Musa’s party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), regained power in 2020 as a member of Malaysia’s unelected ruling coalition. Musa is seen as an ally of Najib Razak, who’s currently in prison for corruption. ‘High-handed action’ A rights group, Aliran, criticized Fahmi’s arrest and said all charges against Fahmi should be dropped. 'Such high-handed action conflicts with the spirit of political reforms that the people have long sought. … The misappropriation of public assets undermines the nation’s socioeconomic development and the people’s well-being,' Aliran said, referring to the accusations against Musa. 'People have a constitutional right to peacefully express their concerns about such public interest issues, as Fahmi has done through his art.' Aliran also called on the government to amend or repeal any laws that curb basic rights. 'Pending a legislative review of such laws, we call for a moratorium on the enforcement of repressive provisions in those laws,' the group said. The Sedition Act carries a prison sentence of up to three years, or a fine of up to U.S. $1,100, or both. It outlaws speech deemed as insulting the Malaysian royalty or inciting racial or religious tensions. Malaysian civil society groups and human rights activists have accused Prime Minister Anwar of breaking campaign promises to cancel laws that curb free speech and stifle dissent. Meanwhile on Tuesday, more than 200 youths in Sabah held a rally against Musa’s appointment as governor and calling for an end to what they said was entrenched corruption in the state. The Sabah Anti-Corruption Peace Rally, organized by university students and youth activists, demanded accountability and transparency in the state government. The protest saw participants march 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the campus of Universiti Malaysia Sabah to Menara Kinabalu, the administrative headquarters of the Sabah government. Fadhil Kasim, who coordinated the rally, said it was meant to send 'a clear message to those high up in the Sabah government' that the state’s residents had had enough. 'We’re youths demanding a clean, transparent state government. Enough with corruption,' he told reporters. The rally came on the heels of a viral video by a whistleblower and an exposé by local publication Malaysiakini, which alleged that the Sabah chief minister, some assemblymen and state ministers had discussed getting payoffs to facilitate a mining project. The current Sabah government is led by Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), which like UMNO is a member of Malaysia’s ruling coalition led by PM Anwar. Political analyst Azmi Hassan said the Tuesday rally was significant because young activists staged it. 'This rally could have a strong impact on [next year’s] election [in Sabah],' Azmi, a senior fellow at the Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research, told BenarNews. James Chin, a political scientist from the University of Tasmania, said Musa’s appointment had also tainted the governor’s office. 'While the governor’s role is largely ceremonial, Musa Aman’s reputation drags the institution into controversy,' he said. '[But] Malaysians regard corruption as part and parcel of the political system.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7DP4DRGWh0FW	2024-12-31T15:16:52-08:00	
Why The Trump Administration Needs To Mend US Relations With Turk...	The incoming Trump administration might want to focus on domestic affairs, but this will prove to be impossible. The Trump administration will enter office with crises in the Greater Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war that it cannot ignore before focusing its attention primarily on combating China, the main threat to US national interests. The Trump administration’s best ally to resolve the crisis in the Greater Middle East and bring to an end the Russian-Ukrainian war is Turkey. Pandering to the domestic Armenian lobby and human rights advocates the Biden administration made Turkey, the second biggest military power in NATO and hosting two US military bases, a punching bag for its foreign policy failures in the South Caucasus and Greater Middle East. Relations between Presidents Joe Biden and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fell to their lowest level. US bias was evident in how Turkey was portrayed by Freedom House, which receives financing from USAID, which wrongly ranked Turkey as a fully authoritarian regime. Türkiye holds relatively free elections that would be the envy of the Russians and Chinese and has many cities which are controlled by the opposition (which is not something that is found in Russia or China). Turkey has promoted Western interests by taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Russian military with Ukraine and singlehandedly taken on Russian interests in four regions. The first was to support Azerbaijan’s drive to regain control over its territories that had been illegally occupied by Armenia since the early 1990s. Most of this territory was recaptured in the Second Karabakh War in 2020 with the last remaining land – Karabakh itself – retaken three years later. The Kremlin-controlled CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organisation) did not intervene in both military engagements. Russian peacekeepers, which were introduced by the November 2020 trilateral peace agreement between Armenia-Azerbaijan-Russia, did not intervene to prevent Azerbaijan retaking Karabakh. The second was to support the UN-recognised Government of National Accord which is recognised by the UN as the sole legitimate executive authority in Libya. Turkish forces supported the UN-backed Government of National Accord by assisting it to halt the Russian-backed attempt using Wagner mercenaries to capture Tripoli by General Khalifa Hifter. The third was to support Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Turkey refused to supply Bayraktar drones to Russia forcing it to turn to Iran which has supplied Shaheed drones that have been extensively fired against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. Türkiye is completing the building of a Bayraktar drone producing factory in Ukraine and is building three corvettes for Ukraine’s navy. Türkiye is a staunch supporter of Ukrainian membership of NATO and has repeatedly condemned Russia’s occupation of Crimea. The fourth was to back opposition forces in Syria who defeated Assad’s military and security forces and took power after the dictator fled to Moscow. Russia, which had intervened in 2015 to prop up Assad, has lost its Tartus naval base which the Soviet Union received in 1971 and Khmeimim Air Base. Russian President Vladimir Putin was humiliated for a fourth time after losing its influence in the Armenian-Azerbaijani, Libyan, and Russian-Ukrainian wars. Iran lost its major Syrian ally, Syria as a staging post for anti-Western terrorist activities, and a transit route for arms supplies and logistical support to its proxy forces in the Greater Middle East. Turkey accomplished in Syria what President Barack Obama baulked at undertaking. Obama’s ‘red lines,’ conveyed over the regime’s use of chemical weapons, were ignored by Assad and Putin who continued to murder hundreds of thousands of Sunnis Muslim opponents and force out millions as refugees to Turkey and Europe. Turkey’s policies have promoted Western interests and undermined Russian imperial outreach. In all three countries – Azerbaijan, Libya, Ukraine and Syria – Turkey has supported the international principle of the territorial integrity of states. The Trump administration should view Turkey, as well as Israel, as allies in its likely adoption of a more robust approach to Iran’s terrorist regime. First Israel and then Turkey severely impaired Iranian military assets and its geopolitical sphere of influence. Turkey and Israel have had difficult as well as mutually beneficial relations. The Trump administration should take a leaf from Azerbaijan which developed a strategic partnership with Israel in the 2000s a few years before developing a similar relationship with Turkey. Azerbaijan used Israeli and Turkish military equipment and drones to defeat Armenia in the Second Karabakh War. The Trump administration should give the green light to Israel and Turkey to further undermine the Iranian theocratic regime. This would further the Trump administrations goals of bringing peace to the Greater Middle East and ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. The Russian military would be unable to wage war against Ukraine without Iranian, Chinese, and North Korean support. Turkey is the key to achieving the Trump administration’s goals in the Greater Middle East and Eurasia. Turkey’s national interests would be furthered by supporting Israel in continuing to weaken and undermine the Iranian theocratic regime which, coupled with additional tough US sanctions, could usher in its downfall. The removal of Iran as a geopolitical player in the Greater Middle East would in turn impair its ability to provide military supplies to Russia to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine. The incoming Trump administration should repair relations with Turkey to achieve its goals of bringing peace to the Greater Middle East and ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. Removing the threat from Iran’s theocratic regime and parking Russia would provide the Trump administration with the resources to focus on its main threat and challenge – China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7IZ66A9StjFH	2024-12-31T15:15:13-08:00	
Bishop Expelled From Nicaragua Asks For Prayers For The People	By Walter Sánchez Silva Expelled last month by the Nicaraguan government of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, the bishop who serves as president of the Nicaraguan Bishops’ Conference thanked the Catholic Church in Guatemala for its support and called for prayers for the people of Nicaragua. Bishop Carlos Enrique Herrera Gutiérrez, OFM, of the Diocese of Jinotega made his appeal at the end of the opening Mass for the 2025 Jubilee, which was celebrated in the Archdiocese of Guatemala’s cathedral. 'I welcome your prayers: Pray not only for me but for the people of Nicaragua, so that one day we can be together and see each other, as brothers, and take our place again, where we were also born. Thank you and I commend myself to your prayers,' Herrera said. 'I would like, in a very special way, to thank Gonzalo [de Villa y Vásquez], the archbishop of this diocese, for welcoming me, for his prayers, his words of encouragement, since a few days after arriving, crossing over from there, from Nicaragua, he came to visit me, to encourage me,' Herrera said. 'Just like the Franciscan community [who took him in when he arrived], and you too, I know that when something happens concerning our Central American people, we are always attentive, praying,' the Nicaraguan prelate added in his comments. The bishop of Jinotega also thanked the local clergy for their prayers and for the assistance they give to the 'pilgrims [migrants] who pass through here on their way north, to the different institutions or associations who provide a space, a time to help them to keep going, as happened to the Holy Family as well, who had to go through those difficult moments to be able to defend life.' 'And since this is a year of hope, I hope that hope does not disappoint me. Through the faith that the Lord himself gives us, we always hope that the future will be better. Thank you all!' he concluded. Herrera’s expulsion from Nicaragua The Ortega-Murillo dictatorship expelled Herrera from Nicaragua on Nov. 13, a few days after he had criticized the town mayor, Leónidas Centeno, an Ortega regime supporter, who interfered with a Sunday Mass by blasting loud music in front of the local cathedral. The prelate was abducted by the police after participating in a meeting in the capital Managua with the other bishops of the Nicaraguan episcopate. With the expulsion of Herrera and bishops Silvio Báez, Rolando Álvarez, and Isidoro Mora, only five out of Nicaragua’s nine bishops now remain in the country. The remaining bishops are Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, archbishop of Managua; Bishop Jorge Solórzano of the Diocese of Granada; Bishop Francisco José Tigerino of the Diocese of Bluefields; Bishop Socrates René Sándigo of the Diocese of León; and Bishop Marcial Humberto Guzmán of the Diocese of Juigalpa.
