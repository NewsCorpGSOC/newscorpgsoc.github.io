Chickpeas: Sustainable And Climate-Friendly Foods Of The Future	Climate change has a negative impact on food security. An international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna has now conducted a study to investigate the natural variation of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress. The scientists were able to show that chickpeas are a drought-resistant legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain cultivation systems even in urban areas. The study was recently published in the specialist magazine The Plant Biotechnology. Long periods of drought stress have also become a reality in Central Europe due to climate change, a major threat to plant productivity, harvests and therefore food security. At the same time, there is a decline in the use of plant genetic diversity, and the global food system has become more and more uniform. While there are approximately 7,000 edible crops, two-thirds of global food production is based on just nine crop species. 'This narrow genetic base can have several negative consequences, such as increased susceptibility of plants to diseases and pests, reduced resistance to factors such as drought and climate change, and increased economic fragility,' explains molecular biologist Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna. 'Maintaining adequate plant and genetic diversity is crucial for agriculture, which must adapt to future changing conditions. With our new study, we have taken an important step in this direction and looked at the chickpea as an important food of the future,' says Weckwerth The chickpea is currently not one of the plants mentioned above on which the global diet is currently mainly based. The international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth has now researched the natural variations of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress and achieved promising results. The team managed to grow many different chickpea varieties under drought stress in a field experiment in a Vienna city region, demonstrating that chickpeas are a great alternative legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain farming systems in urban areas. 'The different varieties and wild types show very different mechanisms to deal with persistent drought stress. This natural genetic variability is particularly important in order to withstand climate change and ensure the survival of the plant,' says Weckwerth. 'In our study, we used a stress susceptibility index (SSI) to assess the effects of drought stress on yield. This allowed us to identify genotypes that perform best and worst under stressful conditions. Our findings are crucial for the selection of genotypes for breeding drought-tolerant chickpeas,' explains Palak Chaturvedi from the University of Vienna, lead author of the study. The team used artificial intelligence, multivariate statistics and modeling to identify markers and mechanisms for better resilience to drought stress. 'With their high protein content and their drought resistance, legumes such as chickpeas are a food of the future. Another advantage is that a higher proportion of legumes in a country's agricultural systems improves the overall efficiency of nitrogen use - this also makes agriculture more sustainable,' summarizes Weckwerth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcpQYRuDVqa4rJ1C6BVB_gm	2024-10-20T15:48:47-07:00	
Global Aid Funds Face Fundraising ‘Traffic Jam’	Major global developmentfundsand institutions could struggle to secure the billions of dollars needed to support the world’s least affluent countries as they embark on new funding campaigns, according to analysts. Areportpublished today (Wednesday) by the Center for Global Development says that funds including The World Bank’s International Development Association, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are seeking to replenish their coffers with a combined total of about US$100 billion in grants from donors over the course of 2024 and 2025. This is creating what the report’s authors call a 'replenishment traffic jam', whereby different institutions are lining up for a share of the same limited basket of resources amid aid budget cuts in several countries. Economic headwinds Charities warned in September that the UK’s spending on overseas bilateral humanitarian and development could fall to a 17-year low of 0.36 per cent this year, ahead of an autumn budget announcement later this month. The German governmentsaidin August that it would cut funding for global development cooperation by almost 1 billion euros next year, which comes on top of severe cuts to its 2024 aid budget. According to Janeen Madan Keller, co-author of the report and deputy director of the Global Health Policy Program at the Center for Global Development, foreign aid budgets from the biggest development players are under pressure due to economic headwinds, which makes the current fundraising bids especially challenging. Not only are top donors like the European Union, Germany and France slashing their aid budgets, but the funds that distribute aid keep relying on the same small group of donors, said Keller. 'So, what we’re seeing is the same donors being asked to contribute to these same replenishments,' she toldSciDev.Net. Another issue is that a growing number of aid funds are being created with a specific focus, such as pandemic preparedness or climate response, while the pot of money they’re competing for dwindles, said Keller. Aid at risk 'Prospects for fully replenishing all these funds’ coffers look grim asgovernmentscontinue to cut aid budgets and elections add even more uncertainty to pledges, especially where they entail transitions between political parties,' says the Center for Global Development’s report. It remains to be seen whether development funds will actually fail to raise enough money, since the replenishment season is still underway. But if the money does fall short, aid flows could be jeopardised, with potentially dire consequences for the poorest countries in the world. 'You don’t want [aid] to go up and down, because when it goes down, that can have permanent effects,' said Jean-Louis Arcand, president of the Global Development Network, who wasn’t involved in the report. One typical example is when someone in a poor country loses their job as a result of cuts, they might not be able to afford to keep their children in school, Arcand toldSciDev.Net. Aid budget cuts by major donors such as the UK and Germany could have direct consequences on the stability of aid, which is essential in countries where large shares of government budgets are made up of aid money, said Arcand. 'If the Germans, the UK, cut [aid budgets], the people who are going to get hurt are the people in the least developed countries,' he said. The World Bank, which oversees the International Development Association, or IDA, says there is a need to step up ambition for the IDA since multiple crises have set back progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and development. However, it declined to comment directly on the report’s findings. A Global Fund spokesperson said the Fund hoped to launch its investment case in the first quarter of next year in a 'challenging' context of development finance. The Fund has mobilised an additional US$109.4 million since its last replenishment, or fundraising cycle, so has been able to invest more than expected in the current period, the spokesperson added. More broadly, decreasing aid budgets and reduced domestic financing for health threaten to impact the delivery of 'core and essential life-saving care … such as antiretrovirals,malariabed nets, therapeutics and diagnostics' as well as investment in the next generation of solutions, the spokesperson said. Gavi didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Bucking the trend Elise Dufief, research lead at IDDRI, a France-based sustainable development think tank, said that the latest aid budget cuts do warrant concern, but that some countries are leading the way in increasing contributions. Denmark has said it will increase its aid contributions by 40 per cent and good news is also expected from South Korea, said Dufief, while some African countries have pledged contributions to the African Development Fund. 'I think these countries are really showing that they can decide that they want to contribute and lead on these issues, and hopefully encourage others to join as well,' she said.

From Waste To Resource: Recovering Nutrients To Fertilize The Fut...	Europe faces growing food supply demands and a shortage of non-renewable raw materials for fertilisers. But producing more from available resources is possible, say researchers: 'The nutrients we need are before our eyes, ready to be transformed.' European farmers face a monumental dual challenge: increasing food production while meeting daunting deadlines imposed by the green transition. Amid the drive to produce greener, more efficient fertilisers, new technologies seek to squeeze maximum potential from nutrients that have long been imported, but which until now have been under-exploited. 'An important part of the nutrients we have been importing for years are here, ready to be transformed and to be given another life,' says Javier Brañas Lasala, Director of Research, Development and Innovation at the Spanish fertiliser producer Fertiberia. Using nutrients from bio-waste to reduce Europe’s dependency on non-renewable raw materials and increase the efficiency of new sustainable fertilisers is one of the main goals of B-Ferst, a 5-year European project he coordinates, due to end this October. The European Commission president has highlighted the challenge of securing future food supplies, via sustainable farming that protects nature and respects climate goals. Where are we at globally in facing that challenge? We’re on the way to guarantee the food supply for everyone, but it's still not achieved. The population is growing and unfortunately there are countries and people that don't have enough food. So, we need to increase food production, but we cannot use more land. We need a technological increase in farming systems, to produce more per hectare in a sustainable way. The challenge is very big, because Europe has decided to increase the surface area dedicated to organic farming to 30% in a few years, and organic farming is less productive than traditional farming. So, we must bet on high value-added products and put together all the knowledge we have in order to be much more efficient and at the same time more respectful of the environment. In recent years we’ve seen the pandemic, war in Europe, ongoing disruption to supplies, higher prices. How urgent does that make this transition? As fast as possible, but I’m not sure if we're getting there on time, because it’s not an easy challenge. However, the European Commission has been very clear with dates and deadlines and together with European companies it’s putting a lot of money into research and innovation. The EU still depends on non-renewable raw materials and uses natural gas as its main energy source for producing fertilisers. Are we still not a long way off achieving set goals? It must be step by step. Europe doesn’t have the natural resources to produce the nutrients needed for farming. But we do have a large part of the nutrients we’ve been importing for years: in waste treatment plants, in agricultural soils. We have them here — tons and tons of phosphates and potash and so on — ready to be transformed. We’ve been trying to do that, for phosphorus and for potassium mainly. With nitrogen fertilisers we have the same problem: nitrogen plus hydrogen produce ammonia, and the hydrogen comes from natural gas. Even so, many companies in our sector are setting very ambitious decarbonisation targets, betting on renewable energies and innovating to gradually reduce their carbon footprint and to offer European agriculture sustainable and smart crop nutrition solutions, in line with what society demands. The B-Ferst project set out to valorise underexploited bio-waste, develop new green fertilisers, substitute raw materials, and cut energy consumption. How much has been achieved? We have two goals here: one is nutrient recovery; the other is to increase the nutrients’ performance. The first — the circular economy, the re-use of nutrients from bio-waste — is not easy: a lot of new technologies are under development, but they’re not cheap. There is a logistic issue: the residues are produced in different places, their composition varies during the year, supply is temporal, mostly the nutrients need to be concentrated. You can’t transport low-concentrated bio-waste nutrients far: moving liquid manure 400 kilometres, for example, is expensive. An industrial process is needed to transform a bio-waste into a raw material. Some bio-waste is suitable for fertiliser production, but most needs more development. The project’s objective wasn’t to make fertilisers 100% from bio-waste because that’s nearly impossible at a big scale. But we can produce fertilisers by partially substituting nutrients, with about 20% coming from bio-waste. However, to have more impact in Europe, with more fertiliser producers doing the same, a bigger effort is needed from waste management companies to develop processes to transform this bio-waste into raw materials. And the second objective, to increase the nutrients’ efficiency? We’ve got that through the development of bio-stimulants that increase the efficiency of the nutrients you apply to the soil. It’s very exciting to see how we can make these fertilisers more efficient and more advanced. We’ve also produced special innovative coatings to protect the bio-stimulants, increase the nutrients’ efficiency and protect them in the soil from leeching. With these new additives we’ve found we can increase production by between 5 to 15%. Some reports identify potentially serious barriers, particularly financial and on crop yields. Other reports have also highlighted problems with pricing and regulation. Won’t the new fertilisers be too expensive for farmers? Pricing, like quality, is of course very important: in the end if it's not economically viable it won’t work. Of course, transforming bio-waste into a raw material and moving it from the point of production to the fertiliser plant are costly but farmers aren't going to pay much more for these fertilisers; it’s hard enough for them producing food for us, we can’t make their job harder still! Any difference in price between BFerst fertilisers and conventional ones should be small, but the benefits will be much higher. So, our message is: 'yes, maybe this will be just a little more expensive, but we’re going to produce more per square metre'. Higher yields… Yes, in the end it's going to be a win-win, they're going to produce more, and via a circular economy that uses high-technology bio-stimulants to make fertilisers. We get everything we were looking for: higher yields, lower environmental impact. Are there communication problems with the industry and can they be overcome? I think the farmers will always valorise the best product for their business. The first thing is to show that their production has been higher per kilogram of nutrient they're applying. So, on numbers alone, farmers will be convinced by the economic benefits. Afterwards, we’ll highlight the environmental advantages such as carbon footprint and waste reduction — and argue that they're contributing to make Europe stronger because we’ll be less dependent on natural resources from abroad, very important at a time of international tension.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen11mj3oFyKw7v6L8moPO_	2024-10-20T15:38:42-07:00	
How Airbnb Could Help Curb The Rise In Housing Costs	Home-rental platforms like Airbnb are known to drive up housing costs, but a new study shows that doing a better job of collecting the taxes owed by these home rentals appears to slow the rise in home prices. The finding suggests that tax policy can help to mitigate rising home prices, particularly in areas where there are a lot of short-term rental properties. 'It’s well established that Airbnb rentals can drive up home prices, and that’s because a lot of homeowners who use Airbnb or similar services are not paying the taxes that they’re supposed to,' says Jared Smith, co-author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of finance in North Carolina State University’s Poole College of Management. 'For example, hotels have to pay taxes imposed by local governments on short-term rentals,' Smith says. 'Airbnb hosts are supposed to do this as well, but previous research tells us that as many as 75% of hosts aren’t paying those taxes. That makes being an Airbnb host particularly profitable. This drives up property prices by effectively encouraging people to purchase homes specifically to put them on the short-term rental market. The increased competition makes those properties more expensive for people who are seeking to rent or purchase a long-term home. 'Our goal with this work was to determine whether tax policy can make a difference,' Smith says. 'Specifically, we wanted to examine whether having companies that oversee short-term home rentals – like Airbnb – collect relevant taxes right off the top would help slow the rise in home prices.' For the study, researchers focused on Florida, where taxes are largely levied at the local level. Coupled with the fact that Florida garners a lot of tourist visitors, this made the state a good source of data that would allow researchers to assess the impact of local Airbnb tax collection efforts. The researchers collected county-level tax data from all 67 Florida counties for the years 2012-2019. Between 2015 and 2019, 41 Florida counties adopted tax enforcement agreements with Airbnb, in which Airbnb collects the taxes directly from the hosts who are renting the homes. In the remaining 26 counties, hosts are responsible for paying the taxes. 'In other words, by 2019, 41 counties had rules in place with Airbnb that meant the company collected 100% of the taxes that were due on Airbnb rentals,' Smith says. 'We used statistical approaches that allowed us to account for confounding variables and compare changes in both property prices and residential rent costs across all 67 counties. We refer to the combination of property price and rent costs as ‘housing costs.’' The researchers found that housing costs went up in every county. But housing costs in counties that did not have Airbnb tax enforcement agreements went up 1.6 to5.8% more than housing costs in counties that did have tax enforcement agreements. And the effect of the tax enforcement agreements varied according to the size of the housing unit. 'Essentially, the bigger the housing unit, the more pronounced the effect,' Smith says. 'For example, a one-bedroom apartment might have seen housing prices rise by an additional 1.6%, whereas a four-bedroom home would likely have seen a rise closer to 5.8%. 'In short, our findings suggest that implementing tax enforcement agreements with the companies that oversee the short-term rental industry could make a significant impact in slowing the rise of housing costs,' Smith says. 'This has two very real benefits. First, many parts of the country have been seeing skyrocketing housing prices, putting significant stress on both renters and homebuyers. This could help with that. Second, it guarantees that hosts will comply with existing tax requirements by removing the possibility of tax evasion, which is good news for the coffers of local governments and the services they provide.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfKh-y680HL22_63bikK-sP	2024-10-20T15:33:07-07:00	
Sweden Meets UN Targets For HIV Epidemic	Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, according to a study in Eurosurveillance by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and others. According to the researchers, Sweden is the first country in the world to achieve these targets. Sweden has reached a historic milestone in the fight against HIV. A new study shows that Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, known as the 95-95-95 target. This means that 95 percent of all people living with HIV in the country have been diagnosed, 95 percent of these are receiving treatment, and 95 percent of those treated have undetectable levels of the virus in their blood. The targets are to be reached by 2025. Sweden's figures are even better: 96 percent have been diagnosed, 99 percent are on treatment and 98 percent have undetectable virus levels. 'This is proof that it is possible to reach these ambitious targets. It shows that Sweden's infrastructure for finding and treating people with HIV is very effective,' says one of the researchers behind the study, Professor Anders Sönnerborg at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet. The study is based on data from the national HIV cohort established in 2003. Over 99 percent of all people diagnosed with HIV in Sweden are included in this cohort, and the data has been analyzed using advanced bioinformatics methods in collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States. 'We have shown that we have indeed reached the target. This means that people with HIV in Sweden have a life expectancy approaching that of non-HIV-infected people and that the vast majority of those diagnosed are not infectious,' says Anders Sönnerborg. The results are important because they show that it is possible to achieve the UNAIDS and WHO targets, which may inspire other countries to intensify their efforts against HIV. Despite the successes, challenges remain, such as late diagnosis, stigma and, not least, HIV cure. 'Research on HIV cure is now a top priority,' says Anders Sönnerborg Researchers at Karolinska Institutet are also continuing to work to ensure that the targets are maintained and to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV. 'We are now working on a fourth goal: that 95 percent of people living with HIV in Sweden should have a good quality of life,' says Anders Sönnerborg. Anders Sönnerborg says that Sweden is the first country with a published study that can show that these goals have been achieved. 'This success shows that Sweden is a leader in the fight against HIV and that it is possible to reach the global targets to end the HIV epidemic.' The study was conducted in close collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, and has been funded by the NIH, the Swedish Research Council and Region Stockholm.

3D Printing Method May Improve Micro Energy Storage	One key to making portable devices more compact and energy efficient lies in the precise nanoscale form of energy-storing capacitors. Researchers in Sweden report they've cracked the challenge with a unique 3D printing method.Researchers at KTH Royal Institute of Technology demonstrated a 3D printing method for fabricating glass micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) that reduces the complexity and time required to form the intricate nanoscale features MSCs need. The advance could potentially lead to more compact and energy-efficient portable devices, including self-sustaining sensors, wearable devices and other Internet of Things applications, says Frank Niklaus, professor of micro- and nanosystems at KTH. Their study was published in ACS Nano. The new method addresses two key challenges to fabricating such devices. A micro-supercapacitor's performance is largely determined by its electrodes, which store and conduct electrical energy. So they need more electrode surface area, and they need nanoscale channels to facilitate rapid ion transport. Po-Han Huang, who was lead author of the study at KTH, says the new research addresses both challenges with through ultrashort laser pulse 3D printing technology. The researchers discovered that ultrashort laser pulses can induce two simultaneous reactions in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), a glass-like precursor material. One reaction results in the formation of self-organized nanoplates, while the second converts the precursor into silicon-rich glass, which is the foundation of the 3D printing process. This enables the fast and precise fabrication of electrodes with plenty of open channels, which maximizes surface area and speeds up ion transport. The researchers demonstrated the approach by 3D-printing micro-supercapacitors that performed well even when charged and discharged very quickly. 'Our findings represent a significant leap forward in microfabrication, with broad implications for the development of high-performance energy storage devices,' Huang says. 'Beyond MSCs, our approach has exciting potential applications in fields such as optical communication, nanoelectromechanical sensors and 5D optical data storage.' The implications are also significant for technologies presently in common use. Supercapacitors of the non-micro type are already collecting energy generated during braking, stabilizing power supply in consumer electronics, and optimizing energy capture in renewable energy, Niklaus says. 'Micro-supercapacitors have the potential to make these applications more compact and efficient.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRSACLOX4vQWaRRIH7l7Ps	2024-10-20T15:24:35-07:00	
Iran Seeks Influence In Sudan Through An Influx Of Weapons – Anal...	Iran is working to take advantage of the chaos caused by Sudan’s civil war to gain a foothold on the Red Sea. Establishing a presence in Sudan would, in essence, enable Iran to box in its regional opponents, including Saudi Arabia and Israel, and threaten shipping through the Suez Canal, according to experts. 'It [Iran] considers it a starting point towards achieving long term strategic gains, in terms of expansion in Africa, control of the Red Sea and wider regional influence,' analyst Abdal Monim Himmat wrote recently for The Arab Weekly. Toward that end, Iran has spent more than a year rebuilding its relations with Sudan’s leadership, which is based in Port Sudan because the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controls most of the national capital, Khartoum. In October 2023, Sudan and Iran resumed diplomatic ties and exchanged ambassadors after an eight-year break. Since then, Iran has supplied the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with weapons to bolster its fight against the RSF. A crucial part of those weapon shipments has been the Iran-made Mohajer-6 and Ababil drones. The drones helped the SAF defeat RSF fighters. Earlier this year, the drones played a key role in driving the RSF out of parts of Omdurman and retaking the headquarters of Sudan’s national broadcaster. Mohajer-6 drones are capable of delivering explosives. In addition to Iranian weapons, the SAF increasingly relies on Iranian intelligence to aid its offensives against the RSF. Observers say Iran has helped the SAF recruit and train new soldiers drawn from people displaced by the fighting who have been trained at camps in Uganda. Iran has attempted to use its aid to the SAF as leverage to get the Sudanese leadership to approve an Iranian naval base on Sudan’s coast. The country has rejected that proposal along with a later proposal for a dual-use commercial and military port at Port Sudan. Iran’s aid has become a key component of the SAF’s effectiveness against the RSF. When the Iranian government was distracted by the death of President Sayyid Ebrahim Raisolsadati in May, the SAF’s battlefield actions suffered, according to observers. Sudan’s connections with Iran go beyond weapons and intelligence. 'The Sudanese Army seeks to leverage Iran’s presence as a tool to pressure anti-Iran regional and international actors, encouraging them to push the RSF toward agreeing to a ceasefire on the Army’s terms,' Hani al-Aasar wrote recently for the Emirates Policy Center. The RSF gets aid from the United Arab Emirates, which, along with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries has a tense relationship with Iran. So far, that strategy has not borne fruit, al-Aasar noted. Ultimately, Sudan is likely to come out on the losing end of Iran’s involvement in its civil war as the Islamic Republic expands its presence in the country. 'As the Sudanese army and Iran have clearly intensified their cooperation, speculation has arisen about Sudan’s vulnerability to Tehran’s influence,' al-Aasar wrote. 'The ongoing war between the Sudanese Army and the RSF has significantly eroded Sudan’s resilience against infiltration and influence by foreign powers.' In the short term, however, the influx of Iranian weapons creates the risk that Sudan’s internal conflict will worsen and might spread beyond its borders. 'Iranian weapons in Sudan will further ignite conflicts there and in surrounding countries,' Himmat wrote. 'It will turn the Red Sea into an arena for international confrontation, further complicating the security posture in region and exposing international navigation to major threats.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i866G2VThv7xZ	2024-10-19T17:27:08-07:00	
Tigray Must Avert Another Cycle Of War – Analysis	As tensions between two TPLF factions rise, urgent measures are needed to prevent another crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. By Meressa K Dessu and Tegbaru Yared After two years of war in Ethiopia’s Tigray Region, the 2022 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) ended clashes between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The parties agreed to find lasting and comprehensive solutions, including restoring constitutional order in Tigray. The TPLF was Tigray’s ruling party for over 30 years. Under the CoHA, it makes up only 51% of the new Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), reducing the party’s tradition of absolute control. Now the TPLF has split into two factions, and violent conflict looms again. Divisions are mainly between the party’s leaders in the TIA under Getachew Reda (TPLF Deputy Chair and Executive Committee Member) and those led by Party Chair Debretsion Gebremichael. The former say the latter are trying to undermine and fragment the administration, reducing the TIA’s control over local governance. Debretsion’s faction accuses the TIA of compromising Tigrayan interests,and recentlyclaimedthey disagreed with some CoHA provisions despite publicly committing to implementing the agreement. After coming to power following popular protests and violence in Ethiopia between 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali restructured the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front – a coalition of four regional parties including the TPLF – into the Prosperity Party (PP). The TPLF said the move was illegal and refused to join the PP. This contributed to rising tensions between the PP-led federal government and the TPLF-led Tigray regional government, eventually culminating in the civil war thatkilledover 600 000 people. TPLF infighting could be an opportunity to spark a new political culture and marketplace of ideas in Tigray The CoHA helped establish an ‘inclusive’ TIA. Following his party's nomination, Getachew was appointed president of the interim administration by Abiy. While the TPLF has significant influence over the TIA, the body includes representatives from the political opposition, civil society, Tigray security force and intellectuals. Many Tigrayans have credited the TIA for improving relations with the federal government, helping return some internally displaced persons (IDPs), attempting to separate party and state structures, entertaining media freedom, and promoting assembly and freedom of speech. At the same time, the TIA has been criticised for not addressing crime, returning all IDPs or fully restoring Tigrayan authority to its pre-war status – some territories remain occupied by Eritrean and Amhara forces. The TIA has acknowledged its weaknesses on several occasions, but claims the TPLF’s factionalism has intensified its difficult task. Tensions resulted in the Getachew-led faction boycotting the 14thTPLF Congress in August, convened by Debretsion’s faction. Following the congress’ decisions, 16 senior political figures including Getachew were expelled from the party. The Getachew-led faction has however labelled the congress illegal and its decision ‘null and void.’ Some commentatorscriticisedthe congress for bypassing due process and lackingapprovalfrom the National Election Board of Ethiopia. The board is a federal institution that registers and manages political parties and ensures impartial elections in the country. TPLF infighting could, however, spark a new political culture, civic discourse and a marketplace of ideas in Tigray. Both factions hold public meetings freely to build support and haven’t resorted to using the state's coercive power to resolve their differences, as happened after the bloody 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritreawar. Any move by Tigray’s security forces in support of either faction would plunge the region into violence At the same time, various parts of Tigrayan society have become more assertive and organised, challenging both factions publicly and urging them to avoid violence. This has opened the political space with media outlets, intellectuals, civic organisations, youth and the diaspora expressing different perspectives on politics in Tigray. Healthy debates among the government, parties and social forces are emerging, which could encourage a more open society and non-violent politics – if sustained. The very existence of the two factions may lead to a more balanced, equitable political environment – if they become separate political parties. However, the situation is fragile. Both factions seek support from the Tigray security forces, which is a dangerous move against peace. Getachew’s group claims the TIA commands the security forces, but Debretsion’s faction refutes this. So far, the security forces have largely kept their neutral posture, with their leaders committing to maintaining peace and preventing looming anarchy in Tigray. At this point, any move by Tigray’s security forces to support either faction would plunge the region into more violence. Both sides have popular support, with the youth demanding real changes in the political landscape. Most Tigray security force members are young, so any misstep by their leaders could lead them into violence that will be hard to control. The TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome Another consideration is that the TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome. Any attempt by the Debretsion-led faction or other actors against the TIA will affect the federal government’s interests and could result in military interventions and further crisis. The region fought hard for self-administration and self-determination, so Tigrayans would struggle to accept such interventions. Delays in fully implementing the CoHA may also lead to conflict. The federal government committed to facilitating the return and reintegration of IDPs and refugees, yet hundreds of thousands remain stranded and desperate. More than a million people are displaced in Tigray, and over 70 000 sought refuge in Sudan, which now faces its own civil war. Their continued suffering and frustrations could lead to more violence unless solved urgently. The federal government also pledged to protect civilians and Tigray’s territories from foreign incursion, but variousreportsshow Eritrean forces are still in Tigray and continue committing atrocities against civilians. Recently, the US Special Envoy to the Horn of Africa Ambassador Mike Hammerwarnedthat this presence of Eritrean forces could ‘flame an already tragic situation.’ To prevent another war in Tigray, the CoHA must be fully implemented and political tensions between the TPLF factions resolved. The international community, particularly the African Union, United Nations and United States – who brokered the CoHA, and the European Union, must persuade the TPLF factions to resolve their differences peacefully. All parties to the CoHA should also be encouraged to honour their commitments. Leaders of Tigray’s security forces must maintain their neutrality and avoid intervening in support of either TPLF faction, lest the region be turned into chaos.

Ukraine Repels Russian Aerial Attack On Kyiv	Ukraine's military deployed air-defense systems late Saturday to repel an aerial assault on Kyiv, according to the capital's top elected official. 'Stay in shelters!' Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the scope of the aerial assault. Saturday's attack follows a visit to the city by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who said a Ukrainian defeat would mean 'chaos' for the international order. According to Agence France-Presse, Barrot's speech came hours after Russian forces issued a statement claiming that they'd captured another village in the country's east. Barrot's visit, aimed at underlining Paris' unflinching support for Ukraine, comes at the end of a week in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled his 'victory plan' to defeat Russia, again calling for beefed-up Western backing. 'A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,' said Barrot, who also warned that recent reports of North Korean regular troops supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, if verified, would constitute a serious escalation of the war. France's top diplomat also said Paris was open to the idea of an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, but that talks would continue on the subject with allies. Barrot's stop in Kyiv coincided with the G7 defense ministerial meeting in Naples, Italy, which saw a pledge of 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, including vows of military aid, according to a final statement. 'We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,' read the group's final statement following the one-day summit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8-N0DvfNDp6k	2024-10-19T17:24:04-07:00	
Making The Most Of EU Catch-All Control On Cyber-Surveillance Exp...	By Dr Mark Bromley and Giovanna Maletta In 2021 the European Union (EU) adopted a new iteration of the EU Dual-use Regulation, which sets common standards for EU member states’ controls on exports ofdual-use items. Among other new features,Regulation (EU) 2021/821introduces a new ‘catch-all control’ for cyber-surveillance items. This requires exporters to seek approval for exports of cyber-surveillance items when they become aware that the items are likely to be used in connection with human rights violations, even if those items are not specifically covered by existing export controls. It therefore gives EU member states the power to control such transfers. Although the proliferation and misuse of spyware and other cyber-surveillance tools are growing concerns, the use of the new catch-all control has been limited to date. One likely reason is that exporters appear to be unclear about how to apply it. This week, the EU published a newset of guidelinesintended to help exporters to comply with the catch-all control. This backgrounder examines the catch-all control and the new guidelines, highlighting their main features and limitations. It also suggests steps that could be taken by the newly elected European Parliament and others to improve the guidelines and support consistent, effective application of both the new catch-all control and restrictions on the trade in cyber-surveillance items more broadly. Export controls and cyber-surveillance tools Export controls rely on ‘control lists’ of specific items or categories of items that may only be exported after obtaining a licence from the competent national authorities. However, it is difficult to ensure that these lists cover all relevant items, especially in areas where technologies are developing rapidly. Moreover, there are products that are not controlled because they fall outside the technical thresholds but could nonetheless be used in ways the regulations aim to prevent. States have responded to this challenge by introducing ‘catch-all controls’ that impose a licence requirement on exports of non-listed items that are nevertheless likely to be used in prohibited ways or by prohibited end-users. The control list of the EU Dual-use Regulation is found in Annex I and is based on the control lists adopted by theWassenaar Arrangementand other multilateral export control regimes. Five categories of cyber-surveillance tools have been added to Annex I since 2013, toaddress concernsabout the misuse of these cyber-surveillance items by state actors in ways that threaten other states’ national security (for example, to enable the theft of sensitive data or attacks on critical infrastructure), or in connection with violations of human rights (for example, to facilitate the repression of political opponents through torture or unlawful detention). However, there are additional cyber-surveillance tools that are not captured by the EU dual-use control list. There are also many technologies that have legitimate civilian uses but that can be repurposed as cyber-surveillance tools or their subcomponents. To date, the EU’s control list includes no such ‘truly dual-use’ technologies—only what are better described as ‘single-use’ technologies that are specifically designed for use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. States have so far been unwilling to control exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools and related subcomponents for fear of disrupting the trade in legitimate cybersecurity tools. The new EU catch-all control on cyber-surveillance items and the accompanying guidelines have the potential to help close these gaps by expanding the set of cyber-surveillance items that are subject to control and selectively targeting exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools. The EU cyber-surveillance catch-all control Prior to 2021 the EU Dual-use Regulation included three catch-all controls on non-listed items that may contribute to a weapons of mass destruction programme, have a ‘military end-use’ in a state subject to an arms embargo, or be used as parts or components in illegally exported military equipment. Article 5 of the 2021 Dual-use Regulation adds a new catch-all control that applies to non-listed cyber-surveillance items that ‘may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with internal repression and/or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law’. Article 5 can be triggered in two ways. The national licensing authority can notify an exporter of the requirement for a licence. However, exporters are also obliged to inform their national licensing authority if, on the basis of their own due diligence findings, they become aware that the items are intended for a prohibited end-use, in which case the authority may decide the export cannot go ahead. One category of non-listed cyber-surveillance items that might be subject to a licence requirement under the catch-all control is mobile phone hacking services, which trick wireless carriers’ servers into revealing the location data of their users. Switzerlandhas proposedthat mobile phone hacking tools be covered by the Wassenaar Arrangement control list but this is unlikely to happen in the near future due to political divisions within the group. Another category is data-retention systems, which store collected surveillance data for later use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. These have also been proposed for control at the Wassenaar Arrangement and are included in the national control lists ofGermany and Spain. Truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools that might be covered by the catch-all control include, for example, tools for capturing and analysing biometric data, such as facial recognition tools. Another type isdual-intent tools, such as vulnerability scanners, that are designed to help organizations test their own vulnerability to cyberattacks but can also be used to perpetrate malicious cyberattacks. One important type of subcomponent that might be captured by the catch-all control isdeep packet inspection (DPI) technologies. DPI has a wide range of legitimate cybersecurity applications but is also used to enable the functioning of some cyber-surveillance tools. The new guidelines and what they say Article 5 of the Dual-use Regulation states that the Commission and Council ‘shall make available guidelines for exporters’ on how to implement their obligations under the catch-all control. The newCommission Recommendation (EU) 2024/2659, which was released on 16 October 2024 (but dated 11 October), fulfils that requirement. The guidelines are mainly concerned with clarifying for exporters when they should alert the licensing authority about a potential export. To do this they elaborate on the content of Article 5 and the definition of cyber-surveillance items provided by the Dual-use Regulation. This section looks at key aspects of those explanations and their implications. ‘Specially designed to enable . . . covert surveillance’ The Dual-use Regulation defines cyber-surveillance items as ‘dual-use items specially designed to enable the covert surveillance of natural persons by monitoring, extracting, collecting or analysing data from information and telecommunication systems’. According to the new guidelines, ‘specially designed’ means that covert surveillance must have been the ‘main purpose’ of the item’s development and design, although the item may have other possible uses. ‘Covert surveillance’ is explained as occurring when a person ‘cannot objectively expect to be under surveillance’. This definition potentially brings mobile phone hacking tools, data-retention systems and certain types of dual-intent product within the scope of Article 5. Less clear is if and how facial recognition and other biometric tools would be captured. Both the European Parliament and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)have advocatedfor biometric tools to be subject to controls, and in July 2024 it wasproposedthat facial recognition tools be included in the national control list of the United States. However, many of the mostconcerning applicationsof biometric tools involve the use of footage collected from CCTV cameras that are publicly visible. The guidelines say that ‘[f]acial and emotion recognition technologies that can be used to monitor or analyse stored video images, could fall within the scope of the definition of cyber-surveillance item’. However, if the system is drawing its data from publicly visible CCTV, then it is hard to see how it would meet the criterion ‘specially designed to enable...covert surveillance’, creating ambiguity. ‘Awareness’ that the items are ‘intended . . . for’ Regulation 2021/821 and the new guidelines reflect a wider trend in which NGOs and states are pushing for exporters to take on more responsibility for identifying potentially sensitive exports. Article 5 obliges an exporter to notify the authorities if it is ‘aware, according to its due diligence findings’ that cyber-surveillance items it proposes to export are intended for the proscribed uses. The guidelines state that ‘'aware' ... implies that the exporter has positive knowledge of the intended misuse’ and that ‘the exporter should assess the end-use on a case-by-case basis, in light of the specific circumstances of that case’ in order to identify whether an item may be ‘intended for’ a sensitive end-use. Significantly, the guidelines indicate that the due-diligence obligations apply not only to exporters of finished cyber-surveillance tools but also to exporters of products that ‘could be used as part or component’ of such a system. If the product was ‘specially designed to enable ... covert surveillance’, this implies that the catch-all control could potentially apply to exports of components such as DPI technologies that might be sold as civilian products but later integrated into a cyber-surveillance system. ‘Internal repression’, ‘serious violation of human rights’ and ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’ To clarify what may constitute prohibited uses, the guidelines refer to language used in both the EU Common Position on arms exports (2008/944/CFSP) and its accompanyinguser’s guide. According to the Common Position, ‘internal repression includes ... torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, summary or arbitrary executions, disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other major violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in relevant international human rights instruments’. The user’s guide states that ‘the current and past record’ of the end-user and recipient country with regard to human rights should be considered to assess the risk of an exported item being used for internal repression. Similarly, for the interpretation of ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’, the guidelines again refer to the Common Position user’s guide, which calls for assessing the recipient’s attitude towards international humanitarian law (IHL) by looking at its record, its formal commitments and its capacity to uphold relevant provisions. The Dual-use Regulation uses the Common Position as a point of reference for licensing authorities in making licensing decisions, so it is logical to also use it as a reference point for exporters assessing potential exports of cyber-surveillance tools. However, the Common Position and its user’s guide are focused on transfers of military equipment and do not consider several issues relevant to transfers of dual-use items and cyber-surveillance tools or other items captured by the Dual-use Regulation. In particular, they do not consider factors that would be relevant for assessing the recipient’s record regarding the appropriate use of cyber-surveillance tools or consider the specific IHL risks that might arise in connection with their use. Next steps for Article 5 and the guidelines Regulation 2021/821 tasks the Commission with conducting an evaluation, ‘after 10 September 2024’, of the new catch-all control for cyber-surveillance items. This gives the newly elected European Parliament and others an opportunity to clarify the intended coverage of the new catch-all control and strengthen the EU’s and EU member states’ controls on cyber-surveillance tools more broadly. These steps should include the following: Develop case studies In feedback on the first draft of the guidelines, which was published in March 2023, businesses and other stakeholders asked for ‘concrete practical examples’ of cyber-surveillance items potentially requiring an export licence under Article 5, accompanied by relevant case studies. These have not been included in the published guidelines. Although the guidelines rightly note that it is ‘impossible to provide an exhaustive list of those products that may be controlled as 'non-listed items' under Article 5’, it should be possible to develop real or fictional case studies. This could be done collaboratively by the Commission, the European Parliament, EU member states and NGOs through the use of tabletop exercises. Add language on cyber-surveillance risks to the Common Position user’s guide The new guidelines make frequent reference to Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and its user’s guide. While these documents are useful on issues of human rights and IHL, they do not specifically address issues relating to the use and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools. In order to improve the value and comprehensiveness of the user’s guide, the European Parliament could recommend revising it to cover both military items and items captured by the Dual-use Regulation and include detailed language on assessing risks associated with cyber-surveillance tools. This could be done as part of the currentreview of the Common Position, which is expected to conclude by the end of 2024. Build connections with other areas of policymaking Addressing the proliferation and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools is a complex challenge that cannot be achieved through any single policy instrument. Building on its 2023 inquiry to investigate the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware, the European Parliament could push for the development of a common and coordinated EU approach for controlling not only the export but also the procurement and use of cyber-surveillance tools. In response to theEuropean Parliament’s recommendationsfollowing the inquiry, the Commission is currently working on adraft communicationthat will reportedly focus on addressing the possible misuse of cyber-surveillance tools at the national level. This communication and the publication of the Article 5 guidelines create the opportunity for a more coordinated set of policy responses at the EU level. As part of this approach, the EU should coordinate with theUSA-led initiative to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which seeks to adopt a more comprehensive policy response.

Widening The War: The US Sends Troops To Israel – OpEd	The dangers should be plastered on every wall in every office occupied by a military and political advisor. Israel’s attempt to reshape the Middle East, far from giving it enduring security, will merely serve to make it more vulnerable and unstable than ever. In that mix and mess will be its greatest sponsor and guardian, the United States, a giant of almost blind antiquity in all matters concerning the Jewish state. In a measure that should have garnered bold headlines, the Biden administration has announced the deployment of some 100 US soldiers to Israel who will be responsible for operating the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. They are being sent to a conflict that resembles a train travelling at high speed, with no risk of stopping. As Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant promised in the aftermath of Iran’s October 1 missile assault on his country, 'Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising.' It would be of such a nature that 'They will not understand what happened and how it happened.' In an October 16 meeting between the Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Gallant, the deployment of a mobile THAAD battery was seen 'as an operational example of the United States’ ironclad support to the defense of Israel.' Largely meaningless bits of advice were offered to Gallant: that Israel 'continue taking steps to address the dire humanitarian situation' and take 'all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security' of UN peacekeepers operating in Lebanon’s south. The charade continued the next day in a conversation between Austin and Gallant discussing the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. THAAD was again mentioned as essential for Israel’s 'right to defence itself' while representing the 'United States’ unwavering, enduring, and ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.' ('Ironclad' would seem to be the word of the moment, neatly accompanying Israel’s own Iron Dome defence system.) A statement from the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, was a fatuous effort in minimising the dangers of the deployment. The battery would merely 'augment Israel’s integrated air defense system,' affirm the ongoing commitment to Israel’s defence and 'defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks from Iran.' The very public presence of US troops, working alongside their Israeli counterparts in anticipation of broadening conflict, does not merely suggest Washington’s failure to contain their ally. It entails a promise of ceaseless supply, bolstering and emboldening. Furthermore, it will involve placing US troops in harm’s way, a quixotic invitation if ever there was one. As things stand, the US is already imperilling its troops by deploying them in a series of bases in Jordan, Syria and Iraq. Iran’s armed affiliates have been making their presence felt, harrying the stationed troops with increasing regularity since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7 last year. A gradual, attritive toll is registering, featuring such attacks as those on the Tower 22 base in northern Jordan in January that left three US soldiers dead. Writing in August for The Guardian, former US army major Harrison Mann eventually realised an awful truth about the mounting assaults on these sandy outposts of the US imperium: 'there was no real plan to protect US troops beyond leaving them in their small, isolated bases while local militants, emboldened and agitated by US support for Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, used them for target practice.' To send more aircraft and warships to the Middle East also served to encourage 'reckless escalation towards a wider war,' providing insurance to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could be protected 'from the consequences of his actions.' Daniel Davis, a military expert at Defense Priorities, is firmly logical on the point of enlisting US personnel in the Israeli cause. 'Naturally, if Americans are killed in the execution of their duties, there will be howls from the pro-war hawks in the West ‘demanding’ the president ‘protect our troops’ by firing back on Iran.' It was 'exactly the sort of thing that gets nations sucked into war they have no interest in fighting.' Polling, insofar as that measure counts, suggests that enthusiasm for enrolling US troops in Israel’s defence is far from warm. In results from a survey published by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations in August, some four in ten polled would favour sending US troops to defend Israel if it was attacked by Iran. Of the sample, 53% of Republicans would favour defending Israel in that context, along with four in 10 independents (42%), and a third of Democrats (34%). There have also been some mutterings from the Pentagon itself about Israel’s burgeoning military effort, in particular against the Lebanese Iran-backed militia, Hezbollah. In a report from The New York Times, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., is said to be worried about the widening US presence in the region, a fact that would hamper overall 'readiness' of the US in other conflicts. Being worried is just the start of it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8zFK0VLYUxLj	2024-10-19T17:16:26-07:00	
China’s Information War In Africa – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya and Yuvvraj Singh In 2014, during the Central Foreign Affairs meeting in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping advocated for strengthening China’s soft power globally by improving how the country communicates its message. In the subsequent years, Chinese state-controlled media focused on cultural investments and international cooperation, establishing marketing networks and expanding the reach of quality cultural assets abroad, particularly in Africa. China’s African outreach China’s information campaigns in Africa are subtle, focusing on economic issues and promoting apositive narrativearound its investments, mainly in the Belt and Road Initiative. State-controlled media outlets likeXinhua, China Daily, China Radio International (CRI), and CGTN(formerly CCTV International) play a vital role in this narrative. Meanwhile, StarTimes, a Chinese-owned media company, has become Africa’ssecond-largestdigital TV provider, with over 13 million digital TV and 20 million streaming subscribers. It has invested over US$2 billionin digital TV infrastructure across 30 African countries. Additionally, China actively produces documentaries to enhance its soft power, such as Africans in Yiwu, TAZARA: A Journey without an End, and Bobby’s Factory. For instance, the docuseries 'Bobby’s Factory' focuses on a Chinese factory owner in Africa and his positive interactions with local workers. Another series, 'TAZARA: A Journey without an End', highlights the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project, a symbol of China-Africa cooperation under the broader umbrella of BRI. Consisting of three episodes, 'A Railway of Friendship', 'The Life Line', and 'Love for Tazara', the docuseries delves into the emotional connection of the railway line and how it positively impacted Tanzanian youth. Similarly, 'Africans in Yiwu-Chinese Meet Africa' depicts stories of hardworking and enterprising people living in Africa and their efforts to bridge the China-Africa gap. Finally, ‘My China Story’ features Africans sharing positive experiences from their time in China, further shaping a favourable image among younger generations. China’s information strategy in Africa China has adopted a three-pronged strategy in its information campaign in Africa. First, it hosts and trains numerous African media professionals each year, teaching them to promote Chinese investments as a positive force. Second, China invests in local African media outlets, influencing their editorial practices to align with the Chinese narrative. For example, StarTimes formed a joint venture with the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), securing a majority stake. Finally, China sells technology to African governments that enables tighter control over digital information, including blocking websites and shutting down internet access. During the 2020 Tigray Conflict in Ethiopia, for instance, Ethio Telecom used technology and expertise from Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE to suppress dissent and limit information flow. Chinese content frequentlydownplays local criticismsof its projects, such as labour disputes, environmental issues, and debt concerns, leading to a distorted view of Sino-African relations. DuringZambia’s 2016 elections, Chinese-owned and local media outlets portrayed Chinese investments as beneficial to Zambia’s future economy, favouring pro-China candidate Edgar Lungu. InKenya’s 2017 elections, China’s increasing role as an infrastructure financier was prominently featured. CGTN Africa portrayed the erstwhile President Uhuru Kenyatta as a symbol of modernity and progress, stressing his consent for projects like the Standard Gauge Railway while overlooking public concerns about sustainability and costs and minimising opposition critiques. In Zimbabwe,China has actively supported the ZANU-PFPolitical Party byrestricting civil societymovements and opposition and advancing narratives favourable to China’s interests in politics and business. In order to negotiate contracts and trade agreements, China also generates new narratives. Angola, a major oil producer, has received substantial Chinese infrastructure loans in exchange for future oil exports to China. Chinese media have framed these infrastructure projects as 'infrastructure-for-oil,' portraying them as vital for Angola’s recovery after decades of Civil War. This strategy has ultimately enabled China to gain long-term access to Angola’s oil reserves at favourable prices. Similar tactics were observed in Zambia, where the China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC) secured a significant stake in Zambian copper mines, aided by favourable media coverage that overlooked labour issues and environmental concerns. Similarly, China established a presence at Djibouti’s Doraleh Multipurpose Port as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, downplaying worries about Djibouti’s increasing reliance on Chinese loans. Other strategically important projects, such as Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport and Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, allowed China to reap significant economic and geopolitical advantages by undermining debt concerns and promoting a pro-China narrative. China’s media influence under scrutiny Local perceptions are evolving as more and more African nations speak out against the adverse consequences of Chinese narrative-building.Hakainde Hichilema, the President of Zambia, has voiced concerns about the growing influence of foreign countries in the media, citing China, in particular, for shaping narratives and favouring specific perspectives. Similarly, Chinese investments and loans are frequently presented in an unduly flattering light, according toOby Ezekwesili, a former politician from Nigeria who is currently the Vice President of the World Bank Africa. Ezekwesili has questioned the lack of transparency in contracts granted to Chinese enterprises. She has alleged significant narrative control by Chinese-backed media. Concerns regarding Chinese-owned social media apps like TikTok are also growing because they are perceived to be susceptible to politically-driven actions. Several nations, like Senegal and Somalia,formally prohibitedthe app in 2023, claiming security and moral concerns. Others, including South Africa and Kenya, have petitioned againstWeChat and TikTok, among other apps. Controlling the narratives CCP’s investments in the African media landscape influence access to information and shape key narratives, although the impact of Chinese messaging remains mixed. Officials within African regimes are often more receptive to China’s governance model and messaging. However, ordinary Africans bear the brunt of this narrative battle, inundated with conflicting misinformation designed to sway public opinion and erode societal cohesion. There is an urgent need for awareness campaigns to educate these politicians about the long-term risks to their sovereignty.

Indonesia’s Tax Reforms Risk Being Undermined By Reckless Spendin...	By Yosephine Uliarta Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has beendeclining for over a decade, standing at 12.1 per cent in 2022 — just above Laos in ASEAN and well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3 per cent and the OECD average of 34 per cent. In response,tax reformshave been ongoing, with two major policies set to take effect soon —Core Tax Administration System (CTAS)by the end of 2024 and a potential value-added tax (VAT) rate increase in 2025. The long-awaited CTAS will modernise Indonesia’s tax system by integrating all tax processes into a unified platform, using accurate data to enhance oversight and improve collection. CTAS is expected to expand the tax base and increase efficiency by identifying new taxable objects and untapped revenue potential, improving compliance and making it easier to track income sources. Along with the introduction of aSingle ID for taxationin 2022, it will boost Indonesia’s low personal income tax (PIT) collection. Indonesia’stax revenue structurerelies heavily on corporate taxes (28.8 per cent) and VAT (28 per cent), while the contribution of PIT remains minimal (13 per cent).International trendsshow that countries with higher tax-to-GDP ratios typically generate a large share of revenue from PIT. Most PIT revenue in Indonesia comes from employees, whose taxes are automatically withheld by employers, while self-reported taxes from business owners, doctors and lawyers remain nonoptimal.The tax gap— the difference between potential and actual collections — was 42 per cent for overall PIT and a striking 80 per cent for non-employee income taxes in 2019. The small contribution of PIT is not unique to Indonesia. Due to limited capacity in collecting VAT,less developed countriesshould maximise revenue through easier-to-collect taxes, such as VAT, while continuing to reform PIT. VAT is harder to evade, making it a more reliable tool for revenue generation. Indonesia has already begun reforming its VAT system through the 2021 Tax Harmonization Law, which mandates a VAT rate increase from 11 to 12 per cent as early as 2025. This will bring Indonesia’s VAT rate closer to the OECD average (19 per cent) and global average (15.4 per cent). VAT is often criticised for being regressive —affecting lower-income households disproportionately. But this concern can be mitigated by strengthening targeted social assistance programs, offsetting the rate increase impact on lower-income groups. What matters ultimately is the overall distributional effect of the fiscal system, not just the impact of an isolated policy. Additionally, VAT is not imposed to basic necessities such as food, healthcare and education. While the VAT hike is necessary, the current economic downturn — marked bycontraction in the manufacturing sectoranddeclining consumer purchasing power— means raising VAT in 2025 could worsen financial pressures. Fortunately, the law includes flexibility, allowing the government to adjust the timing of the VAT increase according to economic conditions and providing the option to delay the hike if necessary. Indonesia is moving in the right direction with its tax reforms, but it’s important to recognise that much of the increased revenue from optimising personal income tax and VAT will come from the middle class. This group already bears asignificant tax burden, providing 42 per cent of indirect taxes (VAT and excises) and representing the majority of Indonesia’s income taxpayers. Naturally, they will expect public benefits and better governance in return for their contributions and their political importance cannot be underestimated. Tax reform success depends not just on raising revenue but on how well those funds are spent. Effective delivery of public goods builds support for higher taxes, while reckless spending erodes trust. Ideally, tax and expenditure reforms should go hand in hand, but this alignment is lacking in Indonesia. While revenue efforts are underway, several questionable spending plans risk undermining public support. The government’s plan to cut the Public Service Obligation (PSO) subsidy andadjust commuter train faresin greater Jakarta based on income levels could raise fares for the already financially strained middle class, despite the principle that public transport should serve all citizens equally. The president-elect’s proposal for a nationwide free school meal program has also raised concerns about itseffectivenessandfunding, which may divert essential resources from education and lower the education budget below legally required levels. More broadly,delays in budget disbursementand the failure to meet spending targets have historically undermined the effectiveness of public programs. These spending choices, along with the slow pace of disbursement, highlight a disconnect between tax reform efforts and the responsible, timely use of public funds. As Indonesia advances with its tax reforms, it is crucial to ensure these efforts aren’t undermined by reckless spending. A budget reveals a government’s true priorities, where policy goals meet the reality of implementation, determining how resources are raised and allocated. Responsible budgeting builds and sustains public trust. About the author: Yosephine Uliarta is a Master’s student at the Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University.

They Have The Money, We Have The Numbers – OpEd	Authoritarianism is back across the West — from Europe to the Biden-Harris censorship regime that would fit perfectly in Communist China. I think many of us were surprised during Covid to realize just what the supposedly liberal West has become: Essentially the Soviet Union but with better uniforms — well, better video games, anyway. Of course, it was decades in the making — Covid just showed their cards. The question, as always, is What’s Next.For better or worse, authoritarianism has happened many times in history — it’s kind of the human default. The original state. Humanity has a lot of experience with authoritarianism. So how did people protect themselves last time? Dodging Tyranny in the 1940s An elegant illustration is the 1940s, where essentially the entire globe went authoritarian socialist and then — as always — went to war. And the correct response very much depended on where you were. If you were in New York, you adjusted your stock portfolio. FDR’s 52nd birthday party, dressed as Caesar. The fasces bottom right is unintentionally apt. If you were in Britain you moved to the countryside and stockpiled canned food. If you were in Switzerland you packed a go-bag in case the German army decided to fill in the map. And if you were in Germany, of course, the only plan was to get the heck out. The problem is when to pull each trigger: When do you adjust the portfolio? Buy the canned food? Pack the go-bag? When do you get the heck out? Each of these preparations has a cost. And the more successful you are — the more you’ve built or achieved — the higher those costs go. Moving your family, your business, converting your career to location-independent where you can support your family. People ask why people didn’t leave Berlin before it was too late, and those costs are why. The good news is that this means the vast majority of us will stay and fight. I mean, true patriots will always stay and fight. But those mounting costs mean even apolitical people will fight. They will fight in proportion to the risk — because the cost rises with it. And they will fight in proportion to what they’ve built. That is, the people with the most to lose – the natural elite – are the most likely to stay. Every election since George W we’ve been treated to Hollywood liberals threatening to leave the country. You don’t hear influential people on the other side saying that. We will stay. The Bleaker It Gets, the Better Our Odds And stay we should. Because I know I’ve made this point repeatedly in videos, but we are going to win. Why? Partly tactical. They launched their takeover too soon. Because Covid fell into their lap, and they were still a generation away from the brainwashing it would take for a totalitarian takeover. Instead, the people rejected it. The Covid state left dangerous remnants, to be sure, that will become malignant if not excised. Still, it’s striking — perhaps unprecedented — the degree to which a totalitarian regime, once installed, was almost entirely removed. And the reason is encouraging: Because it polled atrociously — you may remember the Dems turning as one just after Biden assumed office. In other words, even with our shabby election infrastructure, they still fear the people. What remains post-Covid is an institutionalized left that has lost credibility with the majority. That is overextended, that has completely lost touch with the people. This loss of legitimacy means they are far weaker than pre-Covid. And Democracy is coming for them. Liberty’s Moment We’re already seeing the backlash with Trump surging in the polls, with Canada on deck next year, and European countries electing populists. Even more encouraging, if you zoom out rarely in history has liberty had so many advantages. Thanks to the internet — with a big assist from Elon. Of course, liberty starts out with the advantage that man is not by nature a slave. Slavery is an unstable equilibrium. It’s fragile. Just waiting for the right push. But this is up against the natural advantage of authoritarianism — it has the money. And money buys guns. It has the money because it seizes half of what you earn and uses it against you, then prints up whatever else it needs at the central bank. Then it uses that money to control the levers of society, from education to media to finance. We have the numbers, they have the money. Trust in Government Collapsing in Both Parties. What’s Next If it comes down to numbers vs money, our numbers are growing fast. Moreover, gloriously, the more they push the more we grow. Meaning they only have 2 options: pull back and hold on for dear life against the backlash. Or keep pushing and they’re out of power. It’s only a matter of time. In the 1970’s the great economist Murray Rothbard noted that you could fit the entire liberty movement in a New York living room. Now there are literally a billion of us. Forget a living room, we couldn’t fit in a state. Meanwhile their advantage – money – is collapsing before our eyes. Crashing in crippling debt, nervous financial markets, the limits of inflationary printing, and the moribund stagflation that always accompanies it. In short, we’re getting stronger. They’re getting weaker. And the longer it takes, the more spectacular will be our victory.

California’s Coastal Commission Ramps Up Partisan Zealotry – OpEd	In 2022, the California Coastal Commission (CCC)rejected the Poseidon desalination plantthat would have provided Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. The CCC has now rejected a plan by the Space Force to boost the number of launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was allegedly based on environmental concerns, but the real reason recently came to light. In August, the commission asked the Space Force to monitor more closely howsonic booms affect southern sea otters, California red-legged frogs, the western snowy plover and the California least tern. Commissioner Kristina Kunkel worried that the CCC could be 'bullied into ignoring environmental protections' but by October it was apparent that the real problem wasSpaceX and its founder Elon Musk. 'Elon Musk is hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods,' claimed Commissioner Gretchen Newsom,political directorfor the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and not related to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The governor did appoint commissioner Mike Wilson, who is on the same page as commissioner Newsom. 'This company [SpaceX] is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most expansive communications system in the planet,' Wilson proclaimed, and 'just last week that person was talking about political retribution.' Commissioner Caryl Hart also targeted Musk, who builds Tesla electric cars. 'We’re dealing with a company, the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the presidential race,' proclaimed Hart, an attorney and author of a dissertation on 'California State Parks and Climate Change.' Hart wants SpaceX to apply for a coastal development permit issued by the Commission. Commissioner Susan Lowenberg is 'beyond pissed' and proclaims 'I don’t understand why our own government is thumbing their nose at another branch of our government.' Perhaps this is because the California Coastal Commission was not elected by the people of California. A 1972 ballot initiative created a temporary commission aimed at preventing environmental disasters, like the1969 oil spillnear Santa Barbara. The California Coastal Act of 1976, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, made the commission permanent. Since then the CCC has run roughshod over property rights, and ramped up corruption. As Californians might recall, when Hollywood celebrities sought permits for swimming pools and such, commissioner Mark Nathanson, appointed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, hit them up for bribes. In 1993, Nathanson drew aprison sentenceof nearly five years for extortion. Under the command of regulatory zealots likelongtime director Peter Douglas, the commission blocked development and made coastal residency practically impossible for working people. The unelected CCC also projected its regulatory reach intotheme parks such as Sea Worldanddictated the rulesof surfing tournaments. The Poseidon Desalination Plant in Huntington Beach was in progress for 20 years and supported by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, including Gov. Newsom. The CCC turned it down with commissioner Dayna Bochco explaining that 'the ocean is under attack from climate change already.' Bochco is the wife of the late Steven Bochco and served as president of Steven Bochco Productions, producers of 'Doogie Howser MD,' 'Cop Rock' and other television shows. The CCC did approve theDoheny Ocean Desalination Plant, which will produce five million gallons of water a day, much less than the plant that got rejected. An unelected, unaccountable body thus prevents California from deriving maximum benefit from the Pacific Ocean, the state’s greatest natural resource. The commission now seeks to block Space Force launches because a majority of commissioners dislike Elon Musk. By now the lessons should be clear. The elected officials of California’s coastal cities and counties are fully capable of handling their own affairs and dealing with the Space Force. It is long past time to eliminate the Coastal Commission, a partisan political body that exists only to preserve its own power. Meanwhile, more than 50 years after the Santa Barbara oil spill, the greatest source of oil in the ocean is natural seepage from the ocean floor. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) natural seeps in Southern California addfive million gallonsto the ocean annually. In the Coal Oil Point area near Santa Barbara, 4,200 to 25,000 gallons of oil seep into the ocean per day. According to NOAA, the seeps have been leaking for 'thousands of years' and an oil seep is the possible cause of anoil sheen off Huntington Beachlast March.

Patrushev Using New Position To Promote Changes In Russian Naval ...	When Putin transferred Nikolay Patrushev from his position as secretary of the Russian Security Council and appointed him as a presidential assistant in charge of the restored Naval Collegium, many saw that as a clear demotion and even suggested it might cause Putin to challenge Putin. Those suggestions (cf. windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/06/putins-recent-personnel-moves-threaten.html and have overshadowed and distracted attention from a more important development. As Vzglyad commentator Aleksandr Timokhin argues, Patrushev has used his new position to promote the rebuilding of Russian naval and merchant marine capacity and to lead Putin to adopt a far more aggressive stance against the West on the world’s oceans (vz.ru/society/2024/10/17/1292275.html). Indeed, he implies, Patrushev may have emerged from his supposed demotion in an even stronger position and one with more immediate and troubling consequences to the West than even his sometimes paranoid denunciations of what he sees the West as doing inside Russia (e.g., jamestown.org/program/kremlin-worried-about-ukrainian-wedges-inside-russia/ and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/08/newly-elevated-naval-collegium-to.html). In his new position, Patrushev has been working to overcome three major obstacles to Russia’s becoming a major naval power: the longstanding Russian focus on the army rather than the navy as the basis of its strength, serious problems in Russian shipbuilding, and the paucity of exercises that can serve to intimidate others by highlighting Russia’s strength in this area. As Timokhin notes, these three problems have combined to lead to the decline of the Russian fleet since Soviet times, leaving the country’s navy with only approximately a quarter of the ships in the Armenian navy and meaning that there is not a single book in recent times on the uses of the Russian fleet in non-nuclear conflicts with the West. Putin has put Patrushev in this position to overcome these problems, the commentator continues; and Patrushev has the knowledge and energy to achieve far more in this regard than the Russian naval leadership has achieved in recent decades, putting it on course to be far better able to respond to and challenge the navies of the West.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i88We9OTyuil5	2024-10-19T16:49:27-07:00	
ASEAN Must Reform Or Face Decay – Analysis	ASEAN has a long and rich history, but its main tenets and essence of its self-induced mantra of principles have many times failed to spark new confidence in bracing for the tough challenges to come. The recently concluded ASEAN Summit and Related Summits in Vientiane have also portrayed the same old trappings within the entity and beyond exposing the deep lying structural and systemic loopholes and internal weaknesses that have over the decades slowed progress and frustrated many within and without, over the road not taken. The division within ASEAN has weakened unity and collective resolve, giving other powers the advantage of dealing with member states individually rather than with ASEAN as a whole. Previous mechanisms, such as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DoC) and efforts to accelerate the Code of Conduct (CoC) process, are seen as only preventive frameworks that establish guardrails and norms of behavior in the South China Sea. These mechanisms do not directly address the resolution of disputes but merely ensure that behaviours in the contested zones adheres to an agreed code of ethics and procedures, relying on the goodwill of involved states to follow norms and exercise self-restraint. However, the core issues remain unresolved, particularly the need for compliance with international law and maritime law, ensuring that actions do not exceed agreed-upon limits. These laws serve as the foundation for peace, stability, and behavior, based on the rule of law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, in line with international law. They should not be interpreted according to historical perspectives or individual viewpoints. The focus should be on deepening ties with other equally, if not more, important powers in the region especially India and Australia apart from the traditional and conventional powers that have been relied upon in trade, economic development and technological advancement and inflow. Existing economic, trade and people to people ties that have been robust with Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul must also be enhanced to have the long term spillover impact on matters of greater priorities and areas of high politics, transitioning from low politics. Defence and security ties with Seoul and Tokyo present a vast opening for solidification, with Tokyo's OSA and RAA initiatives providing a more reliable fallback defence and deterrent capacities for the region and the country, apart from aligning with the arch of democracies that will stand ready to defend the rules based order. Structural and Systemic Limitations Old conventional approaches of ASEAN have seen ASEAN losing its relevance, strength and leverage to negotiate and fast becoming obsolete. New strategic moves to strengthen internal unity and capacity must also rely on the manoeuvre and political will to escape from past practices and limitations and to gain further weight and leverage in diversifying trade and economic dependence on the major neighbouring economic power and to lessen the baggage and strings involved, and also in increasing the bargaining chips and greater internal security and defence capacities by having more fallback options with the inclusion of new powers that have been neglected in the past, including Russia and India to be seen as the needed third force in the region both in defence and economic presence. Within ASEAN, there is a clear division in addressing this issue and in the response to China's actions, particularly between Manila and other actors. This division has created gaps in the collective approach to positioning ASEAN as a united entity in negotiations and dialogue with China. Manila has expressed frustration with ASEAN and other member states for not supporting its firm stance and physical responses in dealing with Chinese Coast Guard actions, which have led to the risk of confrontation. Other claimants within ASEAN prefer to continue using existing mechanisms to engage with China, aiming to avoid high-intensity confrontations and the risk of retaliation in other areas. Addressing the South China Sea disputes will also require considering potential future claims and changes, not just relying on the CoC or ASEAN's strategic hedging, balancing, or neutrality as a way out. Changes in global power dynamics and the concept of total power will alter the balance of economic and military capabilities, and it is not guaranteed that current dominant economic and military powers will maintain their strength in the future. ASEAN risks irrelevance and being obsolete unless it can jettison its past conventional trap of being a mere balancing entity and a bridge to appease both sides. It needs to make its stance loud and clear,which is to steadfastly align with, and protect the universal principles of the rules based order,the sanctity of international law and maritime law and in safeguarding the interests of each member's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It cannot continue being limited by its overwhelming focus on trade and economic returns without parallel focus on securing the stability, peace and international order in the region and in protecting each member's vulnerabilities and addressing their concerns. Internal economic and development divide has been ingrained, alongside weak internal cohesion on fundamental security concerns, with rising arms races and security dilemma. These core gaps and structural and systemic loopholes will first need serious regional political will to ensure that Asean remains relevant in the future, especially in moving away from its systemic trap of an ineffective security and economic provider and the inability to project wider global influence and escaping its middle powership projection. New Opening for New Reform Malaysia is expected to continue with the policy direction of maintaining strategic hedging and balancing between the two blocs of power, without risking economic and security ties with both China and the US. The concept of independence in foreign policymaking and neutrality is expected to continue with dependence on other emerging powers within the Global South, especially with India, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America and Africa on economic and trade diversification and also in strengthening supply chain and energy and food security and in boosting friendshoring efforts. All said, Malaysia will also expect to continue to strengthen defence and security fallback which will be important to the country in facing renewed threat settings and a volatile region, and will also not risk existing good ties in defence and security with the other power bloc. Malaysia's role as Chair of ASEAN provides a critical and strategic platform for leading the region and shaping new approaches to resolving the conflict in the South China Sea. In line with ASEAN's mantra of non-alignment and strategic hedging and balancing, Malaysia is expected to continue to steer the regional grouping towards this line of approach in dealing with both the West and China, taking into account past mechanisms and also calculating on future changes of possible risks and tensions and the need for continued adherence to decades old mechanism of ASEAN being the primary bridge and balancing role between both sides of the bloc. Concurrently, it is expected for ASEAN under the Malaysian leadership to expand and deepen the role of ASEAN in engaging with immediate neighbouring powers including the current set up of ASEAN + 3 and related Summits and cooperative domains, and also including new players including in South Asia, Middle East and Central Asia. The Need to Preserve the Rules Based Order The CoC will also not fundamentally solve the core contentious claim of the CoC, as it merely provides rules and guidelines on the conduct in the zones,and not providing conclusive judgment of the jurisdictions. As such, ASEAN must push for a concrete plan for upholding the agreed upon adherence to universal norms and the international law and maritime rules, and the freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters, all of which have formed the main basis of international peace and order since WWII, and that the region cannot afford to tolerate attempts to alter the rules based order which will disjoint the entire ecosystem of equality and common status under the rule of law and abiding by the UN Charter. The global system and other countries, as well as the UN, will continue to defend and support ASEAN's position and principles on this issue. This creates a critical platform for strengthening ASEAN's options and power, looking beyond the CoC, ASEAN TAC, SEANWFZ, or ASEAN-China dialogue as conventional conflict prevention mechanisms, while building new capacity without jeopardizing formal relations or ties with external powers. Therefore, the universal system that has maintained global peace and stability since WWII, such as the UN Charter and international law, must be the foundation and provide legitimacy for claimant states and ASEAN. This will serve as the most critical platform and a strong moral standing for asserting sovereignty without disrupting existing relationships, as these foundational principles provide a conviction of legitimacy and a rules-based moral standing. In this context, Malaysia has the opportunity to craft a new narrative, vision, and strategy to steer ASEAN toward a new nucleus of unity, based on the principles of a universal rules-based order, freedom of navigation, and respect for the sanctity of international law and the international law of the sea. This would send a clear message that ASEAN is no longer bound by the old framework, which is seen as weak and overly dependent on external economic pressures and influences. This new direction also demands a fresh concept of conflict deterrence, based on universal and holistic approaches that enhance internal capacity in the domain of hard power deterrence, economic resilience, and diversification of economic dependencies, along with a strong fallback option. Collectively, this will strengthen individual countries and ASEAN's ability to defend regional interests, sovereignty, and peace without compromising official and diplomatic relations with other powers. In a new era of rising autocratic tendencies and policies that have further worsened the risks of conflicts and miscalculations and weakened the fabric of international order based on rule of law and international norms, all free nations and the arch of democracy must not fail the world, in standing in solidarity to defend the beacon of freedom and democracy. Failure to do that will signal a historical misjudgment and mistake in preserving and saving the hard fought freedom and democracy and a rules based order that have preserved global peace for more than seven decades since WWII, and will allow unchecked aggression that will threaten peace anywhere. ASEAN therefore remains a critical forefront in this overall economic and security stability based on values and norms, and defending the freedom in the Indo Pacific will mean defending the freedom of the entire world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8xq1HFiqsCw3	2024-10-19T16:29:51-07:00	
Canada’s Vote Bank Politics: Domestic Compulsion And Foreign Poli...	Sri Lanka and India have become victims of Canada's ethnic vote bank politics. 'Vote bank politics' is a South Asian term which refers to the cultivation of a community to secure their votes. In some cases, a blind eye is turned to undesirable elements, like terrorists, among these communities. Such a blind spot may lead to domestic as well as international problems. Canadian political parties attempt to get the support of various ethnic groups living in Canada. This cannot be deemed objectionable as it is mandated by democratic electoral politics. But in the case of the Sri Lankan Tamil and the Sikh ethnic groups in Canada, political parties' vote bank politics has had direct implications for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and India. Sri Lanka On May 21 this year, the Sri Lankan government hit out at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for engaging in electoral 'vote bank' politics by making an 'outrageous allegation' about 'genocide' during the island nation's brutal armed conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that ended in 2009. Sri Lanka pointed out that the LTTE has been banned in 33 countries other than Sri Lanka. 'Canada's falsification of our history amounts to irresponsible disinformation. It misleads the minds of current and future generations in Canada and elsewhere, encouraging and perpetuating hatred. It empowers extremism on all sides in all parts of the world where such messages are easily and instantaneously transmitted including through social media. We therefore urge the Canadian Government to assume responsibility in a spirit of mutual respect in promoting peace and harmony',' the government's statement said. 'Canada's disproportionate focus on Sri Lanka is a clear example of double standards.While Canada has opted to support a false narrative regarding the conflict in Sri Lanka, it has remained intentionally ambiguous relating to the daily dire humanitarian situations we see elsewhere. It is crucial that countries like Canada, who claim to be global advocates of human rights, recognize their self-interested double standards which are resulting in increased polarization in the international community.' 'Clearly, the repeated statements by the Prime Minister of Canada with regard to Sri Lanka are the outcome of electoral vote bank politics in Canada, funded by a small number of Canadians of Sri Lankan origin with vested and personal interest,' Sri Lanka's statement said. India Earlier this month, the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau accused the Indian government of assassinating a wanted Sikh terrorist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil and expelled six Indian diplomats including High Commissioner Ramesh Kumar Verma. India described the charge as 'preposterous' and accused Trudeau of doing 'vote bank' politics. New Delhi also expelled the top most Canadian diplomat in residence and six others. Canada is a multi-ethnic country in which Sikhs and Sri Lankan Tamils have for long been an important part. The Sikh population is about 770,000 and the Sri Lankan Tamil population is about 240,000. The Sikhs even have a political party the National Democratic Party (NDP) with a significant presence in parliament. The Tamils have no political party but have influential lobbyists in parliament and outside. Sikhs have a reputation for being much more politically engaged than other Diaspora communities in Canada. The Sikh vote is a significant factor in elections. The White Canadian political parties enter into alliance with the ethnic groups or ethnic parties or uphold their demands for electoral gain.Trudeau's Liberal Party has been doing the same. It had an alliance with the NDP, which subsequently broke. Yet, Trudeau continued to cultivate the Sikhs turning a blind eye to those in the community who were actively advocating a separate Sikh country called Khalistan carved out of India. Canadian political scientist Roy Norton points out that over the decades, White Canadian participation in party politics has been declining and the participation of certain Diaspora communities, especially Sikhs, has been rising. In many parliamentary constituencies, the Diaspora communities could tilt the outcome one way or the other. Hence their growing importance for the mainstream White parties. And Diaspora communities in Canada prioritize foreign policy objectives ahead of other concerns, Norton points out. This is where the rub is. The result is that Canadian political leaderships are unwilling to accept even 'reasonable' requests from the Governments of India or Sri Lanka. Though only a section of Sikhs or Tamils are supportive of an independent Khalistan or Tamil Eelam, Canadian political leadersfear losing the entire Sikh or Tamil vote if they do not endorse the demand of the minority. India's Outburst A statement released by India's External Affairs Ministry on October 14, blasted Trudeau of indulging in vote bank politics without nay regard for India's territorial integrity. On the action taken against the Indian High Commissioner in the case relating to the assassination of Sikh terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Indian government said: 'This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.' 'Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard.' 'That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters.' 'Under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, his Government has deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage.' 'This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a Commission on foreign interference. It also serves the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau Government has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains.' 'To that end, the Trudeau Government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada. This has included death threats to them and to Indian leaders. All these activities have been justified in the name of freedom of speech.' 'Some individuals who have entered Canada illegally have been fast-tracked for citizenship. Multiple extradition requests from the Government of India in respect of terrorists and organized crime leaders living in Canada have been disregarded.' Row with Trudeau Goes Back to 2018 International relations expert C.Raja Mohan noted that in most countries, especially democracies, 'the cultivation of narrowly-based domestic constituencies for electoral reasons has its unfortunate consequences for the conduct of foreign policy.' Recalling the 2018 visit to India by Trudeau, Raja Mohan noted thatPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who is more than eager to serenade visiting leaders in his home state of Gujarat, did not travel to Ahmedabad to be with Trudeau. Despite repeated efforts, including at the highest political levels, to flag the question of Sikh separatism in Canada, Trudeau was reluctant to address India's concerns. There was speculation as to whether Trudeau would meet the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh who was on the hit list of the Sikh terrorists. He did not what to meet Amarinder Singh. But according toIndian Expresshe did meet Amarinder Singh after he was told that his plane would not be allowed to land in Amritsar if he did not agree to meet the Chief Minister. Raja Mohan correctly predicted in 2018 that Trudeau's visit, instead of putting aside the Khalistan issue, would aggravate the differences with India. And that was evident in 2023 and 2024. Political scientist Roy Norton found that radicals seeking overt Canadian government support for the dismemberment of a generally friendly country have always failed. But Canadian governments would not interfere with peaceful, law-abiding actions by segments of any Diaspora community, or by any Canadians, supporting human/democratic rights abroad. Ottawa complains that New Delhi and Colombo do not understand this democratic practice. Norton also noted that, in contrast to the past, foreign governments have begun to act on Canadian soil against Canadian citizens who they consider threatening to their interests. Verbal protests have been substituted by action on the ground. The assassination of Sikh terrorist Nijjar allegedly by Indian agents in June 2023 is an example.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8ynuBJxanUmg	2024-10-19T16:25:08-07:00	
China Undermines Its Interests By Boosting Support For Myanmar’s ...	By Zachary Abuza China borders 14 countries, tied with Russia for the most in the world, and Beijing takes great pains to ensure the security of its interests and defend against conflicts from spilling over. Despite that, China’s Myanmar policy is based on faulty assumptions and is undermining its own interests. China’s policy since the February 2021 coup – which Beijing simply labeled a change in government – has never been good. Nonetheless, it refrained from offering initial support for the State Administrative Council (SAC), as the junta formally calls itself, and put pressure on them not to ban the National League for Democracy, which they ultimately did in March 2023. For the first two years, Beijing clearly hedged their bets. But since then, the Chinese have doubled down on the junta. China continues tosell weapons, and there is evidence that Chinese technicians are working in Myanmar’sdefense industries. There is clearly some technology sharing. A new shell designed for drone warfare is a copy of a Chinese-produced munition. At the same time, China had initially held the junta at arms length diplomatically. They have never invited Min Aung Hlaing to China, including to the poorly attended third Belt and Road Initiative summit in October 2023. While China invited the junta’s deputy commander, Soe Win, in July 2024, it was only in a multilateral setting. China has both supported ASEAN’s decision to keep Myanmar’s representation at the non-political level, but also the Thai-ledTrack 1.5 initiativeto engage the junta. China’s primary concern has been the protection of its economic interests, in particular their parallel oil and gas pipelines in Myanmar and theWanbao copper mine. Another priority for China was the development of their special economic zone in the Rakhine state port of Kyaukphyu. Beijing has long been frustrated with theslow implementationof the project, which includes rail and road links to the Chinese border. Although they were able to negotiate further concessions from the diplomatically isolated junta, the project continues to stall. Rebels control borders, resources But since the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic armies that have received various degrees of support from China over the years, launched an offensive against the military regime called Operation 1027 a year ago, there’s been a hardening of China’s position, in line with the junta’s losses. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which includes the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Arakan Army, and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), as well as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), now controls all but one of the major border crossings to China. There has been some $9 billion in cross border trade since the 2021 coup. While this is not huge in terms of China’s overall trade, it matters to Yunnan province, especially in the context of slowing economic growth. And for the sanctioned junta with dire shortages of foreign exchange, border trade is a financial lifeline. China recently shut down five border gates, in order to punish the opposition which continues their offensive against the military. The government in Yunnan has cut electricity and internet service in the enclave of Kokang to further pressure the MNDAA. But facts on the ground are changing. China now must contend with the reality that 90% of Myanmar’s natural resources, including jade and rare earth minerals, are now either controlled by opposition forces or are in contested areas. Chinese hydroelectric dams are now under the control of non-state actors in Shan state, while the KIA is moving in on Chinese backed dams in Kachin. Other Chinese investments arenow in opposition-controlled territories, and they must now pay taxes to the shadow National Unity Government (NUG) or to ethnic resistance organizations. While the Arakan Army (AA) has not taken Kyaukphyu, it controls all the surrounding territory in Rakhine state. Any development of the special economic zone requires negotiations with them. The capture ofAnn Townshipwould give the AA control over a pipeline pumping station. AA control of the territory surrounding the port city of Sittwe forced the Indian government to reevaluate their Myanmar policy and engage the Arakan Army and NUG. China is digging in their heels. Signs of Chinese frustration Since Operation 1027 began last October 27, China has continued the transfer of weaponry to the junta. In August, the military took possession of six additionalFTC-2000G jet trainers, produced by Guizhou Aviation Industries, a division of the large military conglomerate AVIC. While air power alonecan punish civilians, it cannot hold territory, a task that is increasingly beyond the reach of the junta military. Despite at least six intakes of conscripts, adding an estimated 30,000 troops, the new forces are hastily trained, inadequately equipped, and poorly motivated. Some 300 junta troops surrendered in northwestern Sagaing region early this month after nearly one month of fighting. The military was simply unable to resupply them and other forces deployed to far-flung outposts around the country. Peoples’ Defense Force militias and ethnic armies are now routinely targeting the army’s riverine transportation. Demoralized soldiers are voting with their feet andsurrendering. The military launched a counter-offensiveto retake territory lost since Operation 1027 began. While they have made limited inroads, they’ve been against priority urban targets, such as Laukkaing in Shan State’s Kokang region. A leaked document from a July meeting between China's special envoy for Myanmar, Deng Xijun, and the powerful United Wa State Army rebel group, laid bare Beijing’s frustration that the Three Brotherhood Alliance refuses to stop its offensive. China’s concerns about the potential fall of the junta are palpable. China has since also pressured the MNDAA to distance itself from the tripartite alliance and publicly state that it would notcoordinate actionswith the NUG. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Naypyitaw to pledge additional financial assistance to the junta, prompting the NUG to issue a stern warning that debts incurred by an illegal government will not be honored by a future democratic government. Willfully ignorant It is for this reason alone that China has been calling for elections. Beijing sees these both as an offramp and as a way for the military to maintain its political influence in a post-conflict government. Deng and Beijing’s new ambassador to Myanmar, Ma Jia, appear to be willfully ignorant about the degree to which the people of Myanmar hold China in contempt for propping up the military, giving them the weaponry to intensify their aerial attacks on civilian populations, and for searching for ways for the military to prolong their disastrous political interference. China is clearly on the wrong side of history. Chinese diplomats and intelligence analysts are not stupid people. So why are they getting this one so wrong? In part, it’s because of their ideology and analytical blinders. As an authoritarian regime, China can’t imagine a fellow authoritarian regime failing, especially one that they back. But it’s also wishful thinking driven by fear. China, as a statist regime, is highly uncomfortable with the idea of a messy federal democracy on its borders. So for now Beijing is backing the junta, which, despite every advantage in resources and military capabilities, has fallen under the weight of its own incompetence, avarice and delusional thinking. Beijing believes that a corrupt and pliable Myanmar government that includes the military will best serve Chinese interests. At the same time, the NUG and their allies will never accept elections or a negotiated settlement with the junta, who haveproven themselves to be untrustworthy. Giving the junta a seat at the table gives them yet another opportunity to kick the forces of democracy and federalism in the teeth. The people of Myanmar have fought too hard and suffered too much to accept that. Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Italian Court Rules Migrants Shipped To Albania Must Be Sent Back	By Fjori Sinoruka A court in Rome on Friday ordered the transfer back to Italy of 12 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt who were intercepted at sea and then transported to a reception centre in Albania under a controversial new scheme backed by Italy and Albania’s premiers. The court said that it was impossible to assess whether they came from a 'safe country of origin' and so they have a right to have their asylum claims processed in Italy. The decision was based on a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded that a country of origin cannot be assessed as 'safe' if parts of it are not – a decision that could have a major impact on the Italy-to-Albania offshoring project. The court ruling can be appealed and it is so far unclear when the migrants will be returned to Italy. The first Italian military ship holding 16 migrants arrived in Albania on Wednesday. However, four migrants were sent back to Italy the same day; two of them because they were minors and two other for health reasons, according to media reports. Italy unveiled its plan to send refugees and migrants intercepted by its navy at sea to processing centres in Albania was unveiled in November last year by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. The scheme has been criticised in both countries by activists and human rights lawyers who question Albania’s capacities to handle the arrangements. But the deal received the green light from Albania’s Constitutional Court in January. According to the agreement, Italy is covering all the construction and equipment costs. The arrangement is supposed to operate along the same lines as Italy’s repatriation 'hotspots', where migrants and refugees are detained pending repatriation, but which the European Court of Human Rights criticised in March.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i85z-NZWV9yh7	2024-10-19T16:13:02-07:00
