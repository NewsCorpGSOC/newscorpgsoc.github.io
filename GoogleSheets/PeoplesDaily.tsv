China-Brazil Deals & Joint Statement - Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows - Liu Jianchao Meets Communist Party of Nepal Delegati...	As I opened the front page of the paper today, I felt a bit like Marty McFly. Everything on the page I covered in my newsletter yesterday. So I will keep staying ahead of the curve, and cover some developments that you can expect tomorrow. First, let's look at Xi Jinping's meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Xinhua reports (English readout): -Xi Jinping pointed out that he was very pleased to visit Brazil in this year of great historical significance, marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. Just now, President Lula held a grand welcoming ceremony with the highest courtesies for me, fully demonstrating the high importance attached to China-Brazil relations and the deep affection for the Chinese people, which deeply moved me. China and Brazil are two major developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres. Looking back over the past 50 years, China-Brazil relations have spanned mountains and seas, exploring the right path for large developing countries to engage based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, friendship, and win-win cooperation. Brazil was the first country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first Latin American country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Lula and myself, the two countries have increasingly become reliable friends with a shared destiny and a positive force for promoting peace. China-Brazil relations are now at their historical best, not only enhancing the well-being of the two peoples but also safeguarding the shared interests of the vast number of developing countries, strengthening the power and voice of the Global South, and making outstanding contributions to world peace and stability.- ，50。，，。。50，，、、。、。，，、，，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, -Lula specially arranged for the Brazilian artist to sing the famous Chinese song My Motherland to thank the Chinese side for its warm hospitality during his visit to China last year-. Xi Jinping emphasized that today, we are elevating the positioning of China-Brazil relations to the level of a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. At the same time, we are aligning BRI with Brazil's development strategy. This marks another historic moment in the development of China-Brazil relations, highlighting the global, strategic, and long-term nature of the bilateral relationship. This aligns with the general expectations of the two peoples and will provide a driving force for both sides to advance their modernization agendas. It also demonstrates the determination of China and Brazil to jointly uphold international fairness and justice and promote common global development. China is willing to work with Brazil, keeping the future of humanity in mind and focusing on the well-being of the people, to continually enrich the connotations of the new-era China-Brazil relationship, becoming ‘golden partners' that achieve mutual success, and steadily progress toward building a community with a shared future for humanity, a fairer world, and a more sustainable planet, thereby making greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress for humankind.- ，，--，，、、，，，、。，、，，--，、，. Xi then made four points: First, we must share a common destiny and should continue to consolidate strategic mutual trust. We must firmly support each other on issues involving core interests, such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and become strategic partners that trust each other and a model of solidarity, cooperation, mutual benefit, and common development among the Global South countries. We must strengthen exchanges in the fields of culture, education, and youth, and consolidate the public opinion foundation of the China-Brazil community with a shared future. Second, we must develop together and continue to deepen the linkages between our development strategies. We must seize the historical opportunity of building interlinkages between the BRI and Brazil's development strategy, deepen cooperation in key areas such as economy, trade, infrastructure, finance, science and technology, and environmental protection, and strengthen cooperation in aerospace, agricultural science and technology, and clean energy. China has placed poverty alleviation in a prominent position in state governance and supports Brazil's ‘Zero Hunger' plan. It is willing to continue to strengthen poverty reduction cooperation with Brazil so that the people of the two countries can live a better life. Third, we must share responsibilities and demonstrate the strength of China and Brazil in maintaining world peace and justice. We must practise true multilateralism, make fair remarks and take fair actions, so as to make global governance more just and equitable. China attaches great importance to Brazil's international status and influence and supports Brazil in playing a greater role on the international stage. China stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Brazil at the United Nations, BRICS and other multilateral mechanisms, support Brazil's presidency of BRICS next year, promote high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make BRICS voice louder on upholding multilateralism and improving global governance. Fourth, we must share weal and woe and make distinctive contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. As major developing countries, China and Brazil should take the lead in conducting consultations, promoting global solidarity, jointly addressing global challenges concerning the future of mankind, and strengthening cooperation in such fields as green transformation, sustainable development, climate change, and AI governance. China is willing to support Brazil in hosting the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ，。、、，、、。、、，。，。--，、、、、，、、。，--，，。，。，、，。，，，，--，、。，。，，--，。、、、。《》.

The Chinese readout quotes Lula saying that: -China is Brazil's most important strategic partner, and the Chinese people are the most trustworthy friends of the Brazilian people.- -The working groups of the two sides should expeditiously explore and advance cooperation in priority areas such as infrastructure, finance, industrial chain, science and technology, and ecological and environmental protection.

Brazil is ready to further deepen communication and cooperation with China under multilateral frameworks such as the U.N., BRICS, and the G20 to enhance the voice and influence of the Global South in global governance.- Share Tracking People's Daily The list of all the agreements and the full text of the cooperation plan is available on the website of Brazil's foreign affairs ministry.

China highly values Brazil's influence and role in regional and international affairs, understands and supports () Brazil's desire to play a greater role in the United Nations, including in the Security Council. ，、。，、。，、，。，.

Both sides emphasise the importance of maintaining the authority and core role of the United Nations and promoting global governance based on multilateralism, international law, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Both sides will further strengthen strategic cooperation at multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and strive to achieve an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization. Both sides emphasize that as an example of similar views in the field of international peace and security, the two countries reached the ‘China-Brazil Consensus on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis', promoted the ‘Global South' countries to hold a high-level meeting on the Ukrainian crisis in New York on September 27, established a ‘Friends of Peace' group and issued a joint communiqué. ，--、，。，、《》。、、，，。，，《、》，--927，--。 Brazil welcomes China's GDI, GSI and GCI. 、、.

China supports Brazil's BRICS presidency and supports Brazil in holding the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Belém in 2025. Both sides agree to deepen China-Latin America overall cooperation. Share Tracking People's Daily The two leaders also met the press later. The only additional bit from that to highlight is this: -President Xi stressed that the world today is far from being tranquil. Many regions are still suffering from conflicts, turmoil and insecurity. Humanity is an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can countries find a path to universal security. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. The two sides should bring together more voices for peace to pave the way for realizing a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. The two sides are deeply concerned about the continued expansion of the conflict in Gaza, and call for realizing a ceasefire and end of hostilities as early as possible, implementing the two-State solution, and working tirelessly for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question. China and Brazil share a tradition and responsibility in upholding justice and moral principles. China will work with Brazil to continually enrich the China-Brazil community with a shared future to enhance its relevance with our times. Together, the two sides will firmly defend true multilateralism, send a powerful message of the new era on pursuing development, cooperation and justice and rejecting poverty, confrontation and hegemonism, and join hands to make the world a better place.- Subscribe now Second, let's now look at the new Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows, which was detailed by the CAC. It says that: -We noticed that, while promoting global cross-border data flows, countries are primarily concerned with risks related to national security, public interests, personal privacy, and intellectual property. We believe that the international community should fully respect the different policies and practices adopted by various countries and regions based on their specific conditions. It is crucial to pay heed to each party's concerns regarding data security and development and to work toward building consensus on cross-border data flow rules through consultation among countries and regions.- In this context, China has proposed: Governments should encourage electronic cross-border data transmission to meet the needs of business and social activities. This will help global e-commerce and digital trade serve as new drivers for economic growth and sustainable development. Governments should respect the regulatory differences of various countries and regions in cross-border data flows. They should support free data flows that do not violate national security, public interests, and personal privacy. Regulations on cross-border data flows should be permitted when they aim to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the premise that such regulatory measures do not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, and do not cross the limits of the goals they seek to achieve. Governments should respect security measures taken by all countries in accordance with their laws to protect non-personal data related to national security and public interests, and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of relevant non-personal data. Governments should respect measures taken by all countries to protect personal information rights and interests including individual privacy. Countries should be encouraged to provide convenient channels for cross-border transmission of personal information on the condition that such information is well protected. Countries should be encouraged to establish and improve legal and supervision frameworks on personal information protection, conduct exchanges on best practices and experiences, improve the compatibility of personal information protection mechanisms and rules, and foster mutual recognition of relevant standards, technology regulations and conformity assessment procedures. Enterprises should be encouraged to obtain personal information protection certifications to demonstrate their compliance with personal information protection standards and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of personal information. (Note: This bit on certification is important) Governments should support exploring the establishment of negative lists for managing cross-border data flow to promote efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flow. Governments should work together to create a data flow and usage environment that is open, inclusive, secure, and non-discriminatory, jointly uphold a fair and just market order, and promote the orderly and healthy development of the digital economy. Governments should enhance the transparency, predictability, and non-discriminatory nature of measures managing the cross-border flows of various types of data, as well as the interoperability of policy frameworks. Governments should actively conduct international cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows. Support should be given to developing countries and the least developed countries to enable them to effectively participate in and utilize cross-border data flows so as to promote their digital economic growth. Developed countries should be encouraged to provide capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries, especially the least developed ones, in order to bridge the digital divide and achieve fair and sustainable development. Governments should encourage the use of digital technologies to promote innovative applications in cross-border data flows. They should improve technological capabilities to ensure efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flows. They should advance international mutual recognition of evaluation standards for technical and security assurance capabilities related to cross-border data flows, and ensure effective intellectual property protection. Governments should oppose overstretching the concept of national security on data issues. They should object to making restrictive and differentiated policies on cross-border data flows targeting specific countries and enterprises without factual evidence, or implementing discriminatory restrictions, prohibitions, and other similar measures against specific countries and enterprises. Governments should prohibit illicit acquisition of data through methods such as setting up backdoors in digital products and services or exploiting vulnerabilities in digital technology infrastructure. They should collaborate to crack down on cross-border illegal activities in the data field and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and enterprises in all countries. We are ready to carry out and deepen exchanges and cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows with all parties based on the above initiative. We call on all countries and regions to respond to and endorse the above initiative through bilateral, multilateral, or regional agreements and arrangements. We welcome the support of international organizations, businesses, and civil society for this initiative.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, the paper today has reports on three sackings today.

Xi at G20: If China Can Make it, Other Developing Countries Can Too - Jaishankar-Wang Meeting Analysis - Xi Meets Macron, Scholz, Milei, Arce & Sheinb...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. Page 1: I covered Xi Jinping's G20 speech on global governance yesterday. Today, let's look at Xi's speech (full speech) at Session I of the G20 Summit in Rio. Both these are covered in the paper today. Xi said: -The Rio Summit this year has chosen the theme ‘Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet.' It places fighting hunger and poverty at the top of the agenda, and decides to establish a Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. From Hangzhou to Rio, we have been working for one and the same goal, that is, to build a just world of common development. To build such a world, we need to channel more resources to such fields as trade, investment and development cooperation, and strengthen development institutions. There should be more bridges of cooperation, and less ‘small yard, high fences', so that more and more developing countries will be better off and achieve modernization. To build such a world, we need to support developing countries in adopting sustainable production and lifestyle, properly responding to challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution, enhancing ecological conservation, and achieving harmony between man and nature. To build such a world, we need an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. We should promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, energize sustainable development with new technologies, new industries and new business forms, and support developing countries in better integrating in digital, smart and green development to bridge the North-South gap. To build such a world, we need to stay committed to multilateralism. We should uphold the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.- He added: -China's story is proof that developing countries can eliminate poverty, and that a weaker bird can start early and fly high, when there is the endurance, perseverance, and striving spirit that enables water drops to penetrate rocks over time and turns blueprints into reality. If China can make it, other developing countries can make it too. This is what China's battle against poverty says to the world.- He then termed China a member of the Global South and outlined 8 actions. Apart from the initiative on open science and the decision to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, nothing seems new in this list. First, pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On top of RMB700 billion yuan added financing windows and an additional RMB80 billion yuan injection into the Silk Road Fund, China is moving ahead with the development of the multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network, one that is led by the building of a green Silk Road and will empower a digital Silk Road. Second, implementing the Global Development Initiative. On the basis of over 1,100 development projects already in operation, we will make sure the Global South research center that is being built is fit for purpose, and the 20 billion U.S. dollars of development funds will continue to be put to good use to support developing countries and deepen practical cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, food security and the digital economy. Third, supporting development in Africa. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in September this year, I unveiled ten partnership actions on joining hands with Africa to advance modernization over the next three years and, in this connection, a commitment of RMB360 billion yuan in financial support. Fourth, supporting international cooperation on poverty reduction and food security. China has decided to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. We support the G20 in continuing to convene the Development Ministerial Meeting, and will stay a committed host of the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste. Fifth, China, alongside Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, is proposing an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science to help the Global South gain better access to global advances in science, technology and innovation. Sixth, supporting the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South and using such outcomes as the Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries and the High-Level Principles on Bioeconomy to good effect. China supports the work of the Entrepreneurship Research Center on G20 Economies based in Beijing, and supports cooperation on digital education and the digitization of museums and ancient archives. Seventh, implementing the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We are strengthening cooperation with fellow developing countries in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, denial of safe haven, and anti-corruption capacity building. Eighth, China is pursuing high-standard opening up, and unilaterally opening our doors wider to the least developed countries (LDCs). We have announced the decision to give all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. From now to 2030, China's imports from other developing countries are likely to top 8 trillion dollars. Subscribe now Next, there is a report about Xi's meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Xinhua says: -Xi once again congratulated Sheinbaum on becoming the first female president in the history of Mexico…Xi said China and Mexico share similar views and ideas on many international issues, and both countries advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation. China is ready to work with Mexico to uphold multilateralism and international fairness and justice, and inject positive energy into the development of the world economy.- The report adds: -Sheinbaum expressed her pleasure in meeting Xi, noting that she fully agrees with Xi's assessment of the relationship between the two countries.

Both sides should deepen strategic communication, strengthen mutual support, and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China-France relations, contributing more to the healthy development of China-Europe relations and to world peace and stability. Xi Jinping stressed that China is willing to continue close high-level exchanges with France, continue to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the humanities fields, such as culture, education, local governance, and youth, to enhance mutual understanding between the Chinese and French people.

The readout said that they discussed the war in Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula and other issues. Subscribe now Second, Wang met with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Before I detail the readouts, let me offer a brief analysis. My Brief Takeaway: As you go through both the readouts, you will notice that there is remarkable divergence in just how the Chinese side has characterised Jaishankar's position and what the MEA's readout actually says. The differences in the readouts are indicative of how far the two sides are in terms of their interests and perceptions of each other, despite the patrolling rights deal that was agreed in October and the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan. Here are four points to consider: First, the Chinese readout essentially has Jaishankar agreeing with Beijing's proposition that -specific differences-, i.e., the boundary tensions, should not define the relationship. In contrast, the Indian readout says that both ministers -recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility-. In other words, the Chinese side also appreciated the Indian position that you cannot have a stable relationship if tensions persist on the boundary. Second, the Chinese readout seems to indicate far greater common cause between India and China on global issues, while accepting that there are issues of attrition and suspicion between the two. The MEA's readout, on the other hand, explicitly says that on global issues -India and China have both differences and convergences-. In particular, the Chinese readout talks about world multipolarity; the Indian readout also calls for a multipolar Asia. Third, on specific actions, the Chinese readout calls for easing visa processes, exchanging journalists and resuming direct flights. It does not mention the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage and data sharing on trans-border rivers, which the MEA's readout mentions. Finally, the Chinese readout attributes this to Jaishankar -India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS-. The underlying message in this appears to be directed at the US. In contrast the MEA's readout says that Jaishankar told Wang -where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations.- To me, the underlying message in this is directed at China and its assertive and aggressive policies. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan not long ago and the restart of China-India relations are in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, the expectations of Global South countries and the right direction of history. The two sides should implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, handle differences properly with sincerity and integrity, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of stable and sound development at an early date. The two sides should send more positive signals and engage in actions that facilitate bilateral exchanges, enhance mutual trust and reduce suspicion, and carry out more cooperation and reduce attrition. The two sides should strive to make practical progress in such issues as resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and easing visa procedures as soon as possible. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and India. The two sides should plan commemorative activities, and encourage exchanges and visits in various fields and at different levels to enhance understanding and mutual trust.- ，，，，，。，，，，。，；，；，。、、。75，，，. -Wang said China and India, as two neighbouring major developing countries, have more common interests than differences, and they should view each other's development as an opportunity and work together to achieve common development and rejuvenation, which will help safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and contribute to global multipolarity. Both China and India adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy and multilateralism, and support the democratisation of international relations. The two countries should continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international affairs and further develop mechanisms such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.- ，，，，，，。，，，，、. The Chinese readout quotes Jaishankar as saying: -During the BRICS Summit in Kazan, leaders of both countries reached a consensus on promoting the stable development of India-China relations. It is gratifying to see that both sides are taking measures to implement the consensus of the leaders and have made positive progress. The Indian side hopes to restart the relevant dialogue mechanism as soon as possible and maintain the momentum of improvement and development of bilateral relations through strengthened communication. The consensus between India and China far outweighs the differences. Both sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, properly handle relevant issues with a more positive attitude, and not let specific differences define the relationship between the two countries. The Indian side is willing to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year as an opportunity to push forward India-China relations. Both India and China play an important role in international affairs, which also reflects the potential of India-China cooperation. India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS.- ，，。。，。，，，。75，。，。，，，、. The Indian MEA's readout of the meeting says: -The Ministers recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility. The discussions focused on the next steps in India-China relations. It was agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon. Among the steps discussed were the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage, data sharing on trans-border rivers, direct flights between India and China and media exchanges.- -On the global situation and international issues, EAM noted that India and China have both differences and convergences. We have worked constructively in the BRICS and the SCO framework. Our cooperation in the G20 has also been evident. EAM said that we are strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia. Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations. FM Wang Yi concurred with EAM that India-China relations have particular salience in world politics. He noted that our leaders had agreed in Kazan on the way forward. The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary. It talks about the Xi-Biden meeting, saying that in the past four years, -overall stability has been achieved- in ties. It says that: -President Xi Jinping expounded on strategic, directional, and guiding opinions on the development of China-US relations, proposing that the two countries should respect each other, coexist peacefully, and cooperate for win-win results. He clearly outlined China's four red lines regarding the Taiwan issue, democracy and human rights, the choice of path and system, and development rights. He suggested that both sides should jointly establish correct perceptions, effectively manage differences, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder great power responsibilities, and promote people-to-people exchanges, making the great edifice of China-US relations have not only a dome but also a foundation and pillars. To promote stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, both sides need to add bricks and tiles to this great edifice of China-US relations.- 4，，，，。、、，、、，、、、4，、、、、，，。、、，. -Strategic perception is the fundamental and overarching issue in Sino-US relations. The ‘Thucydides Trap' is not a historical destiny, and a ‘new Cold War' cannot be fought or won. Containment of China is unwise, undesirable, and will not succeed. If the two countries are partners and seek common ground while reserving differences, Sino-US relations will be able to achieve substantial development. If the other side is regarded as an opponent and vicious competition is carried out, Sino-US relations will encounter setbacks or even regress. In the interaction between these two major powers, neither side can reshape the other according to their own wishes, nor can they suppress the other based on so-called ‘position of strength', let alone deprive the other of legitimate development rights to maintain their own leading position. China and the US are two major powers, and some contradictions and differences are inevitable, but they cannot harm each other's core interests, much less engage in conflict and confrontation. The One China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques are the political foundation of bilateral relations and must be strictly observed.- 、。--，--，、，。，，。，，。，，--，。，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily -The interests of China and the United States are deeply intertwined, and the space for cooperation is infinite. In terms of economic ties, the trade volume between China and the United States exceeds $660 billion. More than 70,000 American companies in China have an annual profit of $50 billion; in terms of employment, exports to China alone support 930,000 jobs in the United States, and Chinese investment has also boosted American employment; in terms of people's livelihood, Chinese products have not only enriched the choices of American consumers, but also reduced the cost of living. McDonald's new stores in China in the past year accounted for about 60% of global presence. Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory delivered electric vehicles accounting for half of its global production capacity last year. And Starbucks has more than 1,000 stores in Shanghai alone...The story of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States fully shows that under the current situation, the common interests of China and the United States have not decreased, but rather increased. China and the United States should always focus on the well-being of the people of the two countries, continuously extend the list of cooperation, expand the pie of cooperation, and achieve win-win cooperation.- ，。，6600，7500；，93，；，，。，，1000……，，，。，，，. The next paragraph talks about global turbulence and then outlines this vision for bilateral ties. In essence, this is a call for a G2-style relationship. -China and the US should take into account the interests of the world, constantly consider the future destiny of humanity, take responsibility for world peace, provide public goods for the global community, and play a positive role in world unity. Major power competition should not be the underlying theme of the era; only unity and cooperation can overcome difficulties together. ‘Decoupling and breaking chains' is not the solution; only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to joint development. ‘Small yards with high walls' are not behaviours befitting of major powers; only openness and sharing can benefit humanity. Only by demonstrating the pattern of major powers, shouldering the responsibilities of major powers, and playing the role of major powers can we be responsible to history, to the people, and to the world, and only then can we win the world's respect.-，，，，。，。--，。--，。、、，、、，. The next bit reiterates Xi's framing of the -four unchanged- , i.e., China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. It then says: -To achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations, both sides need to uphold the already agreed-upon guiding principles, i.e., mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, maintaining communication, preventing conflict, adhering to the UN Charter, cooperating in areas of common interest, and responsibly managing competitive elements in bilateral relations. At present, China-US relations once again stand at a crossroads. The people of both countries have expectations for the stable development of China-US relations, and the international community also has expectations for the stable development of China-US relations. It is hoped that the US side will meet China halfway, continue to explore the correct way for two major powers to get along, achieve long-term peaceful coexistence between China and the US on this planet, and inject more certainty and provide positive energy for the world.- ，，、、、、《》，，。，。，。，，，、.

Ghimire has been in China for a few days. He earlier attended the Second Global South Think Tanks Dialogue. This dialogue led to the establishment of the Global South Think Tanks Alliance last week. Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report on He Lifeng attending the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. He said that -with the strong support of the central government, effective leadership of the HKSAR Government, and joint efforts from all sectors of Hong Kong society, the city has achieved new accomplishments in economic and social development, and its financial system remains vibrant.- 、，，. He added that -building, consolidating, and developing Hong Kong as an international financial center is not only essential for Hong Kong but also of great importance to the country. The central government has always positioned the development of Hong Kong as an international financial center from a strategic and overall perspective. It will continue to improve the policy system that supports the construction of Hong Kong as an international financial center and will, as always, provide full support and protection for Hong Kong's financial reform and development, as well as the maintenance of financial stability and security.- ，、、，，。，，，、、. He then talked about China's reform agenda and said: -The long-term positive trend of China's economic development has not changed and will not change. A strong country means a strong Hong Kong; a strong Hong Kong will make the country even better. It is hoped that Hong Kong will seize the historic opportunities brought by the country's reform and development, continuously deepen financial reform and innovation, expand financial openness and cooperation, actively align with national development strategies, safeguard financial security, and continue to write a brilliant chapter of ‘one country, two systems' in the new journey.- ，、。，，。，；，。，，，，，--. Subscribe now Also on the page is a Jin Sheping article, which uses two data points to make the case for economic strength. First, the fact that China's NEV production hit 10 million this year. Second, there have been a total of 100,000 China-Europe freight trains this year, with 7 trains going and 6 trains returning per week. More than 11 million standard containers of goods have been shipped with a value of more than $420 billion. Note this bit: Economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical tide. Although it is facing headwinds and setbacks, this overall trend has never changed and will not change. At 6:00 p.m. on October 11, the 3 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory. In the first three quarters of this year, the Shanghai Gigafactory has delivered 676,000 vehicles, accounting for more than half of Tesla's global deliveries in the same period, becoming the ‘capacity pillar' for Tesla. Of these 3 million vehicles, one-third were exported to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. The localization rate of parts at the Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, and Tesla has signed over 400 local first-tier suppliers, with more than 60 suppliers entering Tesla's global supply chain system. Tesla's development in China is a fruit of economic globalization and a strong proof of ‘harmony and coexistence'. Not just Tesla. In April, Mercedes-Benz announced the upgrade of its Shanghai R&amp;D center, further accelerating innovation in China; Volkswagen Group (China) announced a 2.5 billion euro investment to expand its production and innovation center in Hefei; BMW's Shenyang production base has invested nearly 100 billion yuan since 2010... China's creation of complete industrial chains, efficient market mechanisms, and healthy industrial competition ecology has attracted global capital to invest and develop business. As the economy becomes increasingly globalised, the interdependence between countries further deepens. Research and development, production, circulation, and consumption are interlinked; no country can achieve full lifecycle management of industrial and supply chains on its own. ‘I exist in you, you exist in me', the cooperation pattern becomes more solid. Unilateralism and protectionism offer no way forward, and ‘small yards with high walls' will only trap oneself. For some time, certain people in the US and the West have exaggerated the so-called ‘Chinese new energy overcapacity theory', which in essence is a ‘development anxiety theory' and a ‘zero-sum game theory', which harms others and benefits no one…Facts show that the development of China's new energy industry is a contribution and opportunity to the world. Coming from the depths of history, every Chinese understands what isolation will bring to us and the world. China is a beneficiary of economic globalisation and a firm promoter, because we understand that ‘when the world is good, China will be good; when China is good, the world will be even better'.- ，。，，，。10116，300。，67.6，，--。300，1/3、。95%，400，60。，，--。。4，—，；（），25；20101000……、、，。，。、、、，，。-、-，。、，--。，--，----，。。ATTO32023，E，H6……，。，，。，，、。，，-，；，-.

Another report on the page talks about the successful trial of large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries via trains. A related English report informs: -China Railway has conducted its first large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). On Tuesday, three trains loaded with lithium batteries departed from Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province and Guizhou Province, all of which are located in southwest China. For China, the world's largest producer of lithium batteries, this is a major step forward in the transportation of these vehicle batteries, which are listed as dangerous goods and were previously transported only by sea or road. The transport of lithium batteries is risky as they may burn or explode if jolted. ‘For the trial run, we are using a new type of container designed solely for the transport of lithium batteries. The containers are made of non-combustible materials and equipped with smoke and temperature detectors and venting devices,' said Jia Ping, deputy general manager of China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. Rail transport will facilitate the export of Chinese lithium batteries as it has a larger capacity than road transport and is faster than sea transport, Jia said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi's G20 Speech - Xi Meets Starmer & Albanese - Wang Huning on Spreading China's Voice - Song Tao Meets Wang Jin-pyng	Earlier today, Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the G20 summit in Brazil. Last year, when the G20 was held in India and Xi had skipped it, there was a fair amount of commentary in India about how Beijing was de-prioritising the G20 as a forum in favour of BRICS. I recall saying, wait till it's in Brazil; he will go. And look what we have now. Anyway, Xi said: -the G20 needs to build on its past achievements and continue to act as a force to improve global governance and move history forward. We should keep in mind that mankind lives in a community with a shared future, see each other's development as opportunities rather than challenges, and view each other as partners rather than rivals. We should observe the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and defend the international order based on international law. In light of the G20's mandate, we could build greater international consensus in the economic, financial, trade, digital and eco-environmental fields, among others, to improve global governance and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- He then made five points: First, improve global economic governance. -We should stay committed to strengthening global economic partnerships, reinforcing macro policy coordination in fiscal, financial, monetary and structural reform policies, cultivating new quality productive forces, and raising total factor productivity, in a bid to open up more possibilities for the global economy. It is important to make good use of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meetings, let them serve as a ballast for macro policy coordination, and foster an open, inclusive, and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. As main creditors, international financial institutions and commercial creditors need to take part in debt reduction and suspension for developing countries. It is also important to create a clean business environment by upholding a zero-tolerance stance against corruption, stepping up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, and denying safe haven to corrupt officials and their assets.- Second, improve global financial governance. -To increase the voice and representation of developing countries, the World Bank should carry out shareholding review and the International Monetary Fund should carry out quota share realignment in line with the agreed timeframe and roadmap. Joint efforts are needed to keep the international financial market stable and prevent negative spillover of domestic monetary policy adjustments. Developed countries should fulfill their responsibilities in this regard. It is important to enhance the systems for financial risks monitoring, early warning and handling, reinforce cooperation in such areas as digital currency and taxation, and strengthen the global financial safety net. The G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap should be implemented at a faster pace to better meet the green financing needs of developing countries.- Third, improve global trade governance. -We should place development at the center of the international economic and trade agenda, and steadily advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We should press ahead with reforming the World Trade Organization (WTO), oppose unilateralism and protectionism, restore the normal functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism as soon as possible, include the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement into the WTO legal framework, and reach early consensus on the e-commerce agreement. We should work actively to keep the WTO rules relevant, both addressing long-pending issues and exploring the formulation of new, future-oriented rules, to enhance the authority, efficacy and relevance of the multilateral trading system. It is important to avoid politicizing economic issues, avoid fragmenting the global market, and avoid taking protectionist moves in the name of green and low-carbon development.- Fourth, improve global digital governance. -We should step up international governance and cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI), to make sure that AI is for good and for all, not a game of the rich countries and the wealthy. China hosted the 2024 World AI Conference and High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance, and issued the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance. Together with other parties, China promoted the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China will hold another world AI conference in 2025 and welcomes the participation of fellow G20 members-. Fifth, improve global ecological governance. -We should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and fully and effectively implement the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for the sake of man's harmonious coexistence with nature. Developed countries should provide developing countries with the necessary funding, technology and capacity-building support…Energy transition and energy security is a major issue. We should follow the approach of ‘establishing the new before abolishing the old,' and replace traditional energy with clean energy in a stable and well-ordered way, as we expedite the green and low-carbon transition of the world economy. China stands ready to continue to deepen international cooperation with all sides on green infrastructure, green energy, green mining and green transport, and will provide support to developing countries to the best of its ability.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 19, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi's arrival in Rio for the G20 summit. On the sidelines of the summit, Xi met with (English report) British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. -Noting that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, Xi said that China and Britain, both as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major global economies, share the responsibilities of advancing their respective national development and addressing global challenges. Both countries should stick to their strategic partnership, adhere to the principles of mutual respect, open cooperation, and mutual learning, strive for mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and jointly write the next chapter of healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, he added. Xi said that while the two countries differ in history, culture, values, and social systems, they share extensive common interests. Both sides should view each other's development rationally and objectively, strengthen strategic communication, enhance political mutual trust, and ensure that China-UK relations remain stable, practical, and long-lasting. The two countries have extensive room for cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, clean energy, financial services, and healthcare, which should be continuously expanded to better benefit the people of both nations. Both sides should work to promote the political resolution of hotspot issues, strengthen global governance of artificial intelligence, and contribute to global economic growth and the shared development of all countries. ，。，，。，、、，，。，、、，，，，，、、。、、、，，。，，、. As per Xinhua, Starmer said that Britain and China share extensive common interests. He added that Britain -hopes to strengthen dialogue with China, enhance mutual understanding and carry out exchanges and cooperation in a wide range of areas, including economy and trade, technology, finance, healthcare, education, and addressing climate change, in a spirit of mutual respect, equality and candor-. Share Tracking People's Daily The UK side's readout says: Starmer told Xi that -the UK and China have a shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and the clean energy transition…They also discussed deepening the partnership bilaterally on trade and investment, health, education and other areas of mutual interest. The Prime Minister set out that our approach would be consistent, respectful and pragmatic in order to advance these shared goals…The Prime Minister said that he also wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia's war in Ukraine. He reiterated that his approach would always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner. They discussed next steps and agreed that the Chancellor should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.- Subscribe now Xi also met with (English report) Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He said -that in November last year, we had in-depth communication in Beijing on strategic, overall and directional issues concerning the long-term development of China-Australia relations. Over the past year, the two countries have maintained close communication and exchanges at all levels, actively promoted the implementation of the important consensus we reached, and made positive progress. There is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia. As long as the two sides insist on mutual respect, equality, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, China-Australia relations will surely develop well. China is willing to work with Australia to promote the construction of a more mature, stable and fruitful China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and inject more stability and certainty into the region and the world.- ，11，、、。，，，。，、、，。，、，. Xi added that this year more than 250 Australian companies participated in the CIIE. This was their -vote of confidence- in the Chinese economy. -Both sides should continue to expand the pattern of mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation. China is willing to import more high-quality Australian products and encourages Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Australia. It is hoped that Australia will provide Chinese companies with a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment. Both China and Australia are supporters and defenders of economic globalization and free trade. The two sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation, oppose protectionism, and promote the sharing of opportunities and benefits through openness to achieve common development.- 。，，、、。、，，，，. Among other things, Xinhua quotes the Australian PM as saying that -the Australian side stays committed to the one-China policy, opposes ‘decoupling', advocates promoting economic globalization, and hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in such areas as energy transition and climate change.- Subscribe now In his press briefing in Rio, Albanese said the following: -Earlier today, I also met with President Xi to talk about the progress in stabilising relations between our two countries. This is the third bilateral meeting I've had with President Xi. We have restored trade between our two countries. Impediments have been removed across a range of industries – wine, timber, coal, barley, seafood. And as a result of that, some $20 billion of trade has been resumed. That means Australian jobs. I was in Geraldton talking to the co-op that runs the lobster industry there. That's important not just for those people who work with the lobster trade, it's a driver of that town's regional economy as well. And so these things do matter. And I'm confident that the agreement which will see the lobster trade resume by the end of the year in time for the Lunar New Year in 2025, will be delivered and those negotiations between our respective departments is taking place. I've also said that dialogue is crucial. I've said, a number of times, that we'll cooperate with China where we can, we'll disagree where we must, but we'll engage in our national interests. And we've managed to improve relations without compromising any of Australia's national interests, which we have continued to pursue and will continue to pursue. This patient, calibrated and deliberate approach has made a difference and has both saved but also created many thousands of new jobs in Australia. We discussed areas that present opportunities for greater practical cooperation, such as the renewable energy transition and climate change. And I also made clear Australia's views on issues affecting regional and international peace, stability and prosperity, ranging a number of bilateral points as well, including consular matters which included Dr. Yang Jun.- He was then asked questions about the meeting. He was asked if the policies of the incoming Trump administration in the US were discussed. He said no, they weren't. But he added that -our alliance, is with the United States and that is the only context in which the US was raised, was that.- Albanese also confirmed that he will be visiting China next year for dialogue with Premier Li. In terms of the issues he raised, Albanese said -I raised the issues of human rights. I raised Taiwan. I raised cyber. I raised the supply of assets to Russia. I raised the ICBM missile test that I previously raised as well with the Chinese Premier. So, we raised issues that matter to us, to Australia.- Another interaction is this: JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said that Taiwan was one of the issues that was discussed at the meeting. Chinese state media suggested that the Australian delegation said it wasn't in support of decoupling. Are you able to elaborate a bit further on Taiwan discussions? PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not about Taiwan, that's about the economy. We support the bipartisan support that is there for One China Policy. We also support the status quo. That is no unilateral action, and that's been a consistent bipartisan position for a long period of time. We support peace in the Taiwan Strait. Decoupling refers to the idea that you would decouple your economies. That the trade sanctions, those issues, that is what that's referring to. And our economic relationship with China is important because that is where a whole lot of, for example, our iron ore and coal goes to China and creates steel and construction that's the relationship which is there. Also worth noting is Albanese's characterisation of the significance of the trade relationship with China, which he said brings -substantial benefit for Australians and for Australian jobs and Australian businesses…- He added: -one in four Australian jobs as export dependent, and one in four of our export dollars comes from China.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Li Qiang's comments (English report) when he visited the China Construction Technology Exhibition in Beijing. The report says that Li said that -China's housing situation is shifting from addressing ‘whether there is housing' to focusing on ‘how good the housing is'; guided by the goal of enhancing residents' quality of life and sense of happiness, housing development should take into account functionality, quality, and experience, addressing the diverse needs of people with different living habits, age groups, and economic capacities, especially new demands such as elder-friendly and child-friendly housing. Efforts should be tailored to local conditions to promote the construction of quality housing. This includes setting higher standards and leveraging technology to build good new houses, as well as scientifically renovating old houses to transform them into quality housing.- ，----，，、、，、、、，，、，. He also -called for efforts to advance scientific and technological innovation, and improve design, construction and maintenance levels, with the aim of promoting the high-quality development of the real estate and construction industries. Li noted that urban renewal is an important task for ongoing urban construction. He said that combining the improvement of people's livelihoods with the expansion of domestic demand is necessary, as is strengthening efforts to renovate old urban residential compounds, urban villages and dilapidated houses. Li also stressed the importance of protecting and passing on historical and cultural heritage in the urban renewal process, as part of efforts to build harmonious cities and ensure residents can live happily.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's remarks at the China Overseas Friendship Association executive directors' meeting in Beijing. Wang said that -to do a good job with overseas friendship work with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan in the new era, we must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, adhere to great unity and great solidarity, adhere to holding high the banner of patriotism, adhere to playing the role of Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas united front work in winning hearts and minds, form a vivid situation wherein all children of China think and act in unison, and pool hearts, consensus, wisdom, and strength to broadly rally support for advancing Chinese modernization.- ，，，，，，、，、、、. -Wang Huning said that over the past 75 years since the founding of the PRC, the great motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. Entering the new era, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the cause of the Party and the country has achieved historic achievements and undergone historic changes; a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way has been built, achieving the first centennial goal.

Xi Pitches for 'Open & Interconnected' Asia-Pacific - Biden-Xi Meeting Breakdown - Xi's Bilaterals in Lima - China Taiping's Party Committee on Financ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 18, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's speech at the APEC Leaders Summit. First, let's look at the key points from Xi's speech (English text) at the summit. First, we need to build an open and interconnected paradigm for Asia-Pacific cooperation. We should stay committed to multilateralism and an open economy, firmly uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, fully reactivate APEC's role as an incubator of global economic and trade rules, and advance regional economic integration and connectivity. We should tear down the walls impeding the flow of trade, investment, technology and services, uphold stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, and promote economic circulation in the region and the world. A Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) is an ambitious vision for regional economic integration, and is critical for long-term development and prosperity of our region. Ten years ago, a historic decision to kick off the FTAAP process was taken at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing. Today, we will adopt a new document to guide this process. I believe that this will give new impetus to our efforts toward an open Asia-Pacific economy. On China's approach to FTAs, he added: -We continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) against high standards. We are also working actively to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). We have just signed a protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement with Peru, and have substantially concluded negotiations with ASEAN to upgrade to free trade area 3.0. Together with the relevant parties, we will seek to discuss trade agreements in digital and green areas, and steadily expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.- Second, we need to make green innovation a catalyst for the Asia-Pacific. We need to firmly seize the opportunities presented by the new round of sci-tech revolution and industrial transformation, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information, life and health, and other frontier areas. We need to foster an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory ecosystem for innovation, and promote a leapfrog development of productive forces across our region. To build a clean and beautiful Asia-Pacific, we should prioritize ecological protection, promote resources conservation and their efficient use as well as green and low-carbon development, and engineer an all-round green transition in economic and social development. We need to push forward coordinated digital and green transformation and development to create new momentum and new drivers for Asia-Pacific development. Then he talked about China's initiatives: -China will launch a Global Cross-Border Data Flow Cooperation Initiative, and seek deeper cooperation with other parties to promote efficient, convenient and secure cross-border data flows. China has put forward initiatives in the APEC framework concerning, among others, the application of digital bill of lading, capacity building on green supply chains, exchanges and dialogue on approaches to AI, and the digitalization of food supply chains, with a view to contributing to high-quality development of the Asia-Pacific.- Third, Xi talked about the need to support -developing economies and disadvantaged groups, and work together to grow the pie and distribute it equitably to allow more economies and people to benefit from development…China will advance initiatives through the APEC platform on increasing residents' income and promoting the industrial cluster development of small and medium-sized enterprises, for the purpose of bringing about universally beneficial and inclusive development of Asia-Pacific economies.- Subscribe now Also, earlier Xi spoke at the APEC CEOs summit. Here's an interesting excerpt from his remarks: -…the world is in a new period of turbulence and transformation. Unbridled unilateralism and protectionism and an increasingly fragmented world economy threaten to reverse the trend toward economic globalization. The grave challenge for us is like sailing up a river -- we either forge ahead or drift downstream. Where will the Asia-Pacific economy be going? It is a decision we must make. Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail. New technological revolution and industrial transformation are getting more profound, and the world is moving faster to embrace a digital, green and smart economy. All this is building up powerful energy for further expedition of economic globalization down the road. We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- Another excerpt says: -APEC was born on the eve of the end of the Cold War when a new round of economic globalization was gradually emerging, and has since taken it as its mission to promote economic globalization. It has contributed immensely to boosting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific, economic mutual benefit between member economies, and the interests and well-being of the people in our region. Asia-Pacific economies have maintained robust growth and created the remarkable Asia-Pacific miracle. The success of the Asia-Pacific is due to our firm commitment to peace and stability in the region, to our continuous practices of true multilateralism and open regionalism, and to our deep faith in the trend toward economic globalization as well as mutual benefit and mutual success. The Asia-Pacific should remain the locomotive of economic globalization in the future. We should stay on the right course and seek to break new ground at the same time. While further burnishing the Asia-Pacific hallmark of openness and inclusiveness, we should make new brand-building efforts to foster a green and digital Asia-Pacific, build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, and usher in another 30 golden years of development for our region.- Share Tracking People's Daily Let's now look at Xi's bilateral meetings. Today's paper covers the meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden. The Chinese readout says that: Xi said that -over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but the two sides have also been engaged in dialogue and cooperation. The relationship has remained stable on the whole. Under the stewardship of the two Presidents, the two teams have worked out through consultations a number of guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents have jointly brought China-U.S. dialogue and cooperation back on track. More than 20 communication mechanisms have been restarted or established, and positive achievements have been made in such areas as diplomacy, security, economy, trade, fiscal affairs, finance, military, counternarcotics, law enforcement, agriculture, climate change, and people-to-people exchange. President Xi underscored that it is worthwhile to review the experiences of the past four years and draw inspirations from them. He listed the following: First, it is important to have a correct strategic perception. The Thucydides's Trap is not a historical inevitability. A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail. Second, it is important to match words with actions. A man cannot establish himself without credibility. China has always honored its words. If the U.S. side always says one thing but does another, it will be detrimental to its own image, and undermine trust between China and the United States. Third, it is important to treat each other as equals. As two major countries, neither China nor the United States should seek to remodel the other according to one's own will, suppress the other from the so-called ‘position of strength', or deprive the other of the legitimate right to development so as to maintain its leading status. Fourth, it is important not to challenge red lines and paramount principles. Contradictions and differences between two major countries like China and the United States are unavoidable. But one side should not undermine the core interests of the other, let alone seek conflict or confrontation. The one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. They must be observed. The Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China's path and system, and China's development right are four red lines for China. They must not be challenged. These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations. Fifth, it is important to conduct more dialogue and cooperation. Under the current circumstances, common interests between China and the United States are expanding rather than shrinking. Their cooperation is crucial not only for the economy, trade, agriculture, counternarcotics, law enforcement and public health, but also for handling global challenges of climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as addressing international hotspot issues. The two sides should expand the list of cooperation and make a bigger pie of cooperation to achieve a win-win result. Sixth, it is important to respond to the expectations of the people. China-U.S. relations should always advance the well-being of the two peoples and bring them closer together. To facilitate personnel and cultural exchange, the two sides need to build bridges and roads, remove distractions and obstacles, and refrain from making any moves that have a chilling effect. Seventh, it is important to step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. China and the United States should always keep in mind humanity's future and their responsibilities for world peace, provide public good for the world, and act in a way conducive to global unity, including carrying out constructive interactions, refraining from mutual attrition, and not coercing other countries into taking sides.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xi added: -When the two countries treat each other as partner and seek common ground while shelving differences, their relationship will make considerable progress. But if they regard each other as rival and pursue vicious competition, they will roil the relationship or even set it back…Neither decoupling nor supply-chain disruption is the solution; common development can only be achieved through mutually beneficial cooperation. ‘Small yard, high fences' is not what a major country should do; only openness and sharing can advance the well-being of humanity. A stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. China and the United States should keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet, and inject more certainty and positive energy into the world.- Some other key points: -Xi stressed that cross-Strait peace and stability and ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities are irreconcilable as water and fire. If the U.S side cares about maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, it is crucial that it sees clearly the true nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities in seeking ‘Taiwan independence', handles the Taiwan question with extra prudence, unequivocally opposes ‘Taiwan independence', and supports China's peaceful reunification.- -The Chinese people's right to development is not to be deprived of or ignored. While all countries need to safeguard their national security, they should not overstretch the national security concept, still less use it as a pretext for malicious moves to constrain and contain other countries.- -China firmly upholds its territory, sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. Dialogue and consultation between states concerned is always the best way to manage differences in the South China Sea. The United States should not get involved in bilateral disputes over the relevant islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao, nor should it aid or abet the impulsion to make provocations.- The report adds that -the two Presidents reiterated the seven-point common understandings on the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations, namely treating each other with respect, finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the United Nations Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship. The two sides are ready to uphold these principles, continue to stabilize China-U.S. relations, and ensure a smooth transition of the relationship.- Also: -The two Presidents believed that the two sides have had candid and constructive dialogue on AI. The two sides co-sponsored each other's resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly on AI. They affirmed the need to enhance international cooperation and promote AI for good and for all. The two Presidents stressed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.- Subscribe now The US readout said that: Biden -welcomed efforts to maintain open channels of communication with the PRC to manage competition responsibly and prevent it from veering into conflict or confrontation…On counternarcotics, both sides affirmed the importance of continued coordinated law enforcement actions, information exchanges to identify new and emerging drug trends, and regulatory actions. President Biden welcomed the PRC's scheduling of 55 dangerous synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals, closure of online platforms and companies that supply precursor chemicals, and arrests connected to the illicit chemical industry, and he called for additional steps in the period ahead. Both sides welcomed the resumption over the last year of high-level military-to-military communications, the U.S.-China Defense Policy Coordination Talks, U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings, and engagements between theater commanders. Both leaders affirmed the need to continue these channels of communication.- -The two leaders affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons. The two leaders also stressed the need to consider carefully the potential risks and develop AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner…- -President Biden condemned the deployment of thousands of DPRK troops to Russia, a dangerous expansion of Russia's unlawful war against Ukraine with serious consequences for both European and Indo-Pacific peace and security. He expressed deep concern over the PRC's continued support for Russia's defense industrial base. President Biden emphasized the United States' commitment to upholding international law and freedom of navigation, overflight, and peace and stability in the South China Sea and East China Sea. On Taiwan, President Biden underscored that the United States' one China policy remains unchanged, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. He reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He called for an end to destabilizing PRC military activity around Taiwan.- -President Biden raised concerns about the PRC's unfair trade policies and emphasized that the United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine the national security of the United States or its partners, without unduly limiting trade and investment. The President noted the importance of human rights and the responsibility of all nations to respect their human rights commitments. He emphasized that it remains a priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are unjustly detained or subject to exit bans in China. The President raised deep concerns about ongoing PRC cyberattacks targeting civilian critical infrastructure and threatening the safety and security of Americans.- Subscribe now Subsequently, the Chinese foreign ministry issued an explanatory statement. It reiterated the key points made in the readout. Some messages for the incoming administration are as follows: -in his interactions with President Biden, President Xi fully shared his views on how the two sides should approach bilateral relations, which provide strategic guidance and are important for the direction of this relationship.- -President Xi vividly compared the relationship between China and the U.S. to a mansion. He proposed in 2021 during the virtual meeting with President Biden that the two countries need to follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, which is the dome of the mansion. During the 2022 Bali meeting, he underscored China's four red lines on the Taiwan question, path and system, democracy and human rights, and right to development, which is the foundation of the mansion. During the meeting in San Francisco in 2023, he stated that China and the U.S. should jointly develop a right perception, manage disagreements effectively, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder responsibilities as major countries and promote people-to-people exchanges, which are the five pillars of the mansion, the spokesperson said. In Lima, President Xi insightfully listed seven experiences and inspirations that the two countries should draw from the course of their relations, namely, to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. He stressed that the two sides should continue to add building blocks to the mansion, and expressed readiness to make joint effort with President Biden and his successor towards this end, the spokesperson said.- -The spokesperson noted that President Xi in particular stressed that China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged.- Subscribe now Along with this, let's look at Page 3, where we have a report on the US-China Political Dialogue, which was held in Shenzhen. The report says that Liu Jianchao spoke at the event. More than 50 participants attended, including representatives from Chinese ministries and commissions, local governments, universities, think tanks, as well as strategic and business figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. -The two sides agreed that a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship serves the common interests of both countries and is also the common expectation of the international community. It is also their common belief that China and the United States should maintain contact and communication, properly manage differences, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and shoulder their responsibilities as major countries in promoting world peace and development. They also expressed the belief that with multi-dimensional and multi-faceted characteristics, the China-U.S. relationship faces many uncertainties, but at the same time has strong resilience.- Share Tracking People's Daily Now let's look at other bilateral engagements that Xi had. These were covered in Sunday's paper. First, the Chinese readout (English report) of Xi's meeting with Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba says: -Xi Jinping stressed that the current international and regional situations are facing changes and turbulence, and China-Japan relations are at a critical period of improvement and development. China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world. The relationship between the two countries has great significance beyond bilateral relations. China is willing to work with Japan, in accordance with the principles and directions established in the four political documents between China and Japan, to uphold the important consensus that the two countries should ‘be partners, not threats', comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and endeavour to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era.- -Xi Jinping stressed that China's development is an opportunity for the world, especially for neighbouring countries such as Japan.

The two sides should deepen and expand cultural and sub-national exchanges to promote mutual understanding between the two peoples, especially the younger generation. China and Japan's economic interests and industrial and supply chains are deeply integrated. The two sides should adhere to win-win cooperation and safeguard the global free trade system as well as stable and smooth production and supply chains. Strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs, practise true multilateralism, promote open regionalism, and jointly respond to global challenges.- The readout ends with saying -the two sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges, make good use of high-level dialogue mechanisms in the fields of economy, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other fields, and translate the consensus reached on the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima into action as soon as possible.- The Japanese readout says that this was a 35-minute meeting.

Regardless of how the situation evolves, China and South Korea should remain true to the original intention of establishing diplomatic relations, steadfastly uphold the direction of good-neighbourly friendship, adhere to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and leverage the advantages of geographical proximity, cultural similarities, and economic integration.

However, the development of China-Canada relations still experiences disturbances from time to time, Wang noted, adding that it is necessary for the two sides to maintain communication, properly handle differences and maintain the momentum of continuous improvement. Wang said China and Canada have different political systems, which is a choice made by their respective people and rooted in each other's history and culture. Both sides should adhere to mutual respect and seek mutual benefit and win-win results. The two countries share extensive common interests, and do not have conflicts of fundamental interests. Wang expressed the hope that Canada will work with China to meet each other halfway, view China's development objectively and rationally, and do more things that are conducive to the development of bilateral relations and the enhancement of mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples, so as to promote cooperation and reduce differences between the two countries. He noted that Canada's imposition of high tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles violates the spirit of free trade and is not conducive to the healthy development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. Canada should earnestly abide by the World Trade Organization rules and lift discriminatory restrictions on Chinese products. Wang stressed that the Taiwan question concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the one-China principle is the universal consensus of the international community and an important part of the post-World War II international order, which can not be challenged. He expressed the hope that Canada will fully understand the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question and earnestly abide by the one-China principle.- Back to the front page of today's paper. There's a report on Xi's article in Brazilian media. Xi wrote that China and Brazil have -established a model for major developing countries to develop win-win cooperation and pursue a shared future.- You can read the full English text, which is available from Xinhua. Finally, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory letter for the official commissioning of China's first domestically designed and built deep-ocean drilling vessel Meng Xiang. Xi said that -the successful sea trial and official commissioning of the Meng Xiang marked an important step of China's deep-ocean access, exploration and development. It is another major achievement in improving maritime and sci-tech strength.- The commissioning ceremony was held in Guangzhou. He Lifeng attended it.

Dear Elon, Let's Talk Cooperation	Hi folks, Doing an extra edition today, detailing one rather interesting article in the paper today. This one is bylined Hua Ping (). It talks about the Tesla Effect as part of China's NEV sector. The article's purpose is to praise Tesla's impact on China's NEV sector and make the case for open economic cooperation between China and the US. The argument is that China's opening benefited Tesla; Tesla's factory and presence in the Chinese market benefited the Chinese NEV sector as a whole; and the consequent expansion of China's NEV sector has benefited the global economy and green transition. Ergo, Dear Elon, your company is awesome; please let President-elect Donald Trump know that the US and China must focus on win-win and multi-win collaboration. -The article argues that after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector were fully lifted, demonstrating China's confidence in steadily expanding institutional opening-up.- ，，。 It adds: -In April 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping announced, ‘we must quickly relax foreign ownership restrictions, especially foreign investment restrictions, in the automotive industry'. Three months later, Tesla announced the construction of a factory in Shanghai, with a total investment of 50 billion yuan and planned annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. In January 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory broke ground, and in December of the same year, the first complete vehicle rolled off the production line. As the first wholly foreign-owned new energy vehicle project, Tesla's ‘complete vehicle manufacturing', with its ‘Tesla speed' of starting construction, completing construction, and starting production all in the same year, provided Tesla with broad development space, and also brought a ‘catfish effect', compelling Chinese automakers to accelerate innovation. China's new energy vehicle production ‘exceeding 10 million annually' has one important reason: facing fierce competition in an open environment and facing Tesla's ‘catfish effect', Chinese auto companies dared to confront challenges directly and actively adapted and sought change. Developing real capabilities through open competition, today's China has become the world's most active industrial center for new energy vehicle technological innovation. In 2023, China's automobile exports jumped to first place globally, among which new energy vehicle exports exceeded 1.2 million units, increasing by 77.6% year-on-year.- 20184，，--。3，，500，50。20191，，12。--，、、--，，--，. --，，，--，、。，。2023，，120，77.6%。 Share The article then makes the following points: Starting from November 1, the new version of the negative list for foreign investment access will be implemented. The number of restrictive measures will be reduced from 31 to 29. This means that China has the firm determination to promote a higher level of opening up, and is brave enough to enhance its openness in expanding international cooperation and win new advantages in international competition. 111，，3129。，，。 China's NEV sector's growth is a product of -integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation.- And they have -achieved a strong rise, transitioning from running alongside others to leading the way in terms of production and sales, core technologies, and levels of intelligence.- ，--。，、、. China's NEVs hitting the 10 million production volume is a -‘green milestone' for the global new energy industry.- Green and low-carbon development is a universal trend, which cannot be blocked by ‘small yards and high walls'. In the first three quarters of this year, China exported a total of 928,000 NEVs, a year-on-year increase of 12.5%. Faced with ‘additional tariffs' and other big sticks, global consumers have used their actions to express their love for quality products and their pursuit of green and low-carbon concepts.- 、，--。，92.8，12.5%。--，、. Leave a comment It then says: -Cooperation and mutual benefit are the right path and broad way, while isolation and exclusivity are dead ends. Only through cooperative win-win can things be accomplished, be done well, and be done on a grand scale. Leveraging advantages in technology and brand, and backed by China's super-large-scale consumer market, Tesla's substantial sales growth has driven rapid development of upstream and downstream industry and supply chains. Today, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory has achieved a localization rate of parts exceeding 95%, and more than 60 suppliers have entered Tesla's global supply chain system. Relying on China's perfect supply chain system and first-class intelligent manufacturing capabilities, Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory has an average of one vehicle rolling off the assembly line every 30 seconds. In 2023, the output of Tesla's Chinese factory accounts for more than half of its global production capacity, of which 36% caters to the export market. Tesla's success in the Chinese market is a process of mutual and multi-win collaboration, aligning with the global division of labour in industrial and supply chains in the era of economic globalisation. It exemplifies the philosophy of cooperative win-win outcomes and harmonious coexistence.- Share Tracking People's Daily -Today, more and more multinational car companies are utilising the advantages of China's market, technology, and policy openness to achieve the transformation of ‘in China, for the world'. In Hungary, Spain, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil ... Chinese new energy vehicle companies are establishing overseas factories to promote green cooperation and facilitate the green, low-carbon transition in more countries and regions. On the evening of November 14, the Peruvian Chancay Port, a key BRI project jointly built by China and Peru, opened. As South America's first intelligent green port, its operation will create over 8,000 direct jobs annually for Peru, generate $4.5 billion in revenue, and mark the emergence of the new Asia-Latin America land-sea corridor in the new era. ‘From Chancay to Shanghai', from win-win to multi-win.

Based on the concept of win-win cooperation, we continue to provide new opportunities for world development with new achievements in Chinese-style modernization, and are willing to work with all parties to promote the realization of world modernization of peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity. Great opening up brings great development, and high-level opening up promotes high-quality development. In opening up, we have not only acquired real skills, but also greatly enhanced our confidence in development. Having faced countless risks and challenges, by steadfastly expanding openness and focusing on managing our own affairs well, we have ultimately turned dangers into safety and crises into opportunities. Using openness to drive reform and promote development, today's China is more resilient and steadfast than ever. By working together globally and embracing harmonious coexistence, and with an even more open and inclusive mindset, the world will surely reach its next ‘green milestone' more quickly.- 。，，、、。，。，，。，，，、。，，，。、，，--。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

China-Peru Joint Statement - Celebrating NEV Output Landmark - Funding Basic Research - Yin Hejun Outlines Sci-Tech Tasks - Philippines Sends Supplies...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, November 15, 2024. Page 1: Let's start by covering Xi Jinping's visit to Peru. The paper is lagging behind on developments. Today, it has carried Xi's article published in Peruvian media (English report) outlet El Peruano. Xi called Peru a -‘neighbor' of China across the Pacific Ocean-. He wrote: -Peruvian thinker José Carlos Mariátegui once said, ‘Spiritually and materially, China is closer to us than Europe. The psychology of our people is more Asian than Western.' This is the ‘code of civilization' that explains the inseparable bond between immigrants of Chinese origin and the local people, forged through seamless integration and familial ties over the past 175 years.- -Peru is one of the first Latin American countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For over 50 years, our bilateral relations have been progressing steadily. Especially since the elevation of our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013, our ties have grown stronger and our practical cooperation fruitful, bringing tangible benefits to our peoples. In fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, China sent a medical expert team to Peru. We also provided vaccines and other medical supplies to the best of our ability. We have proven through concrete actions that China is a trustworthy friend that Peru can rely on in crucial moments. Peru is the first Latin American country to sign a package FTA with China. It is also among the first in Latin America to participate in cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. China has been Peru's largest trading partner and largest export market for 10 consecutive years. Last year, Peru's exports to China accounted for 36 percent of its total exports. Chinese businesses have an investment stock of about US$ 30 billion in Peru. The Las Bambas copper mine, a project with investment from Chinese enterprises, contributes to about 1 percent of Peru's GDP, creating tens of thousands of job opportunities. The Saúl Garrido Rosillo Hospital in Tumbes, a project undertaken by a Chinese enterprise, will serve over 100,000 local residents. The water project in the three districts of Lima will enable more than 400,000 people to access clean water and sanitation services.- The article talks about the inauguration ceremony of Chancay Port, which Xi has already participated in along with the Peruvian president Dina Boluarte. In the article, Xi wrote that: -This is not only an important project under Belt and Road cooperation, but also the first smart port in South America. The first phase of the project, when completed, will reduce the sea shipping time from Peru to China to 23 days, thus cutting logistics costs by at least 20 percent. It is expected to generate US$ 4.5 billion in yearly revenues for Peru and create over 8,000 direct jobs. The completion of Chancay Port will enable Peru to put in place a multi-dimensional, diverse and efficient network of connectivity spanning from coast to inland, from Peru to Latin America and further on to the Caribbean. It will also help build an Inca Trail of the New Era with Chancay Port as its starting point, thus boosting the overall development and integration of the region. The port's development plan also includes establishing animal rescue services to fulfill its social responsibility for the rescue and protection of penguins, seals, and birds and to improve the environment of wetlands, beaches, and habitats. It is thus very important that we work together to ensure the success of Chancay Port from construction through operation, so that the route from Chancay to Shanghai will lead China, Peru and Latin America to common development and prosperity.- Xi also promised that -China is also ready to launch in Peru more ‘small and beautiful' livelihood cooperation projects, open more Luban Workshops and centers for Chinese language learning, and strengthen cooperation on vocational education. We will encourage Chinese companies to create more jobs and fulfill their social responsibilities in Peru, making our paisano friendship more tangible and beneficial.- He added: -We should take more measures to facilitate personnel exchanges to garner greater public support for our relations. We should enhance cooperation under the framework of the Ancient Civilizations Forum. We should explore the establishment of a global network for dialogue and cooperation among civilizations, and support their exchanges and mutual learning.- And said: -China is ready to join Peru in embracing a broader vision and grasping the underlying trends of our times from a long historical perspective to champion true multilateralism, promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and build together a community with a shared future for mankind.- Subscribe now Xi has already held talks with the Peruvian president. The detailed readout is awaited. But the joint statement following the talks is out. Key points: Both sides are satisfied with the fruitful results of the talks, which will deepen bilateral cooperation in strategic areas such as infrastructure, energy, and mining. Both sides emphasize that the ‘Joint Action Plan 2024-2029' has great significance for promoting the development of bilateral relations. Both sides commit to taking concrete actions to implement this plan. ，、。，《20242029》。. Both sides emphasized that China's development brings new cooperation opportunities for developing countries, including Peru. The Chinese side reiterated its support for Peru to follow an economic and social development path that suits its national conditions, and wished Peru success in achieving its related goals.75，。，。，. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and core interests of all countries. Peru reiterated its firm adherence to the one-China principle. 《》，、。. Both sides welcome the signing of the upgraded protocol of the China-Peru Free Trade Agreement during this visit. Both sides are willing to continue to promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen customs inspection and quarantine cooperation, and increase trade in high value-added products. 。，，. Both sides emphasized the importance of bilateral mechanisms such as the China-Peru Strategic Dialogue on Economic Cooperation. The two sides held the fourth strategic dialogue on economic cooperation in October 2024, conducted effective dialogues in the field of investment, and exchanged experiences and practices on issues such as investment standardization and facilitation. 。202410，，、. The document talks about cooperation in large-scale infrastructure projects, and areas like circular economy, sustainable agriculture, industrial and supply chains, digital economy investment, and green development. Both sides welcomed Chinese airlines to establish air links between China and Peru through code sharing to cultivate the market for the opening of direct flights between the two countries. ，. — Just a note on this. Xi stopped over in Gran Canaria on his way to Peru. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in digital economy, scientific and technological innovation, digital transformation, talent exchange, technology transfer, and digital security, promoting the development of emerging technologies like AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, data analytics, nanotechnology, and telemedicine. 、、、、、，、、、、、、. The two sides -stressed that it is of great significance to strengthen cooperation in AI capacity building and enhance the digital competitiveness of all people, especially the vulnerable groups. During the life cycle of AI systems, special attention should be paid to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, human dignity, safeguarding personal privacy and data, and promoting diversity and inclusiveness.- ，、。，、、、，，. The document then talks about strengthening cultural, educational and tourism exchanges. China also committed to doing -small but beautiful cooperation projects in the field of people's livelihood- and -provide economic and technical assistance to Peru within its capacity.- Both sides are willing to strengthen fishery cooperation, promote sustainable development of fisheries, cooperate to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and agree to strengthen communication and exchanges between the law enforcement agencies of both sides. ，，、、，. The next bits talk about their -commitment to multilateralism, safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law…-; support for -the open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core- and decision to -jointly safeguard multilateralism and oppose protectionism-; and -willingness to continue to promote the construction of high-quality cooperation mechanisms in key areas such as economy, trade, investment, minerals, infrastructure, industry, finance, industry, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, green development, blue economy, new infrastructure construction, renewable energy, digital economy and e-commerce.- This is under BRI. Peru welcomes China's willingness to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and reiterates that this agreement has expanded and enriched trade exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region. 《》，. Peru positively evaluates the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by China. And it reaffirmed support for GDI. Interestingly, there is no mention of GSI or the Global AI Governance Initiative by China. Anyway, -China appreciated Peru's joining the ‘Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative' and invited Peru to join the Global Development Promotion Center Network.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a Ren Ping article discussing that as of November 14, China's new energy vehicles output exceeded 10 million for the first time. The article says that -this is an important node for China to move from a large automobile country to a powerful automobile country, marking a new stage of high-quality development for China's new energy vehicle industry.- 1114，1000。，. The report adds that: Looking back. In 2012, the annual output was 13,000 vehicles. In 2018, the annual output reached 1 million. In 2024, the annual output is expected to reach 12 million vehicles.

The article adds that: -the reason why the new energy vehicle industry has grown from small to large and from weak to strong is that technological innovation is the key variable. After the ‘Qilin' battery and ‘Shenxing' battery, CATL recently released the ‘Xiaoyao' super range-extended hybrid battery. This is the world's first range-extended hybrid battery with a pure electric range of over 400 km, featuring 4C ultra-fast charging capability. In recent years, China has made major breakthroughs in core technology paths such as plug-in hybrid, pure electric, and hydrogen fuel, and has a leading advantage in the three major technical fields of new energy vehicles, such as batteries, motors, and electronic controls. By driving industrial innovation with technological innovation and strategically arranging the industrial chain around the development of new-quality productive forces, China has significantly enhanced the resilience and security level of the supply and industrial chains. Over 1000 intelligent devices, over 3000 robots working intelligently in coordination, 100% automation of key processes ... Using intelligent production, Chongqing SERES super factory rolls off two new energy vehicles per minute. Behind China's transition from ‘Made in China' to ‘Intelligently Made in China' is the ‘qualitative change' brought by technological innovation.

The article adds: In order to promote Chinese-style modernization, technological innovation is the only way. The 2024 Global Innovation Index Report shows that China's global innovation ranking has jumped to 11th place, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in innovation in the past 10 years. In the first three quarters of this year, investment in high-tech industries increased by 10.0% year-on-year, 6.6 percentage points higher than total investment, maintaining double-digit growth for 7 consecutive months. The added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.1%, 3.3 percentage points faster than all industries above designated size. We have sufficient strength and great potential to develop new quality productive forces by using disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, and new momentum. We will continue to do a good job in innovation, promote the accelerated integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation, and achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. The scientific and technological support for Chinese-style modernization will be stronger. ，。《2024》，，10。，10.0%，6.6，7。9.1%，3.3。、、，，、。，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the article says: -Developing new energy vehicles is a strategic choice to conform to the trend of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation and promote green and low-carbon development. Since the new era, with the new development concept as a strategic guide and the goal of meeting the diverse needs of the people through green and low-carbon smart products, new energy vehicles have strongly driven the real economy toward a path of green and low-carbon development. In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, new-quality productive forces and a broad range of consumers are ‘heading toward each other' — a 2022 market survey showed that users under 40 years old accounted for as much as 84% of new energy vehicle users in China, with people under 30 making up nearly half. A survey in the second quarter of this year showed that 53.6% of Chinese consumers chose new energy vehicles, noticeably higher than the 36.2% who preferred fuel-powered vehicles … In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, we are seizing the historical opportunity of electrification, intelligence and green transformation, taking the lead in switching to a new track, and establishing new advantages in international competition. In the first three quarters of this year, China's cumulative exports of new energy vehicles reached 928,000, an increase of 12.5% ​​year-on-year. This has not only met the needs of global consumers for high-quality products and services, but has also led the global transportation energy transformation and reform…Today, China's high-quality production capacity of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, etc., has provided important support for the world's green development.

Share In contrast, reporting from the US indicates that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation. Reuters' report adds that: -ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla - by far the nation's biggest EV maker - have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ‘devastating' to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors…Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said…Trump campaigned on ending Biden's ‘EV mandate', without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden's clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump could use the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans plan to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions.- Another report, meanwhile, quotes CATL's Robin Zeng saying that the company would be open to invest in a plant in the US if Trump opens the door to Chinese investment in the electric-vehicle supply chain. The report adds: -Trump wants to prevent Chinese auto imports but has said he remains open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the United States. Trump told Reuters in an August interview: ‘We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers.' Such comments have kept Zeng interested in a US expansion for CATL. ‘I do hope that in the future they are open to investments,' he said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang signing a decree of the State Council, unveiling a set of revised regulations on the use of the national natural science fund. This will come into effect on January 1, 2025. The Regulations have 7 chapters and 45 articles. The revisions primarily cover the following: The National Natural Science Foundation should adhere to the centralised and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, focus on the forefront of world science and technology, the main economic battlefield, major national needs, and people's health and well-being. The Foundation is explicitly designated to fund basic research, support talent cultivation and team building, and follow the principles of openness, fairness, and impartiality. When determining funded projects, both free exploration and goal-oriented research should be encouraged. Second, improve the management system to adapt to new trends and requirements in the development of scientific and technological innovation. The responsibilities of the Fund's management organization, relevant departments, and supporting units are specified.

Share Tracking People's Daily The MoFA readout has some additional context. Wang Yi emphasized that the leadership of the heads of state is the greatest political advantage and fundamental guarantee for the high-quality development of China-Russia relations. The China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism must take the implementation of the consensus between the two heads of state as its fundamental guideline, strengthening coordination on strategic and overarching issues that concern the security and development interests of both sides, continuously enhancing the level of strategic mutual trust, and enriching the substance of strategic cooperation.

Instead of this, I want to point to the Xinhua Institute's report that was released during this forum. It is titled: -New Model for Human Advancement and Its Global Significance-. If there is any doubt that Beijing sees value in promoting its governance model, let me share the following for you to consider. The report talks about how China has created a -distinct path to modernization- under the CPC -and thereby created a new model for human advancement, which provides effective solutions to the problems facing the entire humanity-. It adds that -the emergence of the new model for human advancement has brought the Chinese civilization back to the frontier of human advancement.- -The emergence of the new model for human advancement has exerted enormous influence upon the whole world. It busted the myth that ‘modernization is Westernization', and created an effective path toward modernization for almost one fifth of the world population, thus offering a brand-new option for large numbers of developing countries seeking modernization.The new model for human advancement is a huge contribution that China has made to innovating both the theory and practice of the world's modernization efforts, as it contributes the Chinese wisdom to tackling global challenges, and points out the right way to further progress of human advancement. Highly inclusive, this new model for human advancement sticks to allowing cultural exchanges to transcend estrangement, mutual learning to transcend clashes, and coexistence to transcend feelings of superiority.This new form, constantly enriched and developed as it fuels the construction of a better world, will play a huge role in making the garden of the world civilizations more colorful and vibrant.- Later, the report discusses the constituents of the Chinese model. One of the aspects discussed is -Political Integrity-. This consists of the -Leadership Core of the CPC-, -Whole-Process People's Democracy-, and -Law-Based Governance on All Fronts-. The final chapter of the report seeks to draw lessons from the Chinese model for others. It says: -By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development. By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development.- It adds: -Western style modernization has never adequately tackled numerous human development challenges, and has instead exacerbated crises in some developing countries. The unique worldviews, values, and views on history, civilization, democracy, and ecology, and their remarkable application in Chinese modernization, have made vital innovative contributions to the theory and practice of global modernization. They also demonstrate to the world that the path to modernization is not unique to any one country, and human civilization still moves on and history's final chapter remains unwritten.- Then we get select points pitching the Chinese model: The new model for human advancement deriving from Chinese modernization reflects a disparate worldview that emphasizes the pursuit of common prosperity for all rather than zero-sum games. China holds the conviction that the development of all nations is closely intertwined, and humanity is a global community of shared future where all people rise and fall together. Only through concerted efforts, solidarity, and cooperation among all nations can humanity secure a brighter future. The new model for human advancement originating from Chinese modernization showcases distinctive values that prioritize the well-being of people over the accumulation of capital. In terms of value orientation, Chinese modernization, which conforms to the people-centered principle, is fundamentally different fromWestern-style modernization, which, on the contrary, worships capital. Chinese modernization insists on development for the people, by the people and to the benefit of the people. The new model for human advancement resulting from Chinese modernization embodies a unique historical perspective highlighting a broad view of history rather than the shallow-minded narrative of the ‘end of history'. China argues that the progression of human society is driven by fundamental social contradictions, and it is the universal laws governing the movement of these contradictions that shape the basic trajectory of humanity's historical development. In pursuing modernization, China emphasizes the importance of summarizing historical experiences, understanding historical laws, and initiating historical progress. By analyzing evolutionary mechanisms and exploring major historical patterns through the lens of historical context, current trends, and global dynamics, and proposing corresponding strategies, China has constantly sustained the vigor and vitality of Marxism, and showcased the profound historical depth of its civilization traversing over five millennia. The new model for human advancement emanating from Chinese modernization offers a different perspective on civilization that stresses exchanges and mutual learning rather than conflict and estrangement. The new model for human advancement stemming from Chinese modernization underlines whole-process people's democracy which stands out as a distinct concept compared to mere formal democracy. China claims that democracy is a treasure shared by all humankind rather than a patent of a few countries; whether a country is democratic or not is determined solely by its citizens; democracy is not an ornament or a façade, and the criterion for evaluating democracy should not solely center on its form, but rather on whether it truly allows its people to govern their own affairs and whether it can be employed to address people's concerns. People are entitled to the right to elect and vote, and moreover, to extensive participation; they can express their will freely and see it effectively fulfilled; better still, they can also do their part in promoting national development and share in its gains. Whole-process people's democracy embodies the will and voices of the people in every facet of national political and social life, transcending the formal democratic model of the West solely obsessed with ‘votes' and showcasing the edges of socialist democracy in governance efficiency. The new model for human advancement forged by Chinese modernization encompasses a distinct ecological outlook that advocates for creating a community of all life on Earth. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the report says: -China does not follow the old path of some countries in achieving modernization through war, colonization and plunder. On the contrary, it holds high the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, seeking its own progress while resolutely safeguarding world peace and development. China's successful advancement towards modernization can be attributed to its adherence to the overall leadership of the CPC in propelling Chinese modernization, its commitment to people-centered development philosophy, its perseverance in pursuing an independent path, its effective employment of reform and opening-up, its insistence on innovation-driven development, and its systematic approach to support progress. These remarkable experiences and practices have set a good example for the vast array of developing countries to pursue modernization on their own, offered fresh options for nations who want to accelerate development while preserving their independence, and provided Chinese solutions for humankind's exploration of a better social system.- After this, the report talks about GDI, GSI and GCI. Some useful data points: Since the GDI's introduction, China has established over 30 cooperative platforms and initiated more than 1,100 projects in eight key areas including poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, and digital-age connectivity, which cover all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda. So far, China has invested and mobilized a range of development funds totaling nearly USD 20 billion and launched more than 600 projects from the GDI project database. Currently, the GSI has won support and applause from over 100 countries and international organizations as it represents China's solution to address global peace deficit and security challenges… Share Tracking People's Daily Page 4: There is a brief report on a seminar held in Shanghai to study Xi's thoughts on urban governance work. Propaganda chief Li Shulei and Shanghai Secretary Chen Jining spoke at this meeting. Page 9: There's an article by the National Defense University's Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center. My Note: This is an important article to read for people around the world, particularly those in India, who seem to assume that the logic of economic engagement with China can rest simply on the basis of economic principles. National security thinking is deeply embedded in Beijing's approach, and I would argue that it is understandable for Beijing to have these national security concerns. However, you should ignore this reality at your own peril. This does not mean that one must decouple or that decoupling is inevitable. In fact, decoupling is impractical and will have adverse economic and strategic consequences. But one needs to appreciate that security will have to be a key component of economic decisionmaking. Conceptually, this is self-evident now. The debate, therefore, needs to move away from this argument to focussing on modalities for estimating risk and vulnerability, sectoral and sub-sectoral actions, and putting in place processes that ensure that security concerns do not result in opacity and unpredictability in policymaking, which will adversely affect businesses. Share Tracking People's Daily Anyway, back to the article. The article begins by telling us that the Third Plenum Decision held that -national security provides a pivotal foundation for ensuring steady and sustained progress in Chinese modernization-. -This important conclusion profoundly demonstrates the foresight of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in coordinating development and security, and provides scientific guidance to build a solid security guarantee for China's modernization-. The article says: Proactively addressing various risks and challenges serves the intrinsic requirement to support the undertaking of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. Using Chinese-style modernization to comprehensively advance the building of a strong nation and the great cause of national rejuvenation is not going to be a smooth, obstacle-free path but rather a long expedition that requires continuously breaking through barriers and seizing strategic positions. At present, China's development has entered a period where various risks and challenges are accumulating and even manifesting at once. The risks and tests faced on the path forward will only become more complex, and may even encounter unimaginable stormy seas. For an undertaking as immensely challenging yet magnificent as Chinese-style modernization, one cannot expect everything to go smoothly. It is essential to deeply understand that security has become a regular and crucial variable in China's economic and social development. While developing, we must solidly lay the security foundation and repeatedly strengthen the security base. Only by comprehensively strengthening the national security barrier, firmly grasping the strategic initiative in maintaining national security, and striving to either prevent major risks from appearing or being able to withstand and get through them when they do appear, can we truly achieve higher quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable and safer development, and ensure that a series of major development strategic goals of the Party and the country will be achieved as scheduled. ，、。、，，。，，，。，，，、。，，、，、、、、，. The next paragraph pats China on the back for achieving the -two miracles-. It then cautions: -Without national security, development miracles can only be ‘castles in the air', the dream of a good life can only be illusory, and already-achieved results could be destroyed in an instant. Therefore, to write a new chapter of the ‘two miracles' and effectively meet the people's growing need for a better life, it is essential to ensure that national security is guaranteed, continually resolving the risks and challenges along the path forward.- ，，--，--，。，--、，，. The steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization is inseparable from a peaceful international environment and a good neighbouring environment. At present, the profound once-in-a-century changes are accelerating in their evolution, traditional security and non-traditional security issues are complexly intertwined, the interconnected nature, transnational nature, and diversity of security issues are becoming more prominent, and the backflow effect, confluence effect, superposition effect, linkage effect, amplification effect, and inducement effect of various risks are becoming more pronounced. Only by upholding national sovereignty, security, and development interests with core national interests as the bottom line and leading the reform of the global governance system based on the principles of fairness and justice, both promoting our own development through maintaining world peace and contributing to world peace through our own development, resolutely opposing all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and firmly rejecting all practices that sacrifice other countries' security to gain absolute security for oneself, can we promote the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. In doing so, we can integrate safeguarding national security and promoting international security, making Chinese-style modernization progress more steadily and soundly. 、、，。、，。，。，，，、、，、、、、、。、、，，，，，，，，. The second section reiterates that as per the third plenum outcome national security is -a pivotal foundation for the steady and sustained development of Chinese-style modernization.- It adds: -This major conclusion examines national security from the perspective of the central tasks of the Party and the country in the new era and new journey, so that the theory and practice of national security are closely centered on Chinese-style modernization, and more theoretical innovations related to Chinese-style modernization will emerge in the field of national security.- ，，. It adds that -the issue of national security has a distinct political nature.- -Linking national security with central tasks for positioning and deployment fully demonstrates the political considerations of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, endows national security with a deeper political foundation, and enables us to implement the overall national security concept from a higher political position.- ，，，。 A country's development and security are like two wings of one body, two wheels of one drive. They complement each other and cannot be neglected. They coexist and share a common fate. Security without the support of development is unlikely to endure, and development without the safeguard of security cannot be sustainable. The ‘Decision' of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee regards national security as an important foundation for the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization, enriching the contemporary connotation of the dialectics of coordinating development and security. On the new journey, whether it is promoting high-quality development or creating high-level security, it must be viewed and planned in the overall situation of Chinese-style modernization. Only in this way can we promote high-level security with high-quality development and ensure high-quality development with high-level security, and achieve mutual support and promotion between high-quality development and high-level security, truly building a position of permanent security and achieving the enterprise of long-term governance.- ，、，、，、。，；，。《》，。，，。，、，、，、. The third and final section talks about practical implications. It calls for the -modernization of the national security system and capacity-. It adds: In practice, we must effectively use systematic thinking to observe security situations, analyze security issues, plan security countermeasures; be good at observing big trends, planning big matters, strengthen forward-looking thinking, overall planning, strategic layout, and comprehensive advancement; promote the connection, coordination and unified advancement of national security work in all fields and aspects. For example, we must emphasize coordinating external security and internal security, territorial security and citizen security, traditional security and non-traditional security, self security and common security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, and effectively prevent various types of risk transmission and superposition. At the same time, we must take scientific coordination as an important principle and basic method of national security work, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, emphasize the synergy between national security work and various economic and social development work, achieve planning together and deploying together, and integrate national security into all aspects and links of the overall work of the Party and the country.- ，、、，、，、、、，、。，、、、，，、。，，，，、，.

China 'Hawks' Set for Trump Cabinet Posts? - Beijing Targets European Brandy - China-Russia Talks - Lashing Out at 'Evil' Philippine Laws - 'Confidenc...	Before I get to today's edition, let's cover a couple of interesting stories from outside the paper. First, WSJ reports that -US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state and has asked Representative Mike Waltz, a Green Beret veteran, to be his White House national security adviser, according to people familiar with his thinking. Trump could change his mind on the Rubio move, as he remains fond of others lobbying for the secretary of state role. But people familiar with the Rubio decision said that Trump feels good about going with him; Trump had considered him for the vice president slot before settling on Ohio Sen. JD Vance.- The report adds: -Rubio's expected rise to the nation's top diplomatic post, earlier reported by the New York Times, would put a more establishment figure into the highest echelons of the Trump administration. A hawk on China, Iran and Cuba, Rubio joined most of Washington in supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion. But in recent months he started changing his message, advocating for the conflict to end as soon as possible, last week stating the U.S. was ‘funding a stalemate war' and that it would take ‘100 years' to rebuild Ukraine. Trump's pick comes just hours after he decided to name Waltz, a fellow tough-on-China lawmaker, as national security adviser. Earlier, Trump also chose another Floridian, co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, as his chief of staff. Waltz will step into his cabinet-level role amid prolonged conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and Trump is expected to try to prevent further escalation abroad by building deterrence against foreign rivals while favoring transactional policies with U.S. allies.- Second, some reporting on China-EU ties amid all this. SCMP reports: -The Chinese foreign ministry's deputy head in charge of European affairs Cao Lei said on Saturday that Trump's election victory may indicate ‘the turning point of [our] times- and urged Brussels and Beijing to fix rifts and improve ties.' No one wants to return to the law of the jungle, no one wants to go back to the era of confrontation and the Cold War, and no one wants to return to unilateral hegemony. This is the backdrop that China-EU relations are facing,' he said.Cao was speaking at the launch of Beijing Foreign Studies University's China Think-Tank Network on Europe, which aims to foster renewed understanding between the two sides.- WSJ's Lingling Wei and Kim Mackrael report that -Beijing is looking at ways to peel American allies away from Washington … Trump's campaign pledge to impose tariffs of up to 60% on imports from China threatens the very growth model promoted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, one that centers on ramping up manufacturing and exporting the country's way out of a downturn.To offset the potential hit to the already wobbly Chinese economy, the Xi leadership is considering plans to shower American allies in Europe and Asia with tariff cuts, visa exemptions, Chinese investments and other incentives, according to people close to Beijing's decision-making. They say that while China is willing to engage in dialogue with Washington once the new Trump team is in place, it is also seizing on the opportunity to court America's traditional partners to buy itself time and leverage in its intensifying competition with the U.S.- The report adds: -In recent months, China has already removed visa requirements for travelers from some two dozen countries including Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Finland and South Korea—without requiring that the moves be immediately reciprocated. The strategy, labeled -unilateral opening- in China's policy circles, represents a tactical change for a leadership that has long favored quid-pro-quo economic and diplomatic deals. He Lifeng, Xi's economic czar, hinted in recent meetings with Western business leaders that Beijing is weighing -proactive- tariff cuts in various sectors to boost foreign investment and trade with Europe and other Asian countries, according to the people close to the decision-making. The people say the sectors in focus include electrical and telecommunications equipment, as well as seafood and other agricultural products, depending on the countries Beijing is targeting.- Meanwhile, Global Times reports: -China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday that Chinese investigating agencies decided to impose temporary anti-dumping measures against brandy imported from the EU. Starting from November 15, when importing the products under investigation, importers must submit deposits or letters of guarantee to China's customs authorities based on the dumping margins as specified in the announcement. Experts noted that in contrast with the EU's unilateral move of launching an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), the MOFCOM's decision is in line with China's domestic laws and WTO rules, and the investigation is based on the demands of the related industry. They urged the bloc to respect and attach importance to the benefits brought by the interdependence of China-EU economic and trade relations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 12, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with two reports about Xi Jinping. First, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory message to the Global South Media and Think Tank Forum being held in Brazil. Xinhua reports: -Noting that at present, the Global South is growing with a strong momentum and playing an increasingly important role in the cause of human progress, Xi said China has always been a member of the Global South and will always belong to the developing world. China is willing to work alongside Global South countries to practice true multilateralism, advocate for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, in a joint effort to build a community with a shared future for mankind, he said. Xi emphasized that in the face of global changes of the century, pursuing modernization and working for a more just and equitable international order are the sacred historic missions of Global South countries and the common issues of the times for Global South media and think tanks. Xi expressed hope that the forum's participants will engage in in-depth discussions, build consensus, and jointly amplify the ‘voice of the Global South' while showcasing the ‘commitment of the Global South'. He also urged them to contribute wisdom toward empowering the Global South to become a stabilizing force for peace, a backbone of openness and development, a constructive force in global governance, and a driving force for mutual learning among civilizations.- Second, there's a report on Xi's response to -letters from friendly personages from all walks of life in Brazil-. Xinhua reports: -China is willing to work with Brazil to enrich the friendship between the two countries in the new era, make China-Brazil relations a good example of solidarity, coordination, common development and mutual benefit among major developing countries, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress of mankind, Xi said. He said Brazilian friends are welcome to visit China more often and experience for themselves the myriad sights of Chinese modernization. He voiced hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will play a positive role in promoting the continuous development of China-Brazil relations and making the China-Brazil friendship flow unceasingly like the Yangtze River and the Amazon River, Xi added.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Jin Sheping commentary, which argues that the leadership's -confidence in achieving the expected target of around 5% is increasing-. This was the assessment made during the Q3 economic data press conference by the NBS, as per the article. -5%。---，. The article later adds that -in general, ‘stability' and ‘progress' are still the main themes of China's economy. On the one hand, the foundation of stability is more solid. The four major macroeconomic indicators of growth, employment, inflation, and balance of payments show that the overall economic operation is stable and steady. ‘These provide a good foundation for China's macroeconomic resilience', said Fan Zhiyong, professor of the School of Economics at Renmin University of China. On the other hand, the momentum of progress is increasing. The growth rate of high-tech industry investment and high-tech manufacturing added value is significantly ahead of the overall level. The more high-tech, high-efficiency, and high-quality industries are, the better the development will be.- ，----。，。、、、、，-。-。，。。、、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily The rest of the article discusses certain policy changes that have been implemented, such as allowing borrowers to negotiate with banks independently and adjust mortgage interest rates dynamically, the pursuit of the ‘two-heavy/priorities' (implementation of major national strategies and capacity building for security in key areas) and ‘two new' (large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in for new consumer goods), pursuit of enacting the private economy promotion law, and capital market opening, etc. It ends with a call for renewed confidence.

Sergei Shoigu, secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, will attend these meetings, with Wang Yi and Chen Wenqing, respectively, chairing from the Chinese side. Meanwhile, there's a very brief report informing that ILD chief Liu Jianchao met with Dmitry Mironov, aide to the president of the Russian Federation in Beijing on Monday. The report says that the two sides held in-depth discussions on implementing the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepening exchanges between counterpart departments, enhancing the exchange of governance experience, and promoting the development of China-Russia relations.

China -highly appreciates Italy's sense of responsibility in protecting cultural heritage and promoting the return of lost relics to countries of origin-, the foreign ministry said. Finally, there's a piece with comments from Mohammed A. Al Ajlan, Chairman, Saudi-Chinese Business Council, looking ahead at the G20 summit in Brazil. He -believes that in recent years, the contribution of emerging market countries and developing countries, including Saudi Arabia and China, to world economic growth has been continuously rising, and they have become an important force driving global economic growth and promoting stable development. Developing countries continue to strengthen South-South cooperation, actively voicing the Global South perspective in global governance, and promoting solutions to global issues with Global South initiatives. ‘Through enhanced communication, increased mutual trust, and united cooperation, developing countries are becoming an important force in improving global governance'.- ，，、，、。，，。-、、，。-. He added that -Saudi Arabia and China are both Global South countries and are both important forces in maintaining world peace and regional stability…- and then he said that: -Chinese-style modernization not only benefits the Chinese people, but also promotes the common development of all countries. ‘China adheres to the path of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and insists on better maintaining world peace and development through its own development.' In Ajlan's view, China's economy is resilient, has great potential and is full of vitality. By continuously optimizing its industrial structure, China will bring more positive energy to the stable development of the world economy. ‘On the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results, China is conducting positive interactions with other countries.

The M2 growth rate continued to pick up, demonstrating the country's greater efforts in maintaining stable economic growth, analysts said. The M1, which covers cash in circulation plus demand deposits, stood at 63.34 trillion yuan at the end of October, down 6.1 percent year on year.

The author calls the new laws -evil- and claims that this is because they: are a serious infringement on China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are a violation of international law and the norms of international relations under the banner of implementing international law impact the freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea threaten regional peace and stability aggravate the complexity of the situation in the South China Sea ，，，，，. Subsequently, too, the article calls them -thoroughly evil laws- and argues that -China's adoption of necessary measures to protect its own sovereign rights and interests is reasonable and legal, and is a legitimate action to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.-t，. The author argues that the laws attempt to -embed the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case in the form of domestic legislation.- -China has sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, and over the Zhongsha Islands including Huangyan Island and their adjacent waters, and has sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters. China's above-mentioned territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests have sufficient historical and legal basis and are in line with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The territorial scope of the Philippines is determined by a series of international treaties and has never included China's Huangyan Island and any islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands. For a long time, the Philippines has illegally occupied many islands and reefs of China's Nansha Islands; it has arbitrarily exceeded its own territorial scope and established the so-called ‘Kalayaan Island Group', infringing on China's territorial sovereignty, which is illegal and invalid. The Philippines' insistence on promoting the legislation of the so-called ‘Philippine Maritime Zones Act' has once again exposed the Philippines' real purpose of attempting to steal its illegally obtained gains in the South China Sea by manipulating domestic law, reflecting its ambitions for expansion in the South China Sea.- --，。、，。，《》。，。，；，--，，、。--，，，. The violation of international law argument is that -the so-called ‘Philippine Maritime Zones Act' uses the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case as one basis for the Philippines to delineate its maritime boundaries. This is akin to using an utter lie to cover up a lie and a fallacy to cover up a fallacy.- --，，. Basically, the argument is that the arbitration was illegal so it cannot be used as a basis for anything. -The Philippines' endorsement of its provocative actions based on the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case cannot conceal its illegal claims and actions of ‘expanding authority' in the South China Sea.- ，--. The next bit says that: -The evil of these evil laws lies in their impact on the freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea, threatening regional peace and stability, and intensifying the complexity of the South China Sea situation. The Philippines' ‘Two Laws' violate the provisions of the ‘Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' regarding ‘exercising self-restraint and not taking actions that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability', which not only does not help resolve disputes but will further intensify contradictions. The so-called ‘Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act' contains multiple points that contradict international law regulations and International Maritime Organization resolutions. For example, the designated sea lanes do not include all commonly used international passages within Philippine archipelagic waters. This is inconsistent with the provisions of the UNCLOS that ‘all normal channels used for international navigation or overflight through or over archipelago waters should be included'. Moreover, all designated sea lanes are adjacent to U.S. military bases in the Philippines, and it cannot be ruled out that the Philippines is colluding with external countries to monitor passing vessels and threaten the navigational safety of all countries. The Philippine side's use of domestic law to exceed the scope authorised by international law, illegally restricting other countries' legitimate rights, has no binding force on other countries, including China. China demands that the Philippine side effectively comply with international law and not harm the legitimate rights enjoyed by all parties under international law, including the UNCLOS. Chinese vessels will continue to navigate in relevant waters and sea lanes in accordance with international law.- ，，，。--《》-，、-，，。--。，，《》--，，，，。，，。，《》。. Towards the end, the article says that -Huangyan Island is China's inherent territory. The Chinese government's delimitation and announcement of the territorial sea baselines of Huangyan Island, based on international law including the UNCLOS and the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, is a normal measure taken by the Chinese government to strengthen maritime management according to law, which complies with international law and international practice, and demonstrates China's firm determination and will to protect its rights. Regarding maritime disputes, China has always maintained high restraint and advocates seeking mutually acceptable solutions in the spirit of good-neighbourliness and friendship, respecting historical and legal facts. However, goodwill must not be abused. China does not accept any attempt to impose maritime jurisdiction on China through unilateral actions, nor does it recognize any actions that harm China's maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. 。《》《》，，，，。，，，，。，，. The article ends by calling on the Philippines to -immediately stop taking any unilateral actions that may lead to the escalation of disputes and the complication of the situation, return to the right track of properly resolving differences through negotiations and consultations as soon as possible…- There's also a report on MoFA's comment attacking the US on this issue. Li Jian said: -Over the years, for the sake of its geopolitical agenda, the US has been instigating the Philippines to engage in acts of infringement and provocations in the South China Sea, as if the area needed any more instability. This vicious intention is so clear for all to see. While urging other countries to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the US refuses to join it, which fully reveals its hypocrisy and double standards. The South China Sea arbitration in itself violates UNCLOS and is a political farce through and through, and the so-called arbitral award is illegal, null and void.- Share Tracking People's Daily A couple of other questions from the MoFA presser: -Reuters: Over the weekend, a joint statement between China and Indonesia said both sides -reached important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims.- Indonesia's foreign ministry said today that the country does not recognize China's -nine-dash line- claims over the South China Sea despite striking a joint development deal with China. Does China view this -important common understanding- as an acknowledgement by Indonesia of China's claims to parts of Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone? Lin Jian: China's sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea are solidly grounded in history and the law. They were established in the long course of history and are consistent with international law and practices. As early as 1948, the Chinese government officially released the dotted line and reaffirmed its sovereignty and relevant rights in the South China Sea. China attaches great importance to signing the cooperation document on maritime joint development with Indonesia and stands ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries so that the cooperation results can benefit the two countries and two peoples as soon as possible. Reuters: Following the recent attacks on Chinese nationals in Pakistan, has the concern for the security of Chinese citizens increased in Pakistan? If so, what are the concerns? Is Beijing satisfied with the security protocols for its nationals and projects in Pakistan? Lin Jian: China reiterates that terrorism is a common enemy of humanity. It's the shared responsibility of the international community to fight terrorism and prevent tragedies from happening again. China will continue to support Pakistan in fighting terrorism. We are firm in our commitment to protecting the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and institutions overseas. China and Pakistan have the resolve and capability to foil any attempt to harm China-Pakistan relations and ensure that terrorists will pay the price. China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. Our iron-clad friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. Attempts to undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries will not succeed. China will continue to support Pakistan in developing its economy and society and improving people's life. We will firmly carry out cooperation with Pakistan in various fields for the benefit of the two peoples.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

PLAAF's 75th Anniversary - Ren Ping Article on Economy: 'Pain of Transformation Cannot be Avoided or Circumvented' - China Delimits Scarborough Shoal	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 11, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF. The article says that: -Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on strengthening the military, the PLAAF has accelerated the pace of transformation and construction, firmly and consciously obeyed the Party's command, deepened training and preparation for war/combat-readiness, accelerated the construction of new combat forces, and written a new chapter in the journey of strengthening and rejuvenating the military.- ，，，，，. The piece talks about changes in combat training, the induction of new weapons systems, and the spirit of heroes. I am sharing one section below: -From radar stations on sea islands to ground air defence troops, tens of thousands of air force personnel maintain full-time combat readiness duties every day; for aerial rights protection and air defence identification zone control, just one aviation brigade conducts hundreds of combat takeoffs annually; the ‘sky net' woven by fighters, missiles, and radars continues to extend ... The People's Air Force marches toward war, striving to forge an air force that comes when called, fights when it comes, and wins when it fights. Chairman Xi has emphasized: ‘We must strengthen actual combat preparation, firmly establish the concept of training to prepare for war and leading troops to cultivate a mindset of preparing for war, firmly establish the mindset of being ready for war at any time, firmly establish the mindset of winning wars under existing conditions, strictly implement various combat readiness systems, maintain a constant and unremitting state of combat readiness, ensure that situations can be dealt with quickly and effectively, and resolutely complete various military struggle tasks shouldered by the air force. Since the 18th Party Congress, the Air Force Party Committee has resolutely implemented the important instructions and requirements of Chairman Xi, always insisted on preparing for war as the top priority, firmly established combat effectiveness as the only fundamental standard, and continuously expanded training content and innovated training methods, and the combat effectiveness of the troops ‘shifting gears and speeding up'. Adhere to the integration of combat to training in order to improve training levels. Continuously increase the proportion of adversarial air combat, far seas operations, long-range mobility and other subjects. Training in high-altitude regions, venturing into open seas, and flying along borders has become routine. Mass training competitions like ‘airborne elite' and ‘maintenance elite' becoming increasingly aligned with real combat scenarios. Adhere to scientific and technology-driven training to deepen capability generation.

It also talks about PLAAF's role in diplomacy, providing humanitarian aid to Maldives and Nepal along with -70 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania-. Global Times' article talks about the weapons that we can expect to see during the Zhuhai Airshow. These include the J-35A medium-sized stealth fighter, the HQ-19 surface-to-air missile weapon system and a new attack reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle. The report adds: -The PLA Air Force will bring 36 types of equipment for aerial flight demonstrations and ground static displays to showcase the development of its equipment in a comprehensive and close-up manner…- It quotes expert Fu Qianshao as saying that the HQ-19 -is comparable to the US-made THAAD weapon system. The THAAD weapon system can intercept hostile ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, and intercept targets at the upper levels of the atmosphere. The US relies on the Patriot air defense weapon system at the lower levels. ‘The HQ-9B and HQ-19 have formed a similar system, capable of intercepting the middle and end of the missile in outer space, the upper atmosphere and the lower atmosphere. The official debut of the HQ-19 marked the construction of the PLA Air Force integrating air and space, both offensive and defensive, making significant achievements, and reaching a new level'.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Ren Ping commentary on the state of the economy. Brief note: I thought that this was really useful to read to get a sense of the argument that the central leadership is making for its agenda. There clearly is a deep sense of concern about the state of affairs, but also evident is the willingness to stay the course. It's a timely reminder that the goal remains high-quality development and focussing on transforming the development model, emphasising technology-driven growth. It is also worth noting that the external environment is listed as the first in the list of challenges that China's economy faces. Anyway, the piece begins by accepting that GDP data for the first three quarters has not been the greatest. It acknowledges that -the year-on-year economic growth rates of 5.3%, 4.7% and 4.6% have shown a downward trend. Looking at the third quarter alone, the growth rates of major economic indicators in July and August fell. As a result, there are doubts about the prospects for economic growth and the completion of annual goals and tasks.- ，5.3%、4.7%、4.6%，。，7、8。、. But it argues that -in the first three quarters, China's economy grew by 4.8% year-on-year, ranking among the top growth rates of major world economies. Although certain economies have relatively higher growth rates, their economic scale and increase are not in the same league as ours. More importantly, we have maintained reasonable growth in quantity on the premise of structural optimization, momentum transformation, and quality improvement. Looking around the world, ‘the scenery is still uniquely beautiful on this side'.- ，。，4.8%，；，。，、、。，--. Subscribe now The author then identifies four key problems facing the Chinese economy: First, the external environment has become more complex and severe. Global economic instability is rising, international political uncertainty is increasing, global trade protectionism is intensifying, and some countries are escalating containment and suppression efforts, increasing the pressure on China to stabilise foreign trade and investment. Second, domestic demand remains sluggish. Residents' capacity and willingness for consumption remain weak, there are challenges in investment stabilisation, and the vitality of private investment requires further stimulation. Third, some enterprises are facing operational difficulties, including weak sales, declining profitability, and weakening market expectations. Fourth, there are many risks and hidden dangers in some fields. Some regions have great difficulty in debt repayment, some local governments are facing fiscal challenges, some enterprises are laying off employees and cutting salaries, employment pressure for a younger demographic, such as college graduates, has increased, and the income growth rate of urban residents has slowed down. 。，，，，、。。，，。，、、。。，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Yet, the author contends that -the difficulties we are facing now are problems in development and pains in transformation, which can be completely overcome through hard work.- ，、，. To support this argument, the author says that policy measures that have been announced this year are finally having an effect. -Since September, increasingly, there have been positive changes in economic operations in the fields of industry, consumption, investment, stock market, and real estate market. Market confidence has enhanced, social expectations have improved, and the growth rates of many economic indicators have rebounded. In general, we have withstood downward pressure, overcome difficulties and challenges, maintained the development trend of stable economic operation, structural adjustment and optimization, and continuous improvement of people's livelihood, and the trend of economic performance shifting from bottoming out to subsequently stabilising and then moving towards recovery is becoming more evident. With the continued effectiveness of existing policies, the accelerated implementation of new policies, and the combined effects of these policies being released, positive factors and favourable conditions will continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, the economy is highly likely to show an upward trend, and the annual economic growth target is expected to be achieved. 。9，、、、，，，。，、，、、，。，，，，，。 In the next section, the author calls for calm in the face of -normal fluctuations- and highlights the -structural adjustment- that is taking place. The article states that in the first three quarters of this year, the proportion of the service industry as part of GDP increased by 0.3 percentage points compared with the same period last year. Its contribution rate to economic growth reached 53.9% Investment in high-tech industries increased by 10.0% year-on-year, with the growth rate being 6.6 percentage points higher than that of total investment, maintaining double-digit growth for 7 consecutive months the growth rate of investment in equipment and tools was 13 percentage points higher than that of total investment investment in technological transformation of manufacturing industry increased by 9.5% the output and export of integrated circuits increased by 26% and 22% year-on-year, respectively the output and export of new energy vehicles increased by 31.7% and 12.5% ​​year-on-year, respectively ，。，GDP0.3，53.9%；10.0%，6.6，7，。，。，13，9.5%；、26%、22%；、31.7%、12.5%……，. The piece then argues that -the favourable conditions for China's economic development, such as a solid foundation, strong resilience and great potential, have not changed. China still enjoys advantages such as a super-large market, a complete industrial system, strong supporting capabilities and large growth space. At the same time, its economy is in a critical period of structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading. From the transformation of the development model to the optimization of industrial structure, the transformation of development quality and the transformation of development momentum, cyclical and structural challenges are intertwined. The pain of transformation cannot be avoided or circumvented.- 、、，，、、。，、，，、、，，、. Leave a comment It adds: -At times like this, we must be all the more determined to press forward despite difficulties and forge new achievements. We must unswervingly follow the path of high-quality development, and we must not abandon or retreat just because of challenges, nor fall back into the old habit of pursuing inefficient, extensive growth. Fundamentally speaking, the key to breaking the ‘bottleneck' that restricts China's economic development lies in scientific and technological innovation. The key to Chinese-style modernization lies in scientific and technological modernization. To achieve high-quality development, we must rely on scientific and technological innovation to cultivate new momentum. The ‘2024 Global Innovation Index Report' released recently shows that China is one of the economies with the fastest growth in innovation in the past 10 years, and innovative development is showing strong momentum and broad prospects. We must also recognize that China's technological development is at a critical stage—strong but not yet robust; it will regress if it does not advance. Some key core technologies are controlled by others, and there is a shortage of top scientific and technological talents. The process of moving from a large science and technology country to a strong science and technology country will inevitably encounter various obstacles and containment. Scientific and technological innovation cannot be achieved overnight; building it into a powerful force for development requires persistent, long-term effort. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasised: ‘We must further enhance our sense of urgency, intensify efforts in scientific and technological innovation, and seize the commanding heights of technological competition and future development'. He has encouraged researchers to embrace the spirit of ‘how many times can one truly fight in life' in order to innovate and create freely. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee proposed ‘building a comprehensive system and mechanism to support innovation.' Reforms that integrate the systems for education, science, technology, and talent are being implemented with urgency. Last year, China's R&amp;D investment exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan for the first time, ranking second in the world. Winning the battle of key and core technologies is neither something to rush nor something to delay. We must maintain strategic resolve and continue our efforts persistently. With time, we are certain to overcome ‘chokepoint' issues and firmly seize the initiative in development. ‘As long as the path is right, distance is not to be feared'.- ，、，，、，、。，--，。，。《2024》，10，。，、，，。，。，。，-，，-，-‘'，-。《》--，。R&amp;D3.3，。，，，，，，--，。-，.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two brief reports to note.

China & Indonesia add Security Pillar to Ties - Breakdown of China's Foreign Trade Data - Understanding the 10 Trillion Debt Package - China-Philippin...	Hi folks, A lot has happened over the weekend in the China news space. So, I am doing a special newsletter today, covering key developments. Regards, Manoj Let's begin with Xi Jinping's meeting with visiting Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto in Beijing. Xinhua reports: -Xi noted that Prabowo visited China in his first overseas trip right after he was elected in March and chose China as the first country to visit after taking office, which speaks volumes about the great importance he attaches to developing relations with China and demonstrates the high level and strategic nature of China-Indonesia relations. Xi went on to point out that the adherence to strategic autonomy, mutual trust, mutual assistance, win-win cooperation, fairness and justice represents not only a summary of the experience in developing bilateral ties over the past decades, but also an important principle that should be followed for ensuring the sustained and stable development of bilateral relations in the future. China is willing to work with the new Indonesian government to build on past achievements, promote building a community with a shared future with regional and global influence, and continue to write a new chapter of seeking self-improvement via solidarity, and boosting coordination and mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation among major developing countries, said Xi.- -Xi stressed that the two sides should consolidate higher-level strategic mutual trust, increase high-level exchanges and cooperation between governments and legislative bodies and at the sub-national level, strengthen exchanges of governance experience, firmly support each other in exploring modernization paths suited to their national conditions, and firmly support each other in upholding respective core interests and major concerns. Xi called on the two sides to further improve the layout of strategic cooperation and foster cooperation regarding the ‘five pillars' of politics, economy, people-to-people and cultural exchange, maritime affairs and security. Xi urged the two sides to deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, continue to operate well the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, advance cooperation on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the ‘Two Countries, Twin Parks' project, strengthen cooperation in such areas as digital economy, advanced manufacturing and the circular economy, carry out joint maritime development, and continuously deepen all-round mutually beneficial cooperation. China is also ready to work with Indonesia to build more projects for the benefit of the people, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in poverty reduction, medicine, grain cultivation and fisheries, provide support for the training of scientific personnel and the development of vocational education in Indonesia, and introduce more facilitation measures to expand personnel exchanges, Xi said.- -This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the next year marks the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference, Xi noted, adding that as major developing countries, emerging markets and major members of the Global South, China and Indonesia should jointly champion the Asian values featuring peace, cooperation, inclusiveness and integration, enrich the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit with the imperatives of the new era, lead countries in the Global South to unite and strengthen themselves, and steer global governance in a fairer and more equitable direction. China is ready to carry out closer multilateral strategic coordination with Indonesia, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and inclusive economic globalization that benefit all, and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability, Xi said.- Prabowo said that China is a -great country-. He added that -under the complex and volatile international situation, Indonesia hopes to work with China to further strengthen all-round strategic coordination, become closer comprehensive strategic partners, and build a community with a shared future that has regional and global influence.- He also referenced -joint maritime development- as part of his agenda. In addition, Xinhua English reports that Jakarta backs the -one-China principle- but PD reports that Prabowo talked about or one-China policy. That said, PD's report also says that Prabowo told Xi that -Indonesia fully supports the Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue- and -firmly supports the Chinese government's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and achieve national reunification.- ，，、. The joint statement below settles this debate rather definitively, I would say. He added: -Xinjiang-related affairs are entirely China's internal affairs. Indonesia adheres to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and firmly supports China's efforts to maintain development and stability in Xinjiang.- He -thanked China for upholding justice and fairness on the Palestinian issue. Indonesia adheres to independence and self-reliance, adheres to an independent and non-aligned foreign policy, will not join any military alliance or ‘exclusive bloc' against a third party, supports the three major global initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping, and is willing to communicate and cooperate closely with China within multilateral frameworks such as the G20, and make positive efforts to safeguard the common interests of the Global South, promote world multipolarization, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- ，，。。，，--，，，、、.

Share Tracking People's Daily Earlier, late on Friday, the NPCSC meeting ended with some important announcements. First, Xinhua reports that: Chinese lawmakers approved a State Council bill on raising the ceiling on local government debt by 6 trillion yuan (about 840 billion U.S. dollars) to replace existing hidden debts. Under the new arrangement, the debt ceiling for special local government debt will be increased to 35.52 trillion yuan from 29.52 trillion yuan by the end of 2024. Also starting from 2024, China will set aside 800 billion yuan from each year's new special-purpose bonds for local governments for five consecutive years, thereby providing debt relief to replace 4 trillion yuan of hidden debts, according to Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an. The new measures will add a combined 10 trillion yuan to China's debt relief resources. Meanwhile, the 2 trillion yuan of hidden debts resulting from housing improvement projects in run-down areas due by 2029 and beyond will be paid in accordance with the original contracts. As a result, the amount of hidden debts that China's local governments need to deal with by 2028 is expected to drop from 14.3 trillion yuan to 2.3 trillion yuan. Share Tracking People's Daily The explanation issued along with this decision states that: -As of the end of 2023, the balance of local government hidden debts nationwide was 14.3 trillion yuan. According to the preliminary calculation of GDP of 126.06 trillion yuan in 2023, the national government debt ratio (debt balance/GDP) after considering statutory government debts and hidden debts is 67.5%. Since 2024, affected by factors such as changes in the external environment and insufficient domestic demand, the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure has become prominent, tax growth has fallen short of expectations, and land transfer income has dropped sharply, creating a gap from previous expectations in various regions regarding debt resolution resources, increasing the difficulty of addressing outstanding implicit debts. At present, local debt reduction work is at a critical stage. In order to ensure the completion of the goal of resolving the existing hidden debts of local governments, the State Council has proposed to increase the local government debt limit to replace the existing hidden debts. On September 25, the Politburo Standing Committee discussed and agreed in principle to the ‘Report on the Arrangements for Relating to Increasing the Local Government Debt Limit to Replace the Existing Hidden Debts' by the Party Group of the State Council.- 2023，14.3。2023（GDP）126.06，（/GDP）67.5%。2024，，，，，，。，，，。925，《》. The explanation then recommends increasing the local government debt limit by 6 trillion yuan to replace the existing hidden debt. It adds that this decision: Does not increase the overall burden of government debt and does not change the local debt repayment responsibility Considering the interest rate difference between implicit debt and statutory government debt, it is estimated that accumulated interest payment savings of about 400 billion yuan can be achieved Promote the solution of various local ‘triangle debt' problems, boost the confidence of business entities, and reduce the bad debt losses of financial institutions Support local governments in unloading burdens and move forward lightly, reverse the predicament of existing debt excessively occupying fiscal resources, free up more funds to solve grassroots ‘three guarantees' and economic development bottleneck problems, optimize government investment layout, and promote high-quality development. ，，；，4000；--，，；、，，--，，. Subscribe now In terms of implementation, the document makes three points: First, the State Council submitted a proposal to the NPCSC for approval to increase the local government debt limit by 6 trillion yuan, which will be implemented over three years. Second, the allocation will be completed in one go to stabilise policy expectations. Based on the scale of local government implicit debt, debt limits will be allocated according to a unified national proportion, reflecting policy fairness and forming stable debt reduction expectations. Third, arrange special debt limits and clarify the use of funds. To facilitate operation and realise policy effects as early as possible, the entire 6 trillion yuan will be arranged as special debt limits, allowing localities to use it for replacing various types of implicit debt within the monitoring scope. Under this arrangement, by the end of 2024, the local government special debt limit will increase from 29.518508 trillion yuan to 35.518508 trillion yuan. ，。6，。，。，，，，。，。、，6，。，2024295185.08355185.08.

It also encouraged efforts to promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, the establishment of overseas smart logistics platforms, green trade, trade activities in border regions, as well as repair services for overseas goods in comprehensive bonded zones, adding that negotiations with more countries on signing mutual visa-free treaties will be continued.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, China reacted rather strongly to the Philippines' new ‘Maritime Zones Act' and ‘Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act'. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Philippines ambassador to express its objection to the two new laws. issued a lengthy statement, saying: The Philippine Maritime Zones Act essentially -attempts to enshrine the illegal award of the South China Sea arbitration in the form of domestic legislation. China strongly condemns and firmly rejects this as the move gravely infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall by no means be affected by the enactment of the Act.- -The Philippines' attempt to whitewash its illegal claims and actions in the South China Sea by adopting the Maritime Zones Act in the name of implementing UNCLOS is illegal and invalid. The Act seriously violates the DOC and will inevitably complicate the situation in the South China Sea. China will firmly respond to any infringement or provocative actions taken by the Philippine side in the South China Sea citing the Act as the ground.- -Many provisions contained in the Philippines' Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act are incompatible with international law and resolutions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Chinese side demands that the Philippine side earnestly abide by international law and refrain from undermining the legitimate rights of all parties under international law, including UNCLOS.- This paragraph, in particular, is remarkable. China is telling the Philippines how treaties signed by erstwhile colonial powers define its territories. -The territory of the Philippines is defined by a series of international treaties, including the 1898 Treaty of Peace Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain (the Treaty of Paris), the 1900 Treaty Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain for Cession of Outlying Islands of the Philippines (the Treaty of Washington), and the 1930 Convention Between His Majesty in Respect of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States Regarding the Boundary Between the State of North Borneo and the Philippine Archipelago. The Philippines' territory so defined has nothing to do with China's Huangyan Dao and Nansha Qundao. The Philippines has invaded and illegally occupied Mahuan Dao, Feixin Dao, Zhongye Dao, Nanyao Dao, Beizi Dao, Xiyue Dao, Shuanghuang Shazhou and Siling Jiao of China's Nansha Qundao, and by doing so has seriously violated international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. It broke its own promise and kept a warship illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao of China's Nansha Qundao for decades, thus infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty and violating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), especially its Article 5 which asks the parties to refrain from action of inhabiting on the uninhabited islands and reefs. Once again China urges the Philippines to immediately withdraw all its personnel and facilities from the aforementioned islands and reefs and immediately tow away the warship illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao. The establishment of the so-called -Kalayaan Island Group- beyond its own territorial scope by the Philippines infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty, and is illegal and invalid.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Meets Anwar Ibrahim - Zhong Sheng & Xinhua Commentaries on US Ties - Shi Taifeng Meets Private Entrepreneurs - China's Journalism Awards - GMS Summ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, November 08, 2024. Page 1: The lead story is about Xi Jinping's meeting with Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim in Beijing. Xinhua reports: -Noting that China and Malaysia are good neighbors, good friends and good partners, Xi said the two countries have maintained close interactions and exchanges at all levels and advanced mutually beneficial cooperation with high quality on all fronts since Anwar's first China visit in March last year after taking office as prime minister, delivering tangible benefits to the two peoples. China and Malaysia are both at crucial stages of national development and rejuvenation, Xi said. ‘The two sides should take the celebration of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the China-Malaysia Year of Friendship as an opportunity to work together for a more concrete China-Malaysia community with a shared future, to help each other achieve their development goals, and to make new and greater contributions to regional prosperity and stability,' said Xi.- PD has more details in the next few paragraphs: -Xi urged the two sides to develop a high-level strategic partnership, continue to maintain close high-level exchanges, deepen exchanges on experience of governance, enhance political mutual trust, and firmly support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns. China supports Malaysia's adherence to strategic autonomy and its choice of a development path suited to its own national conditions. Both sides should strengthen the alignment of development strategies, deepen all-round mutually beneficial cooperation, and continue advancing high-quality BRI cooperation. They should jointly implement flagship projects like the ‘Two Countries, Twin Parks', create new growth points in areas like the digital economy, artificial intelligence, and new energy, and explore mechanisms for poverty reduction cooperation. Malaysia is encouraged to leverage the platform of the China International Import Expo to introduce more high-quality Malaysian products to the Chinese market. China is willing to deepen exchanges and cooperation with Malaysia in higher education, culture, tourism, youth, and local interactions, tightening the bond of friendship between the two peoples. Both sides should advocate for diverse and harmonious coexistence of civilizations, promoting an Asian value system centred on peace, cooperation, inclusiveness, and integration, and encouraging the mutual learning and development of Chinese and Islamic civilizations.- ，，，，，。，。，，--，--，、、，。，。、、、、，。、，、、、，. Xi Jinping pointed out that the world today is intertwined with changes and turmoil, entering a new period of turbulent transformation. As important representatives of developing countries and emerging economies in Asia, China and Malaysia should strengthen communication and cooperation on international and regional issues, firmly support each other, jointly oppose protectionism, promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, advocate an equal and orderly world multipolarization, inclusive and inclusive economic globalisation, promote the reform and improvement of the global governance system, and safeguard international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries. China supports Malaysia's work as the rotating chair of ASEAN next year, supports ASEAN's central position and strategic autonomy, and maintains the mainstream of regional development cooperation. ，，。，，，，，、，，。，，. Anwar said that President Xi Jinping proposed important concepts, such as building a community with a shared future for mankind, advocated tolerance and mutual learning among different civilizations, and put forward high-level opinions and suggestions on leading and promoting the ‘BRICS+' cooperation, which reflected his deep feelings and wisdom for the progress of human civilization and the interests and well-being of the people, and represented the common aspirations and voices of the Global South. The Malaysian side expressed appreciation and support for President Xi Jinping's vision and initiatives. The Malaysian government is committed to further deepening its comprehensive strategic partnership with China and strengthening cooperation in information technology, digital economy, energy and other fields. The Malaysian side admires China's amazing achievements in poverty reduction and looks forward to learning from China's experience in state governance. Malaysia and China share the same ideas and similar positions on many major international and regional issues. Malaysia adheres to strategic autonomy and is willing to work closely with China in multilateral cooperation to maintain regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- ，，，-+-，，。。，、、。，。、，，，. Subscribe now Next, there's a brief report on Xi's congratulatory call to Donald Trump, which I covered yesterday. There's also a brief report on Xi's congratulatory message to Maia Sandu on her reelection as president of Moldova. And to complete the congratulatory trifecta, there's a brief report on Xi's message to the inaugural World Conference of Classics. Xinhua says: -with the theme ‘Classical Civilizations and the Modern World', the conference opened in Beijing on the same day. Xi noted that the conference, co-organized by China and Greece, along with the establishment of the Chinese School of Classical Studies in Athens, has created a new platform for civilizational exchange and mutual learning between China, Greece and other nations around the world.- Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's remarks at the eighth Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit on Thursday. Li put forward four suggestions: First, we should adhere to open cooperation, jointly promote a higher level and larger scale of two-way opening, improve the open regional economic structure, and create a more efficient and dynamic super-large market. We should continue to build a high quality BRI, implement the RCEP with high quality, accelerate the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 Upgrade Protocol, and improve the level of trade and investment facilitation. Second, we should highlight the leading role of innovation, strengthen the coordination of innovation policies, promote the efficient flow of innovation factors, accelerate the transformation and application of innovation results, and support and ensure that innovation cooperation continues to grow in depth and in a more practical manner. We should actively promote the planning, construction and upgrading of regional power grids, deepen cooperation in new energy batteries, automobiles and photovoltaic industries, expand cooperation in emerging fields such as clean energy, intelligent manufacturing, big data, and smart cities, and cultivate and expand new momentum for regional development. Third, we should deepen the construction of integration, deepen the ‘hard connection' of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and ports, strengthen ‘soft connection' in policies, laws, supervision, rules, standards and other fields, strive to improve the convenience of cross-border payments and local currency settlement, actively create more cross-border cooperation demonstration zones, and accelerate the process of regional economic integration. China has decided to issue the ‘Lancang-Mekong Visa' to the five Mekong countries and issue five-year multiple-entry visas to China for eligible business personnel. Fourth, we should maintain close communication and cooperation, practise genuine multilateralism, vigorously promote the coordinated development of the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation with the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the Three Rivers Mechanism, the Mekong River Commission and other mechanisms, and build a good atmosphere of inclusive and mutually reinforcing cooperation. Strengthen cooperation with the UN, the ADB, the AIIB and other institutions, mobilise all forces, and jointly implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ，、，，、。--，《》，—3.0，。，，，，。，、，、、、，。，、、--，、、、、--，、，，。--，5。，，、、，。、、，，2030.

Xinhua reports: Lawmakers -also launched a joint inquiry at the meeting…At the meeting, lawmakers raised questions about incentive mechanisms for the teaching workforce, international exchanges and cooperation, building a modern university system, and advancing law-based university governance, among other topics.- State Councillor Shen Yiqin and the ministers listened to the lawmakers' comments and addressed their questions. -Praising the progress made in the drive to build world-class universities and disciplines, Shen emphasized the need to deepen reforms to unleash the motivation and vitality of universities, enhance resource support to improve development capacity, and provide targeted support for national strategies and high-quality development needs. Presiding over the meeting, Cai Dafeng, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, urged relevant State Council departments to thoroughly study and address the comments and suggestions put forward by lawmakers. He also called for reporting progress to the NPC Standing Committee in a timely and legally compliant manner. About 150 universities and 500 academic disciplines have been included in China's initiative to build world-class universities and disciplines.- More details on this conversation is available on Page 4. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (English report) on Wang Huning's meeting with Esteban Lazo Hernandez, president of Cuba's National Assembly of People's Power, in Beijing. Hernandez also met with Zhao Leji. Xinhua's report on that meeting has more details. It says: -Zhao said China has always placed Cuba in a special position in its external relations, and is willing to deepen political mutual trust and strategic coordination with the country. Zhao thanked Cuba for its firm support on the Taiwan question and other issues concerning China's core interests. He said China supports Cuba firmly in its just struggle against sanctions, blockades and external interference, and will continue providing Cuba with assistance and support within its own capacity. China is ready to strengthen practical cooperation with Cuba in various fields, make good use of coordination mechanisms under the Belt and Road, and deepen cooperation in such fields as agriculture, tourism, sports, biotechnology, clean energy, and information and communication, Zhao said. China is also prepared to translate the high-level political mutual trust between the two countries into further practical cooperation results, he added. The NPC of China is willing to work with Cuba's National Assembly of People's Power to implement the cooperation agreement between the legislative bodies of the two countries, he said. He called on both sides to strengthen coordination and speak with one voice on safeguarding each other's core and major interests, and to undertake dialogue and exchange in the areas of socialist-democracy and rule-of-law development, poverty reduction and public security. The two nations should also promote exchange in the fields of education, culture, youth and media, and consolidate the popular public support for the China-Cuba friendship. Zhao also said that the legislatures of the two countries can promote the exchange of experience in strengthening key legislation areas and improving the quality of legislation. Lazo said that Cuba adheres firmly to the one-China principle, supports the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and is willing to learn from China's experience in reform and opening-up, as well as in party construction…Zhao and Lazo signed a cooperation agreement between their two legislative bodies…- Page 3: Just two reports to note. First, the second meeting of the China-Türkiye Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee mechanism was held in Beijing on Thursday. Zhang Guoqing and Mehmet Şimşek, Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance, co-chaired the meeting. Xinhua reports: -Zhang said that China is willing to work with Türkiye to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, enhance political mutual trust, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and push for in-depth development of China-Türkiye strategic cooperative relations. Şimşek said that Türkiye attaches great importance to developing relations with China, abides by the one-China principle and is willing to deepen exchanges and cooperation with China in various fields.- Second, China and Vietnam confirmed on Thursday that a consulate general of Vietnam will be set up in Chongqing. Li Qiang and Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended a ceremony for the exchange of notes between the two governments on establishing the new consulate general. Xinhua reports that on this occasion, Li said that -China is ready to work with Vietnam to make good use of the steering committee for bilateral cooperation and other dialogue mechanisms to expand trade and investment, and tap cooperation potential in emerging areas such as e-commerce, digital economy and green energy.- He added that -both sides should speed up connectivity through railways, highways and smart ports, promote smooth border trade, and explore the establishment of cross-border economic cooperation zones.- Subscribe now Page 4: With the US elections now done, Zhong Sheng commentaries have returned. Today's article says that: -Promoting the stability, improvement and progress of China-US relations is the right choice to be responsible to history, the people and the world.- -On November 7, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to US President-elect Trump. President Xi Jinping pointed out that a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship is in the common interests of the two countries and the expectation of the international community. It is hoped that the two sides will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find a correct way for China and the United States to get along in a new era, benefiting both countries and the world. President Xi Jinping's congratulatory message reflects the stability and continuity of China's policy toward the United States. As one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, China-US relations should be considered and planned from a broad perspective to bring well-being to the people of the two countries and show responsibility for human progress. Regardless of the changes in the international situation, China consistently develops US-China relations with an attitude of responsibility to history, to the people, and to the world, adhering to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.- 117，。，、、。、、，，，，，，。，。，，，。，、、，、、. -History proves that while US-China relations have experienced ups and downs, they have always progressed forward through twists and turns. Since the ‘ice-breaking' of bilateral relations in 1971, China and the US have worked together to bring tangible benefits to both countries and the world. Mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation are experiences distilled from over 50 years of US-China relations and lessons learned from historical conflicts between major powers, and should be the direction of joint efforts between China and the US. Mutual respect is a basic courtesy in human interactions and the minimum standard for relations between the two countries. Peaceful coexistence is a basic principle of international relations and a bottom line that both major powers must maintain. Win-win cooperation is the trend of the times and should be the foundation of China-US relations.- ，，。1971--，，。、、，50，，。，。，。，. -Win-win cooperation between China and the US is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples and in line with the trend of the times. China's rapid development has benefited from its open cooperation with countries around the world. China's continuous growth has provided the world, including the US, with a driving force for sustained growth and huge market space. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, trade between China and the US has grown more than 200-fold, with bilateral trade accounting for about one-fifth of global trade. Today, China is the third-largest export market for U.S. goods, and the US is China's third-largest trading partner. Over 70,000 US companies invest and operate in China, and exports to China alone support 930,000 US jobs. Last year, 1,920 new US companies were established in China, and 80% of US companies in China plan to reinvest their profits this year. Facts have proved that China-US cooperation has brought tangible benefits to the people of both countries, and the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other.- ，。，。200，1/5。，，，7，93。，1920，。，，. -China and the US advancing mutually beneficial cooperation can create opportunities for both sides to better address their respective challenges and achieve development. Whether in traditional areas like economics, trade, and agriculture, or emerging fields like climate change and artificial intelligence, China and the US share extensive common interests. Under current circumstances, the common interests between the two countries haven't decreased but have increased. China is continuing to promote high-quality development, while the US is focusing on economic revitalization. The space for cooperation between both sides is infinitely vast, and they should be catalysts rather than obstacles to each other's development. China and the US should lengthen their list of cooperation and expand their pie of cooperation, achieving mutual success and win-win benefits. They should focus on the bigger picture and provide a good atmosphere and stable relationship for cooperation.- ，、。、，、，。，，。，，，，。、，、，，. -The international situation continues to be turbulent and volatile, and humanity faces many global challenges, and the world increasingly needs a stable China-US relationship. China and the US should demonstrate the pattern of major powers, take on major power responsibilities, and play the role of major powers. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should become a stable source of world peace and an engine of common development. Over the past year, China-US diplomatic, financial, law enforcement, climate change teams and both militaries have maintained communication, sending positive signals to the world. Currently, whether promoting world economic recovery or resolving international and regional hotspot issues, China-US coordination and cooperation are needed. The strengthening of coordination and cooperation between China and the US on international and regional issues, providing more public goods to the world, can contribute to addressing emerging global challenges.- ，，。，，。，。，、、、，。，，，。，，. (Note: I find this paragraph fascinating. It is incredibly telling of the anxiety in Beijing around what a Trump presidency could bring. It is sending a message to Washington that the stability that was achieved through different dialogue mechanisms under the Biden administration over the last year were positive outcomes and must be maintained. -China and the US will benefit from cooperation, while confrontation will harm both. Suppression and containment cannot solve the problems facing the US. Both sides should strengthen dialogue with mutual respect, manage differences with prudence, promote cooperation in a spirit of reciprocity, and strengthen international coordination with responsibility. China's foreign policy is open and transparent, and its strategic intention is aboveboard, maintaining a high degree of continuity and stability. China will continue to view and handle China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. At the same time, China has interests that must be maintained, principles that must be defended, and bottom lines that must be upheld. Only when both sides move towards each other can they find the correct way for two countries with different civilizations, systems, and paths to peacefully coexist and develop together on Earth in the new era, making their respective contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. The vast Earth is completely capable of accommodating both China and the US to develop individually and prosper together. Promoting US-China relations to stabilise, improve, and move forward is the correct choice that shows responsibility to history, to the people, and to the world.- ，。。，，，。，，。、、。，、、。，、、、，。、。、、，、、. Share Tracking People's Daily In addition to this, there's a Xinhua commentary on the issue. It says: -Getting the China-U.S. relationship right is not optional, but something the two sides must do and must do well. For China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option. It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. China and the United States have different histories and cultures, social systems and development paths. However, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation are the lessons learned from over 50 years of China-U.S. relations and the exchanges between major countries in history, which should be the direction of joint efforts between the two countries. Specifically, mutual respect is the precondition, because interaction sustains only when differences in social and political systems are respected and acknowledged. Peaceful coexistence is the bottom line. That is because conflict and confrontation between two major countries like China and the United States have unimaginable consequences. Win-win cooperation is the goal. When working together, China and the United States can do great things conducive to the two countries and the world. China does not engage in the so-called ‘major-country competition', with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions. The aim is to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, base its efforts on the goal of meeting people's aspirations for a better life, unswervingly pursue reform and opening-up, and promote the building of an open global economy. China's policy toward the United States remains highly consistent and stable. It has consistently perceived and envisioned the China-U.S. relationship in the broad context of the accelerating global transformations unseen in a century. The ultimate goal of maintaining good China-U.S. relations is to enhance the well-being of the people of the two countries and show the responsibility of a major country in promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other's domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China-U.S. interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition. China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other. The successes of China and the United States are opportunities, not challenges, for each other. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together. Differences and contradictions are inevitable, but as long as the two sides can strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, negative factors will be gradually reduced and positive factors accumulated. Thereby, the space for benign interactions in China-U.S. relations will become larger and larger.- Subscribe now Meanwhile, China's Commerce Ministry responded to a question about the possibility of new US tariffs on imports from China and/or actions targeting its tech sector. It said that China -is willing to strengthen communication, expand cooperation and resolve differences with the United States for stable, sound and sustainable development of bilateral economic and trade relations…Under the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, China is willing to work with the United States and bring greater benefits to both countries and the rest of the world.- Do also note this SCMP report. It says that EU leaders are preparing for talks with Trump's transition team. It adds: -High on their wish list will be keeping the tap open for US funds to flow to Ukraine and avoiding scything tariffs on European goods. Brussels has already been told what Trump would expect in return: EU backing for his tough agenda on China. The China demand was made clear during preliminary talks with Republican interlocutors ahead of the election, according to people familiar with the talks, although it is likely to be just one item on a laundry list from a man who showed disdain for EU institutions during his first stint in the White House. For more than a year, the European Commission has been working to ‘Trump-proof' the bloc, which has sore memories of his last term in office, during which he initiated a trade dispute and repeatedly threatened to revoke the American security blanket Europe enjoys. Baskets of carrots and sticks have been prepared, including offers to buy more US energy goods to reduce the gaping trade deficit – and targeted retaliatory tariffs of more than 50 per cent if those offers fail. They have also tried to game out post-election scenarios, ranging from the expected – higher US tariffs on Chinese products – to the far-fetched, such as Trump switching US diplomatic recognition of China from Beijing to Taipei. The broad plans were discussed at a meeting of ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states on Wednesday.- Subscribe now Back to PD, a report informs that from November 5 to 7, a special training course for secretaries of the Party committees of central and state organs to study and implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and promote high-quality development of Party building was held in Beijing. Another report informs that UFWD chief Shi Taifeng spoke at an event held in Beijing for representatives of the private sector to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. The report says: -Shi Taifeng stated that the private economy is a vital force in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and also an important force in participating in and promoting reform. It is hoped that private entrepreneurs will deeply understand and grasp the spirit and major significance of the plenary session from the perspective of the ‘two overall situations', and align their thoughts and actions with the spirit of the plenary session. It is necessary to fully and accurately grasp the reform direction and clear policy orientation clarified by the plenary session, adhere to the ‘two unwaverings' and promote the ‘two healths', strengthen the confidence in reform, strengthen the responsibility for reform, and combine the development of enterprises with the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation. It is necessary to firmly be the supporters and practitioners of further deepening reform and promoting Chinese-style modernization, carry forward the entrepreneurial spirit, actively fulfil social responsibilities, practise a close and clean relationship between government and business, and firmly support the ‘two establishments' and resolutely achieve the ‘two safeguards' with practical actions.- ，，、。--，。，--、--，、，、。、，，，，--、--.

Xi Calls Trump - Xi's Hubei Inspection - Xi's Thought on Social Work - 4th Round of Central Inspections Begin - Why does China Need to Improve Foreign...	Before I get to today's newspaper, Xinhua reports that Xi Jinping called US-president elect Donald Trump today, congratulating him on his electoral win. The report says: -Xi Jinping emphasised that history shows us that cooperation between China and the United States benefits both, while confrontation harms both. A stable, healthy, and sustainably developing China-US relationship aligns with the common interests of both countries and the expectations of the international community. He expressed hope that both sides would uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find a correct way for China and the United States to engage in this new era, benefiting both countries and the world.- ，，、。、、。、、，，，，，，. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, November 07, 2024. Page 1: The big story on the page today is a wrap of Xi Jinping's visit to Hubei province. Xi was accompanied by Wang Menghui, Hubei Party Secretary, and Hubei Governor Wang Zhonglin. He visited Xiaogan, Xianning, and Wuhan. Xi's message was that -Hubei must thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, firmly grasp its mission and tasks in constructing the new development pattern, fully utilize its own advantages, drum up motivation and strive forward with enterprise, persist in long-term efforts and achieve success through good work, strive to take the lead in high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, speed up efforts to build itself into a strategic fulcrum for the rise of the country's central region, and write its own chapter in Chinese-style modernization.- 、、，，，，，、，、，，，. On the 4th, Xi visited an exhibition of ancient bamboo and wooden writing slips from the dynasties of Qin (221-207 BC) and Han (202 BC-AD 220) at a museum in Yunmeng County, the city of Xiaogan. The report talks about the Qin laws being on display, written on the slips, which demonstrate that as early as more than 2,200 years ago, China's ancient legal system was already established. -Xi Jinping listened in detail to explanations on the content of the bamboo slips, their historical and cultural value, and the status of their protection and research. He pointed out that archaeological research must continue to be strengthened, and the level of cultural relics protection should be improved, providing solid support for promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture and enhancing cultural confidence, so as to ensure that the treasures of Chinese civilization are preserved for posterity, benefiting future generations, and inspiring people to continuously strengthen their sense of national pride and confidence.- 、，，，、，、，. On the 5th, Xi visited Jiayu County, the city of Xianning, where he visited a vegetable farm. The key message that he delivered was that -to develop modern agriculture and build an agricultural strength, we must rely on scientific and technological progress, so that science and technology can give agricultural modernization wings to take off. He encouraged local cadres and the masses to take the road of science and technology, the road of quality, and the road of branding, and further improve the vegetable planting industry that enriches the people, enabling more people to increase their income and achieve prosperity.- ，，，。、、，，. Xinhua English summarises the next bit well: -He then traveled to a village in Jiayu to inspect local elderly care facilities and community services. He called for more targeted measures to address public concerns, with a focus on the needs of older people and children.- One of the messages he had was -it is necessary to continue to reduce the burden on the grassroots so that grassroots cadres can spend more time and energy to serve the masses.- Xi visited a villager's home and talked with the family about their livelihood and access to medical and elderly care services. As villagers bid him a fond farewell, Xi said that to advance Chinese modernization, efforts must be made to speed up rural revitalization. He encouraged the villagers to boost the economic returns of specialty industries and make their village more beautiful under the Party's leadership.- In the afternoon, Xi visited the Wuhan Institute of Industrial Innovation and Development. He said that -achieving high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, and developing new quality productive forces, has posed more urgent demands for the integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation. The broad masses of scientific and technological workers and entrepreneurs should enhance their confidence, maintain lofty aspirations, work in coordination, and continuously make achievements in improving the overall effectiveness of the innovation system and building a modernised industrial system.- ，、，。、、，、. On the 6th, Xi heard work reports from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, affirmed the achievements made in Hubei, and put forward clear requirements for the next stage of work.

Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's instructions with regard to promoting high-quality development of social work in the new era. This was delivered by Cai Qi at the Central Social Work Conference, which was held on November 5 and 6. Xi said: Social work is an important part of the work of the Party and the state. It is related to the long-term governance of the Party and the long-term stability of the country, and is to social harmony and stability and the happiness and well-being of the people. Since the new era, the Party Central Committee has made a series of major decisions and arrangements to promote important achievements in social work. At present, China's social structure is undergoing profound changes, especially the rapid development of emerging fields, the emergence of a large number of new economic organisations and new social organisations, and the continuous expansion of the scale of new employment groups. Social work, therefore, faces new situations and new tasks, and must demonstrate new responsibilities and new actions. It is necessary to adhere to the guidance of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the people-centred approach, practise the Party's mass line in the new era, unswervingly follow the path of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics, improve the social work system and mechanism, focus on the Party building across new economic organisations, new social organisations, and new employment groups, and continuously enhance the Party's appeal, cohesion and influence in emerging fields; do well in Party building leading grassroots governance and grassroots political power construction; do well in cohesion and service to the masses, promoting high-quality development of social work in the new era. 、、，，，。，，。，，、，，，。，、，，，，，、、，；；，. Xi Jinping emphasised that doing social work well is the common responsibility of the entire Party. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must shoulder political responsibility, strengthen organisational leadership and overall coordination, ensure that the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements regarding social work are implemented; all regions and relevant departments must take initiative and work in coordination, adhere to managing both industry and Party building, forming strong joint synergy for doing social work well; social work departments must strengthen their own construction, strengthen political responsibility, be brave in practice and exploration, solidly fulfil their duties and responsibilities, making new contributions to comprehensively advancing the building of a strong country through Chinese-style modernization and the great cause of national rejuvenation. ，。（），，；、，，；，，，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily In his remarks, Cai Qi stressed on the significance of Xi's thought. He called on everyone deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, resolutely achieve the Two Safeguards, profoundly grasp the overall requirements for doing social work well in the new era, effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and mission, and strive to create a new situation for social work in the new era. He called to: Take strengthening Party building in emerging fields as the top priority, strengthen overall coordination, adhere to classified guidance, emphasise Party building work in new economic organisations, new social organisations, and new employment groups, advance the coverage of Party organisations and work, and promote the healthy development of emerging fields. Continue to do a good job in party building and reform and development of industry associations and chambers of commerce. Strengthen Party building leading grassroots governance and grassroots political power construction, solve the prominent problem of ‘small horses pulling big carts' ( people being given responsibilities that are way beyond their capacities) in grassroots governance, coordinate the promotion of empowering and reducing burdens for the grassroots. Do a solid job in gathering and serving the masses, adhere to and develop the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, promote the legalisation of petition work, do a good job in collecting people's suggestions, and develop volunteer service.

There's also a front page commentary on this issue. It reiterates the key points I have covered above. It also seemingly coins Xi Jinping Thought on Social Work. This is done by saying that when it comes to social work, Xi has emphasised: -the need to be good at transforming the Party's leadership and the advantages of China's socialist system into advantages in social governance; the need to adhere to social governance for the people the need to unswervingly follow the path of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics the need to innovate the establishment and activities of Party organisations and expand the Party's appeal and cohesion in emerging fields the need to strengthen the Party building of social organisations and streamline the Party building management system of industry associations, societies and chambers of commerce the need to provide ideological guidance and cohesive services for new employment groups the need to vigorously promote Party building to lead grassroots governance the need to focus on the grassroots, strengthen the foundation and consolidate the basic work orientation the need to adhere to and develop the ‘Fengqiao Experience' in the new era the need to promote the legalisation of petition work the need to build a high-quality petition work team that is loyal to the Party, abides by the responsibility of serving the people and is good at mass work, gradually establish a team of professional community workers with excellent quality, and develop and strengthen the Lei Feng volunteer service team.

This is not in the People's Daily today, but I thought it was interesting to cover. The report says: -Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has made a series of major strategic decisions regarding national security from an overall and strategic height, constructing a new security pattern, fully preventing and addressing external risks and challenges affecting our country's national security, achieving comprehensive and historic major accomplishments. We have resolutely defended national interests and national dignity, continuously thwarted attempts by external forces to attack and smear us using issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, epidemic, and human rights. The fight against infiltration, terrorism, and separatism has achieved remarkable results, firmly maintaining national political security, system security, and ideological security. We have forcefully counteracted external forces' interference in the Taiwan issue, establishing or re-establishing diplomatic relations with 11 countries on the basis of the One-China principle. We have firmly safeguarded national maritime rights and interests, steadily promoted the development of border areas and enriched the people, stabilized and consolidated borders, properly handled peripheral security risks, and defended national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have accelerated the construction of overseas interest protection and risk warning and prevention systems, repeatedly implemented emergency protection and evacuation operations for overseas citizens, continuously strengthened security guarantees for jointly building BRI, protecting the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions, and projects overseas. We have maintained the security of food, energy and important resources supply, and the security and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain. We have actively participated in global security governance, strongly supported the important agenda of the United Nations in the field of peace and security, deeply participated in international security cooperation, put forward new concepts and propositions in the field of security, such as the Global Security Initiative, and significantly increased the influence, appeal and shaping power in global security affairs.- ，，，，、。，、、、、、，，、、。，11、。，、，，。，，--，、。、、。，，，，、、。，、、、，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily Then the article makes three points: First, improving foreign-related national security mechanisms requires coordinating external and internal security, responding to risk challenges brought about by the profound changes unseen in a century in the world situation. Currently, the world has entered a new period of turbulent transformation, with rising anti-globalization sentiment, significant increases in unilateralism and protectionism, weak global economic recovery, frequent regional conflicts and turmoil, worsening global problems. In this situation, China's external environment and security landscape have undergone major changes, and external suppression and containment can escalate at any time. History repeatedly proves that security exists when it is fought for, but perishes when sought through weakness and concession. We must develop a struggle spirit, establish and improve peripheral security work coordination mechanisms, improve mechanisms for counter-sanctions, counter-interference, and countering ‘long-arm jurisdiction', improve mechanisms for maintaining maritime rights and interests, firmly withstand and counter extreme external suppression and containment, strictly prevent and severely crack down on hostile forces' infiltration, sabotage, subversion, and separatist activities, fully maintain the Party's leadership and ruling position, maintain the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and defend the core interests of the country. ，，，。，，，、，，，，，。，，。，，、、--，，，、、、，，，. Second, to improve the national security mechanism involving foreign countries, it is necessary to coordinate openness and security in order to serve high-level opening up and the new development pattern. Since reform and opening up, especially since the 18th Party Congress, China's relations with the world have undergone historic changes. China has become the main trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, and the main source of investment for an increasing number of countries. Since 2017, China has maintained its position as the largest goods trading country for 7 consecutive years. In 2023, China's share of global exports reached 14.2%, remaining the largest for 15 consecutive years. China's total overseas assets are huge, and the number of people travelling, working, and studying abroad is huge. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasised that ‘the more open we are, the more we must pay attention to security.' It is necessary to strengthen the system and mechanism for early warning, prevention, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks, deepen international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security, promptly coordinate and deal with major security incidents involving Chinese citizens and institutions, improve the security guarantee system for jointly building BRI, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons overseas, and ensure the security of food, energy resources, and important industrial chain supply chains. ，，，。，。140，，20177，202314.2%，15。，、、。，--。、、，，，--，、，、、。 Third, to improve the national security mechanism involving foreign countries, we must coordinate our own security and common security and promote global security governance. To achieve national rejuvenation, we not only need a stable and united domestic environment, but also a peaceful and stable international environment. It is necessary to continue to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security concept, promote the implementation of GSI, actively participate in global security governance, promote the construction of a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, seek the greatest common divisor of universal security, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind with universal security. ，，，。，。、、、，，，、、，，.

Xi Tells Airborne Corps to 'Strengthen the Awareness of Preparing for War' - Li Qiang's Openness Pitch at CIIE - Li Xi Visits Kenya - Huai Jinpeng on ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 06, 2024. Page 1: Xi Jinping is touring Hebei, where he inspected an airborne corps in the city of Xiaogan. He Weidong accompanied Xi for this. As per the report, Xi said that: The -airborne forces have a special and important role in our military force structure and combat system. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the thought on strengthening the military in the new era, implement the military strategic guidelines of the new era, implement the requirements for the transformation and construction of the air force, comprehensively strengthen military training and war preparedness, comprehensively improve airborne combat capabilities, and strive to build a powerful modern airborne force.- 、、4。，，，，，，，. After the group photo session, Xi Jinping inspected the airborne combat and support equipment, and carefully learned about the typical weapons and equipment, as well as their technical and tactical performance, and listened to the relevant information. Learning that the airborne forces have made positive progress in building their weapons and equipment system in recent years, Xi Jinping was very pleased. He emphasised the need to reinforce the traction of operational requirements (this essentially means using specific operational or combat requirements to be the key factor in the development, acquisition, and deployment of equipment), strengthen the standardisation, serialisation, and generalisation of airborne equipment development and its real combat application, and build a new-type airborne equipment system. ，，，。，。，，、、，. After this, Xi visited the military history museum of the airborne forces. Xi said that this -is a heroic unit with a profound history and outstanding achievements. It experienced a baptism by the smoke of war during the revolutionary war years, demonstrated the national prestige and military might in the Battle of Shangganling during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and has outstandingly completed a series of major tasks during the period of peaceful construction, and has produced a large number of heroic collectives and model individuals. Xi Jinping carefully observed the exhibits and listened attentively to the explanation. He urged everyone to make good use of the advantages of red resources, educate and guide officers and soldiers to carry forward the glorious traditions, and strive to be the successors of heroes in the new era.- ，。、，，，，。，。，，，. Xi then delivered a speech. Xi -emphasised that it is necessary to firmly remember the duties and missions, strengthen the awareness of preparing for war/combat readiness, and grasp the military struggle preparations tightly and solidly. It is necessary to grasp the characteristics and laws of the use of airborne forces in modern warfare, update the thinking and concepts with regard to airborne operations, innovate combat styles and ways of using military forces, and give full play to the unique advantages of the airborne forces. It is necessary to do a good job in basic training and concentrate training efforts to specialise in key and difficult domains, based on complex and challenging conditions, strengthen all-element, system-based, and scenario-driven training, increase the intensity of joint training with other service branches, promote the deep integration of combat and training, and enhance joint command, joint action, and joint support capabilities.- ，。。，，，。，，，。，、、，，，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to implement the concept of ​​system construction, coordinate and strengthen the construction of airborne combat forces, strengthen the development of cadres throughout the chain, solidly promote high-quality development, and build combat capabilities in a systematic manner. It is necessary to strengthen the practical exploration of the construction of new-quality combat effectiveness, use advanced scientific and technological achievements to empower and increase the efficiency of airborne forces, and guide the transformation of the combat effectiveness generation model. It is necessary to focus on achieving the PLA's centennial goal, focus on the core capabilities of airborne operations, implement the various tasks outlined in the 14th FYP, and ensure that the goals that have been set are achieved as scheduled. It is necessary to focus on the current situation and the long-term, strengthen the planning and design of airborne troops, and ensure that the target map, roadmap, and development map. (、、) are scientifically developed. ，，，，，。，，。，，--，。、，，、、. Xi Jinping stressed that we must implement the spirit of the CMC's political work conference, fully leverage the power of political work, and provide a strong political guarantee for the construction of the airborne troops. It is necessary to deepen political training, tighten and enforce political responsibilities for party governance, forge a strong party organisation that is politically steadfast and capable, seriously investigate and address corruption issues and misconduct among officers and soldiers, and ensure that the heroic troops remain pure and glorious at all times. It is necessary to adhere to higher standards and stricter requirements, vigorously strengthen the cultivation of fighting spirit, strengthen practical training and rigorous tempering, and cultivate the unique bravery and courage of airborne troops. It is necessary to implement the requirements of governing the military according to the law and strict military discipline, strictly manage education and training, maintain regular order, and ensure that the troops are highly concentrated/focussed, integrated/unified, and secure and stable. All levels must persist in shifting the focus downward, do a good job of grasping grassroots work and laying a solid foundation, address the difficulties faced by officers and soldiers with utmost enthusiasm, ignite the positive energy of the vast majority of officers and soldiers to unite and forge ahead, and work hard to create a new situation in the construction of the airborne troops. ，，，。，，、，，。、，，，。、，，，。，，，、，.

Xi said that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Botswana relations and stands ready to work with Boko to push the bilateral strategic partnership to a higher level and bring more benefits to the people of the two countries.- Another report covers Xi's congratulatory message to Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu on his election as Fijian president. Xinhua says: -Xi said that Fiji was the first Pacific island country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 49 years ago, the two countries have made substantial progress in their relations, improved the wellbeing of the two peoples and promoted peace, stability and development of the region and the world at large, he said.

Li said that hosting the CIIE is an important measure for China to expand opening up and cooperation, representing China's solemn commitment to the world. If the first CIIE was a one-way invitation from China to the world, then each subsequent edition has become a mutual commitment between China and the world, reflecting the shared aspiration for opening up and cooperation. In today's world, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, the tide of anti-globalization is rising, unilateralism and protectionism are clearly on the rise, and the factors of instability and uncertainty facing the cause of global peace and development are increasing. The more the situation is like this, the more we must adhere to openness, expand openness, and enhance openness, to promote lasting peace, stability, development and prosperity. ，，。2018，，。，，。，，，、，、。，、、，、. Li then made three proposals: First, we should better build consensus on opening up while adhering to the principle of keeping our promises. All parties should jointly adhere to international economic and trade orders and rules and earnestly fulfil multilateral and bilateral economic and trade agreements. China will further expand institutional opening up and actively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, Li said, pledging efforts to implement the strategy for upgrading pilot free trade zones. Second, we should better expand the space for opening up while adhering to mutual benefit and win-win results. All parties should maintain a mindset of achieving success together, create new development space through closer market and resource connections, and adopt methods that are more conducive to innovative cooperation. China is willing to open up its enormous market further, including implementing the unilateral opening up and offering zero-tariff treatment for all tariff lines from the least developed countries and continuously hosting exhibitions such as the CIIE and the Canton Fair, so as to truly turn China's large market into a great opportunity for the world. Third, we should better shoulder the mission of opening up while adhering to the common destiny. China firmly safeguards the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and supports developing countries in sharing more benefits of globalisation. It is willing to continue to closely coordinate and cooperate with all parties in international economic organisations, take the lead in exploring the implementation of the WTO's ‘Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement' and other achievements, and work together to build an open world economy. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain sound, and the Chinese government is capable of promoting steady economic growth and contributing more to global development and the welfare of humanity. 。，。，，。。，，，。，，100%，、，。。，，，《》，。，，、.

I am not covering all the discussions, but do note this from the deliberations on the report on -Double First-Class- construction efforts. Minister of Education Huai Jinpeng presented the report. He said that -in over eight years of ‘Double First-Class' construction, remarkable progress has been achieved. Several universities and disciplines have gradually entered the front ranks of world-class status, and a group of universities and disciplines gradually joined the ranks of world-class institutions, accelerating the formation of a world-class university matrix with Chinese characteristics.- The socialist direction of education has become more firm. The new era university Party building demonstration creation and quality improvement work continues to advance, with 29 ‘Double First-Class' construction universities being recognized as Party building demonstration universities along with 238 benchmark departments; 191 ‘dual leader' teacher party branch secretary workstations have been established. 20 ‘Double First-Class' construction universities were selected for the ‘three-all education' (all staff, all process, all-round) comprehensive reform pilots, solidly promoting the ‘Project for Forging the Souls of the People of the New Era', with professional education and ideological and political education being aligned or moving forward in the same direction. 。，--29、238，--191。20----（、、），--，、.

He added that -the two sides should follow the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, stick to the right direction of improving and developing bilateral relations, and build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. Wang said the Japanese side should establish an objective and rational understanding of China, honor its political commitment on the Taiwan question and earnestly safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations, urging the Japanese side to take concrete actions to implement the important consensus of ‘being each other's cooperation partners rather than threats', and promote the steady and long-term development of bilateral ties.- The two sides reiterated that they will abide by the principles and consensus set out in the four political documents between China and Japan and commit to comprehensively advancing the strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two sides, reaching agreement to maintain high-level intercourse, dialogue and exchanges in various fields, and send more positive signals to the outside world.

Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a combined report on Li Qiang's meetings with the Prime Ministers of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at the sidelines of the CIIE. Xinhua's report on Li's meeting with Kazakh PM Olzhas Bektenov reports Li saying that: -China is ready to work with Kazakhstan to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other on issues concerning each other's core interests, continue to expand mutually beneficial cooperation and bring more benefits to the two peoples. Li pointed out that China is willing to strengthen the docking of development strategies with Kazakhstan, take high-quality Belt and Road cooperation as the guide, continue to expand bilateral trade, consolidate production capacity and investment cooperation, create highlights in energy and mineral cooperation, enhance the level of connectivity and push for more practical results. He called on the two countries to jointly work for the success of the Year of Chinese Tourism in Kazakhstan next year, strengthen cooperation in culture, education, sub-national and other fields, and enhance mutual understanding and amity between the two peoples. China stands ready to coordinate closely with Kazakhstan within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia mechanism, actively implement the three global initiatives, practice genuine multilateralism, safeguard economic globalization and free trade, and promote the development of global governance toward a more just and equitable direction, Li said.- Xinhua's report on the meeting with Uzbek PM Abdulla Aripov says that: -China will work with Uzbekistan to transform those common understandings into concrete actions and cooperation results so as to bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, Li said. China and Uzbekistan should always view their relations from a strategic, long-term perspective, provide firm mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and be trustworthy friends and partners, Li said. The two countries should further align their development strategies, expand economic and trade cooperation, strengthen connectivity infrastructure construction, and build the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway into a flagship project of the Belt and Road cooperation, he said. Li also stressed tapping into cooperation potential in emerging industries such as new energy, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, cross-border e-commerce, 5G and green mining. China stands ready to strengthen cooperation with Uzbekistan in areas such as culture, education, tourism and poverty reduction, and to facilitate the people-to-people exchange, Li said. The two countries should continue to strengthen their coordination and cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia Mechanism, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries and all other developing countries, he added.- Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology holding an event to discuss the pilot program to expand opening-up in value-added telecom services in four designated areas in Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan and Shenzhen.

Page 6: There's a report on the CMC's Political Work Department beginning work to recruit university graduates. The report says that the direct selection and recruitment targets are mainly selected from among fresh science and engineering graduates engaged in ‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines. For specialties urgently needed and in shortage, candidates can also be selected in appropriate numbers from non-‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines, but must be from undergraduate programs that were admitted in the first batch of enrollment. At present, the goal is to have over 800 military (police) officer positions for open recruitment. Share Tracking People's Daily First, Xinhua reports that China on Monday appealed to the WTO against the EU's final ruling of countervailing measures on Chinese electric vehicles. China firmly opposes the final measures of the EU to impose high countervailing duties on Chinese-made EVs, despite a barrage of objections raised by relevant parties, including the governments of EU member states, the industry and the public, said the Ministry of Commerce. To safeguard the development interests of the EV industry and global cooperation on green transformation, China decided to make the appeal to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. The complaint followed China's previous appeal to the organization against the EU's initial anti-subsidy measures for Chinese EVs, according to the ministry. China believes that the EU's ruling, lacking factual and legal basis while violating WTO rules, is an abuse of trade remedy measures and a practice of trade protectionism in the name of countervailing, the ministry's spokesperson noted. China has urged the EU to face up to its own mistakes, immediately correct its illegal practices, and jointly safeguard the stability of the global EV industrial chain and supply chain as well as the overall China-EU economic and trade cooperation, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the EU's incoming trade chief Maros Sefcovic believes that China is the bloc's -most challenging trade partner-. Second, SCMP reports that -a historical drama about Chinese President Xi Jinping's late father, Xi Zhongxun, will be shown on state television from Tuesday – the first time his story has been dramatised for TV. The first episode of Time in the Northwest will make its debut during prime time on CCTV's main channel, according to a trailer aired on Sunday. The series spans 25 years of Xi Zhongxun's life – from 1927 to 1952 – across 40 episodes as he rises from the son of poor farmers in rural Shaanxi province to lead the Communist Party revolution in China's northwest, news website The Paper reported on Sunday. It said the series highlighted Xi Zhongxun's efforts to mobilise support for a revolutionary base in Yanan, Shaanxi, to address ethnic and religious issues in the region, and to drive economic development. The series is set against the backdrop of the failed First United Front – an alliance between the party and the Kuomintang – and the building of the party's revolutionary bases in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.- Third, China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, delivered an interesting speech at the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (MCCI) event in Kolkata recently. Some useful points from that are: Xu's summary of the Modi-Xi meeting: -The two sides reached a series of common understandings, including strengthening communication and cooperation, enhancing strategic mutual trust; holding talks between our foreign ministers and officials at various levels to bring the relationship back to sound and steady development at an early date; making good use of the Special Representatives mechanism on the China-India boundary question, ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas, and find a fair and reasonable settlement; strengthening communication and cooperation in multilateral fora to safeguard the common interests of developing countries.- -This year, the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in India have issued over two hundred and forty thousand visas (240,000 visas), 80% of which were business visas. This shows the vitality of economic and trade exchanges between the two countries.- -Chinese companies have made important contributions to local development and exports. Facts show that China-India commercial exchanges are inseparable. Indian media reported that some electronic, chemical, and renewable energy products still need to be imported from China. Imposing tariffs and restrictions on Chinese products is not conducive to the development of downstream industries and the interests of consumers in India. Indian companies need highly skilled workers from China to install equipment and carry out repairs. The Chief Economic Advisor of the Indian Government also called for more investment from China in the new ‘Economic Survey'.- -China is advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. India has also put forward the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047'. The two countries have the same development goals and broad prospects for cooperation. China wants to develop well for itself, and hopes India will develop well too. No country understands better than China what a great cause it is to enable more than 1.4 billion Indians to live a good life, and how much effort it requires. We would like to work with India to help each other succeed, achieve common development and revitalization, promote the unity and cooperation of the Global South, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- -This September, I met with Chairmen of some of India's leading companies during my visit to Gujarat and Maharashtra. These entrepreneurs have studied the policies proposed by the Third Plenary Session, and are even familiar with important concepts such as ‘new quality productive forces'. I believe that these entrepreneurs pay close attention to the latest developments in China because they think that China's policies will bring new development opportunities to all countries, including India.- Xu then made three proposals: First, he called for closer commercial ties. -India's high-quality products will have broad business opportunities in China. In fact, in Fiscal Year 2024, some products that the Indian industry promoted, such as pepper, iron ore, and cotton yarn have achieved an increase of more than 17%, 160%, and 240% in exports to China. China welcomes more Indian companies to make full use of platforms such as the China International Import Expo to help more Indian high-quality products to be exported to China and share China's development dividends.- (Note: It is worth highlighting that there is no comment from Xu on non-tariff barriers that the Indian side has complained about for a while.) Second, he talked about FDI. -Actively attracting FDI and effectively protecting the rights and interests of foreign enterprises are the reasons behind China's rapid development…By maintaining the stability and continuity of FDI policies, China continues to consolidate the confidence of foreign companies in China. The Third Plenary Session proposed that all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing industry be removed comprehensively, and foreign companies are encouraged to participate in the Chinese upstream and downstream supply chains. Indian companies can enhance ‘Make in India' by ‘investing in China'. At the same time, the industrial structures of China and India are highly complementary. India has a competitive edge in IT, software and biomedicine, while China is seeing rapid expansion in electronic manufacturing and emerging industries. India is in a major drive to improve infrastructure, an area where China has rich experience. Companies of both countries, if connected, will produce an effect of ‘1+1=11'. Such cooperation will help to sustain economic growth in both countries and inject new dynamism into the global economy. The business community hopes that India will lift its restrictions on investment and government procurement against neighboring countries, so as to promote common development of industries and benefit the people of the two nations.- (Note: This is a direct demand from the Chinese side for India to take back the investment scrutiny that began with Press Note 3 in April 2020.) Third, people-to-people engagement. Xu said that -as two large ancient civilizations with a population of over 1.4 billion, relaxing visa restrictions and restarting direct flights will have great significance. It will enhance people-to-people exchanges and bring the relationship between the two nations back to sound and steady development at an early date. In 2024, the number of Chinese outbound tourists is expected to reach one hundred and thirty million. India should not miss this opportunity. Furthermore, China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie industry. During my visit to Mumbai last month, I passed many Bollywood filming locations such as Bandra Fort and ‘Queen's Necklace'. The well-developed film industry in India left a deep impression on me. Indian films, including ‘Dangal' or Wrestling Competition, and ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan' are very popular in China. China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie sector and promote mutual understanding between the two peoples.- (Note: I support this recommendation. Easing visas and restarting direct flights is a no-brainer to me. When it comes to movies and entertainment, I think this is for Beijing to act upon, and I hope Xu will make the case at home. China imposes artificial barriers to limit foreign entertainment content; a lot of this is protectionism in the garb of political control. I agree with Amb. Xu, Beijing must allow for Indian movies, television, music, etc, greater access to the Chinese market.) In the meantime, if you are interested in how the patrolling agreement is shaping up, Rajat Pandit reports for the Times of India that the Indian -Army ‘successfully' undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday, after conducting similar patrols in Demchok last week.- With the first one done, the Indian side will be sending patrols to the four other PPs in the area now. The report adds that the -Army now has ‘unrestricted access' to the five PPs in Depsang and and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers.- The report adds: -The PLA, too, is conducting similar patrols with advance information to India to prevent the possibility of any clash.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Combining Top-Level Design & Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones - Discussing the Future of China's AI Governance - Li Qiang Calls for Supporting...	Hi folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend. I took a bit of a break late last week, celebrating Diwali. There were lots of colourful lights and much-needed sleep to enjoy. The wonderful thing about living in a multicultural, multi-faith society is that you have so many new year's within one year that you can always re-start and renew resolutions that didn't work out. So, here's wishing everyone reading this newsletter a happy and prosperous year ahead. Warmly, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, I want to cover a piece from Saturday. This one deals with Xi's engagement with officials at the provincial and ministerial level. It makes some really interesting points about the principles and boundaries of reform: The combination of top-level design and ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' is one of the distinctive characteristics of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era. On October 29, 100 days after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, at the opening session of a special seminar for provincial and ministerial-level leaders to study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, General Secretary Xi Jinping's remarks on ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' were thought-provoking. ‘Some people say, at this point in time, we're still -crossing the river by feeling the stones-. Isn't that conservative and timid? ‘Reforms that follow familiar paths are like swimming in a pool, where lines mark shallow and deep ends clearly. But in a turbulent river, don't we need to feel for stones to cross? It's not that, after decades of reform and opening up, we've already figured out every issue. If everything were clear, why would there still be a need for reform?' These words sound familiar. During his first local inspection after the 18th Party Congress in Guangdong, the General Secretary made it clear: ‘We cannot say that feeling the stones to cross the river was necessary in the early stages of reform and opening up, but now we can no longer mention feeling the stones to cross the river'. There are both key approaches for overall planning. In the new era of comprehensively deepening reform, an important reform methodology, which is also a major theoretical achievement we have made, is ‘combining top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones.' The combination of the two reflects the important principle of governance of seeking progress while maintaining stability and has multiple practical implications.- ，。，1029，，--。-，，，、？--，，，、。，？，。？-。，：-，-。，。，，，--。，，。 Later the piece adds: -Top-level design emphasises systematic thinking and overall strategy, while ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' emphasises daring to explore and experimentation at the grassroots level. ‘We must combine top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones' - this is an inherent requirement for further comprehensively deepening reform, and it is also an inevitable choice to enhance the systematic, holistic, and coordinated nature of reform, and to improve the cohesion, driving force, and implementation of reform.- 、，、。--，，、、，、、. The piece then stresses that during his remarks, Xi spoke about -- using both hands, adopting a dual strategy or doing two things in tandem. It adds: -The General Secretary profoundly pointed out: ‘For things we are confident about and have thought through carefully, we should implement top-level design; for things we are uncertain about and that are not yet mature, we should cross the river by feeling the stones - these two approaches should be used in tandem'. Reform is a journey of exploration full of unknowns. The coordination of ‘using both hands' contains the harmonisation of ‘knowing' and ‘doing'. For what is clearly understood, we must ‘commit to advancing resolutely'. For what is not so clearly understood yet still requires breakthroughs, we should neither stand still nor rush forward blindly. Over these years, a series of major reforms have formed replicable experiences through pilot exploration, which have then evolved into institutional achievements, and finally expanded to larger scales. Comprehensively deepening reform is thus about ‘accumulating small victories into big victories'.- Another phrase that the piece talks about is ‘establish first, then break' . Reform is a process of breaking the old and establishing the new. At this point in history, the prioritisation between breaking and establishing concerns not only the strategic planning of top-level design but also the orderly steps of crossing the river by feeling the stones. The General Secretary has a clear view: ‘To further comprehensively deepen reform, we must adhere to institutional building as the main line and emphasise the simultaneous approach of establishing and breaking, prioritising establishment before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, with in-depth risk assessments, and proper control of timing, extent, and effectiveness. What needs to be established should be proactively established, and it must be established firmly, sustainably, feasibly, and effectively; what needs to be broken should be broken in a timely manner, decisively, and thoroughly on the basis of what has been established, achieving steady and swift reform progress through the unity of breaking and establishing'. ，。--。、、、，。：-、，；、，，‘'。-。--，----。，--。-、-？，。，，，。，--。--。。，，，。：-，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，.- Subscribe now A couple of paragraphs towards the end are also interesting, since they set the boundaries for the reform agenda: -What should not be changed? The General Secretary pointed out: ‘Our fundamental political system, basic political system, and supporting systems are all very mature now. The People's Republic of China has been established for 75 years, the People's Congress for 70 years, and the Political Consultative Conference for 75 years - do they still need major reforms? Where would further reforms lead? We shouldn't reform just for the sake of reform, nor should we reform blindly'. What must not change? Take economic system reform for example. For example: on the issue of ‘letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation while better leveraging the role of government', General Secretary Xi Jinping recalled the lengthy discussion process during the preparation for the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, emphasising that ‘this important assertion is absolutely crucial.' Another example is the consistent adherence to and implementation of the ‘Two Unwaverings'. The General Secretary also responded to the concerns of those who try to distinguish the importance of the two: ‘There's no singling out, no one-sidedness; this has never wavered. We must be fair and just, maintain the balance, and not weigh one as more important than the other'. These things that cannot be casually changed or easily altered were also established through repeated experiences of exploration and were ultimately solidified through top-level design. The General Secretary made this assessment: ‘As the reform has progressed to this day, we already have a relatively clear big picture in terms of the top-level design of the reform'.- ？：-、。75，70、75，？？，。-？，，--，，，--。，--，。：-，，。，，。-、，，。：-，，.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 04, 2024. Page 1: There isn't a lot useful on the front page today. There's a report (English report) on Li Qiang's visit to Shanghai, where he discussed vocational education and skilled talent training. Li visited the Shanghai Nanhu Vocational &amp; Technical College. He said there -it is necessary to deepen the integration of industry and education as well as the cooperation between colleges and enterprises, optimize the setting of college disciplines and majors based on the needs of the society and industries' actual development and strengthen hands-on skill practice, adding that more skilled teachers are needed to innovate the models and methods of teaching.- Li added: -It is necessary to grasp the trend of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, aim at the forefront of science and technology and the world's first-class, cultivate more ‘high-tech, cutting-edge and scarce' skilled talents with strong theoretical foundations and practical capabilities to help achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening.- ，，、--，. Noting that there are ever-growing demands for elderly care, childcare and medical care, Li urged efforts to strengthen the training of skilled workers in the related fields. In addition, while visiting the WorldSkills Museum, Li said that -governments at all levels should continue to refine support policies for the cultivation of skilled workers by strengthening institutional innovation and investment. Efforts should also be made to improve the systems of development planning and services for skilled workers with a view to broadening their development channels and enhancing their incomes-. Subscribe now Also on the page is a long article previewing the 7th China International Import Expo. The article calls it a -major economic and diplomatic- event. One key point in the piece is: -Opening up is the inevitable path to world prosperity and development. Looking back at history, openness and inclusiveness lead to progress, while isolation and narrowness lead to obstacles. After the Cold War, economic globalisation developed rapidly, greatly promoting the flow of goods and capital, providing strong momentum for world economic development. In today's world of ‘you are in me, and I am in you', opening up and cooperation is the only choice. China's hosting of the Import Expo is a major initiative to proactively open its market to the world, and a practical action to promote the building of an open world economy and advocate inclusive economic globalisation. Only by gathering the power of cooperation through openness can we achieve great things, accomplish good things, and sustain long-term success, bringing a bright future for global development. Opening up is a distinctive marker of Chinese-style modernization. Major trading partners with more than 150 countries and regions, ranking first in total goods trade for 7 consecutive years, outward direct investment flow ranking among world's top three for 12 consecutive years…Since reform and opening up, China has forged a path of seeking common development through openness. The Import Expo is a vivid example that ‘the more China develops, the more it opens up', witnessing China's door of opening up growing ever wider. Only an open China can become a modernised China…- ，。，，。，，，。-、-，。，，、。，、、，。，。150，7，12……，。-，-，。，. Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report discussing China's energy mix. Some key data points: -In the first eight months, the investment in key energy projects was about 1.7 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.2%. Among these, investment in energy network infrastructure has been steadily released. Investment in 5 under-construction ultra-high voltage DC transmission projects across provinces and regions is accelerating, LNG receiving terminal investments in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Shandong are growing rapidly, and under-construction projects are quickly materializing into physical work progress. Non-fossil energy power generation investment is growing steadily. A batch of centralized wind power projects in Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Xinjiang are accelerating, while five newly approved nuclear power projects in Shandong Zhaoyuan, Jiangsu Xuwei, Zhejiang Sanao, Guangdong Lufeng, and Guangxi Bailong are gradually materializing into physical work progress. Investment in new energy business forms is expanding in multiple areas. In the first 8 months, completed investment in new energy storage increased by 21% year-on-year, while pumped storage completed investment increased by 45.5% year-on-year. A batch of multi-energy complementary clean energy base projects in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are progressing in an orderly manner, while Inner Mongolia's under-construction green hydrogen production projects and Henan's under-construction hydrogen facilities projects continue to form effective investment. The completed investment in key energy projects has maintained relatively rapid growth, further consolidating the foundation of energy supply security and injecting momentum into high-quality economic and social development. As of the end of September, the national total power generation installed capacity reached 3.16 billion kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 14.1%. Coal, oil, and gas production capacity has steadily improved, with crude oil and natural gas production increasing by 2% and 6.6% year-on-year in the first three quarters of this year. ，。5，、、、，。。、、、、，、、、、5。。8，21%，45.5%。、、，、。，，。9，31.6，14.1%。、，，、2%、6.6%. -In the first three quarters, China's new installed capacity of renewable energy power generation was 210 million kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 21%, accounting for 86% of the newly-installed capacity of electricity.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 9: The entire page is dedicated to views from academics as part of a roundtable discussing the establishment of -oversight systems to ensure the safety of AI- and improving the mechanisms for developing and managing generative AI, which were goals outlined in the resolution issued after the Third Plenum. First, Liu Yanhong from the China University of Political Science and Law argues that the development of generative AI can be classified into three stages: the preparatory stage involving pre-training and algorithm upgrades aided by human annotation the operational stage where input data is processed by algorithms to produce generated outputs, and the generative stage where the outputs are applied in society. Liu says that -We must understand the operational mechanisms of generative AI in depth, grasp the characteristics of the formation and development of security risks at each stage, and use legal means to strengthen systematic governance, ensuring that the immense power contained in generative AI always operates within the framework of the rule of law.- ，，，。，，，. She then outlines the key risks for each stage. For the first stage, Liu argues that the risks are primarily related to data security. At this stage, it is important to ensure -appropriate classification of data and the establishment of usage patterns and protection methods for different types of data to properly address relevant data security risks, avoiding illegal use or improper disclosure of data, which could lead to infringement disputes.- 、、。，，，，. Liu adds: -Legal rules for generative AI's acquisition and use of government data should be clarified to both meet society's needs for utilizing government data and strongly support the development, training, and application of AI government service large models to improve public service and social governance intelligence levels, while also regulating its processing methods to avoid results derived from government data harming individual rights or disrupting social public order.- ，，、，；，、. On personal data collection, She argues that -generative AI tends to over-collect personal data to improve conclusion accuracy, such as analyzing medical health data to mine personal whereabouts and predict personal life trajectories. Therefore, collection must adhere to law, collecting personal data within the minimum scope needed for technology, and setting reasonable data processing depths to avoid excessive mining of potential information.- ，，，、。，，，，. For the second stage, Liu highlights the -inherent risk of algorithmic bias.- Liu says: -To prevent and resolve algorithm bias risks, targeted governance should be conducted according to the principles and domains of algorithm bias formation. Legal regulatory requirements should be deeply embedded into the algorithmic models of generative AI, promoting technology for good, eliminating algorithmic bias, and ensuring reasonable use of generative AI algorithms and allocation of computing resources. Based on the concept of combining technology and management, strengthen full-cycle safety supervision of algorithms, implementing legal regulatory requirements throughout the entire process of generative AI operation. When setting algorithms, it is essential to adhere to relevant legal rules and technical standards, implement the regulatory requirements of ‘machine learning + human annotation', review the algorithm modules with risks, and better discover the technical risks within the generative AI algorithm models; when congenital algorithmic biases are discovered, corrections should be made from within the algorithm based on legal requirements, ensuring that the modified algorithm can operate normally; if problems occur afterwards, conduct source-tracing governance of AI algorithms, achieve precise attribution of responsibility and make corrections, promote the improvement of regulatory standards for generative AI algorithms, fill gaps in preliminary preventive review, and use both technical and legal means in parallel to equally emphasise development and management.- ，。，，，。，，。，-+-，，；，，；，，，，，. For the third stage, Liu writes that there are many risks from the risk of abuse to IPR risks, exacerbating information asymmetry, widening the digital divide, and damaging the interests of digitally disadvantaged groups. In terms of IPR risks, Liu argues that -substantial analyses of the technical models and principles of generative AI should be conducted according to the standards of intellectual property law. If human intervention is necessary to ensure that the generated outputs possess originality and innovation, intellectual property rights should be granted and ownership clearly defined, reinforcing the systematic protection of intellectual property rights in the field of generative AI. At the same time, it is necessary to reasonably determine the scope of protection for the intellectual property rights of generated outputs to avoid an unlimited expansion of the protection scope, which could hinder the promotion and application of generative AI and technological development.- ，、，，，，；，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Gu Liping from the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing Normal University discusses the importance of strengthening privacy protection in the era of artificial intelligence and ensuring personal information security. Gu argues that -the right to privacy faces severe challenges in the era of AI.- Gu elaborates the types of harms and challenges in the first bit before saying that: In terms of solutions, Gu stresses the -principle of informed consent-. He adds: -The principle of informed consent includes two aspects: knowledge and consent. Consent must be based on knowledge. Without sufficient knowledge and understanding, there can be no real consent. Information, understanding and voluntariness are the three elements of the principle of informed consent. On the basis of comprehensive ‘information', individuals can independently express their ‘consent'. This requires that when users use artificial intelligence, easy-to-understand and clear prompts and instructions should be made to obtain users' consent to the collection and use of personal information. If personal information will flow between different platforms, users need to be informed of the scope, target and use boundaries of the flow. For a good and smooth user experience, users can also be given the option of one-time or phased authorization. Users should be informed about the scope, methods, and purposes of personal information collection, as well as who their personal information will be shared with, and they should have the option to withdraw at any time. When conducting personal information analysis, users should be alerted via pop-ups or other forms and provide real-time authorization. Establishing a data lifecycle and timely deletion of personal information is also an effective way to protect the security of personal information.- ，，，。、，。--，--。，，。，、、。，。、，。，。、. The author also calls for -protect privacy rights and personal information security by improving database security, core data encryption, personal data anonymization and other technologies-. ，，、、，. Subscribe now The third and final write-up is by Professor Zhang Xin from the School of Law at the University of International Business and Economics. Zhang argues that for a variety of reasons, AI entities can cause -complex, dynamic and unforeseen risks.- Therefore, she calls for a -modular governance framework- for AI. -Such a framework must cover the entire industrial chain and various levels of endpoints, starting from key nodes such as data modules, algorithm modules, and model architectures, to design corresponding governance modules.- ，，、、，. Zhang later adds that -AI entities are deeply interactive, highly interconnected, and dynamically adaptable. Correspondingly, the governance approach should go beyond traditional individual-centered governance and promote the formation of a governance ecosystem characterized by extensive interconnectivity, multi-party participation, and multi-level collaboration. In this context, technical communities such as developers and operations and maintenance personnel will play a crucial ‘whistleblower' role in the governance of artificial intelligence entities. We should better leverage the supervisory advantages of technical communities and establish effective constraint mechanisms within artificial intelligence companies. Additionally, we should actively enhance the digital literacy of a wide range of users, raising their awareness of the lawful, safe, and responsible use of artificial intelligence entities, achieving positive interactions with these entities, and fostering an upward and virtuous operational state.- 、。，，、、。，、--。，。，、、，，.

Xi Calls to Strengthen Confidence in Reform Agenda - China-Finland Ties - New Inspections Target Propaganda & United Front Organisations - Made in Chi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, October 30, 2024. Page 1: Xi Jinping dominates the front page today. The main report is about Xi's remarks at the opening of the study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee for principal officials at the provincial and ministerial level. Xi called on them to -continue to deepen the study and implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenum, guide the entire Party and the people of the country to strengthen their confidence in reform, and better unite their hearts and minds to advance reform in a steady and sustained manner.- 、、，，，. As per the report, Xi said that: The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Party initiated a new era of comprehensively deepening reform and systematically designing and advancing reform on a new journey, creating a new situation for China's reform and opening up, which has been of epoch-making significance. Comprehensively deepening reform in the new era has achieved major practical, institutional and theoretical results, and is one of the most magnificent chapters in the history of China's reform and opening up. It has provided strong momentum and institutional guarantees for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and continuing to write the ‘two miracles', and has also provided a solid foundation and valuable experience for further comprehensively deepening reform on the new journey. ，、，，。、、，，、--，. He added that -maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation is a major principle that must be firmly grasped and consistently adhered to in further comprehensively deepening reform. Our reform has direction and principles. Adhering to the Party's comprehensive leadership, adhering to Marxism, adhering to socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, and taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and enhancement of people's well-being as the starting point and ultimate goal—these are all fundamental, directional, and long-term matters that reflect the Party's nature and purpose, conform to China's national conditions, and align with the fundamental interests of the people. These principles must remain unwavering, regardless of circumstances. We must stick to the general goal of continuing to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, always moving forward in the direction guided by the general goal, resolutely reforming what should be reformed and not reforming what should not be reformed. We must adapt to new trends in the times, new requirements of practice, and new expectations of the people, emphasise economic system reform as the focus, comprehensively and coordinately advance reforms in all areas, vigorously promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation and innovation in other aspects, to provide strong momentum and institutional guarantees for Chinese-style modernization.- ，、。、。、、、，、，、、，，，，。、，，，。、、，，，、、、，。 Xi Jinping pointed out that reform is a systematic project that requires scientific methods and proper handling of various relationships. We must adhere to the unity of reform and rule of law, using the force of reform to improve the rule of law, further deepen reform in the legal field, and continuously improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics; better utilise the positive role of the rule of law in eliminating resistance to reform and consolidating reform achievements, be good at using rule of law thinking and methods to advance reform, ensure major reforms have legal basis, and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of all citizens and legal persons. We must adhere to the dialectical unity of breaking and establishing, doing both simultaneously by establishing first and breaking later, proactively establishing what should be established, breaking what should be broken in a timely manner and on the basis of what's been established, and realise the steady pace of reform in the unity of breaking and establishing. We must adhere to the unity of reform and opening up, steadily expand institutional opening up, actively connect with international high-standard economic and trade rules, deepen the reform of the foreign trade, foreign investment and outbound investment management system, and create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, internationalised. We must properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation. The design of reform plans must grasp objective laws, pay attention to the coordination and supporting measures of various reform initiatives, enhance the consistency of reform orientation, establish and improve work mechanisms with clear responsibilities, complete chains, and interlocking links, strengthen tracking and effectiveness evaluation, and promote the thorough and precise implementation of reform measures.- ，，，。，，，；、，，，。，、，，，。，，，、，、、。，，，，、、，，. Xi Jinping stressed that leading cadres, especially senior cadres, should shoulder important responsibilities for promoting reform. We must strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge, we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development. We must be good at using scientific methods to promote reform, make systematic arrangements, and act after careful planning. Xi Jinping pointed out that broadly building consensus and fully mobilizing all positive factors is very important for smoothly advancing reform. We must effectively do a good job in guiding public opinion on reform, strengthen positive publicity, sing the main theme and transmit positive energy. We must strengthen the study and interpretation of some major theoretical viewpoints put forward in the ‘Decision' of the Plenary Session, especially strengthen publicity and interpretation for the grassroots and the masses, promptly resolve doubts and confusion, respond to social concerns, build consensus widely, and build a solid ideological foundation and mass foundation for the whole party and society to jointly grasp reform. Guide cadres and masses to strengthen their awareness of the bigger picture and correctly handle the adjustment of interest relationships and personal gains and losses in reform. Xi Jinping finally emphasised that all regions and departments should conscientiously implement a series of major measures determined by the Politburo meeting, fully implement all stock policies and incremental policies, take coordinated actions, effectively do a good job in various tasks in the last two months, and strive to achieve the economic and social development goals and tasks for the whole year. ，。、，、，，，，。，、。，、，。，，、。《》，、，，，，、。、，。，，，，，. Li Qiang then spoke underscoring the importance of Xi's speech and calling on truly everyone to -unify thoughts and actions with the spirit of the General Secretary's important speech and the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee, and creatively implement the reform tasks.- Share Tracking People's Daily On Page 2, there's a commentary discussing Xi's remarks. It says: -Reform and opening up is always ongoing, never completed. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made systematic arrangements for further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. The Central Committee organised this special seminar for provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres to further unify thinking and action, and to better implement the spirit of the plenary session. We must thoroughly study and understand the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, deeply grasp the guiding ideology, overall objectives, major principles, and scientific methods for further comprehensively deepening reform; strengthen our confidence in reform, maintain the correct direction of reform, reinforce reform responsibilities, and gather reform synergy. With unwavering courage and determination, we should work together to effectively implement the ‘Decision' of the plenary session. ，。、。，，。，、、、，、、、，，《》. It adds that in order to -strengthen confidence, unite efforts, and drive reform steadily forward, we must first correctly understand and grasp the historic achievements of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era.- 、，，. Then the article reiterates Xi's assessment of reform since the 18th Party Congress, which I have covered above. The article then adds: -The comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era was planned and advanced against the backdrop of China's reform entering a crucial phase and deep-water zone, marked by distinctive features such as broad scope, deep involvement of interests, great difficulty in tackling tough problems, and and having strong interconnectedness and linkages. Daring to advance into deep waters, daring to crack hard nuts, daring to traverse dangerous rapids, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united and led the whole Party and people of the country, with great historical initiative, enormous political courage, and strong sense of responsibility, to break through the constraints of ideological concepts, break through barriers of vested interests, resolutely eliminate of the drawbacks of various systems and mechanisms in all aspects, achieving a transformation of reform from localised exploration and breaking through ice to systematic integration and comprehensive deepening. The comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era is one of the most magnificent chapters in the historical process of China's reform and opening up; its great achievements are solid and can withstand the test of history and the people. This fully demonstrates that the Communist Party of China is a party with great reform and innovation spirit, and fully proves that the ‘Two Establishments' are of decisive significance for us in responding to various risks and challenges and advancing the construction of Chinese-style modernization. ，、、、。，，，，、、，，，，、、。，，。，--、. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era ‘also provides a solid foundation and valuable experience for further comprehensive deepening of reform in the new journey'. All great causes advance through continuous struggle, and perfecting the socialist system with Chinese characteristics is a dynamic process. Since the 18th Party Congress, our Party has timely summarized fresh experiences, continuously deepened its understanding of the laws of reform, and formed a series of new thoughts, new viewpoints, and new assertions from General Secretary Xi Jinping regarding comprehensively deepening reform, providing fundamental guidance for further comprehensively deepening reform. By emphasising institutional construction as the main thread, promoting the socialist system with Chinese characteristics to become more mature and well-defined, broadly consolidating the consensus that ‘reform and opening up is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves', we have formed an ideological foundation and mass foundation for the whole Party and society to jointly pursue reform. On the new journey, by adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as guidance, anchoring to the overall goal of further comprehensively deepening reform, making good use of valuable experience, and mobilising all positive factors, we will certainly be able to promote reform to advance steadily and far along the correct direction. ，--。，。，，，、、，。，，--，、。，，，，，. -Today's China has entered a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong nation and the great rejuvenation of the nation through Chinese-style modernization. It is in a situation where progress is becoming increasingly difficult and perilous, and where not advancing will lead to regression, making progress imperative. The more we move forward in the complex environment of turbulent clouds, the more we must strengthen our confidence and unite our hearts and efforts, demonstrating the spirit of ‘not shying away from the labour of reaching the summit', striving to open up new horizons for reform and development. and strive to open up new horizons for reform and development. We firmly believe that with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and with the whole Party and people of the country united in heart and determined to forge ahead, Chinese-style modernization will certainly open up broad prospects through reform and opening up.- ，、，、、。，、，--，。，，、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Back to the front page, there's a report on Xi's meeting with visiting Finnish President Alexander Stubb in Beijing. -Xi noted that Finland was one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China and the first Western country to sign an intergovernmental trade agreement with China. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Finland have always existed in friendship, respected and trusted each other, and set an example of equal exchanges between countries that transcend historical, cultural and institutional differences. As the world is undergoing accelerated changes unseen in a century and the risks and challenges facing humanity are increasing, the future-oriented new-type cooperative partnership between China and Finland holds exceptional value and should be cherished and advanced. China is willing to work with Finland to strengthen strategic cooperation, carry forward friendly traditions, and further advance the new type of cooperative partnership between China and Finland for the future, so as to better benefit the two countries and their peoples and make new contributions to world peace and development.- ，，。，、，、、，。，，。，，。，，，，，. Xi added that -the most important reason for the long-term healthy and stable development of China-Finland relations is that the two countries have always adhered to mutual respect, equal treatment, and taken care of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Finland practical cooperation got off to an early start, has yielded fruitful results and demonstrates great potential.

China has repeatedly pointed out that the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs is irrational, fraught with numerous non-compliance issues, and is a protectionist move under the guise of ‘fair competition', said the spokesperson in a statement released on the ministry's website. China has already appealed to the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. Noting that the EU is still willing to continue talks on price commitments for Chinese-made EVs, the spokesperson said China always advocates the resolution of trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, and had made the utmost efforts to this end. Currently, technical teams from both sides are engaged in a new phase of consultations.

Brazil wants to ‘take the relationship with China to a new level, without having to sign an accession contract', he told Brazilian newspaper O Globo. ‘We are not entering into a treaty,' Mr. Amorim said, explaining that Brazil does not want to take Chinese infrastructure and trade projects as ‘an insurance policy'. According to Mr. Amorim, the aim is to use some of the Belt and Road framework to find ‘synergy' between Brazilian infrastructure projects and the investment funds associated with the initiative, without necessarily formally joining the group, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted him as saying.

Politburo Discusses Inspections - Building Cultural Power - Zhong Yin Commentary: 3 Perspectives on China's Economy - Birth Support Policies - Boostin...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, October 29, 2024. Page 1: The lead reports today discuss the 17th group study session of the Politburo and the meeting of the Politburo to review the report on the third round of disciplinary inspection launched by the 20th Central Committee. First, let's look at the review of the third round of disciplinary inspection. The report says: The meeting pointed out that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the inspection work adhered to the central objectives and served the overall situation, focused on problem-orientation, maintained a strict tone, innovateed organizational methods, deepened coordination between upper and lower levels, and continued to prominently play the role of the sharp sword. Based on the findings of the inspection, Party building efforts within central and state organs, as well as centrally managed financial institutions, have been strengthened, and various achievements have been made. However, certain problems continue to exist. It is essential to seriously and earnestly grasp the inspection rectification issues, reinforce the political responsibility of ‘top leaders' and leadership team members, strengthen organisational coordination and daily supervision of inspection rectification, and combine inspection rectification with deepening reform, with comprehensive and strictly Party governance, and with the building of leadership teams and cadre ranks, integrate into daily work, integrate into functional responsibilities, and use rectification effectiveness to promote high-quality development. ，，、，、，、，。，、，，。，--，，，，，、，. The meeting emphasised that Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must continuously raise their political stance, strengthen their sense of political responsibility in performing duties, dare to act and be good at acting, overcome difficulties, and take initiative to share the Party's worries and fulfil responsibilities for the country. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee and implement the reform tasks with a spirit of nailing nails. It is necessary to enhance our awareness of potential dangers, coordinate development and security, focus on preventing and resolving risks in key areas, and firmly hold the bottom line of security. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the leadership team, strictly implement democratic centralism, promote the ability of leading cadres to move up and down, and continuously enhance cohesion and combat effectiveness. It is necessary to clearly understand the situation of the anti-corruption struggle, deeply advance comprehensive and strict Party governance, carry the anti-corruption struggle through to the end with a thorough spirit of self-revolution, adhere to the integrated advancement of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, deepen the treatment of both symptoms and root causes and systematically treat them, continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in combating corruption, continuously perfect the mechanisms for power allocation and operational constraints, focus on eliminating the soil and conditions where corruption breeds, and promote the normalization and long-term effectiveness of preventing and controlling corruption. ，（），，、，、。，。，，，。，，，、。，，，、、，、，，，，、. Subscribe now My Note: I think it is worth looking back to the report announcing the launch of inspections from April. It said that the inspections would cover 34 economic work departments and financial agencies. The full list of the institutions covered is available here. Back then, we were told that the purpose of the inspections was to: -deeply understand the performance of the inspected organizations in fulfilling their functions and responsibilities; promoting high-quality development; preventing and resolving major risks; coordinating deep-seated reforms and high-level opening-up; comprehensively grasping the deepening of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party; the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations; as well as the rectification of problems discovered by inspections, audits and other supervision; focus on identifying political deviations, promote the resolution of outstanding problems; and provide strong support for high-quality development.- I think it is interesting that there is nothing celebratory in the report in terms of the anti-corruption crackdown. Instead, it calls to -continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in combating corruption.- In addition, it reiterates the significance of the Third Plenum reform agenda and talks about using effective rectification to serve high-quality development. Another noteworthy aspect is the emphasis on holding the bottom line of security. To me, this is a timely reminder that the current stimulus effort does not imply shifting away from broader economic goals or the security focus of economic policy. Share Tracking People's Daily The other key report on the page is on the group study session of the Politburo. The special guest speaker at the session was Wang Bo, Vice President and Professor at Peking University. In his speech, Xi Jinping -emphasized that we must anchor the strategic goal of building a cultural power by 2035, adhere to Marxism as the fundamental guiding ideology, take root in the profound Chinese civilization, follow the trend of information technology development, and continuously develop the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics for a new era that has strong ideological leadership, spiritual cohesion, value appeal, and international influence, constantly enhancing the spiritual strength of the people, and consolidating the cultural foundation for building a strong country and national rejuvenation.- ，2035，，，，、、、，，、. The report adds: Xi -pointed out that since the 18th Party Congress, we have insisted on putting cultural construction in a prominent position in terms of governing the country, made a series of major arrangements, formed the thought of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics for a new era, promoted cultural construction to achieve historic accomplishments in returning to the source and innovating while upholding tradition, and taken solid steps in building a socialist cultural powerhouse. Solid steps have been taken in the construction of a socialist cultural power. Xi Jinping stressed that we must unswervingly follow the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics. We must adhere to the leadership of the Party, improve the governance capacity in the cultural field under the conditions of informatization, and strengthen the Party's ruling foundation and mass foundation in terms of ideology, spirit and culture. We must adhere to the fundamental system of Marxism's guiding role in the field of ideology, fully implement the cultural thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and develop a socialist culture that is oriented towards modernization, the world, and the future, one that is national, scientific, and for the masses. We must adhere to the guidance of the core socialist values, continuously build Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese strength, and develop and strengthen the mainstream values, mainstream public opinion, and mainstream culture.- 。，，，，，、，。，。，，、、。，，、、，。，、、，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that we must strive to unleash the cultural innovation and creativity vitality of the entire nation. Adhere to the people-centred creative orientation, adhere to prioritising social benefits, while unifying social benefits and economic benefits, take stimulating the vitality of innovation and creativity as the central link in deepening the reform of the cultural system and mechanism, and accelerate the improvement of cultural management systems and production and operation mechanisms. Focusing on improving original cultural creation capabilities, improve the service, guidance and organisation mechanism of literary and artistic creation and production, nurture and spawn a batch of classics that go deep into the hearts of the people and build new heights of Chinese culture. Actively foster a good cultural ecology, fully promote academic democracy and artistic democracy, support writers, artists, and experts in rooting themselves in life and focusing on creation, and drive the continuous surge of vitality in cultural innovation and creativity. Explore effective mechanisms for the integration of culture and technology, achieve digital empowerment and informatization transformation in cultural development, and transform cultural resource advantages into cultural development advantages.- ，。，、，，。，、、，，。，、，、、，。，、，. -Xi Jinping emphasised that we must always adhere to the principle of cultural construction being people-oriented and centered on the people. Focus on meeting the diversified, multilevel, and multifaceted spiritual and cultural needs of the people, enhance the supply capacity of cultural services and cultural products, and strengthen the people's sense of cultural gain and happiness. Attach importance to giving play to the role of culture in cultivating the mind and shaping sentiments, and nurture the high-spirited and enterprising spirit of the whole nation. Respect the laws of talent growth, improve the talent selection, cultivation, utilisation, and incentive mechanisms that are in line with the characteristics of the cultural field, create a good policy environment that identifies, values, and cherishes talents, and build a large-scale, structurally reasonable, and innovative high-level cultural talent team.- ，、。、、，，、。、，。，、、、，、、，、、. -Xi Jinping pointed out the importance of carrying forward the Chinese cultural lineage through creative transformation and innovative development. He emphasized the need to uphold the cultural subjectivity of the Chinese nation and to protect, promote, and further develop the precious treasures of Chinese civilization that have weathered the storms of history. Deeply explore and expound on the spiritual connotations of excellent traditional Chinese culture, use Marxism to activate the excellent factors in Chinese traditional culture and endow them with new era connotations, and develop socialist culture with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Uphold the heart of revering history and loving culture, adhere to the principles of protection first, reasonable utilization, and minimum intervention, and promote the systematic protection and unified supervision of cultural heritage. Improve the institutional mechanisms for the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage, and accelerate the improvement of the legal and regulatory system.- ，。，、、。，，。、，、，。，. Xi Jinping emphasised that we must continuously enhance the national cultural soft power and the influence of Chinese culture. Promote the reconstruction of the international communication landscape, innovate in conducting online external propaganda, and build a multi-channel, three-dimensional external communication pattern. More proactively introduce China's propositions, disseminate Chinese culture, and showcase China's image. Extensively carry out diverse international cultural exchanges and cooperation. More actively and proactively learn from and draw upon the outstanding achievements of all human civilizations, and create a batch of cultural achievements that integrate the ancient and the modern, and connect China and the world. ，。，，、。、、。。，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that building a cultural power is the common task of the whole Party and society. Strengthen the centralised and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over propaganda, ideology and culture, and improve the leadership and management system and mechanism of cultural construction. Party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly strengthen organisational leadership, do a good job in cadre deployment, talent training, and resource investment, mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of all parties, and gather a strong synergy for the construction of a cultural power. ，。，。，、、，，. Subscribe now Moving on, there's a Zhong Yin commentary on the page, discussing three perspectives on the Chinese economy. The first perspective is -bottoming out and stabilizing- . -Currently, many economic indicators are showing marginal improvement, and positive signals are steadily strengthening. Many economists believe that China's economy is showing signs of bottoming out and stabilizing. Looking at the demand side - in September, the year-on-year growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 1.1 percentage points compared to August; fixed asset investment growth stopped falling and stabilized, with the growth rate for the first three quarters matching that of January to August; exports grew by 6.2% in the first three quarters, and by the end of September, foreign exchange reserves returned to $3.3 trillion. The ‘troika' of consumption, investment, and exports are gaining momentum and exerting strength together. allowing the world's second-largest economy to achieve faster growth on a high base. New growth drivers are expanding rapidly, the economic structure is increasingly optimized, and the foundation of China's economy is more solid. Looking at the supply side—in September, the added value of industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 5.4% year-on-year. The growth rate stopped falling after 4 months of decline, and rebounded by 0.9 percentage points from August; the service industry production index increased by 5.1%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from August; the manufacturing PMI was 49.8%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points from August. The marginal improvement of macro indicators is the most intuitive positive factor, which fully demonstrates that the trend of steady improvement in China's economy has continued. ，，。，。——981.1；，18；6.2%，9，3.3。、、--、，，，，--。——95.4%，4，80.9；5.1%，80.5；49.8%，80.7。，. We must both face difficulties and maintain confidence. Currently, some new situations and problems have emerged in economic operations. However, the difficulties encountered are issues arising during development and transformation, and can be completely overcome through effort. This is precisely the methodology for comprehensively, objectively, and calmly viewing the current economic situation. ，。。、，。. The second perspective is that of the -combination punch- , which can help understand the effectiveness of regulation. -On September 26, the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee released strong signals for stabilising growth, coordinating and deploying a combination punch of ‘policy reinforcement' and ‘reform acceleration'. This carries weight, and its effects are beginning to show. Social expectations and market confidence are recovering. The implementation of major national strategies and key security capability building projects is a major deployment focusing on the overall situation of building a strong country and national rejuvenation. The accelerated implementation and promotion of the ‘two major' constructions not only drive current investment growth and promote industrial transformation, but also lay a more solid foundation for long-term high-quality development. Large-scale equipment renewal and trade-in of consumer goods benefits both enterprises and people, serving both current and long-term interests. Since the reinforcement of these ‘two new' policies, they have both driven rapid sales growth in key consumer goods such as automobiles, home appliances, and home furnishings, and promoted the high-end, intelligent, and green transformation and upgrading of related industries. Land, fiscal, financial, and other policies have been intensively introduced, promoting the real estate market to stop falling and stabilize. Both existing and incremental policies are showing effectiveness, with positive factors in real estate market operations continuously increasing. Accelerating the formulation of unified national market construction guidelines, releasing new versions of the negative list for market access ... with the accelerated implementation of major reform measures proposed by the Third Plenum, they will effectively stimulate the vitality of the whole society. Strong macro-control capabilities and precise counter-cyclical adjustments are important magic weapons for the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and an important manifestation of our institutional advantages.- 926，，----，，。。、，--，、，；，，--，、、，、、；、、，……，。，……，。、，，. The third perspective is that of ‘new consumer groups' . -Confidence exists both in the present and the future. In the first three quarters, China's new energy vehicle production and sales reached 8.316 million and 8.32 million units, respectively, increasing by 31.7% and 32.5% year-on-year. Looking at a longer timeframe, China's new energy vehicle production and sales have ranked first globally for nine consecutive years. Such data can boost our confidence. Behind these numbers lies future consumption trends, which are supporting factors for long-term economic improvement. Looking at new energy vehicles, Germans view it from a comparative perspective, seeing both the present and, more importantly, the future. German media listed consumer structure and mindset as important factors: ‘Chinese people are much more open-minded, with the average age of electric vehicle buyers being 34 (versus 56 in the EU).' This reveals the future potential of ‘developmental consumption'. According to a 2022 market survey, users under 40 accounted for 84% of China's new energy vehicle users, with those under 30 accounting for about half. Indeed, comparatively speaking, China's new consumer groups provide stronger and more lasting support for new energy vehicles. In today's China, from new energy vehicles, driverless technology, smart wearable devices, to integrated circuits, low-altitude economy, virtual reality industry…whether emerging industries or future industries, their significant characteristic is being driven by technological innovation and led by green low-carbon development. Since the new era, from consensus to action, from investment to consumption, from supply to demand, the new development concept has played a ‘conducting baton' role, guiding China's industrial deep transformation and upgrade, accelerating the transformation of development methods, promoting the ‘mutual advancement' of new quality productive forces and new consumer groups. Such ‘mutual advancement' is of symbolic significance. In today's China, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth has increased from 55.4% in 2012 to 82.5% in 2023. When the younger generation becomes the main force of consumption, when high-quality population development closely combines with people's high-quality life, from ‘survival consumption' to ‘developmental consumption', the consumption space of over 1.4 billion Chinese people will be greatly expanded, and consumption upgrading will maintain good momentum. This is the deep advantage of China's super-large market and the long-term advantage of China's high-quality population development. With the accelerated construction of a modern industrial system supported by the real economy, and the solid advancement of the all-round development of people and the common prosperity of all people, this ‘mutual advancement' will further evolve in depth and breadth, and promote high-quality population development to support the all-round realisation of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，。，831.6832，31.7%32.5%。，9。。，。，，，。：-，34（56）。---。2022，4084%，30。，，。，、、，、、……，、。，，，，--，、，--。--，。，，201255.4%202382.5%。，，----，14，，，。，，--，.

People in flexible and new forms of employment and rural migrant workers, who have already participated in the basic medical insurance scheme for urban workers, will be included in the country's maternity insurance scheme, according to the document. New mothers and fathers can feel more confident taking time off work, as the document urges local authorities to ensure the implementation of maternity, childbirth reward, paternity and child care leave policies. A childbirth subsidy system will be established, and the country has pledged to increase related personal income tax reliefs. Notably, suitable labor pain relief and assisted reproductive technology services will be added to the list of services that qualify for medical insurance reimbursement, according to the document. The country will also enhance health education for adolescents to prevent unintended pregnancies and improve early-pregnancy and abortion care services. More efforts will be made to increase the supply of quality pediatric resources, channel those resources toward the community level, and ensure more balanced distribution among regions. To increase the accessibility of child care services, child care services centers will be established at the prefecture and city levels, and child care facilities will be planned, constructed, approved and delivered for use in step with newly constructed communities, the document says.

The notice requires all departments and units to strengthen coordinated management of new energy vehicle procurement by their subordinate units. When preparing annual official vehicle equipment update plans, they should specify the quantity of new energy vehicles to be procured. Except for special circumstances such as geographical environment, climatic conditions, and lack of suitable vehicle models, the proportion of new energy vehicles in that year's official vehicle equipment updates should reach the target requirements specified in the ‘14th Five-Year Plan for Energy and Resource Conservation Work in Public Institutions', and gradually increase according to regulations thereafter.- ，，、、，；、、，，。、，，，、，《--》，.

Xi's Global South Pitch at BRICS+ Meeting - Wang Huning Visits Xinjiang - Aligning People’s Congresses with Party Agenda - China's Diplomatic Push at ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, October 25, 2024. Page 1: The main story today is drawn from Xi Jinping's remarks at the BRICS+ dialogue that took place in Kazan, Russia, on Thursday. The full text of Xi's remarks is on Page 2 and available in English. Xi stressed the significance of the rise of the Global South. But he added that -peace and development still faces severe challenges, and the road to prosperity for the Global South will not be straight.- He then added: We should uphold peace and strive for common security. We should come forward together to form a stabilizing force for peace. We should strengthen global security governance, and explore solutions to address both symptoms and roots of hotspot issues. Many parties have warmly responded to my Global Security Initiative. Under the Initiative, we have made prominent progress in maintaining regional stability and in many other areas. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. We should promote early deescalation to pave the way for political settlement. Last July, Palestinian factions reconciled with each other in Beijing, marking a key step toward peace in the Middle East. We should continue to promote comprehensive ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and revive the two-State solution. We must stop the flames of war from spreading in Lebanon and end the miserable sufferings in Palestine and Lebanon. We should reinvigorate development and strive for common prosperity. The Global South emerges for development and prospers through development. We should make ourselves the main driving force for common development. We should play an active and leading role in the global economic governance reform, and make development the core of international economic and trade agenda. Since its introduction three years ago, the Global Development Initiative has helped make available nearly US$20 billion of development fund and launch more than 1,100 projects. And recently the Global Alliance on Artificial Intelligence for Industry and Manufacturing Center of Excellence has been established in Shanghai. China will also build a World Smart Customs Community Portal and a BRICS Customs Center of Excellence. We welcome active participation by all countries. We should promote together development of all civilizations and strive for harmony among them. Diversity of civilization is the innate quality of the world. We should be advocates for exchanges among civilizations. We should enhance communication and dialogue, and support each other in taking the path to modernization suited to our respective national conditions. The Global Civilization Initiative I proposed is exactly for the purpose of building a garden of world civilizations in which we can share and admire the beauty of each civilization. China will coordinate with others to form a Global South Think Tanks Alliance to promote people-to-people exchanges and experience-sharing in governance. Xi ended by saying that -we support more Global South countries in joining the cause of BRICS as full members, partner countries or in the ‘BRICS Plus' format…- Share Tracking People's Daily Moving on, there's a report on Wang Huning visiting Hotan and Kashgar in Xinjiang from October 21 to 24. It says: Wang said that -we must adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, thoroughly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, fully and accurately implement the Party's strategy for the governance of Xinjiang in the new era, adhere to the main line of building a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, and better build a beautiful Xinjiang in the process of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. Wang visited schools, hospitals, villages and the homes of people belonging to ethnic minority groups. He said that: -Efforts to promote ethnic unity should be implemented in grassroots governance, school education, and aspects of people's daily lives. The awareness of the Chinese nation as a community should be instilled in the hearts of children from an early age, so as to promote all ethnic groups to hold together like pomegranate seeds.- When visiting an economic and technological development zone and related enterprises in Hotan, Wang said that -it is necessary to build a modern industrial system with the characteristics and advantages of southern Xinjiang, cultivate a group of enterprises with long industrial chains and strong driving capabilities, support the improvement of people's livelihood, and enhance the vitality of development.- ，、、，，。，，，、，，. Support for higher education, opening up, protection and utilisation of historical relics and sites were among other key aspects that he talked about. The report adds: -During the investigation, Wang Huning said that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee has thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches on Xinjiang work, further consolidating the good situation of Xinjiang's overall social stability and the good situation of people living and working in peace. To do a good job in Xinjiang, it is necessary to always put the maintenance of social stability in the first place/as the priority, ensuring long-term stability in the overall situation in the region. It is necessary to do a solid job in ethnic and religious work, carry out cultural enrichment in Xinjiang, and guide people of all ethnic groups to forge a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, strengthening the ‘five identifications'. We must promote Xinjiang to embark on the track of high-quality development and consolidate the material foundation for Xinjiang's social stability and long-term peace and stability. The spirit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps should be promoted, with deeper integration of civilian and military development, forming new advantages in stabilising and defending the border in the new era.- ，，，、。，，。，，、--。，。，，.

Zhao stressed the importance of -upholding, improving and running the system of people's congresses at a new historical starting point.- Zhao visited Dandong, Dalian and Shenyang, carrying out extensive research at the offices of the local people's congress standing committees, while also presiding over symposiums. -He stressed that studying and implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech (on the work of people's congresses at the 70th anniversary of the NPC's founding) is a compulsory course and basic skill for people's congresses at all levels to do their jobs well. It should be combined with studying the General Secretary's series of important expositions and important instructions on the people's congress system and the work of people's congresses, so as to fully grasp the development context, core essence and rich connotation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on upholding and improving the people's congress system, and always adhere to the correct political direction in the work of the people's congresses.- ，，、、，、、、，. -Zhao Leji pointed out that the people's congresses should leverage the significant political advantages of the people's congress system in practice, adhere to the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, ensure that the Party's propositions become the will of the state and the people's common actions through legal procedures, and ensure that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work.

Xinhua English summarises the last paragraph well: -Zhao also took the time to visit legislation outreach and community deputy liaison offices, enterprises, villages and rural households. During these visits, he engaged in profound exchanges with both deputies to the people's congresses and local residents. In the course of such interactions, he pointed out that people's congresses should consciously practice whole-process people's democracy, establish sound mechanisms for gathering public opinion and wisdom, and ensure the effective performance of deputies' responsibilities in accordance with the law.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's investigation and research tour in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from Tuesday to Thursday. Xinhua reports that Li -called for concrete efforts to facilitate the progress of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TSFP) and ensure the supply of energy-. The report covers Li's remarks on dealing with desertification, soil and water conservation management, forest belt construction and dairy technology innovation, as well as ecological, grass and seed research, and research on the promotion of improved varieties. They key point from my perspective are these: In Ningxia, Li -called for continuous energy technology research, and the promotion of the on-site deep processing of coal resources. He said that policy guidance and support should be enhanced and efforts be made to make good use of building facades, particularly rooftop spaces, to release the development potential of new energy, such as photovoltaic power.- In Inner Mongolia, he called to -put the development of new energy and clean energy in a more prominent position, and promote the complementary and deep integration of traditional energy and new energy. It is necessary to vigorously promote the clean and efficient use of coal, further improve the efficiency of power generation and heating, and ensure that the people can spend the winter in warmth.- He also stressed the need to -forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong meeting with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi in Beijing. Xinhua says: -Wang noted that China stands ready to deepen practical cooperation with Italy in areas such as drug control and cracking down on telecom fraud and transnational organized crime, to effectively protect each other's national security interests and promote bilateral relations to a higher level. Piantedosi said Italy is willing to enhance law-enforcement and security cooperation with China to jointly address security issues.- Also on the page are reports of three CPC delegations visiting Laos, Thailand and Ethiopia. The delegation to Thailand was led by Chen Gang, a member of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee. Xinhua reports that it met with Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy Pirapan Salirathavibhaga, Deputy Pheu Thai Party leader Chusak Sirinil and other leaders of political parties. The delegation to Laos was led by Qu Qingshan, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Xinhua reports that Qu met with Bounthong Chitmany, a politburo member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) Central Committee, a permanent member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee, and vice president of Laos. Qu also met with Kikeo Khaykhamphithoune, a member of the Political Bureau of the LPRP Central Committee and deputy prime minister of Laos, and Khamphanh Pheuyavong, a member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee and head of the Propaganda and Training Board of the LPRP Central Committee. The delegation to Ethiopia was led by Vice Minister of Education Wu Yan. He met with Adem Farah, Vice President and General Secretary of the Prosperity Party (PP) of Ethiopia, and Minister of Labor and Skills Muferihat Kamil, among others. If you are interested, here's a related Xinhua report with details of an event that took place. Subscribe now Page 15: There's a long article detailing China's diplomacy at the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The report says that the Chinese viewpoint was that the country -has embarked on a human rights development path that suits its national conditions, is supported by the people, and conforms to the trend of the times.- Chen Xu, head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and China's permanent representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, highlighted the significance of the Decision following the Third Plenum. He said that -China will further deepen reforms in an all-round way, promote Chinese-style modernization, enhance the well-being of all people, and strengthen human rights law enforcement and judicial protection.- The report adds: -On September 18, the Chinese representative spoke to publicise China's achievements in human rights development, pointing out that China has built a comprehensively moderately prosperous society as scheduled, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty; it has continuously developed whole-process people's democracy, promoted the legal protection of human rights, and promoted the people to enjoy more extensive, substantial and comprehensive democratic rights; it has continuously improved the levels of employment, education, social security, and the quality of living environment. At present, China is promoting Chinese-style modernization and will continue to improve the level of human rights protection with the achievements of modernization construction.- 918，，，；，，、、；、、，。，. The next segment is useful to recap in entirety: -China advocates respecting each country's right to independently choose its path to human rights development and opposes using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or hinder their development. In the face of baseless attacks and false accusations, the Chinese delegation resolutely defended its position during the meeting, clearing up the confusion and reaffirming its stance. On September 24, in response to the United States and some other countries attacking and smearing China's human rights situation at the meeting, more than 100 countries supported China's just position and opposed the politicisation of human rights issues in different ways, such as joint and individual statements. Cuba, speaking on behalf of nearly 80 countries, including China, emphasized that respecting national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, are fundamental principles of international relations. Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet are internal affairs of China, and the politicization of human rights issues and the application of double standards should be opposed, as well as using human rights as a pretext to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. All parties should adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, follow the principles of universality, fairness, objectivity, and non-selectivity, and respect the right of all peoples to choose their own development paths based on their national conditions. Uganda, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, Venezuela, on behalf of the Group of Friends in Defence of the UN Charter, and Gambia, on behalf of the African Group, spoke in support of China's position, pointing out that all parties should objectively view the human rights situation in other countries, conduct dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect, avoid selective and double standards, and jointly resist the wrong practice of politicising, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues. Chen Xu, representing the ‘Group of Friends in Promoting Human Rights through Dialogue and Cooperation', made a joint statement, noting that the politicisation and polarisation of the Human Rights Council is intensifying. The Human Rights Council should not be a venue for confrontation and pressure but should play its proper role in building trust and promoting cooperation through dialogue and exchanges between countries.- ，、。，、。924，，100、，，。80，、，。、、，，。，、、，。、--、，，，，、、。--，。，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Some other key points: On October 2, the Chinese representative called for the effective protection of the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people… Li Xiaomei, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the UNHRC, urged the United States and other Western countries to immediately lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China during an interactive dialogue with the Council's Special Rapporteur on Unilateral Coercive Measures. Li said that unilateral sanctions seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations, and seriously infringe on human rights. China has always firmly opposed them. The United States has a poor human rights record, but it often abuses ‘long-arm jurisdiction' based on domestic law, completely violating human rights in the name of democracy and human rights. ，。，，，，。，--，、.

BRICS Summit Special: Examining Leaders' Remarks & the Kazan Declaration	I'll limit this edition to the BRICS summit-related engagements. This anyway dominates the paper today too. At least, I found little else interesting in the paper today. So here goes. The top story on the front page today is based on Xi Jinping's speech at the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. The speech has been published on Page 2; full English version is available here. Key points: -At this summit, we have decided to invite many countries to become partner countries, which is another major progress in the development of BRICS…We must make full use of this summit, maintain the momentum of BRICS, and consider and devise our strategy to address issues that have a global impact, determine our future direction, and possess strategic significance. We must build on this milestone summit to set off anew and forge ahead with one heart and one mind.- -We must work together to build BRICS into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.- Then Xi made a five-point proposal of building a: : Peaceful BRICS; : Innovative BRICS; : Green BRICS; : Fair BRICS; and : Humanistic BRICS -We should build a BRICS committed to peace, and we must all act as defenders of common security. We humans are an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can we pave the way for universal security. The Ukraine crisis still persists. China and Brazil, in collaboration with other countries from the Global South, initiated a group of Friends for Peace to address the crisis. The aim is to gather more voices advocating peace. We must uphold the three key principles: no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames, and strive for swift de-escalation of the situation. While the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, the flames of war have once again been rekindled in Lebanon, and conflicts are escalating among the parties. We must promote an immediate ceasefire and an end to the killing. We must make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question.- -We should build a BRICS committed to innovation…China has recently launched a China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center. We are ready to deepen cooperation on innovation with all BRICS countries to unleash the dividends of AI development. China will establish a BRICS Deep-Sea Resources International Research Center, a China Center for Cooperation on Development of Special Economic Zones in BRICS Countries, a China Center for BRICS Industrial Competencies, and a BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network.- We should build a BRICS committed to green development…China's high-quality production capacity, as exemplified by its manufacturing of electric vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, provides a significant boost to global green development. China is willing to leverage its strengths to expand cooperation with BRICS countries in green industries, clean energy and green mining, and promote green development through the entire industrial chain, so as to increase the ‘green quotient' of our cooperation and upgrade the quality of our development. -We should build a BRICS committed to justice, and we must all act as forerunners in reforming global governance. The international power dynamics is undergoing profound changes, but global governance reform has lagged behind for a long time. We should champion true multilateralism and adhere to the vision of global governance characterized by extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. We must ensure that global governance reform is guided by the principles of fairness, justice, openness and inclusiveness. In light of the rise of the Global South, we should respond favorably to the calls from various countries to join BRICS. We should advance the process of expanding BRICS membership and establishing a partner country mechanism, and enhance the representation and voice of developing nations in global governance.- -The current developments make the reform of the international financial architecture all the more pressing. BRICS countries should play a leading role in the reform. We should deepen fiscal and financial cooperation, promote the connectivity of our financial infrastructure, and apply high standards of financial security. The New Development Bank should be expanded and strengthened. We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape.- We should build a BRICS committed to closer people-to-people exchanges…We should enhance the exchange of governance experiences among BRICS countries, and fully harness the untapped potential for cooperation in areas such as education, sports, and the arts so that our diverse cultures can inspire one another and illuminate the path forward for BRICS…China will implement a capacity-building program for BRICS digital education. We will open 10 learning centers in BRICS countries in the next five years, and provide training opportunities for 1,000 local education administrators, teachers and students… Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the front page are reports on Xi's meeting with the presidents of Iran and Egypt. The meeting with India's Narendra Modi is covered on Page 2. I covered this in detail in the edition yesterday. First, the report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says: -Iran, Xi said, is a country with important regional and international influence and a good friend and partner of China. The strategic significance of China-Iran relations has become more prominent as transformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at faster pace, he said. The Chinese side supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and national dignity, steadily advancing its own economic and social development, and improving and deepening good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries, he added. The Chinese side, he said, stands ready to work with Iran to firmly support each other, uphold the basic norms governing international relations such as non-interference in internal affairs, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries, adding that his country is also willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Iran in various fields, promote the sound and steady development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, and better benefit the two peoples. Xi congratulated on and welcomed Iran's participation in the BRICS Summit for the first time as a full member, pointing out that China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Iran within BRICS and other multilateral frameworks, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and push forward the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.- -Xi pointed out that China is deeply concerned about the current situation in the Middle East, saying that an early ceasefire and end of war in Gaza are the key to easing regional tensions. The international community should work together to urge relevant parties to earnestly implement the UN Security Council resolutions and avoid further instability in the region, he added.- Among other things, Pezeshkian said -China is Iran's most important partner for cooperation.- He added that -Iran is also ready to work with China to continue firmly supporting each other on issues concerning their respective core interests and opposing hegemony and bullying.- Subscribe now The report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi says that: -Xi pointed out that this year marks the China-Egypt year of partnership and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. China firmly supports Egypt in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, he said. The two sides should continue to firmly support each other, consolidate political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, jointly build the Belt and Road with high quality, strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and push bilateral relations toward the goal of building a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era, Xi said. China is also willing to strengthen coordination with Egypt to promote the steady and long-term development of greater BRICS cooperation, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries, he added.- -The two sides exchanged views on the current situation in the Middle East. Xi pointed out that China is deeply worried about the current situation in the Middle East. Noting that wars and chaos in the region serve no one's interests and the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue, Xi said the pressing task now is to fully and effectively implement the UN Security Council's relevant resolutions and end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible. Only by implementing the two-state solution can a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue be promoted at an early date, he said. China appreciates Egypt's efforts to promote a ceasefire and end of war, and stands ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Egypt to jointly push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the easing of the regional situation, Xi added.- Share Tracking People's Daily At this point, let me go back to the BRICS Summit. There has been an agreement on partner countries, but I still don't have a list of these countries. In the meantime, let's look at what different leaders said and what the final declaration says. First, let me highlight the Indian Prime Minister's remarks at the Closed Plenary of the BRICS Summit: -We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war. And just as we were able to overcome a challenge like COVID together, we are certainly able to create new opportunities to ensure a secure , strong and prosperous future for future generations. In order to counter terrorism and terror financing, we need the single minded, firm support of all. There is no place for double standards on this serious matter. We need to take active steps to stop radicalization of youth in our countries. We must work together on the long pending matter in the UN of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The same way, we need to work on global regulations for cyber security and for safe and secure AI.- -India is ready to welcome new countries into BRICS as Partner Countries. In this regard all decisions should be taken by consensus, and the views of BRICS founding members should be respected. The Guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures adopted during the Johannesburg summit, should be complied with by all members and partner countries.- -We must move forward in a time bound manner on reforms in global institutions such as the UN Security Council, Multilateral development banks, and the WTO. As we take our efforts forward in BRICS, we must be careful to ensure that this organisation does not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions, instead of being perceived as one that wishes to reform them.- One of the key points that he made at the open meeting was: -We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) developed by India is a huge success story and has been adopted in many countries. Last year, together with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed, it was launched in the UAE as well. We can also cooperate with other BRICS countries in this area.- Share Tracking People's Daily The key points from Putin's remarks at the open meeting are as follows: He proposed -creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.- -I would like to note that this year our association has managed to agree on a number of initiatives aimed at solving critically important common tasks. In particular, this concerns increasing the sustainability of supply chains and added value, countering protectionism, developing e-commerce, and establishing contacts through special economic zones. We believe that the launch of a special mechanism for consultations of BRICS countries on issues of the World Trade Organization will facilitate the development of a common position on the formation of fairer rules of the game in the global economy and the reform of the international financial system.- -We consider the initiatives on the BRICS partnership on carbon markets and the climate research platform to be promising.- It was proposed to open a BRICS grain exchange, which would facilitate the formation of fair and predictable price indicators for products and raw materials, taking into account their special role in ensuring food security. The implementation of this initiative will help protect national markets from negative external interference, speculation and attempts to cause artificial shortages of food products. Over time, one could also think about transforming the grain exchange into a full-fledged commodity exchange.- He talked about the importance of a joint energy research platform and a BRICS platform for precious metals, as well as for diamonds. -Russia has also put forward an initiative to establish a BRICS public health research network, which is designed to strengthen national health systems through the exchange of best practices. It is important to further strengthen the capacity of the BRICS vaccine center and tuberculosis research network.- -I would like to draw attention to the Russian proposal to create a BRICS alliance in the field of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to regulate artificial intelligence technologies, including to prevent their illegal use. In Russia, the business community has adopted a code of ethics in this area, which our BRICS partners and other countries can join.- Subscribe now Looking at the remarks of other leaders is also really useful. It helps understand the very diverse approaches and priorities of all the countries. As I had said in my comments to CNN recently, most of them are approaching the group pragmatically rather than ideologically. I am relying on machine translation of the comments available on the Russian presidential website. Egypt's Sisi talked about supporting multipolarity and basically added: -The world order suffers from many problems and crises, political crises that are aggravated by economic problems, leading to security problems, lack of financing for development goals, and rising costs of resources. Therefore, we in Egypt attach priority importance to taking significant steps to ensure financing for development goals in developing countries by creating reliable mechanisms and instruments to ensure sustainable development in developing countries.- He added: -Egypt confirms its readiness to strengthen interaction, coordination with the countries of the association on various international platforms, including in such areas as the climate agenda, strengthening, ensuring food security, digitalization, education and science. We are also committed to further work to ensure financial cooperation and the transition to national currencies, ensuring financial payments in national currencies, as well as interaction in the areas of digitalization, interaction with the BRICS Business Council and strengthening public-private partnership interaction based on the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism.- Brazil's Lula da Silva mentioned the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. He also talked about climate change. A key point added was: -It is now necessary to create alternative monetary relations between our countries. We are not talking about replacing our internal money, but when we talk about a multipolar world, we must create a financial system, we must seriously discuss this topic. Technically, we cannot wait any longer – we must decide.- Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed stressed the importance of -intra-BRICS trade, investment and tourism-. Supported the proposal on AI. He added that -prompt consideration of applications for membership in BRICS and the New Development Bank will make it possible to create a system of alternative financing for infrastructure projects that are important for development.- He stressed the significance of -African representation in the UN Security Council-. Iran's Pezeshkian said that -the period of unilateralism, when prosperity and development can only be realized on the path determined by Western directions, is coming to an end. I can say that the result of such an approach of Western countries can only worsen the situation in all corners of the world. And with great regret, I must say that the Americans have contributed to the growth of conflicts, as well as wars throughout the world. This is the unleashing of various wars, various conflicts, and we understand very well what is happening right now in Lebanon and Palestine.- He added: -The efforts that have been made so far to reduce the dollar's dominance in the world economy must be strengthened and implemented through operational solutions, such as the creation of a BRICS currency basket or a new settlement mechanism independent of the dollar. Independent parties can no longer pay for the United States' misguided financial policies or ineffectiveness in combating organized corruption in its financial sector.- He talked about Palestine, and the importance of financing support for development projects. He added: -I think it is necessary to create an electronic platform for all BRICS members in order to facilitate mutual trade processes between these parties, as well as to reduce dependence on ‘world domination' in the sphere of trade. We need to think about how we can improve the system of mutual settlements based on national currencies. We are well aware that we should not depend on Western settlement systems any longer, this is a big threat to all countries. Maybe not today, but tomorrow.- South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa said that -We look forward to hearing reports from our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on the use of national currencies in international trade and financial transactions among the BRICS countries and their trading partners.- He added: -Emerging economies are heavily affected by the impacts of climate change. However, they bear the least blame for the current climate crisis. It is therefore imperative that industrialized countries meet their climate commitments to ensure a just and equitable transition. It is important that climate action does not exacerbate inequality or hold back the development of countries in the Global South.- And he said: -It is necessary to increase cooperation among BRICS countries by launching common development programs in the field of exports, industrial cooperation and technology exchange. We call for recalibration and modification of trade routes to ensure more sustainable industrialization. Reform of the World Trade Organization is also necessary. Cooperation among BRICS countries in the field of mineral resources and mineral sourcing needs to be considered. This is of great importance for development and achieving the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our economies.- UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was very brief. He avoided any overt political remarks. Insted, he highlighted the country's success in sectors such as technology, logistics, and the green economy. He added: -The UAE has invested in major renewable energy projects such as solar energy, wind energy, to use natural energy sources, natural resources more efficiently. This is part of our vision to achieve a more sustainable future, taking into account climate change.- Next, the NDB's Dilma Rousseff spoke. She said that the international situation was complex and was further -complicated by the fact that the dollar is used as a weapon to change the living conditions of the population, which also affects the international system, that is, trust [in it] and its integrity.- She further stated: -For 2024-2025, we planned to finance 39-40 projects in the field of infrastructure, transport, clean electricity, clean water, digital projects worth more than 10 billion dollars. To date, we have financed a total of 101 investment projects worth 35 billion dollars. The new development bank envisages and wants to focus on financing in national currencies. This is very important for us to increase our capacity for financing. This is our strategy. The target for 2022–2026 was to implement 30 percent of financing in national currencies. Today, we have reached 28.3 percent, so we are almost reaching our target of 30 percent.- Putin responded to her remarks by adding: -You said that the dollar is used as a weapon. Yes, indeed, we see that this is so. In fact, I think that this is a big mistake for those who do this, because using the dollar, which is still the most important instrument of world finance, as a means of achieving political goals undermines confidence in this currency and reduces its capabilities. But it is not us who do this, it is other people who do this. But we do not refuse, we do not fight the dollar. But if we are not allowed to work with it - what to do, then we are forced to look for other alternatives, which is what is happening. We, striving for cooperation, nevertheless, it seems to me, must understand that the longer we live and work by someone else's rules and on someone else's platforms, the longer this transition to a new and more just economic and financial system will last, and this may be accompanied by major upheavals, including those that we are seeing, in particular, in the Middle East. We will talk about this with our colleagues.- Subscribe now Let's now look at the Kazan Declaration. This is a very, very long document. So I am just going to highlight some key points: We welcome the considerable interest by countries of the Global South in BRICS and we endorse the Modalities of BRICS Partner Country Category. We strongly believe that extending the BRICS partnership with EMDCs will further contribute to strengthening the spirit of solidarity and true international cooperation for the benefit of all. We commit to further promoting BRICS institutional development. We reaffirm our support for the rules-based, open, transparent, fair, predictable, inclusive, equitable, non-discriminatory, consensus-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, with special and differential treatment (S&amp;DT) for developing countries, including Least Developed Countries and reject the unilateral trade restrictive measures that are inconsistent with WTO rules. We welcome the outcomes of the 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and reiterate our commitment to work towards the implementation of the decisions and declarations of WTO Ministerial Conferences. We note however there is still a need for further efforts in many outstanding issues. We emphasize the importance of reforming the WTO and strengthening the developmental dimension in its work. We commit to engage constructively within the WTO to attain the goal to deliver a fully and well-functioning two-tier binding WTO dispute settlement system by 2024 accessible to all, and the selection of new Appellate Body Members without further delay. We agree to enhance our dialogue on multilateral trading system and WTO-related issues and welcome the establishment of the BRICS Informal Consultative Framework on WTO issues. We reiterate the decision under the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025 to take actions to support the necessary WTO reform to enhance the WTO's resilience, authority and efficacy, and promote development and inclusivity. We are deeply concerned about the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the world economy, international trade, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Such measures undermine the UN Charter, the multilateral trading system, the sustainable development and environmental agreements. They also negatively impact economic growth, energy, health and food security exacerbating poverty and environmental challenges. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We call for the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, which includes increased representation of EMDCs in leadership positions to reflect the contribution of EMDCs to the global economy. We support a merit-based, inclusive and equitable selection process for the top positions at the Bretton Woods institutions, increased geographical representation and the role and share of women. We note the quota increase at the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) and urge members to secure domestic approvals to make quota increase effective. We welcome the decision to create a 25th chair at the IMF Executive Board to enhance the voice and representation of Sub-Saharan Africa. We acknowledge the urgency and importance of realignment in quota shares to better reflect members' relative positions in the world economy, while protecting the quota shares of the EMDCs, in particular, the poorest members. We welcome the IMF Executive Board's ongoing work to develop by June 2025 possible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through a new quota formula, under the 17th GRQ. The discussions should result in quota realignment that is fair and transparent, enhances the representation of underrepresented IMF members, and transfers quota share from advanced economies to EMDCs. We look forward to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) 2025 Shareholding Review. We reiterate that the objectives, principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, including its principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) in the light of different national circumstances, must be honoured. We condemn unilateral measures introduced under the pretext of climate and environmental concerns and reiterate our commitment to enhancing coordination on these issues. We will strengthen cooperation on a whole range of solutions and technologies that contribute to the reduction and removal of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). We also note the role of carbon sinks in absorbing GHGs and mitigating climate change, whilst also highlighting the importance of adaptation and stressing the need for the adequate provision of the means of implementation, namely financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building. We reiterate that the unilateral coercive measures, inter-alia in the form of unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions that are contrary to international law, have far-reaching implications for the human rights, including the right to development, of the general population of targeted states, disproportionally affecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations. Therefore, we call for their elimination. Share Tracking People's Daily On the Middle East conflict, the statement says: -We reiterate our grave concern at the deterioration of the situation and humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the unprecedented escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank as a result of the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. We stress the urgent need for an immediate, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and detainees from both sides who are being illegally held captive and the unhindered sustainable and at scale supply of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and cessation of all aggressive actions. We denounce the Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations, facilities, personnel and distribution points. For this purpose, we call for the full implementation of resolutions 2712 (2023), 2720 (2024), 2728 (2024) and 2735 (2024) of the United Nations Security Council and in this regard welcome the continuous efforts by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the State of Qatar, other regional and international efforts in order to reach immediate ceasefire, accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid and Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We call for adherence to international law. We are also alarmed that the further escalation of the conflict in the Gaza Strip fuel tension, extremism and severe negative consequences both regionally and globally. We call on all relevant parties to act with utmost restraint and to avoid escalatory actions and provocative declarations. We acknowledge the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel. We reaffirm our support for the State of Palestine's full membership in the United Nations in the context of the unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution based on international law including relevant UNSC and UNGA resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative that includes the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine in line with internationally recognised borders of June 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital living side by side in peace and security with Israel.- We express alarm over the situation in Southern Lebanon. We condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts. We stress the need to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Lebanon and to create conditions for political and diplomatic solution in order to safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East while underlining the importance of strict observance of UNSC resolutions 1701 (2006) and 2749 (2024). We strongly condemn attacks on UN personnel, threats to their safety and call upon Israel to immediately cease such activity. We express our concern over the increasing incidents of terrorist attacks linked with ICT capabilities. In this regard, we condemn the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024, resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians. We reiterate that these attacks constitute a grave violation of International Law. We stress the importance of ensuring the exercise of navigational rights and freedoms of vessels of all states in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait, in accordance with international law. We encourage enhanced diplomatic efforts by all parties to that end, including by addressing the causes of the conflict, and continued support for dialogue and Yemen's peace process under UN auspices. We stress that Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be strictly observed. We condemn illegal foreign military presence that lead to increasing risks of a large-scale conflict in the region. We emphasize that illegal unilateral sanctions seriously exacerbate the suffering of the Syrian people. We condemn the attack against the diplomatic premises of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Syrian capital Damascus by Israel on 1 April 2024 that constitutes a violation of the fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Share Tracking People's Daily On the war in Ukraine, all we have is this: -We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine as expressed in the appropriate fora, including the UNSC and the UNGA. We emphasize that all states should act consistently with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation. We note with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.- Subscribe now Other security issues referenced are those in Sudan, Haiti, non-proliferation and disarmament, terrorism, prevention of an arms race in outer space, informatio and misinformation, corruption, drug production, trafficking and abuse, the situation in Afghanistan, etc. On Afghanistan, two points worth noting are: We urge for more visible and verifiable measures in Afghanistan to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorists. We call on Afghanistan authorities to reverse the effective ban on girl's secondary and higher education. On development issues, the document says: We believe it is necessary to address the international debt properly and in a holistic manner to support economic recovery and sustainable development, taking into account each nation's laws and internal procedures, accompanied by sustainable external debt and fiscal prudence. We recognise the need to address in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner the debt vulnerabilities of both low and middle income countries. One of the instruments, amongst others, to collectively address debt vulnerabilities is through predictable, orderly, timely and coordinated implementation of the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment with the participation of official bilateral creditors, private creditors and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in line with the principle of joint action and fair burden-sharing. We support the NDB in continuously expanding local currency financing and strengthening innovation in investment and financing tools. We encourage the Bank to follow member-led and demand-driven principles, the employment of innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize financing from diversified sources, and in this regard, we acknowledge the initiative to create new investment platform to leverage the existing institutional infrastructure of the NDB to boost the investment flow into the countries of BRICS and the Global South mechanisms. We support the enhancement of capacity building and knowledge exchange, including by building synergies with knowledge sources from developing countries, the assistance of member countries in achieving the SDGs and the further improvement of efficiency and effectiveness to fulfill its mandate, aiming to be a premier multilateral development institution for EMDCs. We agree to jointly develop the New Development Bank into a new type of MDB in the 21st century. We urge the Bank to execute its purpose and functions in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the New Development Bank in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. We support the further expansion of NDB membership and expedited consideration of applications of BRICS countries in line with the NDB General Strategy and related policies. We reiterate our commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. We recognise the widespread benefits of faster, low cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access. We welcome the use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners. We encourage strengthening of correspondent banking networks within BRICS and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), which is voluntary and non-binding, and look forward to further discussions in this area, including in the BRICS Payment Task Force. We agree to discuss and study the feasibility of establishment of an independent cross-border settlement and depositary infrastructure, BRICS Clear, an initiative to complement the existing financial market infrastructure, as well as BRICS independent reinsurance capacity, including BRICS (Re) Insurance Company, with participation on a voluntary basis. We reaffirm the need to develop a fair agricultural trading system and implement resilient and sustainable agriculture. We commit to minimize disruptions and promote rules-based trade in agriculture and fertilizers with the view to ensure a continuous flow of food and essential inputs for agricultural production which should be exempted from undue restrictive economic measures, inconsistent with WTO rules, including those affecting producers and exporters of agricultural products as well as business services with regard to international shipments. In this regard, we welcome the initiative of the Russian side to establish a grain (commodities) trading platform within BRICS (the BRICS Grain Exchange) and to subsequently develop it including expanding it to other agricultural sectors. We reject unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures, that are not in line with international law, under the pretext of environmental concerns, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), due diligence requirements, taxes and other measures and reconfirm our full support for the call in COP28 related to avoidance of unilateral trade measures based on climate or environment. We also oppose unilateral protectionist measures, which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition. We welcome the establishment of the Contact Group on Climate Change and Sustainable Development by BRICS Environment Ministers on 28 June 2024 in Nizhny Novgorod and the adoption of the Framework on Climate Change and Sustainable Development at the High-level Dialogue on Climate Change (30 August 2024, Moscow). We look forward to establishing the BRICS Climate Research Platform (BCRP) to enhance the scientific and expert exchange of views, knowledge and best practices of the grouping. There's a lot after this on health, tourism, disaster prevention, competition law and policy, customs and tax, IP cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, science, education, culture, etc. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Breakdown of the Meeting between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping	Hi folks, The main BRICS summit concluded earlier today in Kazan, Russia. I'll be coveringXi Jinping's engagement and the Kazan declaration in tomorrow's newsletter breaking down the People's Daily. Today, I am doing a special brief detailing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Xi Jinping in Kazan. My quick takeaway is that this meeting seems to have yielded positive outcomes. This is the first step on a long road to re-engaging, building trust and potential normalisation. A lot has to happen still; and a lot can impede this process still. In terms of the key developments, there is an agreement between the two sides to begin all-round dialogue, which is welcome. Xi Jinping's formulation of referring to India as a major country is noteworthy, particularly given the hierarchy of countries in Chinese official discourse. India generally tends to fall within the peripheral diplomacy category. More important, however, is his comment that -development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India-. It is, of course, terribly early but this is a good sign. It provides a frame for arriving at some sort of a new balance in ties. Also positive is that there will be a meeting of the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question sometime soon. The Indian side in its briefing has suggested that it expects further talks to deal with the issue of further easing in Eastern Ladakh, including de-escalation. But this doesn't seem to have been a part of the conversation, thus far. That said, there is a curious line in the Chinese readout that: Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle. One wonders what these were. Anyway, let's look at the readouts below: The Chinese readout after the meeting said: Xi Jinping pointed out that China and India are both ancient civilizations, major developing countries, and important members of the Global South. They are also both in a critical period of modernization in their respective countries. It is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples for China and India to correctly grasp the historical trend and the direction of development of bilateral relations. The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, enhance strategic mutual trust, and facilitate each other's pursuit of their development aspirations. Both sides should also shoulder international responsibilities, set an example of unity and self-reliance for the vast number of developing countries, and contribute to promoting world multipolarization and the democratization of international relations. ，、、，。，。，，。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that the essence of China-India relations is how two neighbouring developing major countries, each with over 1.4 billion people, should get along with each other. Development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India. Both sides should continue to uphold important consensuses that India and China are ‘development opportunities for each other, and do not constitute threats to each other' (、) and are ‘cooperative partners rather than competitors/rivals (), and adhere to the correct strategic understanding, and and jointly seek the bright path of peaceful coexistence and common development between neighbouring major countries. ，14。--。-、-、--，，、. As per the Chinese readout, Modi said that under the current international situation, -India-China cooperation is conducive to promoting economic recovery and world multipolarization.- He added that -India is willing to strengthen strategic communication with China, enhance strategic mutual trust, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation. India is willing to fully support China's work as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and strengthen communication and cooperation within multilateral frameworks such as BRICS.- ，，28，。，，。，，。，. The two leaders positively evaluated the significant progress made recently through intensive communication between both sides in resolving issues related to the border areas. Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle.- 。，. -The two sides agreed to give full play to the role of the meeting mechanism of the special representatives of the two countries on border issues, jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, and seek fair and reasonable solutions. The two sides agreed that the foreign ministers and officials at all levels of the two countries should conduct dialogues to push the bilateral relations back on the track of stable development as soon as possible. The two sides agreed to strengthen communication and cooperation at multilateral forums to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. The two sides believed that this meeting was constructive and of great significance, and agreed to view and handle China-India relations from a strategic height and long-term perspective, not to let specific differences affect the overall situation of bilateral relations, and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and prosperity and advance world multipolarization.- ，，，。，，。，，。，，，，、. The Indian readout after the meeting says: -Welcoming the recent agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 in the India-China border areas, Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility. The two leaders agreed that the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question will meet at an early date to oversee the management of peace &amp; tranquility in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question. The relevant dialogue mechanisms at the level of Foreign Ministers and other officials will also be utilized to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations. The two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbors and the two largest nations on earth, will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity. It will also contribute to a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world. The leaders underlined the need to progress bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges.- India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri made the following points at the MEA's press briefing after the meeting. The two leaders welcomed the agreement reached by the two sides on the border issue. -Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of not allowing differences on boundary related matters to disturb peace and tranquility on our borders,- said Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. The two leaders -instructed the Special Representatives to meet at an early date.- -Both of them stressed that with maturity and wisdom and by showing mutual respect for each other's sensitivities, interests, concerns and aspirations, the two countries can have a peaceful, stable and beneficial bilateral relationship-. -As we have maintained over the last four years, the restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas will create space in returning us towards the path of normalisation of bilateral relations. Officials will now take the next steps to discuss enhancing strategic communication and stabilising bilateral relations by utilising the relevant official bilateral dialogue mechanisms, including at the level of our respective foreign ministers.- They had a -very productive exchange- on BRICS. Misri added that Modi expressed -full support- for China's SCO presidency. In responding to questions about the impact of the meeting on the LAC and on confidence-building measures (CBMs): Misri said that: -it is certainly our expectation that as a result of not only the agreement that was arrived at just a couple of days ago between Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators but also as a result of the endorsement of that agreement at the highest leader level possible between the two countries as happened in the meeting today where both PM Modi and President Xi Jinping welcomed the efforts made by Indian and Chinese negotiators and the results that were achieved by that, I think these should certainly lead to an easing of the situation along the LAC.- On CBMs, he said that -these evolve continuously-. As the two sides engage once again in multiple formats, this is certainly a subject that I think will be under discussion between the two sides.- On the question of whether soldiers will continue to be deployed along the LAC, he deferred the question to military leaders. On the question of normalisation, he said that we have embarked on the path of normalisation (in Hindi, he said: ek yatra ek tarah se chal padi hai). He added that the agreement between the two sides has opened a pathway, but both need to walk on that path now (in Hindi: yeh rasta khul gaya hai; raste par chalne ki ab hum dono ko aawashakta hai). He added that on trust, what ever process we follow going forward, we hope that it will boost trust between the two sides. On the question of whether the border agreement covers Depsang and Demchok, Misri said that the answer is within is statements issued over the past few days. In essence, he confirmed that Depsang and Demchok were the only issues that the current agreement covers. The agreement that was arrived at, he said, -essentially pertains to these areas.- If you are interested, this is what he had said yesterday when asked a similar question: -Well, what it will entail is that in the pending areas under discussion, patrolling and indeed grazing activities, wherever applicable, will revert to the situation as it obtained in 2020. Incidentally, I should say that this is also what the External Affairs Minister was talking about yesterday when he was speaking at the NDTV World Summit, I think. And as to the other part of your question, what the, as far as the disengagement agreements reached previously are concerned, those agreements were not reopened in these discussions. The agreement that was reached yesterday, very early yesterday morning, was focused on issues that had remained outstanding in the last couple of years. So that is what I would say at this point in time.- On the question of whether Russia played a role as peacemaker between India and China, he said: -We are in Kazan; we are in Russia. I think we can certainly thank Russia for providing the venue.- You can watch the full briefing below. It's an 18-minute video, which is in loop. So don't get freaked out with the hour+ duration when you click :) Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!
