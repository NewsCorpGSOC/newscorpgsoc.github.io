Over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have gone through ups and downs and explored the correct way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other through ‘non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties'.

At present, the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, resulting in a fast-changing and turbulent international landscape, but the profound and lasting friendship between China and Russia will not change, nor will their sense of responsibility as major countries for the world and for the people. Despite complex and severe external challenges, bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade continues to advance, and large-scale joint projects remain stable in operation. The two sides should continue to promote the in-depth docking of BRI and the Eurasian Economic Union to provide dynamic support for promoting the high-quality development of their respective economies.- ，75。75，，-、、-。、、，，，、。，，，，。，，。--，. Xi Jinping stressed that next year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War.

We support Taiwan's cultural figures in countering ‘Taiwan independence in culture', promoting spiritual harmony between compatriots on both sides, and strengthening confidence in Chinese culture. This will provide strong spiritual power for the comprehensive advancement of building a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation, creating new successes in the development of Chinese culture on the journey toward national reunification.

The report also mentions China setting up the China-BRICS Science and Innovation Incubation Park for the New Era in Xiamen. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Zhang Hanhui, China's ambassador to Russia, on the BRICS+ Cooperation. He argues that the -BRICS cooperation mechanism is active and effective, and its shaping power has continued to increase. The BRICS countries have built multi-level, wide-ranging and all-round cooperation mechanisms led by the heads of state meeting, have actively expanded the breadth of cooperation through the ‘BRICS+' cooperation model, and have helped the Global South countries achieve the development goals of mutual achievement and common revitalization. The BRICS countries maintain close coordination on international affairs, defend fairness and justice, and promote world multipolarization. All parties support the development of the New Development Bank, promote the reform of the international financial system, and safeguard the development interests of the Global South countries; they have held a special video summit of BRICS leaders on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, insisted on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through dialogue and negotiation, and promoted political solutions to hotspot issues; and they have proposed ‘BRICS proposals' regarding counter-terrorism, climate change, energy, food, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and other domains of international governance, delivering a ‘strong voice from the South'.- ，。、、，-+-，、。，，。，，；，，；、、、、、--，--. He later adds: -China and Russia maintain close strategic cooperation within the BRICS cooperation mechanism. China actively supports Russia in doing a good job during its rotating presidency, building consensus and pooling strength through the Kazan meeting, promoting the great development and great achievements of BRICS+ cooperation, and working together to promote an equal and orderly world multi-polarization and inclusive economic globalization, and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- 。，、，--、，，.

It adds that the -China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 covers 9 areas, including both existing areas of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and emerging areas with huge cooperation potential between the two sides. For the first time, China and ASEAN have reached the highest level of agreements in their respective economic and trade agreements, covering chapters on the digital economy, green economy, and supply chain connectivity. They have also achieved agreements on the highest level of standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures in their respective treaty practices. These upgrades will fully expand mutually beneficial cooperation between China and ASEAN in emerging fields, strengthen the integration of standards and rules between the two sides, jointly build a safe, stable, and efficient regional supply chain cooperation network, and elevate China-ASEAN win-win cooperation to a new level.- —3.0，，。9，—，。、、，。，，、，. The article adds: -Currently, the global problem of insufficient overall demand is more prominent, making the market a scarce resource for economic development. China and ASEAN's combined populations account for a quarter of the world's total, and their large-scale markets are the main foundation for promoting economic prosperity. The upgraded FTA will further integrate and connect the two large markets, certainly generating more significant economies of scale, industrial clustering effects, and development spillover effects-. 1/4，。、，、、. The article also makes the point that the completion of negotiations on the deal also -reflects the clear attitude of both sides to firmly support multilateralism and free trade.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 16: There is an article by Zheng Zongwen discussing the BRICS summit. The author writes that more than 30 countries have applied to join the BRICS cooperation mechanism, demonstrating the increasing appeal and attraction of the BRICS cooperation mechanism.- Zheng argues that the popularity of the BRICS is the -choice of history and the call of the times.- A key point that the author makes is: -One arrow is easily broken, but ten arrows are hard to bend.- ，. BRICS cooperation has always taken independence and self-reliance as its cornerstone, demonstrating responsibility for promoting human social progress. Faced with the choice between peaceful coexistence or confrontation and antagonism, BRICS countries adhere to the role positioning of -not starting from scratch/a new system/starting over, not engaging in camp confrontation, not wanting to replace anyone' (、、), uphold the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, equal treatment, unity and mutual assistance, openness and inclusiveness, and consensus through consultation, striving to seek the greatest common divisor and draw the largest concentric circle. From respecting each other's development paths to resolutely opposing interference in other countries' internal affairs, from jointly defending development rights to jointly exploring the path of modernization, every step forward in BRICS cooperation crystallises profound thinking on changing one's own destiny and pursuing reform and progress, and demonstrates the tremendous power of the collective awakening of the vast number of developing countries. At present, certain major countries, driven by geopolitical objectives, are seeking to coerce other countries to take sides and create camp confrontation, disregarding other countries' interests and engaging in self-centeredness, arbitrarily containing and suppressing emerging market countries and developing countries. The enlarged BRICS as the first echelon of the Global South will stride forward along the path of independence, self-reliance, and united self-strengthening, continuing to build a solid ‘golden defense line' to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，。，-、、-，、、、、，、。，，、，。，，，，，。----，、，--. The next bit talks about BRICS cooperation essentially being a win-win model, focussing on key areas, such as economic development, technology, production and supply chain cooperation, food security cooperation and sustainable development. -BRICS cooperation has always pursued fairness and justice, contributing wisdom to improving the global governance system. Faced with the contest between multilateralism and hegemony and power politics, BRICS countries represent the Global South countries in voicing more just opinions. From maintaining the authority and status of the United Nations to promoting reforms of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, BRICS countries, while maintaining the stability of the global governance system, support its timely reform and rectification of historical injustices. From holding the BRICS Leaders' Special Video Summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue, to China and Brazil proposing a ‘six-point consensus' on the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis, to establishing a ‘Friends of Peace' group for the Ukraine crisis, BRICS countries take the lead in speaking and acting justly, playing a constructive role in promoting the resolution of international and regional hotspot issues. From establishing a working group on cybersecurity issues to setting up the ‘China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center', BRICS countries actively engage with new domains of global governance, playing a positive role in ensuring equal participation of Global South countries in international affairs and safeguarding their rights. The enlarged BRICS is an expansion of the world's justice front, and will continue to contribute ‘golden wisdom' to promote the construction of a global governance pattern featuring joint consultation, joint construction and shared benefits.- ，。，。、，，，。，--，--，、，。-—-，，、。--，--. The author then makes the case that the BRICS is a model of inclusiveness, of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and of coexistence and cooperation among countries with different ethnicities, cultures, and systems.

Ford, chairman and chief executive officer of General Atlantic. Xi pointed out that China-U.S. ties are one of the world's most important bilateral relations, which bear on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. Xi said China has always handled the China-U.S. relationship based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and always believes that each country's success presents opportunities for the other. The two countries should serve as a boost to each other's development rather than a hindrance, Xi said, adding that China is willing to work with the United States as partners and friends, which will not only benefit the two countries but also the whole world.- -Xi stressed that the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was successfully held in July this year, making systematic arrangements for China to further deepen reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.

Xi said the two sides should carry out more visits and exchanges, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and work together to translate the ‘San Francisco vision' into reality, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability and positive energy into the world.- Third, there's a brief report on Xi's message (English report) to Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh on the 75th anniversary of bilateral ties. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: First, there's a report (full speech text - English text) on Li Qiang's remarks at the SCO meeting in Pakistan. Li called on the SCO members to move towards the following: First, efforts to build an even more solid political foundation. The fundamental reason why the SCO has stayed vibrant since its inception is that we have upheld the Shanghai Spirit, a vital political consensus, and endeavored to be trustworthy and reliable partners for each other. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, SCO cooperation in various fields will move forward steadily as long as the Shanghai Spirit remains entrenched. Second, efforts to provide more reliable security safeguards. As we speak, geopolitical conflicts, power politics and acts of bullying continue to undermine regional peace and stability, while on such fronts as cyber security and biosecurity, new threats and new challenges continue to emerge. No country is immune, and the only true security is security for all. Only by further improving the mechanisms and tools to tackle threats and challenges can we provide better safeguards for common development. Third, efforts to foster closer economic bonds. The SCO's continuous expansion of membership in recent years has created more notable economic complementarity among member states. By deepening our economic ties, resisting external attempts of pulling us apart, and tapping into and pooling our respective strengths in resources, market and industries, we will be able to foster even stronger synergy for development. Fourth, efforts to cultivate stronger emotional bonds. Our region is home to diverse and splendid civilizations, where different nations and cultures have interacted and converged with each other throughout the course of history and coexisted in harmony. This has been the source of popular support for cooperation among SCO member states. We need to further promote mutual learning among civilizations and cultural exchanges so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of SCO member states. Fifth, efforts to boost coordination in multilateral fora. Embracing 26 countries from three continents, the SCO family is a constructive force that carries important global influence. With our commitment to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and our enhanced communication and coordinated actions, SCO member states will better rally the developing world in promoting a more just and equitable global order. Li then made four proposals: First, enhancing strategic synergy for our shared purpose. Pursuing peaceful development is the abiding purpose of the SCO. We should stay grounded in the fundamental and long-term interests of the region, bear in mind the big picture and keep external disruptions at bay. Our best efforts must be directed toward mapping out the SCO's development strategy for the next decade and drawing up roadmaps for cooperation in various areas. Member states should step up strategic communication, bridge differences and boost mutual trust through dialogue, and pool strengths for unity. Second, expanding practical cooperation in line with development needs. The year 2025 will be the SCO Year of Sustainable Development. China stands ready to deepen cooperation with all sides in poverty reduction, digital economy and green development, to generate sustained momentum for development. We should continue to draw impetus from openness and cooperation, boost the region's trade and investment facilitation and connectivity, and maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains. Active efforts should be made to establish an SCO development bank in order to provide financing support for countries in their pursuit of development. Third, proactively addressing major risks. Our region continues to face grave security issues. The fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism remains a long-term, arduous task, and various challenges lie ahead in such areas as safeguarding information security and combating transnational organized crime. China stands ready to work with all sides to strengthen intelligence sharing and joint operations, move faster to build a universal center to address the challenges and threats to the security of SCO member states and the Anti-Drug Center, and strive for major outcomes at next year's summit, so that we can put in place new platforms and a new architecture for regional security cooperation. Fourth, expanding people-to-people exchange to meet popular expectations. We should fully leverage the role of the SCO Committee on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, develop an effective SCO digital education alliance, organize excellent events under our flagship programs such as the Forum on People-to-People Friendship and the Forum on Friendship Cities, the Forum on Women, and the Art Exhibition of Young Artists, and increase our peoples' participation and sense of fulfillment, to keep people-to-people friendship strong for generations to come.

Military Theory Conference - Li Qiang Meets Kyrgyz & Tajik PMs - World Buddhist Forum - 6 trln in Stimulus Expected? - Lashing out at Malabar Drills -...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, October 16, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is on Xi Jinping's instructions at the military theory work conference, which was held in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday. Xi -emphasised that the modernization of military theory is an important part of the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, and plays a crucial leading role in the development of the cause of strengthening the armed forces. In the new era and on a new journey, as the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, a new military revolution is rapidly advancing, and China's security and development needs are undergoing profound changes, the task of achieving the goal of strengthening the military has become more urgent, and it is necessary to comprehensively strengthen military theory work.- ，，。，，，，，. -It is necessary to implement the thought on strengthening the military in the new era; implement the military strategic guidelines for the new era; persist in combining the basic principles of Marxism with the practice of building the people's army; draw from the essence of China's excellent traditional military culture; focus on the battlefield, the troops, and the future; keep a close eye on changes in technology, warfare, and adversaries; grasp firmly the research on major issues of war preparedness and military building under new historical conditions; optimize top-level design for military theory innovations; improve the model of relevant research and enhance the application of military theory; and build a modern military theory system with Chinese characteristics so as to provide scientific support and leadership for achieving the PLA's centennial goal and accelerating the building of a world-class military.- ，，，，、、，、、，，，，，，、. Zhang Youxia was present at the meeting and also delivered a speech, emphasising Xi's message. Subscribe now The other top story on the page is about Qiushi's publication of a speech by Xi at a symposium on literature and art on October 15, 2014. This is quite a famous speech, but for those who might not have followed back then, I'll do a full breakdown of the report. If you want to read a full translation of the speech by Rogier Creemers back then, here's the link. -The speech emphasised that literary and artistic undertakings are important undertakings of the Party and the people, and the literary and artistic front is an important front of the Party and the people. Literature and art are the clarion call for the advancement of the times, and they best represent the style of an era and are most able to shape the atmosphere of an era. To achieve the ‘two centenary' goals and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the role of literature and art is irreplaceable, and there is much for literary and artistic workers to do. The majority of literary and artistic workers should recognize the status and role of literature and art from such a perspective, recognize the historical mission and responsibility they bear, adhere to the people-centred creative approach, strive to create more excellent works worthy of the times, carry forward the Chinese spirit, gather Chinese strength, and inspire people of all ethnic groups across the country to vigorously move forward into the future.- ，，。，，。--、，，。，，，，、，. -The speech pointed out that achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the prosperity and flourishing of Chinese culture. It is essential to place great importance on and fully leverage the significant role of literature, art, and cultural workers. Both history and reality have proven that the Chinese nation possesses immense cultural creativity. At every major historical juncture, culture can sense the changes in national fortunes, stand at the forefront of the times, and sound the clarion call of the era, cheering millions of people and our great motherland. Raising the banner of spirit, establishing spiritual pillars, and building a spiritual home all cannot be separated from literature and art. Writers and artists in our country should become the forerunners, pioneers, and advocates of the times, and write and record the great practice of the people and the progressive requirements of the times through more literary and artistic works with strength, morality, and warmth.- ，。。，。，、、，、。、、，。、、，、、，、. The next paragraph stresses the importance of -creating and producing excellent works that are worthy of our great nation and great era.- It says: -The central task of literary and artistic work must be the creation and production of excellent works. We must strive to create and produce more excellent works that spread contemporary Chinese values, embody the spirit of Chinese culture, reflect the aesthetic pursuits of the Chinese people, and organically unify ideological content, artistic quality, and aesthetic appeal. Innovation is the lifeblood of literature and art.- ，、、，、、。. Xi then stressed the importance of -the originality of literature and art- and called to -strive to cultivate a group of influential literary and artistic leaders in various fields, and build a large team of literary and artistic talents.- The next bit is important to remember: -The speech pointed out that socialist literature and art, in essence, is the literature and art of the people. Literature and art must reflect the voice of the people and must adhere to the fundamental direction of serving the people and serving socialism. This is a basic requirement put forward by the Party for the literary and artistic front, and it is also the key to determining the future and destiny of China's literary and artistic undertakings. First, the people need literature and art. To meet the people's growing spiritual and cultural needs, we must focus on cultural development and increase the spiritual and cultural wealth of society. Second, literature and art need the people. Whether excellent works can be produced fundamentally depends on whether they can write for the people, express emotions for the people, and reflect the thoughts of the people. Third, literature and art must love the people. There are a hundred or even a thousand methods for literary and artistic creation, but the most fundamental, crucial, and reliable method is to be rooted in the people and in real life. A good work should be one that withstands the evaluation of the people, experts, and the test of the market. It should prioritise social benefits but also achieve a balance between social and economic benefits. Literature and art should not be slaves to the market and should not be tainted with the stench of money.- ，，，。，、。，。，。，，。，。，、、。，。、，、、、。，、、，，。，. The speech pointed out that the Chinese spirit is the soul of socialist literature and art. Every era has its own spirit. Literature and art are projects that shape the soul, and literary and artistic workers are the engineers of the soul. Literary and artistic workers should uphold the banner of core socialist values, fully recognize the responsibilities on their shoulders, and vividly and creatively reflect these core values in their artistic creations. Patriotism should be the main theme of literary and artistic creation, guiding the people to establish and uphold the correct views of history, the nation, the state, and culture, while enhancing their sense of pride and confidence in being Chinese. Through literary and artistic works, we should convey truth, goodness, and beauty, and transmit positive and virtuous values, guiding people to aspire to and pursue a life that values morality, respects morality, and upholds morality. We should inherit and promote China's excellent traditional culture and Chinese aesthetic spirit in line with the conditions of the new era. ，。。，。，，、。，、、、，。，，、、。，. The final paragraph calls to strengthen the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

Subscribe now Page 7: There's a report based on data released by the State Taxation Administration on individual income taxation. It informs that more than 70 percent of people earning an income did not have to pay tax in China last year. Individuals with an annual income of less than 100,000 yuan ($13,600), did not have to pay personal income tax last year. Li Ping, the deputy director of the STA's tax science research institute explained -in 2018, China revised the Individual Income Tax Law for the seventh time, raising the basic deduction standard from the original 3,500 yuan per person per month to 5,000 yuan. At the same time, six special additional deductions were established for children's education, support for the elderly, housing loan interest, housing rent, continuing education, and major illness medical treatment. In 2022, a special additional deduction for the care of infants under 3 years old was added, and in 2023, the standards for three special additional deductions for the care of infants under 3 years old, children's education, and support for the elderly were increased.- The report also informs that among the individual income tax payers in China, high-income earners with an annual income of more than 1 million yuan account for about 1% of the number of taxpayers, and the individual income tax declared and paid by this group accounts for more than 50% of the total individual income tax. The individual income tax paid by the top 10% accounts for more than 90% of the total individual income tax. While on this subject of taxation, do check out this Bloomberg report. It says: -China has begun enforcing a long-overlooked tax on overseas investment gains by the country's ultra-rich, according to people familiar with the matter. Some wealthy individuals in major Chinese cities were told in recent months to conduct self-assessments or summoned by tax authorities for meetings to evaluate potential payments, including those in arrears from past years, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The move underscores growing urgency within the government to expand its sources of revenue as land sales tumble and growth slows. It also aligns with President Xi Jinping's ‘common prosperity' campaign to create a more equal distribution of wealth in the world's second-largest economy. The individuals contacted are facing up to 20% levies on investment gains, and some are also subject to penalties on overdue payments, said the people, adding that the final amount is negotiable.- Another report on the page informs that the inter-provincial electricity spot market has officially begun operation on Tuesday. This is a key step towards building a unified electricity market system. The State Grid said that building on the existing medium- and long-term electricity trading mechanism, the spot market allows for day-ahead and intra-day transactions across provinces. Since the pilot use started in January 2022, the market has been running smoothly and steadily for 31 consecutive months. Up to date, it has achieved full coverage of areas operated by the State Grid and the western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with over 6,000 trading entities and a cumulative transaction volume of over 88 billion kilowatt-hours, of which more than 44 percent are clean energy sources. Share Tracking People's Daily First, there's too much in this to offer a summary, but if you are interested, do check out Xinhua Institute's new report: ‘Eight Major Steps' Heralds Promising New Decade of Belt and Road Cooperation. Second, check out this report from Caixin discussing the potential of the central government possibly raising 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds to support local governments. -​​China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds over three years as part of its efforts to buttress the slowing economy through fiscal stimulus, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told Caixin. The funds will be partly used to help local governments resolve their off-the-books debts, according to the sources. Speculation about the size of China's new fiscal stimulus has been rife since the Ministry of Finance pledged at a press briefing Saturday to help local governments relieve debt pressure without specifying the amount. The central government will expand the quota for local authorities to bring their hidden debt onto the books by a ‘relatively large scale,' Finance Minister Lan Foan said at the briefing. By helping manage the tens of trillions of yuan of off-the-books debt, the measure could free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents, he noted. Lan also announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers in a bid to revive the country's real estate sector, which has now been in a slump for more than three years. Part of the funding will come from local governments issuing special-purpose bonds, which are typically used to finance infrastructure and public welfare projects. Other fiscal measures will include injecting capital into China's major state-owned commercial banks and subsidizing ‘important groups,' such as students, Lan said. The central government is looking into additional fiscal policies, the finance minister said, adding that it has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt.- SCMP also has a very useful explainer on when we are likely to get more details on this stimulus. It says: -When talking on Saturday about introducing a one-time, large-scale, debt-ceiling increase for local governments to swap their hidden debts, Lan said specifics on the amount of money will be disclosed after the proper legal procedures. Historically speaking, the NPC Standing Committee usually holds a chairman's meeting in the second week after the National Day holiday, and the time and agenda of the upcoming legislature gathering are decided. Thus, more details of China's fiscal stimulus might be disclosed in late October or early November after the NPC Standing Committee meeting. Last year, the NPC Standing Committee meeting was held from October 20-24 and a resolution was passed to issue an additional 1 trillion yuan (US$ 141.3 billion) worth of treasury bonds. In December, there will be another Politburo meeting focused on economic issues and the Central Economic Work Conference will likely take place. At that time, more signals about raising the headline fiscal deficit and bond issuance for the next year should come to light. Many economists expect that the size of the overall stimulus package might be counted in the trillions of yuan. But Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, said China's policymakers may not announce an overall figure at all. ‘First, they don't need to come up with such a number for the [NPC] to approve. Second, it's hard to come up with such a number, as the line between fiscal, monetary and industrial policies is often blurred in China,- he said in a note on Saturday. And it would be politically incorrect to be seen flooding the economy with money in China, especially after the ‘4 trillion yuan stimulus' in 2008, he added. Back then, the number was first announced by the former premier at a State Council executive meeting and disclosed to the public a few days later.- Third, Xinhua reports that China unveiled a national mid and long-term development program for space science on Tuesday, which will guide the country's planning of space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050. -The program, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office. The program outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap. The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, panoramic view of Sun-Earth, habitable planets, and biological and physical sciences in space, Ding Chibiao, vice president of the CAS, said at the press conference.- The report adds: -In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the space station operation, implementing the manned lunar exploration project, and the fourth phase of its lunar exploration program as well as the planetary exploration project. Five to eight space science satellite missions will be approved during the period, according to the program.

Special Report: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. I am thrilled to share the publication of my latest paper: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China. Share Tracking People's Daily This paper recommends a pathway for India to arrive at a new modus vivendi in its relationship with China. I begin by providing an overview of the current state of the relationship and structural factors that are shaping its direction. Thereafter, the paper provides a detailed assessment of the Indian debate on China and Chinese discourse on India before recommending a way forward. In essence, I argue that volatility is likely to be the norm in the India-China dyad owing to certain structural factors. However, it is in the interest of both sides to ensure a certain amount of stability and predictability in the relationship. In order to do so, the paper contends that Indian strategy should be focussed on expanding national power and dealing with China from a position of strength, while building new mechanisms of engagement and scrutiny. The paper ends with six broad recommendations for Indian policy going ahead. I hope that these serve as a starting point for a robust debate on Indian policy, what is a desirable relationship with China, and what India should be doing to ensure that we get there.

They discuss the importance of economic cooperation, and Katz notes the 20,000 Chinese workers who remained in Israel during the war. ‘We agreed to continue the relationship and work together to strengthen the ties between the countries based on the long-standing friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people,' says Katz's office.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua's report on Wang's call with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi has Wang saying that -China will continue to demonstrate a sense of duty as a responsible major country and play a constructive role in promoting the cooling down of the conflict-.

Iran highly values China's influence in international affairs and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to cool down the situation through diplomatic means, Araghchi said, adding that Israel should avoid taking risks and proceed cautiously.- -Wang said that the negative impacts of the current Gaza conflict are clearly spilling over, and regional tensions are escalating continuously. China has always advocated for resolving hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation and opposes exacerbating tensions, expanding conflicts and taking military adventures, Wang said, calling on all parties to make more efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wang said that China will proceed from the merits of the issue, strengthen communication among all parties, build a broader international consensus, and pool the strengths of all parties. Wang said that China is pleased to see the Iranian government carry out mediation diplomacy, enhance understanding with relevant parties and improve relations with regional countries.

This fully demonstrates that promoting the development of the private economy is a fundamental policy that the Party and the country will consistently and persistently uphold. Once these principles are enshrined in law, they will gain stability and binding force, which will certainly promote the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy, and create a better environment for the joint development of all types of ownership, including the private economy.- -。，‘'‘'，‘、、，'，。，、、，. -In response to issues such as local protectionism and market fragmentation, more stringent institutional measures with binding force will be introduced and implemented. The revision of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People's Republic of China will be accelerated to prevent and curb unfair competition. The implementation of the Fair Competition Review System will be further strengthened, promoting the removal of policies and measures that hinder a unified market and fair competition, thereby unlocking the potential of China's vast market. Efforts will be made to strengthen comprehensive governance of market order, with a focus on cracking down on illegal activities such as intellectual property infringement, trade secret theft, and the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, in order to enhance business vitality through a well-ordered market environment.- 、，。《》，。《》，，。，、，.

The article begins by making the case that China's long-term fundamentals remain strong. It says that through this year, -overall economic performance has been stable with steady progress; however, some new situations and problems have also emerged-. --，、，，。 The piece begins talking about the September 26 Politburo meeting, which discussed the economy. The meeting called to -effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency of doing a good job in economic work- and -strive to complete the goals and tasks of economic and social development throughout the year.- 926，。，，----. Section one then says that in order to strive to achieve the year's goals, -we must strengthen our confidence in overcoming difficulties-. Then we get some data points from the holidays: The trade-in program for home appliances during the National Day holiday led to the sales of eight categories of home appliances under the program reaching 17.835 billion yuan. During the seven-day National Day holiday, domestic tourist numbers and total tourist spending increased by 10.2% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2019. The article then says: -Currently, all regions and departments are conscientiously implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. A series of measures to support stable economic growth and high-quality development have been introduced in quick succession, effectively guiding societal expectations and strengthening confidence in China's economy.- ，，，，. Then we get some sprinkling of positive information about the real estate sector and consumption vouchers and subsidies by local governments. For instance: -On October 1st, the online signing area of newly constructed commercial housing in Shandong reached 93,800 square meters, a year-on-year increase of 46.8%. From October 1st to noon on October 3rd, compared to the same period last year, Beijing saw a 92.5% increase in new home viewings and a doubling of purchase intentions, while second-hand home viewings increased by 104.1%. Some properties in Guangzhou received over 150 visits per day, a 200% increase compared to normal times.- 101，9.38，46.8%。1013，92.5%、2，104.1%。150，200%. This next macro assessment is worth reading: -On one hand, the external environment has become increasingly complex, severe, and uncertain, and the adverse effects of changes in the external environment on China's economy have increased. The ‘global economy is stagnant', said the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report, updated in July. Currently, major world economies are experiencing weak growth momentum and heavy debt burdens. Many have recently implemented interest rate cuts, and international market volatility has increased. Global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertainty and instability have increased. These factors will have an adverse impact on China through trade, investment, finance and other channels. In particular, it is important to note that some external forces are trying to contain, blockade, and suppress China, deliberately attempting to hinder the historical process of building a socialist modern power in an all-round way and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Rhetoric about ‘decoupling and breaking supply chains' and ‘small yards with high walls' has become louder, reflecting the increasing complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment China faces. On the other hand, while China's economy continues to recover and improve, downward pressure has increased. Since the third quarter, key economic indicators such as industrial production, investment, and consumption have fluctuated. Some industries are experiencing ‘involution-style' competition, and some enterprises are struggling to adapt to optimization, upgrading, or transformation. In some cases, increased production has not led to increased revenue or profits, some companies face significant operational difficulties, and in some sectors hidden risks remain relatively high.- ，，。--，7《》。，、，，，，，、、。，、、，、。----，、、。，，，、，--，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The article then says that given all this, where does confidence come from? The answer is that first, -confidence comes from a deep understanding of (China's) development advantages.- -Since the new era, under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, China's economic development has formed significant advantages. Deeply understanding, utilizing, consolidating, and developing these important advantages is not only a key support for the long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy but also an essential foundation for solving the challenges faced in economic development. China's development benefits from five strategic advantages: the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the notable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the solid foundation accumulated through sustained rapid development, a long-term stable social environment, and the spiritual strength of self-confidence and self-reliance. Additionally, China possesses the institutional advantage of a socialist market economy, the demand advantages of a super-large-scale market, the supply advantages of a complete supporting industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs, which have laid a solid foundation for responding to risks and challenges…History and reality have repeatedly proven that the creation and continuation of China's economic miracle is inseparable from the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the fundamental guarantee of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. On the path forward, as long as we steadfastly uphold the Party's comprehensive leadership and give full play to the role of the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the giant ship of China's economy will surely ride the wind and waves and sail towards a brighter future.- ，，。、、，，。--：、、、、。，、、、，。，--，，，；，，，、，、，，……，，。，，，，. Second, confidence comes from -a deep understanding of the development trend.- Under this point, we basically get selective economic data citation, along with the argument that China's -innovation power and development vitality are surging-, with factors supporting the development of new quality productive and high-quality development surging. This paragraph is useful with quotes from Xi. The reason I point this out is because it is indicative of deep anxieties. Think of this as a pep-talk by a coach at the back of a terrible inning to pick up the team. -What determines the prospects of economic development is never how many difficulties there are, but how we view difficulties, how we resolve to solve them, and how we deal with them. Only by looking at the long-term and trends from a development perspective can we overcome difficulties more effectively. ‘China's development prospects are bright, and we have the confidence and assurance to say so'. ‘The world today is undergoing unprecedented changes not seen in a century, but time and momentum are on our side. This is where our determination and confidence lie.' ‘When have there not been difficulties? We tackle them one by one, year after year, and the Chinese nation has been doing this for over 5,000 years. Overcoming challenges is crucial to boosting confidence.' General Secretary Xi Jinping's profound expositions contain a profound ‘grand historical perspective'. Based on the ‘grand historical perspective', we can more deeply understand that the ‘long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy have not changed and will not change'.- ，，、、。、，。-，。--，，，。--？，、，5000。，。-，--。--，--。 The second section calls to accurately grasp the focus of policy measures. First the section talks about investments in water conservancy projects. It says that from January to August this year, national investment in water conservancy construction reached 801.94 billion yuan, an increase of 10.7% compared to the high level of the same period last year, setting a new record. The number of water conservancy projects implemented and the number of jobs created both exceeded those of the same period last year, making significant contributions to promoting sustained economic growth and stable development. Among these, more than 7,800 water conservancy construction projects were arranged with newly issued national bonds, with investments of 303.77 billion yuan completed. 18，8019.4，10.7%，，、，。，7800，3037.7. -As the external environment becomes more complex and severe, the role of domestic demand in ensuring China's stable economic growth has become more prominent. 700 billion yuan in central budget investment has already been allocated, and all of the 700 billion yuan designated for ‘two major' constructions from the 1 trillion yuan of ultra long-term special government bonds has been fully allocated to projects…Since the beginning of this year, the proactive fiscal policy has been moderately strengthened and improved in quality and efficiency. The role of government investment has been leveraged and efforts have been intensified to lay the foundation, benefit the long-term, make up for shortcomings, and adjust the structure. High-quality investment is becoming an important driving force for promoting high-quality development. Additionally, the 300 billion yuan in national bond funds supporting the ‘two new' initiatives has been fully allocated, providing stronger support for expanding domestic demand. ，。7000，1--7000……，、，，、、、，。，--3000，. -To strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks, we must increase the intensity of countercyclical policy adjustments, strengthen the overall coordination and systematic integration of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and tax policy, monetary and financial policy, investment and consumption, and income distribution; strengthen the coordinated innovation of policy tools, grasp the timing and effectiveness of policy implementation, amplify the policy combination effect, and enhance the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation.- ，，、、、，，，，. The article then signals support for the private economy, by talking about the release of the draft Private Economy Promotion Law, which is open for public comments until November 8. The article also mentions the issuance of living allowances to people. It also references the Guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Implementing the Employment First Strategy. It says that this is the first time since the new era that the central government has issued a guiding document to promote employment. Also, in order to achieve the goals for the year, the article calls to maintain -the bottom line of people's livelihood, strengthen assistance and support for low-income people, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food and water, electricity, gas and heat, and effectively ensure food and agricultural production to ensure national food security.- The final section of the article calls on everyone to take on responsibilities and act. The goal is to break through the -stubborn diseases of formalism and bureaucratism.- -Reform the defects in thinking, eliminate chronic problems in work style, and promote a spirit of practical action. In the current situation, to truly enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency in doing economic work well, we must resolutely overcome simplistic thinking, inertial thinking, and responsibility-avoiding thinking, and use ideological breakthroughs to promote practical action and responsibility-taking. Resolutely break the negative mindset of ‘just getting by without striving for excellence' in doing work, and discard the selfish attitude of ‘not taking risks, taking up fewer tasks'; resolutely eliminate the dependency on ‘first consulting the old almanacs (sort of like resorting to past experiences)' when encountering issues, and discard the lax approach of ‘lying flat and watching, being conservative and procrastinating'; resolutely break the stability-seeking mentality of ‘first thinking about avoiding responsibility, not thinking about taking responsibility' when doing things, and discard the mistaken understanding that ‘doing more leads to more mistakes, doing less leads to fewer mistakes, doing nothing leads to no mistakes'... Great winds and waves are precisely the touchstones for testing responsibility and commitment. Setting good benchmarks for selecting and appointing people, and encouraging cadres to better assume responsibilities, can cultivate firm doers and pragmatists for the construction of Chinese-style modernization, achieve success through overcoming difficulties, open up paths in daring to forge ahead, and develop a bright future for China's economy through unremitting struggle.- 、、。，，、、，。-、-，-、-；--，-、-；-、-，-、、-……，。，，、，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily While on the economy, I am still catching up with the developments of the past 10 days or so. Anyway, Caixin reports: China's finance ministry on Saturday announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers, and promised intensive support to help localities with their hidden debts… ‘Countercyclical' fiscal measures are ‘by no means' limited to those announced Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Foan said at a press conference on the same day, adding that policymakers are studying other policy tools. For example, the central government has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt, he noted…Tools including local government special-purpose bonds (SPBs), special funds and tax policies will be used in tandem to arrest the slide in the real estate market, Lan said. The central government will allow local authorities to tap their SPB proceeds, mainly used for funding government projects, to buy back undeveloped land from developers, according to Liao Min, a vice finance minister. In some regions, SPB proceeds can also be used to increase the reserve of land for sale, Liao said.- On local government debts, the report adds: -At the press briefing, Lan said that the central government had allowed local governments to use bond quotas of 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) and more than 2.2 trillion yuan in 2024 and 2023, respectively, to resolve hidden debt and pay overdue arrears to businesses. He added that the central government will step up support for local governments to deal with their debts by expanding the quota for swapping off-the-books for on-the-books debt. This will be a one-time expansion of a ‘relatively large scale,' the minister said, noting that it can free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents. ‘This forthcoming policy will be the most significant measure introduced in recent years to support (hidden) debt resolution,' Lan said, noting that it will be detailed after going through legal procedures. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also pledged to issue special treasury bonds to help major state-owned commercial banks supplement their core capital. The program is already in the works, Liao said. A cross-department work group, including the MOF, is waiting for banks to hand in their capital injection plans, he said, noting that the lenders will publish their plans according to rules for listed companies.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There is a confirmation that Li will be heading to Pakistan for the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting. Also, there is a brief report informing that Li Xiaoxin, who is the deputy chief of the Organisation Department, led a delegation to Russia from October 9 to 12. Page 3: There's a report with data on China's shipbuilding industry. It says: -From January to September, the shipbuilding completion volume was 36.34 million deadweight tons, an increase of 18.2% year-on-year; new orders were 87.11 million deadweight tons, an increase of 51.9% year-on-year; and as of the end of September, the backlog of orders was 193.30 million deadweight tons, an increase of 44.3% year-on-year. From January to September, China's three major shipbuilding indicators accounted for 55.1%, 74.7% and 61.4% of the global total in terms of deadweight tons.- Subscribe now Page 8: There is an article by Yang Wanming, Party Secretary and President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). He is writing in the context of Xi's speech recently marking the 70th anniversary of the CPAFFC. In that speech, Xi had said: -People are the creators of history, and building a community with a shared future for mankind is the future of the people of all countries in the world. China is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with friends from all countries, give full play to the unique role of people-to-people diplomacy, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- He had then made three points: First, we should build a broad consensus on promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind in the spirit of ‘shared responsibility as dwellers of the same planet'…China is willing to work with all countries in the world to promote the common values ​​of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and an inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, and make the planet Earth a peaceful, friendly and harmonious home for all-. --，。，，。--，--。，，，。，、、、、、，、、、，、，、、. Second, we must gather a strong force to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through the concept of win-win cooperation. The Communist Party of China is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also a party that seeks progress for mankind and world harmony. I proposed the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and the GDI, GSI and GCI, all in order to promote the building of a better world and create a better life for people of all countries. The practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind for more than 10 years has brought many inspirations. One of the important ones is that only through win-win cooperation can we accomplish things, do good things, and do great things. China does not pursue self-centered modernization, and welcomes more foreign friends to actively participate in China's modernization process. The country is committed to providing new opportunities for global development with its achievements in modernization, and promoting a global modernization that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity to better benefit people of all countries.- ，。、，、。、、，，。10，，、、。，。，，，、、，. Third, with an open and inclusive mindset, we should embrace all civilizations to build a community with a shared future for humanity…Harmony while maintaining diversity is the law governing the occurrence and development of all things, as well as the principle behind the transmission and development of human civilization. Mutual exchange and learning are essential requirements for the advancement of civilization and serve as important driving forces for the progress of human civilization, as well as for world peace and development. Chinese civilization is an open system formed in constant exchange and mutual learning with other civilizations, and remains ever new through its inclusiveness. The Chinese nation is an open and inclusive nation, and the Chinese people are kind and friendly people. China is willing to work with all parties to practice the GCI, promote a view of civilization that emphasizes equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness, enhance understanding and deepen friendship through sincere communication, transcend civilizational barriers through civilizational exchanges, transcend civilizational conflicts through civilizational mutual learning, and promote the world to develop in the direction of a community with a shared future. ，。-，。-，。，。，。，。，，、、、，，、，、，. In the article today, Yang writes that more than 300 international friends from nearly 100 countries attended the CPAFFC anniversary event. He writes that over the years the association has established -friendly exchange and cooperation relationships with over 400 organizations and institutions in more than 150 countries, coordinated and promoted the establishment of over 3,000 pairs of friendly city (province/state) relationships between China and more than 140 countries, and built a ‘circle of friends' and ‘network of partners' spanning five continents…- ，。、，150400，1403000（），----，----，、. It has coordinated and mobilised resources from international friendly cities, multinational corporations, friendly organizations, and various other sectors. It has promoted the establishment of diverse mechanisms for local exchanges between China and foreign countries and vigorously advanced pragmatic cooperation in fields such as trade, education, technology, culture, ecology, health, poverty alleviation, and human resources training, etc… ，。，、、，，、、、、、、、，，. Yang concludes with a few points for work going forward: We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for people-to-people exchanges, give full play to the role of friendly organisations as communication channels, continue to consolidate old friends and make new friends, enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and people of other countries, and lay a solid foundation for social public opinion of friendship between China and foreign countries. We will work with friends from all over the world to build more bridges of pragmatic cooperation, give full play to the role of international sister cities as cooperation platforms, mobilize resources and strengths in various fields at home and abroad, constantly innovate cooperation methods, expand cooperation fields, and enhance cooperation effectiveness, so that local and sister cities cooperation can better benefit people of all countries. We will work with friends from all countries to build more bridges for cultural exchanges, give full play to the role of cultural exchanges as a bond to link hearts and enhance friendship, carry out wide-ranging, in-depth and diversified cultural exchanges and mutual learning activities between China and foreign countries, inspiring mutual resonance of hearts, and promoting the ‘heart-to-heart communication, emotional bonding, and strength gathering' of the Chinese and foreign people. We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for youth friendship, fully leveraging the fundamental and long-term role of youth exchanges in the development of relations between countries, inviting more foreign youth to come to China, encouraging more Chinese youth to go out into the world, and striving to cultivate successors for the cause of friendship between Chinese and foreign people. ——，，，，、，，。——，，，，，、、，。——，，，、，、、，，-、、-。——，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Former Taiwan president Tsai ing-wen is in Europe. She will be visiting the Czech Republic and Brussels. She was also expected to travel to London, but that seems to have been cancelled -due to the British Foreign Office, which worried that such a visit could compromise Foreign Secretary David Lammy's first official visit to China next week.- Meanwhile, Xinhua reports that the Eastern Theater Command has just launched its ‘Joint Sword-2024B' drills in the Taiwan Strait and the north, south and east of the island of Taiwan. -Li Xi, spokesperson for the theater command, said the drills involve vessels and planes closing in on the island from multiple directions and assaults by joint forces. The drills focus on joint sea-air combat readiness patrol, the blockade and control of key ports and areas, strikes on sea and land targets, and the seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, so as to test the joint real-combat capabilities of the forces of the command, Li said. The drills are a powerful deterrent to the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' elements, and are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national sovereignty and national unity, Li said.- This comes after President Lai Ching-te's Double Tenth speech. Some key remarks: The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. On this land, democracy and freedom are growing and thriving. The People's Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan. Taiwan is resolved in our commitment to upholding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and achieving global security and prosperity. We are willing to work with China on addressing climate change, combatting infectious diseases, and maintaining regional security to pursue peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For a long time now, countries around the world have supported China, invested in China, and assisted China in joining the World Trade Organization, thereby promoting China's economic development and enhancing its national strength. This was done out of the hope that China would join the rest of the world in making global contributions, that internally it would place importance on the livelihoods of the people, and that externally it would maintain peace. As we stand here today, international tensions are on the rise, and each day countless innocents are suffering injuries or losing their lives in conflict. We hope that China will live up to the expectations of the international community, that it will apply its influence and work with other countries toward ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. And we hope that it will take up its international responsibilities and, along with Taiwan, contribute to the peace, security, and prosperity of the region and the globe. In an era when the international landscape is becoming increasingly chaotic, Taiwan will become more calm, more confident, and stronger; it will become a force for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. I believe that a stronger democratic Taiwan is not only the ideal of our 23 million people, but also the expectation of the international community. Beijing responded with anger. There's this latest Xinhua commentary, which says: -Recently, Lai continued to brazenly preach his ‘two states' claim, openly clamoring that ‘Taiwan has sovereignty' and that ‘the People's Republic of China (PRC) has no right to represent Taiwan'...The Taiwan regional leader repeatedly referred to the mainland as ‘China.' He has been playing with concepts and confusing right and wrong. By attempting to highlight the political differences between the two sides of the Strait and break up their historical ties, Lai fabricated the false concept that ‘the Republic of China equals Taiwan' out of thin air to further advance his ‘Taiwan independence' plot. Lai has been indulging in outright secessionist and blatantly provocative remarks. Certainly, his increasingly hostile words lead nowhere, only escalating tensions and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. If Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities continue going against the historical trend and pursuing their separatist line, they would plunge people in Taiwan into serious calamity.- Subscribe now	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/china-vietnam-deals-taiwan-drills	2024-10-13T19:42:29-07:00	
Xi on Ethnic Affairs Policy - PRC's 75th Anniversary - Li Calls to Accelerate Economic Measures - Friends for Peace Group on Ukraine - China's Afghan ...	Hi folks, I hope this finds everyone well. I wanted to begin with a brief announcement. I will be in Washington DC all of next week, starting October 7th. It would be really good to catch up with subscribers. So if you are in town during the week, please do drop me a line as an email response to this edition and we can schedule something. I will also be taking a break from the regular newsletter, given the holidays in China. Of course, as always, I'll try and cover any major developments or pieces that might be published. Cheers, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's remarks at the National Conference on Commending Models for Ethnic Unity and Progress. The entire speech was published in Saturday's edition of the paper. Xi had a lot of praise for the Party's policies: He said that the Party had combined -Marxist ethnic theory with the specific realities of China's ethnic issues and with the best of traditional Chinese culture, creatively blazing a right path with Chinese characteristics to solve ethnic issues. On this path, the CPC has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to achieve national independence and people's liberation, creating a new situation of developing equal, united, mutually supportive, and harmonious relations among all ethnic groups. It has promoted unprecedented progress in the economic and social development in ethnic regions and improved their lives. China's ethnic minorities, regions of ethnic groups, relations between different ethnic groups, and the Chinese nation have undergone profound and historic changes.- 。，、，。，，，，、、、. He added that since the 18th Party Congress, the Party has -continuously promoted the sinicization and modernization of Marxist ethnic theory, and clearly proposed to make the forging of a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation the main line of the Party's ethnic work in the new era and the main line of all work in ethnic regions, formed the Party's important thought on strengthening and improving ethnic work, promoted ethnic regions to join the other parts of the country in securing a victory in the fight against poverty, finished the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects…- ，，，、，，、，，。 Practice has proven that the path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics is completely correct. This path: focuses on the fundamental interests and overall interests of the Chinese nation, unites all ethnic groups to the greatest extent, and realises the common struggle and common prosperity of all ethnic groups; insists on the equality of all ethnic groups, opposes ethnic oppression and discrimination, and ensures that people of all ethnic groups truly obtain equal political rights and jointly become masters of their own country; correctly grasps the relationship between maintaining national unity and implementing ethnic regional autonomy, insists on combining unity with autonomy, and ethnic factors with regional factors, and promotes the Chinese nation to become a more cohesive and unified community with a shared future. ，。，，、；，，、；，、，、。 In the next bit, Xi talks about 5000 years of history and the creation of China as -a unified multi-ethnic country-. He says that the -formation and development of the Chinese nation community is the will of the people, the general trend, and the historical inevitability.- He makes five points to elaborate on this. First, -the intermingling of bloodlines of all ethnic groups has laid the historical foundation for the formation and development of a community for the Chinese nation.- He added: -History has fully proven that the Chinese nation is the result of long-term interaction, exchange, and integration among all ethnic groups. Only by continuously uniting and integrating, and consciously joining the big family of the Chinese nation, can all ethnic groups enjoy a brighter future.- ，。，，、，、，、。，，、，. Second, the shared convictions of all ethnic groups have served as the endogenous driving force for the founding of a unified multi-ethnic country. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has adhered to the concepts of ‘the six directions share the same customs, the nine regions are interconnected' and ‘there is great harmony under heaven', and regarded great unification as ‘the eternal principle of heaven and earth and the common truth of ancient and modern times'. Since the Qin Dynasty unified China, regardless of which ethnic group ruled the central plains, all have taken the unification of the country as their mission, firmly believing in the common principle that the nation's territory must not be divided, the country must not fall into chaos, ethnic groups must not be scattered, and civilization must not be interrupted. History has fully proven that our unified, multi-ethnic country was jointly created by all ethnic groups and must be jointly safeguarded, consolidated, and developed by them. ，。-，-，-。，，，、、、。，，、. (Note: This is an important paragraph, which allows for building the narrative of continuity with the rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties or Mongol and Manchu rule.) Third, the cultural connections among all ethnic groups are the cultural genes that have shaped the pluralistic and integrated civilization of the Chinese nation. The cultures of all ethnic groups have learned from and integrated with one another, gradually transcending regional, ancestral, and religious boundaries. This process has converged to form a Chinese culture with strong cohesion and appeal, shaping the unified yet diverse framework of Chinese civilization. History has fully proven that the brilliant Chinese culture was jointly created by all ethnic groups. To forge the new glory of socialist culture, we must continuously enhance identification with Chinese culture and further promote mutual learning and integration among the cultures of all ethnic groups. ，。、，、、，，。，，，. Fourth, the economic interdependence of all ethnic groups is the powerful force for building a unified economy. Our country has a vast territory, and the resource endowments of different regions each have their own characteristics, with strong economic complementarity and a high degree of interdependence. All ethnic groups have consistently maintained economic ties characterised by mutual exchange and mutual benefit, which has significantly strengthened the overall national power and promoted the formation and development of the Chinese national community. History has fully proved that only by continuously integrating into the overall development of the country and strengthening economic exchanges and cooperation can all regions and ethnic groups better promote national economic prosperity and better realise their own economic development. ，。，，、。、，，。，、，、. Fifth, the emotional bonds among all ethnic groups are the strong ties that bind the Chinese nation as one family. Harmonious coexistence, brotherhood, and mutual assistance have always been the mainstream of ethnic relations in our country. The close brotherly ties among various ethnic groups has left many heartwarming historical stories. Especially in the process of resisting foreign aggression, preventing division, and safeguarding unity, the people of all ethnic groups were unprecedentedly united, sharing a common hatred for the enemy, writing a magnificent epic of the Chinese nation's arduous struggles and earth-shaking greatness. History has fully proved that emotional closeness is a strong bond in the formation and development of the Chinese national community. All ethnic groups must cherish, continuously consolidate, and develop the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and constantly strengthen the emotional foundation for building the Chinese national community. ，。、、，。、、，、，、。，，、，. Xi ended this section by stating that the common goal of all ethnic groups is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Finally, Xi made five points about the tasks ahead in the -new era.- He said that -the central task of the Party and the country is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. This requires the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. We must comprehensively implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially the important thinking on strengthening and improving work on ethnic affairs, adhere to the main line of forging a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, continuously promote the cause of national unity and progress, and promote the high-quality development of the Party's ethnic work.- ，、，。，，，. First, always adhere to the leadership of the Party and constantly consolidate the common ideological and political foundation for the unity and struggle of all ethnic groups. The CPC is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the most reliable backbone of all ethnic groups. We must guide the people of all ethnic groups to continuously enhance their identification with the great motherland, the Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China, and socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly establish the concept of a community of sharing weal and woe, honour and disgrace, life and death, and destiny, and work together to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ，，。，。、、、、，、、、，. Second, we should focus on building a shared spiritual home for the Chinese nation, providing strong spiritual and cultural support for advancing the construction of the Chinese national community. To build a spiritual home shared by the Chinese nation, we must enhance the recognition of Chinese culture. We should take the core socialist values ​​as the guide, deepen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and guide the people of all ethnic groups to firmly establish a correct view of the state, history, ethnicity, culture and religions. We should strengthen the historical and cultural education of young people, comprehensively promote the popularisation of the national common language and characters, and comprehensively promote the use of state-approved textbooks, so as to instil the sense of community of the Chinese nation into the hearts of children from an early age. ，，。。，、、，、、、、。，，，. Third, accelerate the high-quality development of ethnic regions and solidly promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. To promote Chinese-style modernization and achieve common prosperity, no ethnic group can be left behind. We must support ethnic regions to accelerate their integration into the overall national development and promote closer economic integration and integration among all regions. Ethnic regions must fully and accurately implement the new development concept, continue to deepen reform and opening up, vigorously develop characteristic and advantageous industries, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. We must adhere to the safeguarding and improving people's livelihoods in the process of development, enhance the balance and accessibility of basic public services, do more practical things that conform to the will of the people, benefit the people's livelihood, and warm the hearts of the people, and continuously meet the yearning of people of all ethnic groups for a better life. ，，。、，。，、。，，，。，，、、，. Fourth, promote the all-round integration of all ethnic groups and actively promote exchanges and integration among all ethnic groups. Extensive interactions, exchanges, and integration are important ways to advance the construction of the Chinese national community. We must coordinate economic and social development planning and public resource allocation, strengthen the construction of infrastructure such as transportation in border areas and ethnic minority areas, actively promote people-oriented new urbanization, and promote the mobility and integration of all ethnic groups in an orderly manner. Build an interwoven social structure and community environment, continuously broaden the practical paths for the all-round integration of various ethnic groups, and promote their close unity like the seeds of a pomegranate. ，，。。，，，。，，. Fifth, govern ethnic affairs in accordance with the law, continually improve the capacity and level of governance in ethnic affairs. We must uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, gradually refine relevant laws and regulations as well as differentiated regional support policies, and ensure the legal rights and interests of people from all ethnic groups. We should strengthen legal education and public awareness, guiding people of all ethnic groups to enhance their national consciousness, civic consciousness, and legal consciousness. ，，。，，。，、、. Towards the end, Xi stresses this: -Addressing China's ethnic issues is our internal affairs, and no external forces have the right to interfere. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have found the correct path to solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics, and we do not need anyone else to point fingers at us or act as an ‘instructor'. We must resolutely oppose all attempts to infiltrate, sabotage, slander, contain and suppress our country by using ethnicity, religion and other issues. We must strengthen the research and propaganda of the history of the Chinese nation and the theory of the Chinese national community, actively carry out foreign cultural exchanges, and tell the story of the Chinese nation community well.- ，。，、--。、、、。，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, September 30, 2024. Page 1: The entire front page today is dedicated to events marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Xi awarded the highest state honours during the event. Four people, including veteran war hero Huang Zongde and medical scientist Wang Zhenyi, were awarded the Medal of the Republic. Ten individuals, including border patrolman Bayika Kalidibek, technician Xu Zhenchao, and acclaimed actress Tian Hua, were awarded national honorary titles. Dilma Rousseff, former Brazilian president and president of the New Development Bank, received the Friendship Medal. Xi also delivered a speech. Xi said that the -great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process-. Xinhua English has a decent summation of the key points: -Xi emphasized the need to bear in mind the ambition of making the country greater. ‘We should be loyal to the country, love the country, integrate personal development goals into the overall national development, and realize personal value in fulfilling duties for the country and serving the people,' he said. He encouraged the Chinese people to hone their skills and contribute to building a strong China. He urged them to strive for extraordinary achievements in ordinary job posts, and contribute to overcoming challenges related to development and reform while safeguarding social harmony and stability. ‘A great era calls for heroes and fosters heroes. A galaxy of heroes emerging generation after generation will ensure the lasting success of the Party and the people's cause,' Xi remarked.- Subscribe now Another report on the page informs of a concert to mark the 75th anniversary of the PRC's founding. Finally, there's a report telling us that a new official compilation of the chronicle of events during the New Democratic Revolution period (1921 to 1949) has been published. Page 3: There's a report on the State Council's executive meeting. The report said that the meeting sought to -study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the current economic situation and economic work at the meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, and to study and deploy the implementation of a package of incremental policies.- 929，，. -The meeting emphasised that it is necessary to unify thoughts and actions with the scientific judgement of the Party Central Committee on the economic situation, implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, implement the policies and measures that have been clarified, effectively implement macroeconomic control, promote the coordinated efforts of various policies, focus on addressing prominent issues in economic operation, and strive to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development for the entire year.- ，，，，，，，，. For each policy, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, and the pace of implementation should be accelerated. Policies that are relatively mature should be implemented immediately, while those that need further refinement should be worked on urgently, introducing them in batches as they become ready. All departments should not avoid difficulties or shirk responsibilities, but form a strong synergy in their work. At the same time, new incremental policies should be studied promptly in response to changing situations. In-depth investigations and research should be conducted, paying attention to opinions from all sides, to continuously optimise and improve policy measures. It is necessary to strengthen policy interpretation to better build consensus and enhance confidence. ，，，、。、，。，，。，，。，、. The meeting deployed relevant measures to accelerate the implementation of 102 major projects in the 14th FYP. The meeting pointed out that the implementation of 102 major projects during the 14th FYP period is an important deployment made by the Party Central Committee coordinating immediate and long-term needs. It is necessary to focus on the overall implementation of major projects, further consolidate the responsibilities of all parties, strengthen departmental coordination and central-local linkage, strengthen financial support and factor resource guarantees, address difficulties and bottlenecks, and ensure that the construction of major projects achieves the expected results. --102。，--102，。，，，，，. The meeting also discussed the construction of a universal childcare service system, and heard a report on progress in building up China's strength in intellectual property rights. On IPR, the meeting called to -strengthen the support of intellectual property rights for key core technology research, carry out special actions for patent transformation and application, implement the construction project of the intellectual property protection system, and provide strong support for achieving scientific and technological self-reliance and promoting high-quality development.- The draft revisions to the law on science and technology popularization and the law against unfair competition were discussed and approved in principle. Also on the page is a report on the State Council approving a set of revised regulations for commending fallen heroes. As per Xinhua, -the revised regulations stipulate improved criteria and assessment procedures for identifying martyrs, better financial support and preferential treatment for their families, and strengthened protection and management of their memorial facilities. The revised regulations also highlight the need to strengthen the dissemination of martyrs' heroic deeds and improve the protocols when paying homage to them. The revised regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Wang Yi's remarks at the UNGA general debate. The full English text is available on the MFA website. Key points: What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit. In today's world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity's common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable. Share Tracking People's Daily On Ukraine, Wang said: -An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to ‘no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,' and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace. The meeting of this group was chaired by the Chinese and Brazilians. 17 other ‘Global South' countries attended the meeting. At this meeting, Wang Yi said that: -The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is not about taking sides in the conflict, engaging in bloc confrontation, or replacing existing platforms. They hope to rely on the United Nations to bring together more Global South countries and send more objective, balanced and rational voices, so as to accumulate conditions and create an atmosphere for a ceasefire, an end to hostilities and the resumption of peace talks. The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is open and welcomes the joining of more like-minded countries, in particular, Global South countries.- He added: -China hopes that the parties involved will consider resuming peace talks at an appropriate time, meet each other halfway in their dialogue, and seek common ground while shelving differences in their negotiations, fairly discuss all peace plans, and promote the establishment of a new security architecture.- He also called for -peaceful coexistence- and said that -it is necessary to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries, observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, value the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and ensure the legitimate living space of all ethnic groups.- A joint communique was issued by Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Türkiye, and Zambia. Subscribe now Back to Wang's comments at the UNGA debate. On Palestine, he said that -might must not take the place of justice.- He called for a -comprehensive ceasefire- and Palestinian statehood and full UN membership. On Afghanistan, he said that -it is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people's life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.- Interestingly, at the sidelines of the UNGA, there was a meeting between China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran on Afghanistan. Wang Yi made four points at this meeting: First, build security together. Closely track the movements of terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan, strengthen intelligence exchange and sharing, and expand law enforcement and security cooperation. Fully utilize the anti-terrorism security collaboration functions of platforms such as the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Afghanistan's Neighboring Countries and the SCO to jointly address risks and challenges, and ultimately achieve the goal of eradicating violent extremist groups within Afghanistan. 。，，。、，，. Second, implement comprehensive measures. Jointly implement the ‘Tunxi Initiative' to support Afghanistan's reconstruction, help Afghanistan cultivate self-development capabilities through deepening regional economic and trade investment, interconnectivity, and major project cooperation. Support the SCO in playing a greater role in Afghan issues, support the UN in coordinating the international community to stabilize and assist Afghanistan, help Afghanistan improve its humanitarian predicament, and promote reconstruction and development. 。--，、，。，，，. Third, uphold justice. Make Afghanistan a platform for cooperation among all parties, not a venue for geopolitical games. US actions of cutting off aid, freezing assets, and imposing sanctions on Afghanistan are key factors preventing substantial improvement in Afghanistan's economic and livelihood difficulties. The US should use the seized Afghan overseas assets to support Afghanistan in alleviating livelihood difficulties, developing alternative crops to drugs, and resettling returning refugees. 。，。、、，。，，. Fourth, provide positive guidance. Encourage the international community to focus on the most pressing and urgent difficulties facing Afghanistan, promote Afghanistan's reconstruction and development in a constructive manner, and guide the Afghan governing authorities to improve and strengthen the protection of the rights of women and children in an equal and respectful way. Strengthen the exchange of governance experiences with Afghanistan in a flexible manner, encourage the Islamic world, especially Gulf countries, to exert special influence, and support Afghanistan in exploring a modernization path that aligns with the requirements of the times and the wishes of the people. 。，，。，，. Subscribe now Back to Wang's UNGA speech. He added -the Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.- Wang also said this about Asia: -China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.- After this, Wang pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He then said: In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba. On environmental issues, he said: -At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.- On AI governance, he said: -We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.'s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building-. On human rights, he said: -China maintains that all countries' right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others' internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse.- After this, there's a big chunk on Taiwan: -Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People's Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as ‘two Chinas,' or ‘one China, one Taiwan.' On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.- Share Tracking People's Daily The final bit in the speech is about how China's modernization benefits the world. Moving on, Wang Yi also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Chinese readout says that the -two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future…and agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course.- Wang said that: -The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.- -Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ‘Taiwan independence' activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence' and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ‘Taiwan independence', and support the peaceful reunification of China. Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ‘small yard, high fence' should not become ‘big yard, iron curtain'. China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions. Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there. Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The State Department said that the two had -candid, substantive, and productive discussions-. It adds: -Secretary Blinken underscored the United States' continued concern with PRC support for Russia's defense industrial base and war of aggression against Ukraine and made clear the need for the PRC to address Russia's threat to transatlantic security. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and raised concerns about the PRC's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Secretary Blinken reiterated that it remains a top priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are detained or subject to exit bans in China. He also raised human rights concerns, including with respect to Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. The Secretary discussed concerns related to technology; U.S. policy remains designed to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security. Both sides agreed to maintain contact, including on regional and global issues. Another important report is the one on Wang Yi's meeting with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul. Wang told him that: -As long as both sides adhere to the original intent of establishing diplomatic ties, remain committed to a friendly direction and pursue mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, it is believed that the China-South Korea relationship can continue to develop in a healthy and forward-looking manner. As close neighbors and important cooperation partners, China and South Korea should create favorable conditions for their respective development and the development of bilateral relations, Wang said. The deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in the region undermines regional peace and stability and does not serve the interests of regional countries, Wang said, adding that war and chaos must not occur on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula is in the common interest of all parties. China will continue to mediate and promote talks, playing a constructive role in achieving long-term peace and stability on the Peninsula, he said.- For some context, Reuters' report informs: -The U.S. deployed the Typhon system, which can be equipped with cruise missiles capable of striking Chinese targets, this year. China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fuelling an arms race.- Subscribe now Page 10: There's a report on the PBOC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration announcing new measures (English report) to stabilize the real estate market. The mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more are required to be reduced no lower than 30 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) by Oct. 31, 2024. In principle, 18 national commercial banks need to release their plans for adjustments before Oct. 12. The minimum down payment ratio for individuals' commercial housing mortgages will be lowered to no less than 15 percent for both first-home and second-home purchases. The central bank will increase funding for financial institutions if they issue loans to support local state-owned enterprises to acquire completed yet unsold commercial housing at reasonable prices for use as affordable housing. A Bloomberg report informs: On Sunday, the trading hub of Guangzhou became the first tier-1 city to remove all restrictions, saying it will stop reviewing homebuyer eligibility and no longer limit the number of homes owned. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen said they will allow more people to purchase residences in suburban areas, as well as allow others to buy more homes. Shanghai, China's financial hub, and Shenzhen, the southern city known for its tech industry, also announced they were lowering minimum downpayment ratios for first and second homes to 15% and 20%, respectively, in a bid to boost demand. The loosening in Shanghai and Shenzhen is slightly less than expected, while Guangzhou went further than anticipated, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts including Shujin Chen. ‘We think the policies are unlikely to turn property prices around, but they could ease potential price declines,' Chen wrote in a note on Monday.- Finally, although it is not in the paper, do note this article about the Chinese, Russian coast guards jointly conducing drills and patrols in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean. The report says: -The operation aimed to maintain order in high-seas fisheries. During the mission, the vessels also conducted joint exercises in search and rescue, damage control and locating illegal vessels, demonstrating the strong collaborative capabilities of the two coast guards.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Stimulating the Economy - Wang Yi's AI, GDI & BRICS Pitches - Wang Meets 'Old Friend of the Chinese People' Muhammad Yunus - China on Hopes for Ties w...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, September 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead story on the page is the readout from the Politburo's meeting on the economy. I covered this in yesterday's edition. Before I get to other reports, let me highlight the following: First, this really helpful graphic from Hutong Research. It lists the efforts at cash infusion. Second, this Reuters report summarises the steps being taken. On the heels of the Politburo huddle, China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus, two sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters. On Tuesday by Governor Pan Gongsheng, the People's Bank of China on Friday trimmed the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, known as the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), by 50 basis points, the second reduction this year. The move is expected to release 1 trillion yuan ($142.5 billion) in liquidity into the banking system and was accompanied by a cut in the benchmark interest rate on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by 20 bps to 1.50%. Reuters reported on Thursday that 1 trillion yuan due to be raised via special bonds will be used to increase subsidies for a consumer goods replacement programme and for the upgrade of large-scale business equipment. They will also be used to provide a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children, excluding the first child. China also aims to raise another 1 trillion yuan via a separate special sovereign debt issuance to help local governments tackle their debt problems. Third, today the PBOC has cut the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent. Xinhua reports that the interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The central bank conducted 278 billion yuan (about 39.66 billion U.S. dollars) of 14-day reverse repos on Friday at an interest rate of 1.65 percent, 20 basis points lower than the previous day. A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. The central bank also announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for financial institutions on Friday. Share Tracking People's Daily Okay, now back to the paper. The other main story is Xi Jinping's letter to the faculty and students of the Communication University of China on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Xinhua reports: -Xi urged the university to take solid steps to implement the fundamental task of fostering virtues and educating people on the new journey in the new era. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the needs of the press and public communication, highlighting the university's distinctive features, deepening reform and innovation, and continuously improving its teaching and research capacity, in a bid to cultivate more high-caliber journalism and communication professionals and make new contributions to the development of the Party's cause concerning public communication and culture.- Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with Tanzila Narbayeva, chairperson of the Senate of Uzbekistan. Xinhua says: Wang said that -under the guidance of the two heads of state, the development of China-Uzbekistan relations has entered a new stage with fruitful cooperation in various fields. Following the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to push for steady and long-term growth of the bilateral ties, Wang said. Wang noted that the CPPCC National Committee is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Uzbekistan to better serve the construction of their respective countries and the development of bilateral relations.- Among other things, Narbayeva said that Uzbekistan adheres to the one-China principle. Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel in Beijing. Xinhua reports: Ding -said that China and Nepal -- two nations linked by mountains and rivers -- have enjoyed lasting friendship, setting a fine example of equality and mutual benefits between countries of different sizes. He said that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, China is ready to work with Nepal to deepen exchange and cooperation in various fields, build a high-quality Belt and Road, consolidate popular support for the bilateral friendship, and push China-Nepal relations to a higher level. Paudel said that Nepal abides firmly by the one-China principle, supports China steadfastly in safeguarding its core interests, and hopes to strengthen its exchange of governance experience with China and deepen practical cooperation in various fields.- Paudel also met with He Lifeng earlier. PTI reports that: -He assured Paudel that the Chinese government would accelerate the execution of previously announced projects, according to a press release issued by the Nepal Finance Ministry. The Communist Party leader also requested assistance from the northern neighbour in expanding direct air services from various Chinese cities to Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports…The two leaders discussed about advancing key infrastructure projects being implemented with China's assistance, such as the construction of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, the Kimathangka-Hile and Hilsa-Surkhet-Bhurigaun roads, Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University, and Damak Industrial Park. Chinese leader He underscored the importance of implementing the agreements to further strengthen the bilateral ties and also expressed his desire to expedite the development projects including infrastructure, transport and connectivity.- Subscribe now Next, there is a long article celebrating Xi's leadership of China's modernization drive. The piece refers to him as the people's leader. Also, there is another long article detailing the -record of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in promoting the strengthening of the sense of community of the Chinese nation.- Page 3: Okay, back to Wang Yi in the US. Let me begin with his speech at the BRICS foreign ministers meeting. Wang called the BRICS the -leading force of the Global South-, which must work towards -promoting an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization.- -We must advocate common security and achieve lasting peace. In today's interdependent world, mankind is an indivisible security community. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda, let alone build its own security on the insecurity of other countries. We must make good use of mechanisms such as the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Meeting of High Representatives for Security Affairs to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspot issues and jointly address various challenges. On the Ukraine issue, we must insist on preventing the spillover of conflict, avoiding the escalation of warfare, and preventing any party from fueling the fire. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. Brazil and China jointly issued the ‘Six-Point Consensus', which has received positive responses from more than 100 countries to varying degrees. On the Palestinian issue, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, support Palestine to become a formal member of the United Nations, implement the ‘two-state solution', and achieve lasting peace in the Middle East.- ，。，。，。、，，。，、、，。--，100。，。、，，--，. We must prioritise development and solve development problems. Development is the eternal theme of human society and an important yardstick of progress in the era. President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI, which has been actively supported by the United Nations and the vast majority of developing countries. The BRICS should give full play to its own advantages, promote the development issue to be placed at the centre of the United Nations' work, pay attention to the practical difficulties of developing countries, urge developed countries to earnestly fulfil their commitments, and inject stronger impetus into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We should focus on the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, energy and food security, seize the opportunities of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and cultivate new momentum for high-quality development. ，。，。，。，，，，2030。、、，，. We must uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world falls into chaos. When hegemonic behaviour runs rampant, human civilization regresses to the law of the jungle. We must firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, opposing the practice of using multilateralism only when it is convenient and abandoning it when it is not. Taking the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit of the Future as an opportunity, we should promote reforms in the international financial architecture, support the full participation of southern countries in international economic decision-making, governance, and rule-making, and enhance their voice and representation. The resolution on Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence jointly proposed by China and many southern countries has been overwhelmingly approved by the UN General Assembly, and we welcome BRICS countries to participate in its implementation so that developing countries can broadly benefit. ，。，。，。，，-，-。，，、，。--，，. He then talked about supporting Russia in hosting the BRICS summit in October. He also called to ‘create new landmark achievements in the fields of finance, artificial intelligence, energy and minerals to ensure that the BRICS+ cooperation can get off to a good start. We must also accelerate the completion of the work of setting up partner countries. This is the consensus reached by BRICS leaders at last year's Johannesburg Summit, and it is also the mission we should accomplish. Continue to open the door for expansion, to add vitality and momentum to BRICS development.- ，，、。，，、。、、，--、。，，，，、.

Wang said: -over the past three years since the inception of the GDI, it has evolved from a Chinese proposition to an international consensus, and from a cooperation concept to joint actions, contributing China's solutions and injecting Chinese strength into the implementation of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development…We held a High-level Dialogue on Global Development, a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, and two Global Shared Development Action Forums, effectively building consensus on international development cooperation and promoting all parties to recommit to and start again on the Sustainable Development Goals.- ，，、，2030，...，--，，，、. Then Wang put forward some data around GDI. Over the past three years, more than 100 countries and more than 20 international organizations have actively supported and participated in the Initiative, and 82 countries have joined the Friends of GDI group. More than 70 countries and international organizations have joined the Global Development Promotion Center Network, more than 50 parties have signed cooperation documents on GDI with China, and the United Nations has established a GDI Promotion Working Group.10020，82--。70，50，. We have invested and mobilised nearly $20 billion in various development funds, established more than 30 cooperation platforms in eight key areas, established a global development promotion center, and are actively preparing to build a ‘Global South Research Center.

Moreover, we have organized over 2,000 capacity-building projects for developing countries, training more than 60,000 talents in various fields. From technical cooperation to capacity building, from poverty alleviation and education to the digital economy, from high-yield rice to fungus grass processing, the cooperation under the initiative has deepened and materialized, bringing benefits to the Global South. 、。32，1100，600。2000，6。，，，，--. Share Tracking People's Daily Third, Wang Yi's speech at the High-level Conference on International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building. Wang called for: comprehensive and balanced governance of AI openness without building walls, interconnection without decoupling, equality without discrimination, and working together to create an open, inclusive, inclusive, and non-discriminatory environment for the development of AI, so that the dividends of AI can benefit all countries. He added that AI should not and cannot be reduced to a tool for maintaining hegemony and pursuing superiority. establishing an AI governance mechanism with universal participation from all countries under the UN framework, so that all countries can participate and benefit equally. Using one's own values ​​as the only criterion for judgement will only artificially create differences and obstacles, and will not be conducive to mankind working together to meet new challenges. 。、、、，，，。，。。，、、，、、、，。、。。，，。，、。，，. He then made five areas of China's work: China is willing to cooperate with all countries, especially developing countries, in building AI infrastructure and advancing the global layout of interoperable AI and digital infrastructure. China is willing to carry out AI models development and empowerment cooperation, build an international cooperation platform for AI capacity building, build an open source AI community in a responsible manner, and build a rich, diverse, healthy and benevolent AI development ecosystem in accordance with local conditions. China will organize short-term education and training on AI capacity building for developing countries, AI knowledge and expertise through a combination of online and offline methods. We will organize 10 AI training and seminar programs for developing countries by the end of 2025. China is willing to work with all countries, especially developing countries, to jointly develop AI corpora, promote and improve data infrastructure, promote and protect the diversity of civilizations, and promote fair and inclusive use of global data. China is ready to collaborate with all parties to strengthen strategic alignment and policy exchanges on AI, actively sharing policy and technical practices in AI testing, evaluation, certification, and regulation, and jointly addressing AI ethics and safety risks. ，。，。，-+-。，，，、。，。，，。2025。，。，，，。，。，、、，。，--，。 China proposes the establishment of a ‘Group of Friends for International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building' and welcomes all countries to actively support and participate.

Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Wang Yi's meeting with Sergei Lavrov. Wang said that the experience of China-Russia ties shows that -as long as we adhere to permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic cooperation, and mutually beneficial cooperation and win-win results, China-Russia relations will move forward…Both sides should continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism, defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and promote the building of a more just and reasonable global governance system with the United Nations at its core. China will fully support Russia in playing its role as the BRICS chair, ensure the complete success of the Kazan Summit, and open up a new situation for BRICS+ cooperation.- They also talked about the upcoming 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Wang also met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Wang told him that: -China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes and advocated that all hotspot issues should be resolved politically through dialogue, and the same is true for the Ukrainian issue. China does not engage in geopolitical games or pursue its own self-interests, but has always actively promoted peace and negotiations, working to build consensus for peace. China has always paid attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, has provided four batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and is willing to provide new assistance according to Ukraine's needs. We hope that Ukraine will continue to take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Ukraine. We are willing to maintain communication with all parties, including Ukraine, and continue to do what China believes is right to strive for peace at an early date.- ，，。，，，。，，。，。，，. While on this, do check out Politico's reporting on a Ukrainian assessment of Wang's agenda at the UNGA. The report says: -China wants to work behind the scenes at the United Nations to enlist international support for an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, according to a Ukrainian government document. The Chinese government came into this week's U.N. General Assembly with a plan to seek support from countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa that would freeze battle lines in the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, according to the document obtained by POLITICO. The U.S. is opposed to the deal and Ukrainian officials are alarmed by it — so much so that they have circulated the document among diplomats gathered in New York for the UNGA. In its proposal, China is trying to persuade diplomats to support peace talks focused on -taking into account the security interests of each country- with the objective of -preventing Russia from losing- the war, according to the document. The paper, which was drafted by the Ukrainian government ahead of this week's high-level U.N. meetings, does not say how Kyiv is aware of China's strategy. Ukraine is also pushing on multiple fronts this week to dissuade allies from embracing the China-backed plan. Ukraine's U.N. mission in New York did not respond to a request for comment on the document. Beijing's game plan in New York involves enlisting the support of some two dozen countries -to form some kind of ‘core' group which in the future can quickly expand [to include] other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia,- the document said. China seeks their endorsement for its plan to initiate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine based around a China-Brazil joint six-point proposal released in May. That document urges -no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party.- That would allow Russia to continue hostilities at their current intensity as well as its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The six-point proposal hinges on -an international peace conference … recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.- Also noteworthy part in the report is this bit: -China's pursuit of India's support could create particular trouble for Ukraine. Kyiv has been hoping that New Delhi may help broker a peace pact it can live with. The Indian embassy in Washington declined to comment.- Meanwhile, another interesting Politico report said this week that: Ukraine has found its favored middleman to help end the war with Russia: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi…A high-ranking Ukrainian official, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject, confirmed that India was Kyiv's big hope to reach a peace pact it can live with. According to the official, Modi was clear in summertime discussions with Kyiv that — while Ukraine would inevitably need to compromise on some things to end Moscow's onslaught — any proposals to end the war should not include giving up territory to Russia. Modi, in Kyiv's eyes, has come a long way in a short time. When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, the response from Kyiv was scathing. Zelenskyy called the hug — on the same day a Russian missile strike killed dozens of Ukrainians — -a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts.- But since then, Ukraine has come to increasingly view India — the world's most populous nation, which has long promoted non-alignment in its foreign relations — as its ideal intermediary in dealings with the Kremlin. While New Delhi has consistently refrained from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has spoken in support of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ending the war. Six weeks after his Moscow trip raised Ukrainian hackles, Modi traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. He vowed to be -a friend- to Kyiv and help bring about a peace deal. India may be the only global power player that can play the role — or at least the only one able to credibly portray itself as a neutral party to both Moscow and Kyiv. Subscribe now Another noteworthy report is about Wang's comments on Security Council reform. This was part of a dialogue between the P5 and C10 countries from Africa. Wang made three points: Effectively increase the representation of Global South countries, allow more developing countries, especially small and medium-sized countries including African countries, to participate in Security Council decision-making, enhance the authority and efficiency of the Security Council, and promote the development of international order towards a more just and reasonable direction. The Security Council cannot become a club for big countries or rich countries, let alone an arena for political confrontation. We must effectively change the imbalance between North and South in the composition of the Security Council and the over-representation of developed countries. We must anchor the reform path of giving priority to special arrangements for Africa. The Security Council structure with insufficient representation of Africa is hardly reasonable, and correcting this injustice requires creativity. Last year, President Xi Jinping took the lead in announcing that China supports making special arrangements for the priority resolution of Africa's demands, which has led to just calls in support for Africa's demands. China is willing to work with Africa and all parties to jointly explore the implementation path of the special arrangements for Africa's priority. We must support the main channel status of the General Assembly's Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations. The Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations are the only platform authorized by the General Assembly and widely recognized by member states. We should jointly maintain the intergovernmental negotiation platform where everyone can sit down and talk, and continuously accumulate and expand the consensus of the international community. 。--，，，。，。、。。，。，。，。。、。，.

The readout says: -China has always placed Nepal in an important position in its peripheral diplomacy and is committed to building a closer China-Nepal community with a shared future. Next year will be the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal. The two sides should take this opportunity to promote the joint construction of the BRI and other cooperation to bear more fruit and benefit the people of the two countries… China will, as always, support Nepal in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and hopes that Nepal will find a successful development path that suits its national conditions. He appreciated Nepal's repeated reiteration that it will not allow any forces to use Nepal's territory to engage in anti-China activities. China has granted zero tariff treatment to 100% of items imported from all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, which will facilitate more Nepali specialty products entering the Chinese market. China welcomes Nepal's announcement in China of 2025 as the ‘Nepal Tourism Year' and is willing to work with Nepal to plan a series of events to promote cultural exchanges.-，、，，。100%，。2025--，，. Oli reportedly said: -The Nepali government, all political parties and people support Nepal-China friendship, firmly adhere to the one-China policy, and will not allow anyone or any force to use Nepal's territory to engage in anti-China activities. Nepal is committed to strengthening cooperation with China, building a Nepal-China community with a shared future, and sharing development and prosperity.- 、，，。，，.

The Chinese readout has Wang calling Yunus -an old friend of the Chinese people- and saying that -I believe that you will live up to the expectations of the people and lead Bangladesh to overcome difficulties and challenges and return to the right track of unity, stability, development and prosperity as soon as possible.- 。，，，，。，，。，，. China and Bangladesh share a traditional friendship, and the people of both countries have deep amicable feelings for each other. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to promote this traditional friendship, strengthen political mutual trust, deepen cooperation in jointly building BRI, and push forward the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries. China is also willing to expand cooperation in areas such as agriculture, poverty alleviation, and new energy based on Bangladesh's needs, and strengthen exchanges on governance, reform, and opening-up experiences to support Bangladesh's economic and social development. The two sides can strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，，。，，，--，。，、、，，。，. Yunus reportedly said: -both Bangladesh and I personally have long-standing friendly connections with China. China has created miracle after miracle in human history, especially achieving unprecedented accomplishments in poverty alleviation, which is deeply admirable. Bangladesh is willing to learn from China's experience and continuously expand friendly cooperation between the two countries. On behalf of all the people of Bangladesh, I would like to thank China for sending medical personnel to Bangladesh to treat injured students.- ，。，，。，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, Wang met with American representatives from the National Committee on United States-China Relations, the US-China Business Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the Aspen Institute, the Asia Society, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Wang told them that: -This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. After nearly half a century of ups and downs, the most important revelation is that the two countries should be partners, not adversaries; they should help each other succeed rather than engage in vicious competition; and they should keep their word and follow through, rather than saying one thing and doing another. President Xi Jinping cares deeply about and attaches great importance to China-US relations. Based on profound reflection on the lessons learned, he has proposed the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, which are the fundamental guidelines for China's approach to US relations. In contrast to China's stable and consistent policy towards the US, the US often sends mixed signals and presents two different faces in its China policy. The root cause lies in the inability of some in the US to view and accept China's development objectively. The US needs to recognize that China also has the right to develop, and that China's development is an opportunity for both the US and the world, rather than a challenge. 。，45。，，，；，；、，、。，，、、，。，、。。，。、. Wang Yi said that during his visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, he sensed the widespread concern over the international situation, with many hoping for greater unity and coordination among major powers to shoulder their responsibilities. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should first strive for stable, healthy, and sustainable development of their bilateral relationship. They should also work with the international community to address the numerous global challenges emerging today. China-US relations are an evolving process that requires continuous dialogue and communication to eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings and misjudgments. Wang Yi expressed hope that people of insight from various sectors in the US would contribute to these efforts, foster an objective and rational understanding of China, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and help improve and develop China-US relations. ，，，，。，，，。，，。，，，.

Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong held -candid, professional and pragmatic exchanges- with US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. Xinhua says: -Wang said that the two sides earnestly implement the important consensus of the two heads of state, adhere to mutual respect, dispute management and mutually beneficial cooperation, and have achieved many visible outcomes in areas such as drug control, repatriation of illegal immigrants and cooperation on individual cases. China is willing to maintain communication with the U.S. at all levels, and push for steady and long-term law enforcement cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. side should attach importance to addressing China's concerns, demonstrate sincerity with concrete actions, and remove obstacles for deepening cooperation, Wang noted. The two sides agreed to stay in communication on important issues in the field of law enforcement.- Page 6: There's a report informing that the NDRC and the Xi Jinping Economic Thought Research Center hosted the 2024 Annual Conference on Deeply Studying and Practising Xi Jinping's Economic Thought. I am not detailing this, but NDRC's Zheng Shanjie and Han Wenxiu, deputy director of the Office of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, spoke at the meeting. Page 10: There's a report on a new guideline to promote the market entry of medium and long-term capital. Xinhua reports: -The guideline, issued by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is designed to streamline the entry of capital from social security funds, insurance and wealth management into the market. Key measures outlined include the development of a market environment that encourages long-term investments and the improvement of the quality of publicly listed companies. The guideline advocates the expansion of public equity funds and supports the stable development of private equity investment funds. Additionally, the guideline seeks to refine policies and institutions that facilitate the entry of diverse medium and long-term capital. It aims, among other things, to significantly increase the scale and proportion of medium and long-term capital investments, create a more balanced structure of capital market investors, strengthen the long-term nature of investment behaviors, and enhance the inherent stability of the market, while steadily improving investor returns.- Also, another report informs that in August, there were 23,210 cases of violations of the eight-point central regulation.

Politburo Meeting Signals Economic Easing - Wang Yi's Diplomacy in New York - Guidelines to Implement Employment-first Policy - Song Tao Meets KMT's S...	Just as I was about to publish, Xinhua has published a report stating that Xi Jinping has today chaired a meeting of the Politburo to study and assess the current economic situation and deploy the next phase of economic work. Since the beginning of this year, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to overcome difficulties and respond calmly, enhance macroeconomic regulation, focus on deepening reform and opening up, expand domestic demand, and optimize the economic structure. Consequently, the overall economic operation has been stable and steady, new quality productive forces have developed steadily, people's livelihood security has been solid, positive progress has been made in preventing and resolving risks in key areas, high-quality development has been solidly promoted, and the overall social situation remains stable. ，，、，，、、，、，，，，，. The meeting pointed out that the fundamentals of China's economy and favorable conditions, such as a vast market, strong economic resilience and great potential have not changed. At the same time, some new situations and problems have emerged in the current economic operation. It is necessary to look at the current economic situation comprehensively, objectively and calmly, face up to difficulties, strengthen confidence, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency to do a good job in economic work. We must focus on key points, take the initiative, effectively implement existing policies, intensify efforts to introduce incremental policies, further improve the pertinence and effectiveness of policy measures, and strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks. ，、、。，。，、，。、，，，、，. The next paragraph has specific policy points. It says: The meeting emphasised the need to increase counter-cyclical adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies, ensure necessary fiscal expenditures, and effectively carry out the ‘three guarantees' work at the grassroots level. It is necessary to issue and use ultra-long-term special treasury bonds and local government special bonds to better leverage the driving role of government investment. It is necessary to lower the reserve requirement ratio and implement substantial interest rate cuts. It is necessary to promote the real estate market to stop falling and stabilize, strictly control the increase in commercial housing construction, optimize the stock, and improve the quality, increase the loan issuance for ‘white list' projects, and support the revitalization of idle land. It is necessary to respond to the concerns of the people, adjust the housing purchase restriction policy, reduce the interest rate of existing mortgage loans, speed up the improvement of land, fiscal and taxation, and financial policies, and promote the construction of a new model of real estate development. It is necessary to strive to boost the capital market, vigorously guide medium- and long-term funds to enter the market, and clear the bottlenecks hindering social security, insurance, and wealth management funds from entering the market. It is necessary to support the merger and reorganization of listed companies, steadily advance the reform of public funds, and study and introduce policies and measures to protect small and medium-sized investors. ，，，--。，。，。，、、，--，。，，，、、，。，，、、。，，。 Note: This tells us clearly that we should expect more stimulus measures. The PBOC recently cut the rate of the medium-term lending facility to 2% from 2.3%. Bloomberg had earlier reported that the cut to the MLF rate is a prelude to more significant measures. Pan had also said that the central bank would cut the amount of cash banks have to hold in reserve - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR). The RRR will initially be cut by half a percentage point, in a move expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142bn; £106bn). BBC reported that further measures aimed to boost China's crisis-hit property market include cutting interest rates for existing mortgages and lowering minimum down payments on all types of homes to 15%. Anyway, the next paragraph of the Xinhua report says: The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to help enterprises overcome difficulties and further standardise the law enforcement and supervision behaviours related to enterprises. It is necessary to introduce a law to promote the private economy and create a good environment for the development of the non-public economy. It is necessary to combine promoting consumption with benefiting people's livelihood, promote income increases for middle and low-income groups, and upgrade consumption structure. It is necessary to cultivate new consumption formats. It is necessary to support and standardise the development of the elderly care and childcare industries by social forces, and speed up the improvement of the policy system for fertility support. It is necessary to increase efforts to attract and stabilise investment, promptly advance and implement reform measures such as foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector, further optimise building a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalised. ，，、。，。，，。。、，。，，、、. The meeting also called to implement the employment-first policy, -strengthen assistance to low-income individuals-, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food, water, electricity, gas, and heating, and support grain production and farmers. The final paragraph calls for complete policy implementation by all regions, departments and cadres, and says that economically developed provinces should take the lead and better play a leading and supporting role.

Page 1: There's a report on Xi Jinping's letter to people of various ethnic groups in Pu'er, Yunnan province, calling on them to bear in mind forging the sense of community for the Chinese nation to promote ethnic unity and progress. This was in reply to a letter by the descendants of the representatives from diverse ethnic groups who erected a monument in 1951 in Pu'er and made a solemn pledge to stay united and follow the leadership of the Party. In his letter, Xi said that the Chinese nation is a -big family where 56 ethnic groups love and care for each other-. Xi added that -I hope you will carry forward the glorious traditions of your ancestors- and -let the story of national unity be passed down from generation to generation. People of all ethnic groups must bear in mind the sense of community of the Chinese nation and integrate it into their blood, jointly defend the territory of the motherland, and build a beautiful homeland, so that the flower of national unity and progress will bloom even more brilliantly.- ，。，，。、，、，. Next, there's a brief report on the entire PBSC attending the funeral of Ren Jianxin, a former senior CPC leader and former president of the Supreme People's Court. Ren died aged 99 and his remains were laid to rest at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Moving on, the paper today carries the new guidelines on implementing the employment-first strategy. The document comes at a time when the jobless rate for people in China ages 16 to 24, and not in school, rose to 18.8% last month. That's up from 17.1% in July, and 13.2% in June. The first key section deals with employment and development linkages. This section makes five points: Strengthen the employment-first orientation of macroeconomic regulation. -Make high-quality and full employment a priority goal for economic and social development, incorporate it into national economic and social development plans, and promote the synergy of fiscal, monetary, industrial, price, and employment policies to enhance the employment-driving power of development.

Support the development of industries and enterprises with strong employment absorption capacity. For business entities with good employment demonstration effects, prioritize land use plans and provide preferential employment support services under equal conditions. 。，、、、，。，，，. Enhance the employment carrying capacity of regional coordinated development. Deeply implement the regional coordinated development strategy and major regional strategies, and accelerate the formation of a number of employment clusters and growth poles with integrated services, connected policies, and smooth channels. Guide the orderly transfer of capital, technology, and labour-intensive industries from the east to the central and western regions, and from central cities to the hinterland. Increase policy support for old revolutionary areas, border regions, and resource-depleted areas to promote balanced employment development across regions. 。、，、、。、、、，、、，. Cultivate new momentum for employment expansion and quality improvement. Expand new employment space for the digital economy, vigorously promote industrial digitization and digital industrialization, support the healthy development of the platform economy, and effectively manage job mining and career transitions in digital transformation. Increase new green employment opportunities, actively develop green industries such as energy conservation and carbon reduction, environmental protection, ecological protection, restoration and utilization, and promote the synergy and efficiency of green development and employment growth. Open up new areas of health care employment, develop the silver economy, promote the deep integration of health and elderly care, tourism, leisure, food and other industries, and give birth to new employment growth points. 。，、，，、。，、、，。，，、、、，. Section three deals with the steps to resolve structural employment contradictions. It makes three points: Better match talent demand with education supply Improve the lifelong vocational skills training system Expand growth channels for skilled personnel The next section deals with support that needs to be provided for the employment of key groups. This includes college graduates and youth, retired military personnel, rural labour, those engaged in supporting self-employment and flexible employment, and individuals facing difficulties, i.e., older workers, people with disabilities, and the long-term unemployed. Later the document also talks about steps to be taken to protect workers' rights. This talks about the need to carry out -reforms in household registration, employment services, and personnel records, removing unreasonable restrictions and discrimination in employment based on region, status, gender, age, etc., and facilitating social mobility.- 。、，、、，、、、，。It also mentions support for women and the disabled, along with protecting rights like remuneration, vacation, safety and health. It adds: -Promote employers and employees to participate in social insurance according to law. Improve the social security system for flexible employment personnel, migrant workers, and new forms of employment. Completely remove household registration restrictions for participating in social insurance at the place of employment. Promote unemployment insurance, industrial injury insurance and housing accumulation fund to cover professional workers widely. Improve the linkage mechanism between employment and unemployment insurance and minimum living security. Pay unemployment insurance benefits according to regulations, provide layered and classified social assistance, and adjust and improve the gradual withdrawal period of minimum living security and employment cost deduction regulations. 。，、、，。、、。、，，，。 Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with leaders from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who are visiting Nanning to attend the 21st China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit.

First, he addressed the UNGA. He mentioned GDI, GSI and GCI and then said: In this changing and turbulent world, new risks and challenges keep cropping up. No country can stay unaffected. Greater solidarity and cooperation of the international community is not a choice, but a must. Countries should uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and settle disputes through dialogue, resolve differences through consultation and enhance security through cooperation. Major countries, in particular, should lead by example. They should break geopolitical circles by pursuing the greater good, rise above bloc confrontation with a broad vision for mutual prosperity, and serve as propellers for world solidarity and anchors for international peace. Countries need to share development opportunities and pursue win-win cooperation. We need to follow a people-centered development philosophy and advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, so as to deliver the fruits of development to our people and ensure common prosperity for all countries. A winner-takes-all approach is a sure way to lose the whole game, and the ‘small yard with high fences' would only imprison the builder and tear the world apart. We need to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, and defend the U.N.-centered international system, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We need to strengthen the authority of international rule of law, reject the law of the jungle where the strong bully the weak, oppose acts of hegemonism such as unilateral sanctions, protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, promote greater democracy in international relations, and uphold international fairness and justice.

Borrell, for his part, said that China's rise is an unstoppable historical trend. China is already a strong country and will continue to grow stronger. The world needs China and Europe should strengthen cooperation with China. The world is not peaceful as challenges are growing and conflicts keep cropping up, and countries need to work together to maintain peace and security, said Borrell.- On Ukraine, Wang said that -China has always adhered to an objective and fair stance on the Ukrainian crisis, and is committed to cooling the situation and never giving up its efforts for peace. If anyone continues to accuse China, they are doing so with ulterior motives, trying to shift responsibility onto China with hidden agendas.- Share Tracking People's Daily Second, the readout from Wang's meeting with Australian FM Penny Wong says: -Wang Yi said that China-Australia relations have made positive progress. Premier Li Qiang's successful visit to Australia in June injected new impetus into the development of China-Australia relations. The two sides have resumed a series of dialogue and cooperation mechanisms, China has implemented unilateral visa exemption for Australia, local and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become more active, and Adelaide Zoo will welcome a new pair of giant pandas this year. The improvement of China-Australia relations has been welcomed and supported by all sectors within the two countries. This is the result of the two sides moving towards each other and working together, and it also shows that the healthy and stable development of China-Australia relations is the common expectation of the two peoples. The two sides should continue to build a more mature, stable and fruitful comprehensive strategic partnership. At the same time, the two sides should grasp the problems existing in bilateral exchanges, not define China-Australia relations by differences, not replace the mainstream of mutually beneficial cooperation with negative information, and not let negative thinking interfere with the improvement and development of bilateral relations. It is hoped that Australia will work with China to ensure that China-Australia relations continue to move along the right track and achieve more results.- ，。6，。，，，。，、，。、。，，，，。，.

Judging from the nearly half-century history since China and the EU established diplomatic relations, enhancing bilateral cooperation is in both side's interests and conducive to world stability, Wang said, stressing that the foundation for China-EU relations is mutually beneficial cooperation, and that the highly complementary nature of the two economies means economic cooperation between China and the EU can result in outcomes that exceed a simple adding-up of their respective economic output. Whereas, politicizing economic and trade issues between China and the EU while slashing tariffs on Chinese imports would serve no one's interests, nor would such actions work to the benefit of the green transition of the world economy, Wang remarked, expressing the hope that Germany and the EU will stick to open cooperation, continue to hold dialogue and consultations with China, properly handle related issues, and jointly uphold international trade rules and a fair environment for competition.

Xinhua reports that Wang put forward three points: Firstly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of crisis in cooling down the situation. Weapons of mass destruction should not be used, nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes such as nuclear power plants should not be attacked, and civilians and civilian facilities should not be targeted, the envoy said. Secondly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility in promoting peace talks. Dialogue and negotiation is the only viable way out of the Ukrainian crisis, he noted, urging the international community to seize the current opportunity to form joint efforts to promote peace talks. Thirdly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of urgency in managing spillovers. China calls on the international community to strengthen cooperation on energy, finance, trade, food security and the protection of key infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines, so as to jointly maintain the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains, Wang said. China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor is it a party concerned, the top Chinese diplomat noted. China has always sided with peace, and maintained contact with all parties, including Russia and Ukraine, he added. Warning that any attempt to blame, attack or smear China on the Ukraine issue is irresponsible and will not succeed, Wang called on the international community to join hands to uphold a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.- Subscribe now Tenth, during a meeting with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk and multiple countries' foreign ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Wang lashed out at the US and defended China's human rights record. -The United States and a few other countries used the Xinjiang issue to attack and smear China's human rights situation. Nearly 80 countries, including the majority of Muslim countries, read out a joint statement on the spot in support of China, and more than 20 countries expressed their support for China's just position in different ways, clearly opposing the politicization of human rights issues and interfering in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. The clear voices of more than 100 countries fully demonstrate that the political manipulation of a few countries such as the United States has become increasingly unpopular.- -Wang pointed out that such action of the United States and its followers once again exposed their double standards on human rights issues to the world. People cannot help but ask: if the United States is so concerned about the human rights of Muslims, why does it continuously provoke or support wars in regions like the Middle East, causing numerous innocent Muslim casualties? Why does it turn a blind eye to the historical injustices faced by the Arab people and not support Palestine in becoming a full member of the United Nations? Why does it fail to play its due role in achieving a permanent ceasefire and full military withdrawal from Gaza? Wang Yi said that the majority of Muslim countries have long seen through the tricks of the United States and know that the United States is just using human rights as a cover to interfere in the internal affairs of China and developing countries. More than 100 developing countries, including Muslim countries, clearly supported China at the Human Rights Council, not only to safeguard China's legitimate rights, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and safeguard the basic principle of non-interference in internal affairs of international relations.- 、，924，，。80，20，，，。100，。，。，，，？，？、？，，，。100，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, meeting Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon, Wang said that China supports Slovenia assuming the rotating chair of the United Nations Security Council this month, is willing to work with the Slovenian side to implement true multilateralism, uphold the authority of the United Nations and the Security Council, and promote international peace and security.

Subscribe now First, the Quad meeting in Delaware came up in the daily MoFA press briefing yesterday. Here are the responses to the relevant questions. -Bloomberg: At the Quad summit in the US over the weekend, US President Biden made some remarks on China. He said that China continues to act aggressively and is testing the US and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. What's the Foreign Ministry's comment? Lin Jian: Quad is identified as the premier regional grouping that plays a leading role in the US's Indo-Pacific strategy. It is a tool the US uses to contain China and perpetuate US hegemony. The Indo-Pacific strategy attempts to patch up forces to exclude and contain China by peddling the ‘China threat' narrative, and Quad tries to muster military and security cooperation under the pretext of maritime issues—same intention, same tactics. Though the US claims that it does not target China, the first topic of the summit is about China and China was made an issue throughout the event. The US is lying through its teeth and even the US media does not believe it. China believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party or even harm their interests. Any regional initiative should follow the overwhelming trend of the region and promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Ganging up to form exclusive groupings undermines the mutual trust and cooperation between regional countries, runs counter to the overwhelming trend of pursuing peace, development, cooperation, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and is bound to fail. The US needs to get rid of its obsession with perpetuating its supremacy and containing China, stop using regional countries as its tool, stop glossing over the strategic intention behind all kinds of exclusive groupings, and act on its word that the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China, instead of seeking selfish gains at the expense of other countries' strategic security interests and the wellbeing of the people in the Asia-Pacific. AFP: Quad leaders said in the joint statement that they are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas, which apparently refers to China. Has China protested to relevant countries? Lin Jian: The situation in the East and South China Seas is generally stable. Some country outside the region keeps cobbling together small groupings and tries every means to meddle in maritime issues at China's doorstep in order to incite bloc confrontation, escalate the situation, and undermine regional peace and stability. Let me stress that no interference from any force will weaken China's determination in defending its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with law and keeping the region peaceful and stable. We will lodge serious protests over any act that undermines China's sovereignty and security interests. PTI: Further to what you spoke about the Quad summit in the US. The summit also for the first time approved a joint coast guard cooperation at sea. And also they have rather agreed to strengthen cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and recognized India's leadership in finalizing the IORA Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and expressed support for that. Do you have any comment on this? Lin Jian: Cooperation between countries should be conducive to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, rather than focusing on forming exclusive groupings that undermine trust and cooperation among regional countries. China is open to normal cooperation between relevant countries at sea, but the cooperation should not target other countries or undermine regional peace and stability under any pretext. PTI: You said that China will protest to anyone in violation to security interests. So can we presume that you have lodged a protest to all the Quad countries regarding the comments on the South China Sea and the East China Sea? Lin Jian: As I said just now, China will protest over any move that harms China's sovereignty and security interests. Second, the Chinese and Nepali armies are carrying out joint training in Chongqing. Xinhua reports: -Under the theme of ‘joint counter-terrorism operations in urban blocks', the joint training will include small arms shooting in special operations, counter-terrorism squad tactics, drone operations, emergency rescue, and comprehensive counter-terrorism exercises. The training will last until Oct. 1. In addition to joint exercise sessions, the two militaries will engage in research and exchange on disaster reduction and relief in earthquakes, avalanches and landslides.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!
