CPPCC's 75th Anniversary - State Council Discusses Retirement Age Reform-related Policies - C919 Lands in Lhasa - Zhong Sheng Lashes out at US Tariff ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, September 20, 2024. Page 1: The top story on the page is an article marking the 75th Anniversary of the Founding of the CPPCC. It says that -practice has shown that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a great achievement by the Communist Party of China in combining the Marxist-Leninist theories of the united front, party politics, and democratic political theory with the realities of China. It is a major innovation in the political system under which the CPC leads the democratic parties, non-affiliated individuals, mass organisations, and people from all ethnic groups and social sectors.- ，、、，、、. Going ahead, the article calls to -take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the general outline for the work of the CPPCC, ensure the correct political direction of the development of the CPPCC's cause, and consolidate the common ideological foundation for unity and struggle…thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on strengthening and improving the CPPCC's work, uphold and strengthen the Party's overall leadership over the CPPCC, focus on the central tasks of the Party and the country in the new era and on the new journey, always plan and carry out work keeping in mind the overall situation of the work of the Party and the country, and constantly enhance the level of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in state affairs.- ，，。，，，，、、. The piece terms -consultative democracy- an -important form of whole-process people's democracy in practice- and a -unique advantage- of China's -socialist democratic politics.- It also says that this system -plays a unique role in building consensus, optimising decision-making, coordinating relations, and maintaining stability, demonstrating great superiority and strong vitality.- ，、，，，、、、，.

Moving on, there's a report on a State Council meeting to mobilize efforts to carry out the reform of gradually raising the statutory retirement age. The report says that Li Qiang called for the -steady and orderly implementation- of this reform in order -to provide important support for advancing Chinese-style modernization.- -Li Qiang pointed out that implementing the gradual reform of delaying the statutory retirement age is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee from the perspective of the overall situation of the Party and the country. It is an objective requirement to actively respond to population ageing and promote high-quality population development. It is a practical need to fully unleash the talent dividend and support Chinese-style modernization. It is also a significant measure to improve the social security system and better protect and improve people's livelihoods. All regions and departments must raise their political awareness, align their thoughts and actions with the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, and work solidly to implement the reform, ensuring the achievement of the expected outcomes.- ，，，、，、，、。，，，. Li added: It is necessary to adhere to the principle of ‘voluntary participation and flexibility' to implement the delayed retirement policy and ensure that the wishes of employees are truly reflected. It is necessary to accelerate the formulation and improvement of supporting policy measures. Policies that need to be directly linked to the reform plan should be introduced and implemented as early as possible. Policies that need to be adjusted due to changes in the statutory retirement age should be formulated and implemented as soon as possible after thorough evaluation. It is necessary to further increase policy support and work efforts to effectively address the real concerns of the people. We should take expanding employment as an important measure to support the advancement of reform, implement and improve employment policies for college graduates and other young people, and protect the rights and interests of workers. -、-，。，、，。，。，，.

Wang will attend: the UN Summit of the Future the general debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly events hosted by China, like events to promote the Global Development Initiative and enhance international cooperation on AI Security Council High Level Open Debate, the BRICS foreign ministers' meeting and the G20 foreign ministers' meeting Also on the page is a brief report on Vice Premier Liu Guozhong meeting with visiting Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Bakyt Torobayev. Nothing particularly of note is said in the report. Page 7: There's a report on the launch of the 59th and 60th satellites of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. These are the second batch of Medium Earth Orbit satellites after the completion of the BeiDou 3 Navigation Satellite System in 2020. Another report informs that the C919 jet landed in Lhasa for the first time. This is part of the testing for the jet's adaptability to ultra high-altitude airports and routes. China Daily has a detailed report. It says: -the C919 plane will carry out research and development test flights of key systems for high-altitude operations, including environmental-control system, avionics and power units, as the company prepares the plane to meet the operational needs of ultra high-altitude routes and the R&amp;D of the plateau variant in the future, COMAC said. So far, the C919, comparable with the narrow-body Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 series, has netted more than 1,000 orders from home and abroad.- It adds: -Meanwhile, China's first home developed regional passenger jet, the ARJ21, is close to finishing its month-long ultra high-altitude demonstration flights around the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau that will fully assess the adaptability of the model for ultra high-altitude airports and routes. The C919 and the ARJ21 gathered in Lhasa on Thursday. Since Aug 21, the ARJ21 aircraft started its demonstration flights around the plateau, using Chengdu, Sichuan province; Xining, Qinghai province; and Lhasa as operational bases. So far, the ARJ21 plane has completed flight tests on 25 routes for a combined total of 62 flight hours, covering 11 ultra high-altitude airports in China. In particular, the jet has flown to the world's highest civil airport four times, and fully verified its adaptability to ultra high-altitude operations.- Also on the page is a report on the issuance of new technical standards for electric bicycles. This was issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology together with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Fire and Rescue Administration. The draft is open to public comments. The report has some interesting points: In 2023, there were 738 enterprises above a designated size in the power-assisted bicycle manufacturing industry, including electric bicycles, with an annual output of 42.28 million units, a year-on-year increase of 3.8% Electric bicycles caused 18,000 fires in 2021, and the number increased to 25,000 in 2023, with an average annual growth of about 20%. The draft focuses on the enhancement of fire-retardant features of e-bikes, calling for stricter flame resistance requirements for non-metallic materials to be used in electric bicycles. It also calls for limiting the use of plastic components. The draft also proposes additional features such as real-time communication and Beidou satellite positioning so as to ensure e-bike's safety through dynamic monitoring. The top designed speed of e-bikes capped at 25 km per hour. The draft also relaxes the vehicle weight limit for lead-acid battery models from 55 kilograms to 63 kilograms Subscribe now Page 14: There's a Zhong Sheng commentary on the recent announcement by USTR following a statutory four-year review process on tariffs on Chinese imports. The USTR report said that: -The Trade Representative is proposing modifying the actions by adding or increasing section 301 tariffs for certain products in strategic sectors. Many of the sectors are targeted by China for dominance or are sectors where the U.S. has recently made significant investments. These include: Battery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries) Electric vehicles Facemasks Lithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries Lithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries Medical gloves Natural graphite Other critical minerals Permanent magnets Semiconductors Ship to shore cranes Solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules) Steel and aluminum products Syringes and needles- The Zhong Sheng commentary argues that -the United States has politicized, instrumentalized, and weaponized economic and trade issues, and has insisted on imposing tariffs, which is protectionism that goes against the trend of the times. The United States should immediately correct its wrong practices and cancel all tariffs imposed on China.- It argues that section 301 tariffs are unpopular within the US. -The Office of the United States Trade Representative previously solicited public opinions on the results of the tariff review, and the majority of opinions opposed the imposition of tariffs or requested the expansion of tariff exemptions…Faced with many opinions opposing the imposition of tariffs, the Office of the United States Trade Representative postponed the announcement of new tariff measures on China twice, saying that it would continue to ‘review public opinions'. But facts have proved that the US government did not respect the opinions of the people, and insisted on raising the 301 tariffs on China out of domestic political compulsions. The US approach cannot achieve its declared goals; rather it will only backfire and weaken the competitiveness of American industries.- ，。，...，，--。，，，301。，，. The author adds: American tariff increases distort market rules and seriously damage the interests of the American people. The long list of tariff increases meets the needs of some US politicians to show strength to China, but it pushes up the prices of imported goods, with consumers bearing the cost of tariff increases. As per Moody's estimates, US consumers bear 92% of the cost of tariff increases on China, and American families spend an additional $1,300 each year. Outdated protectionist policies are also not conducive to protecting the interests of American workers. According to statistics from the US-based Tax Foundation, the tariff increase on China has not only failed to solve the employment problem of American workers, but has led to the loss of 142,000 jobs in the United States. US medical equipment importers and others believe that the imposition of tariffs on medical products, such as syringes, will affect doctors' access to high-quality tools and have a serious impact on American newborns and other vulnerable groups. ，。，，。，92%，1300。。，，14.2。，，.

State Council Discusses Venture Capital Sector & Regulations on Export Control of Dual-Use Items - What Guides China's New Era of Reform? - China-EU T...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, September 19, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with the report on the State Council executive meeting. The meeting studied measures to boost the development of the venture capital industry. In addition, it heard a report on this year's grain production situation and agricultural work; reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations on Commendation of Martyrs (Draft Amendment)'; and reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Export Control of Dual-Use Items (Draft)'. The meeting said venture capital is related to technological innovation, industrial upgrading and high-quality development. It is necessary to: accelerate the clearing of blockages and bottlenecks in the various stages of ‘fundraising, investment, management, and exit.' Support eligible tech companies to go public domestically and internationally, vigorously develop the equity transfer and mergers &amp; acquisitions markets, promote the pilot program of distributing physical stocks, and encourage private capital to set up market-oriented mergers &amp; acquisitions funds or venture capital secondary market funds to foster a virtuous cycle in the venture capital industry. encourage state-owned capital investment to become more responsible long-term capital and patient capital, and improve policies related to state-owned capital contributions, performance assessments, fault tolerance, and exits. consolidate the institutional foundation for the healthy development of venture capital, implement key measures for capital market reform, improve the functions of the capital market, and further stimulate the vitality of the venture capital market. ，、。--，，、，，，。、，、、、。，，，. On agriculture, the meeting called to study and formulate the policy plan for grain purchasing and storage as soon as possible, announce the minimum purchase price of wheat in the new year as soon as possible, improve the reward and compensation policy for soybean processing, and protect farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain. It is necessary to increase support for cattle and sheep breeding and implement a number of relief policies to help farmers tide over the difficulties. ，，，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next on the page is a long, long Ren Lixuan article. The crux of the article is a call to action for everyone to implement the reform agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session, and implementing action requires ideological alignment with Xi. The author contends that: -Only by learning well can we implement and execute effectively. Firm action stems from strong political consciousness and ideological consciousness. Only by being clear-headed and resolute in thought can we be strong and effective in action. To ensure the implementation of reforms and be steadfast practitioners and doers in building Chinese-style modernization, we must adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, and learn and understand the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee.- 、。、。，。，、，、、，. Later the author adds: -Thought is the banner of action and hard work. To further comprehensively deepen reform and promote Chinese-style modernization, we are treading a path never before taken by our predecessors. This journey must be guided by the correct guiding ideology. Only by adhering to the correct guiding ideology can we avoid taking the old path of being closed and rigid or the evil path of changing flags and banners, but unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuously promote the self-improvement and development of the socialist system. The ‘Decision' has put forward the ‘guiding ideology for further comprehensively deepening reform', which plays a vital role in further comprehensively deepening reform. Especially at this moment, as reform progresses, the complexity of the situation and environment we face is unprecedented, and the arduousness of the tasks of reform, development, and stability that we bear is unprecedented. The direction of the reform ship must be precise, and its navigation must be steady. The guiding ideology for further deepening reform provides a ‘compass' for the steady and far-reaching progress of reform. We must move forward in the direction guided by the guiding ideology of further comprehensively deepening reform, and we must not deviate or waver at any time. Within the guiding ideology, General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions about comprehensively deepening reform are the most important content. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping has personally led, deployed and promoted the work of comprehensively deepening reform, scientifically summarised historical experience, deeply grasped the laws of reform, and creatively put forward a series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods, clearly answering major questions such as why we should comprehensively deepen reform in the new era and how to promote comprehensively deepening reform, providing a fundamental guideline for further comprehensively deepening reform. General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform not only have in common traits of Marxist theory, such as being political, people-oriented and practical, but also possess a strong sense of historical initiative, firm commitment to upholding principles while innovating, clear problem orientation, systematic strategic layout, profound humanistic concern, and a deep global vision. Party members and cadres should deeply study and understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, grasp their rich connotations, theoretical characteristics and practical requirements, and further unify their thoughts and actions. 。、，，。，，，，。《》--，。，，，、，--。，、。，、、。，、、，，，，、、，、，。、、，、、，、、、、、。、、，、，. And much later, the author also adds: Party members and cadres must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, resolutely implement the Two Safeguards', persist in using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite hearts and forge souls, and thoroughly implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform. On the basis of learning and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, we must implement reforms with a spirit of perseverance and demonstrate our responsibility and action. On the basis of thoroughly studying and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, we must apply the spirit of driving nails to ensure the implementation of reforms, demonstrating responsibility and action. --，--，，、、，，，. Towards the end, this bit is useful to note: -The more than 300 major reform measures determined in the ‘Decision' are all innovative measures, and many strategic deployments are mainly strategic, forward-looking, and directional, still requiring the formulation of thorough and feasible reform plans through exploration and innovation. This requires all regions, departments and Party members and cadres to implement the spirit of the CPC Central Committee to the letter, closely integrate the actual situation, adapt to local conditions, explore and innovate to implement reforms well, and create fresh experiences that can be replicated and scaled.- 《》300，、、，。，，，，、. -Exploration and innovation, along with daring to act and be effective, are proactive actions based on a deep understanding of the guiding ideology, overall goals, and key principles of further comprehensively deepening reform. They are creative actions following a deep understanding of the Party Central Committee's strategic deployment intentions. They are scientific actions that follow the laws of comprehensively deepening reform and building Chinese-style modernization. This is an inherent part of being resolute practitioners and doers. Only by exploring and innovating, and daring to act effectively, can we prevent mere copying in implementation, superficiality from top to bottom, and avoid mechanical execution, oversimplification, and ‘one-size-fits-all' approaches. To explore and innovate for effective reform implementation, it is necessary to promote positive interaction and organic integration between top-level design and grassroots exploration…- 、，、、，， ，、。 、，、，、、--。 ，、.

Subscribe now Page 10: There's an article by the Theory Study Center of the Party Group of the Development Research Center of the State Council. The article talks about building a high-level socialist market economic system. They key tasks that it outlines are: The core issue in building a high-level socialist market economic system is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market. Letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better leveraging the role of the government are important practical experiences formed in the process of China's reform. To unlock the potential of the socialist market economy system at a higher level, the market mechanism must be utilised more effectively, ensuring that property rights serve as effective incentives, factors flow freely, prices respond flexibly, competition is fair and orderly, and successful enterprises thrive while weaker ones are eliminated. At the same time, the government's ability to govern the macroeconomy must be enhanced to better maintain market order, address market failures, and ensure smooth circulation of the national economy, smooth the circulation of the national economy, so as to do both ‘let it live' and ‘maintain control'. 。，，。，，、、、、。，，、，，----. The key points that then follow are: Adhere to and implement the two unwaverings. -Public ownership is the main body, and the common development of multiple ownership economies is an important part of the socialist basic economic system. The leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy is an essential requirement of a socialist state. It is necessary to actively implement the Decision by concentrating state capital in key industries and sectors related to national security and the lifeblood of the national economy, in public services, emergency capabilities, and public welfare areas, and in forward-looking, strategic emerging industries. This requires deepening the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises, establishing a system for optimising the layout and structural adjustment of the state-owned economy, and improving the system and mechanism that promote state-owned enterprises focusing on their main responsibilities and core businesses. The private economy is an inherent element of China's economic system and an important force in promoting the development of the socialist market economy. However, there are still problems such as unequal market access and the failure to effectively protect legitimate rights and interests. It is necessary to accelerate the implementation of the ‘principles and policies that help foster a favorable environment and create more opportunities for the development of the non-public sector' put forward in the ‘Decision' to ensure equal access to factors and business activities after access. Guide private enterprises to improve corporate governance, strengthen the compliance and legal operation of private enterprises, and promote the private economy to better play an important role in stabilizing growth, maintaining employment, and promoting innovation within the framework of the socialist market economic system.- --，、。、。，《》、，、、，，，，。，，、。《》--，。，，、、。 Build a unified national market. Under this, the article points to the fact that -the construction of a national unified factor market faces problems such as local investment promotion involution, imperfect factor price formation mechanisms, insufficient social security connections, and imperfect free flow mechanisms for factors like land and data. The construction of a national unified product market faces issues such as local protectionism, market access barriers, different treatments for different ownership systems, monopolies, and unfair competition.- ，，，，、。、、、。It proposes that: we must strengthen the rigid constraints of fair competition review and intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition efforts…standardise local laws and regulations on attracting investment, and prohibit giving preferential policies in violation of laws and regulations. Establish and improve a unified, standardized and information-sharing public resource trading platform system such as bidding and procurement by the government, institutions and state-owned enterprises, achieving full-process open management of projects. Improve the regulatory mechanism for new economic organizations such as platforms. Improve the land, capital, technology, and data markets, improve the price mechanism of factors mainly determined by market supply and demand, and prevent the government from improperly intervening in price formation. Promote pricing reforms in water, energy, transportation and other fields to achieve more efficient allocation of factor resources. 《》，，。，。、、、，。。、、，，。、、，。 Ensure fair competition in the market. Improve the macroeconomic governance system. Under this, the article calls to -improve the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanism, promote the coordinated efforts of planning, finance, currency, industry, price, employment and other policies, and bring both economic policies and non-economic policies into the consistency assessment of macroeconomic policy orientation to improve the comprehensive efficiency of macroeconomic regulation and control…deepen the reform of the fiscal and taxation system, improve the budget system, optimise the tax structure, increase local independent financial resources, improve the financial transfer payment system and improve the government debt management system.

Share Tracking People's Daily First, Euractiv reports that Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis are set for tough talks on Thursday ahead of a pivotal vote by EU member states next week. -Wang's visit, which follows whistle-stop trips to Germany and Italy earlier this week, is a last-ditch effort ahead of a vote next Wednesday (25 September) on whether to definitively implement the EU executive's proposed duties of up to 35.3% on electric vehicles (EVs). According to reports by the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU), Wang told Chinese and European automakers at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (18 September) that China-EU trade ties are now at a ‘crossroads', with ‘one path leading to openness and collaboration [and] the other to protectionism and isolation'. Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told Euractiv on Wednesday that the European Commission remains ‘open to a negotiated solution ... provided that such a solution is adequate and effective in addressing the risk of injury to EU industry that we established in our investigation.' The European Commission argues the tariffs are necessary to protect European automakers against unfairly subsidised Chinese competitors.- The report adds: -Fifteen of the EU's 27 member states, representing at least 65% of the union's population, must vote against the tariffs to prevent their introduction for five years starting from the end of October. Germany abstained in an initial non-binding vote on the proposed duties held in early July, while Spain voted in favour. Only four member states voted against it. Beijing's push to persuade European capitals to vote against the tariffs reportedly yielded some success over the past week. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both supported Beijing's call for a negotiated solution to the dispute. However, one person familiar with the matter told Euractiv that Germany will likely abstain again next week unless a block is likely to be achieved. But on Monday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said after a meeting with Wang that Rome will continue to ‘support the position of the EU'.- Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced a decision to impose countermeasures against nine US military companies for arms sales to Taiwan. Xinhua reports: -Pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 6, 9 and 15 of China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, China decided to take the following countermeasures against Sierra Nevada Corporation, Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC, Cubic Corporation, S3 AeroDefense, TCOM, Limited Partnership, TextOre, Planate Management Group, ACT1 Federal and Exovera: Their movable, immovable and all other types of property in China will be frozen. Organizations and individuals in China will be prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation or other activities with the above-mentioned enterprises. The decision will become effective from Sept. 18, 2024.- -In response to a query concerning recent U.S. plans to sell arms to China's Taiwan region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, particularly the August 17 Communique of 1982; seriously violates China's sovereignty and security interests; damages China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; and sends an erroneous signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces. ‘China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this, and has lodged stern representations with the U.S. side. China has taken firm countermeasures and announced that it will impose sanctions on nine U.S. military companies,' he said. The United States continues to arm Taiwan, supporting Lai Ching-te and Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in their stubborn pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence' and their provocations regarding the one-China principle, Lin noted. This once again proves that the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the greatest saboteur of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait are the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' forces and the conniving support of external forces led by the United States, he added. It should be noted that the DPP authorities are attempting to seek ‘Taiwan independence' through military build-up, and the United States is determined to help advance that agenda by arming Taiwan, Lin said, adding that any such actions will only backfire and lead to disastrous consequences, ultimately ending in failure, Lin said. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the heart of China's core interests, and it is the most important red line that cannot be crossed in China-U.S. relations. No one should underestimate China's firm will and strong ability to oppose ‘Taiwan independence' and defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Extols the Superiority of the People's Congress System	It's the holiday edition today with the mid-Autumn festival upon us. But there were two important stories over the weekend. So let me cover those today. First, there was a meeting at the Great Hall of the People marking the 70th anniversary of the National People's Congress. The entire PBSC was present. Xi Jinping delivered a major speech. The full text of the speech was published in the paper on Sunday. I am going to rely on that and Xinhua's English report. Xi said: -70 years ago, the first session of the First NPC adopted the Constitution of the PRC, marking the formal establishment of the people's congress system, which is the basic political system of the country. The establishment of the people's congress system meant that China's politics had fundamentally achieved a great leap from a system where a few held power and the vast majority were oppressed and exploited, to one where the Chinese Communist Party leads and the people are the masters of their own country. This was an unprecedented achievement in thousands of years of history, realising a great transformation in China's political system. The system of people's congresses is the result of the arduous exploration and long-term struggles of the Chinese people under the CPC leadership. It is an entirely new political system that has grown from the Chinese soil and a great invention in the evolution of political institutions. From the initial exploration and proposal of the basic concept of the people's congress system during the New Democratic Revolution, to its establishment and implementation during the period of socialist revolution and construction, to its continuous consolidation and improvement during the new period of reform, opening-up and socialist modernization, and to its further development towards greater maturity and institutionalisation in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the system of the people's congress has gone through an extraordinary journey. It is now deeply rooted in China and has become an integral part of the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- 70，《》，。，、、，，。，，。，，，、，，，. Subscribe now In the next part of the speech, Xi made five points, highlighting the significant advantages of the system of people's congresses. First, the people's congress system has demonstrated significant political advantage of upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and ensuring that the Party leads the people to effectively govern the country according to law. The people's congress system upholds the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, firmly safeguards the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and upholds the Party's core leadership role in taking overall charge and coordinating all entities. This system is conducive to ensuring and consolidating the Party's leadership position and its governance status from both an institutional and legal perspective, ensuring that the Party's propositions become the will of the state through legal procedures, ensuring that the candidates recommended by the Party organization become the leaders of the state power organs through legal procedures, ensuring that the Party exercises leadership over the state and society through the state power organs, and ensuring that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work. This effectively overcomes the chaos and disunity of old China, where there was no central leadership (a group of dragons without a leader - ), the country was fragmented (akin to a dish of loose sand - ), and constant political infighting and mutual attacks exposing each other's faults were commonplace. ——、。、、，，、，，，，，、、。、、. Second, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of practising whole process people's democracy and guaranteeing that the people are the masters of the country. The people's congress system upholds the people's dominant position, upholds the principle that all state power belongs to the people, supports and guarantees the people's exercise of state power through the people's congresses, and embodies the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship. The implementation of the people's congress system, together with the implementation of basic political systems, such as the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of grassroots mass autonomy, consolidates and develops the broadest patriotic united front, and together forms a comprehensive, extensive, and organically connected system of people being the true masters of the country. This is conducive to ensuring that all people, in accordance with the law, engage in democratic elections, democratic consultations, democratic decision-making, democratic management, and democratic supervision, and manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law. This effectively overcomes the phenomenon in some countries where the people appear to have rights in form but lack real power in practice, and where grand promises are made during elections, only to be ignored once the election is over. ——、。，，，。，、、，，、、，、、、、，、、。、、. — (Note: For any rational observer, the first point fundamentally undermines the second point. But if you read them in conjunction, the message is quite clear, that as long as the power and legitimacy of the Party to rule is not challenged, policy dialogue is possible.) Third, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of implementing democratic centralism and ensuring that the country's political life is both vibrant and stable and orderly. The people elect their own representatives through democratic elections to form people's congresses at all levels. The state administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs are created by the people's congresses, are responsible to the people's congresses, and are supervised by the people's congresses. People's congress representatives come from all regions, ethnic groups, and all walks of life; they listen to and convey the opinions and suggestions of the public through various forms and channels. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees implement democratic centralism, fully leveraging democracy, and exercise their powers collectively. This demonstrates a high degree of unity between democracy and efficiency, ensuring that state organs operate in a highly coordinated and efficient manner, and that the country's various undertakings are organised and advanced in a unified and effective way. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where there is mutual obstruction, severe internal friction, and situations where matters are discussed but not decided, or decided but not implemented. ——、。，。、、、，，。、、，。，，。，，。、、. Fourth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of ensuring the comprehensive rule of law in the country and promoting the legalisation of all aspects of national governance. According to the Chinese Constitution, the NPC has the power to amend the Constitution and supervise its implementation, while the NPC Standing Committee interprets the Constitution and oversees its implementation. The NPC, its Standing Committee, and local people's congresses with legislative power have the authority to draft and amend laws and regulations, and the people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees have the right to supervise the implementation of laws and regulations and supervise the state organs to perform their duties in accordance with the law. Such an institutional arrangement is conducive to giving full play to the functional role of the people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels in the construction of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics; it is conducive to promoting scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and public adherence to the law; it is conducive to continuously improving the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution as the core; it is conducive to ensuring the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws; and it is conducive to maintaining social fairness and justice. This effectively overcomes the phenomena seen in some countries where there are no laws to follow, laws are not enforced, or where power overrides the law or suppresses it. ——、。，、，、，、，、.，，、、、，，，。、、. Fifth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of maintaining national unity and ensuring long-term stability. China is a unified multi-ethnic country and also a unitary state. The people's congress system serves as an institutional guarantee for maintaining national unity, ethnic solidarity, and social stability. Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, we have rationally divided the powers of the central and local governments, with the central government having comprehensive governance authority over all local administrative regions, including ethnic autonomous areas and special administrative regions. We uphold the principle of equality among all ethnic groups. In areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated, regional autonomy is practised, and autonomous organs are established to exercise the powers and autonomy of local state organs in accordance with the law. We adhere to the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems', establishing special administrative regions in Hong Kong and Macau, maintaining the constitutional order of the special administrative regions as defined by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and supporting the Chief Executives and governments of the special administrative regions in governing in accordance with the law. These institutional arrangements are conducive to maintaining the unity of the legal system, safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, fully leveraging the initiatives of both the central and local governments, and concentrating efforts to achieve major undertakings. They also help to consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations based on equality, solidarity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and promote the building of a Chinese national community. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where local governments act independently, central authority is weak (the tail is too large to wag – ), and ethnic extrangement/divisions and conflicts persist. ——、。，，、、。，，。，，，。--，、，，。，、，、，、。、、. Share Tracking People's Daily In the next bit, Xi begins by talking about the -strong vitality and significant superiority- of the people's congress system. Xinhua English summarises the next two paragraphs well: -Xi pointed out that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, our Party has stood at a new historical juncture, gained a deep understanding of the new changes to the principal contradictions in Chinese society, actively responded to the people's new demands and aspirations for democracy and rule of law, and improved the organizational and working systems of people's congresses, making historic achievements in its work. We adhere to adapting the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and fine traditional Chinese culture, deeply grasp the laws governing the development of socialist democracy, and continuously promote theoretical and practical innovations in the system of people's congresses. Noting that the system of people's congresses is an important institutional vehicle for realizing whole-process people's democracy in China, Xi said it is imperative to uphold the CPC's leadership, adhere to the use of a system of institutions to ensure that the people run the country, exercise law-based governance on all fronts, uphold democratic centralism, and stick to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. Efforts must be made to modernize China's system and capacity for governance, give full play to the role of deputies to people's congresses, strengthen the self-improvement efforts of people's congresses at various levels to uphold their four-fold role as political, working, representative institutions, and institutions of state power. This series of new concepts, ideas and requirements form the Party's important thoughts on upholding and improving the system of people's congresses, providing fundamental guidance for the high-quality development of people's congresses in the new era. After this, he put forth five points of action going forward. First, give full play to the role of people's congresses in ensuring full and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees must fully perform their functions, firmly safeguard the unity, dignity, and authority of the country's legal system, ensure effective implementation of the Constitution and laws, and make sure that all state organs fulfill their duties and carry out their work within the scope permitted by the Constitution and laws. Second, it is important that people's congresses play a leading role in legislative work. Xi urged efforts to improve the legislative framework featuring guidance from Party committees, the leading role played by people's congresses, support from the government, and participation by all parties. Efforts should be made to step up legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related fields, improve the quality of legislation, and continuously improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He also urged efforts to accelerate the improvement of a legal system featuring equal rights, equal opportunities and fair rules for all to ensure that citizens fully enjoy their rights. In addition, he called to adhere to deepening reforms within the framework of the rule of law, achieving unity between reform and the rule of law; major reforms should be based on the law and should be elevated to the status of legal systems in a timely manner. Third, he called to give full play to the key role of the oversight by people's congresses in the Party and state supervision systems. It is imperative to improve the system through which people's congresses oversee the government, the supervisory commissions, the people's courts and the people's procuratorates. Xi urged people's congresses to strengthen oversight of the implementation of the Constitution and laws, and intensify the review and oversight of government budgets and final accounts and the oversight over the management of state-owned assets and government debts. People's congresses should work to promote the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's decisions and plans, and ensure that all state organs exercise their powers by law and that the legitimate rights and interests of the people are safeguarded and realized. Administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory and procuratorial organs at various levels should readily accept oversight from people's congresses and effectively fulfill their respective supervisory duties. Fourth, Xi pointed out that people's congresses should play an exemplary role in maintaining close ties with the people. All state organs and their employees must foster a strong sense of service to the people, put the people above all else, and maintain close ties with them. Deputies to people's congresses shoulder the honorable duties entrusted to them by the people, Xi noted, urging them to faithfully represent the interests and will of the people, and serve as the bridge that links the Party and the state with the people. He stressed the need for all state organs to provide support for the deputies to the people's congresses to perform their duties in accordance with the law, improve the systems and mechanisms for contact with deputies, and ensure that deputies reach out to the public on a greater variety of issues and in more diversified ways. Fifth, Xi emphasized that party committees at all levels should strengthen their overall leadership over the work of the people's congresses, and support the people's congresses and their standing committees in exercising their powers and carrying out their work in accordance with the law. The leading Party members groups of the standing committees of the people's congresses at all levels should always adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, fulfill their main responsibilities for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, and strengthen the political, ideological, organizational, work style, and disciplinary construction of the people's congresses in line with the requirement to uphold the four-fold role. They should train personnel that maintain political resolve, serve the people, respect the rule of law, promote democracy, and are diligent and responsible, and continuously improve the quality and level of the people's congress work in the new era and on the new journey. Towards the end, Xi said: -Democracy is a common value of all mankind. The great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in developing people's democracy have enriched global democratic theory and practice, and contributed Chinese wisdom and solutions. We should draw on the beneficial achievements of human political civilization, but we must not simply copy Western political systems. We are willing to continue exploring with all countries and peoples around the world who pursue peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, to jointly explore paths for achieving broad, genuine, and effective democracy, and to make new contributions to the progress of human political civilization.- 。，，。，。、、、、、，、、，。 70 years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call to ‘struggle to build a great socialist country' in his opening speech at the first session of the First NPC. Now, the new journey of building a comprehensive modern socialist country has begun, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. The entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, keep in mind the original intention and mission, actively develop whole-process people's democracy, strive to build socialist political civilization, give full play to the significant advantages of the people's congress system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization!- 70，，--。，，。，、，，，，、! Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Saturday, there was a detailed report (English report) on Xi's visit to Gansu and Shaanxi. Xinhua has a detailed English report too. In Gansu, Xi was accompanied by Gansu governor and Party secretary. He visited Tianshui, Lanzhou and other localities. Xi visited the Fuxi temple in Tianshui. Xi said that -it is imperative to protect and pass on the precious cultural heritage, so that the wisdom and creativity of ancestors will constantly inspire future generations and enhance national pride and confidence.- He then visited the Huaniu apple production base in the Maiji district of Tianshui. There, he listened to a report of a project to divert water from the Taohe River. The big message from Xi was that -the key to rural revitalization is industrial revitalization.- He called for -strengthened efforts to protect and optimize cultivation of this variety (of apples) and apply new marketing models so that this specialty industry will be expanded, and more people will increase their incomes. He wished villagers a prosperous life.- Xi then visited the Maijishan Grottoes. He said that -China's four major grottoes are the treasures of Chinese civilization, all of which have important historical and cultural value. He called on cultural relic workers to continue the -Mogao Spirit,- devote themselves to protecting national treasures, and make greater contributions to promoting the inheritance and innovative development of China's traditional culture and enhancing the influence of Chinese culture.- Next stop was Lanzhou, where he first went to a service center for Party members and residents. He also visited a police station. -He emphasized the necessity of focusing on the practical needs of residents, especially the elderly and children, and continuously improving community services. It is imperative to adhere to and develop the ‘Fengqiao model- in the new era, and make more solid progress on community-level governance and social security. Work must be done to continue to take actions against the practice of formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots units, so that grassroots cadres can devote more time and energy to serving the people.- Then, Xi visited a section of the Yellow River near the Zhongshan Bridge in Lanzhou, where he stressed the importance of ecological protection. The next day, he listened to a -work report from the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the provincial government, and affirmed the province's achievements in various work.- Xi added: Gansu should promote new-type industrialization, accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, strengthen and improve industries with distinctive advantages, actively develop strategic emerging industries, develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, and build a significant national manufacturing base for new energy and new-energy-related equipment. He also urged the province to actively cultivate modern specialty agriculture in cold and arid climate, and nurture a number of competitive agricultural brands. Efforts should also be made to promote the integrated protection and systematic management of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grass and sand there, and fortify the ecological security shelter in the western part of the country. He stressed the need for the province to deepen reform and expand opening up with greater courage and determination, actively integrate into the building of a unified national market, deepen reform related to state assets and state-owned enterprises, and encourage and support the development of the non-public sector. Efforts should also be made to implement the people-centered new urbanization strategy effectively, enhance the comprehensive carrying capacity of the counties, expand the county economy, and promote the integrated urban and rural development. Xi urged the province to take the initiative to serve and align local development with coordinated regional development strategy, expand cross-provincial cooperation, and deeply integrate itself into high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the construction of the new western land-sea corridor. Xi pointed out that Gansu Province has a profound historical and cultural heritage and is rich in resources of revolutionary culture. It is necessary to carry forward the revolutionary traditions and strengthen cultural heritage protection, he said. Efforts should be made to support the Dunhuang Academy in its efforts to become an example of world cultural heritage protection and a center of Dunhuang studies, and advance the building of the national cultural parks dedicated to the Great Wall, the Long March and the Yellow River, so as to provide a powerful source of inspiration for modernization. Efforts should also be made to further integrate culture and tourism, developing the cultural tourism sector into a pillar industry. Xi emphasized the need to promote social advancement and governance and establish a solid foundation for common prosperity among all ethnic groups. It is important to pool resources to address the demands of the people and accomplish practical livelihood projects that are tangible and accessible to the people. Work must be done to consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, and prevent any risk of lapsing or relapsing into poverty en masse in rural areas. Efforts should be made to promote the transformation of rural customs to cultivate a civilized rural atmosphere, continuously forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation and strengthen the governance of religious affairs in accordance with the law. He emphasized efforts to ensure the basic needs of the people affected by the earthquake that struck Jishishan County are met, and advance post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, making sure the people are safe and warm during the winter. Work must be done to effectively ensure workplace safety. Finally, on September 12, Xi met with senior officers at colonel-level and above, and representatives of model soldiers at the grassroots and civilian staff of the PLA troops stationed in Lanzhou. He was accompanied by CMC Vice Chairman He Weidong. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Theory workers should thoroughly study and comprehend Chairman Xi's important expositions on political army building in the new era, and strengthen research and interpretation of the strategy for political army building in the new era.

Deputies to the People's Congresses are elected through democratic processes, come from among the people, are rooted in the people, and maintain close ties with the people. They faithfully represent the interests and will of the people in exercising state power, which is a distinctive feature and unique advantage of the People's Congress system. Over the past 70 years, as the people's congress system has been continuously improved, the system of deputies has also been strengthened, providing support and guarantees for deputies to perform their duties according to law and to maintain contact with the public. Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has placed great emphasis on the role of deputies, comprehensively strengthening leadership over the work of deputies. The mechanisms and systems for deputies to connect with the people have been further improved, channels have become smoother, and the effectiveness of their work has been continuously enhanced.- ，。，、，，，。70，，，、。，，，、、.

I am going to cover the different meetings and statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website. First, Wang said (English report) -in the face of current security challenges, BRICS should adopt a long-term perspective, demonstrate a more open attitude, and cooperate more closely to jointly address security threats and resolve security dilemmas, so as to inject positive energy into the turbulent international situation and make new contributions to building a world of lasting peace and universal security-. He then put forward four points: -Firstly, be implementers of peaceful coexistence. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. BRICS should lead by example in practicing peaceful coexistence, strengthening solidarity and coordination and upholding independence, and take the lead in building a community with a shared future for mankind. It is essential to adhere to a holistic approach to national security, systematically advance political, economic, cultural and social security, and firmly grasp the initiative of safeguarding national security, in a bid to ensure real security for the people. Secondly, be builders of multilateralism. Guided by true multilateralism, BRICS should advocate abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, uphold dialogue rather than confrontation, partnership rather than alliance, and win-win rather than zero-sum outcomes. Using the UN's 2024 Summit Of The Future as an opportunity, BRICS should jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and support the UN in playing a greater role in international security affairs. Exceptionalism and double standards should be rejected, and any words or deeds that undermine the UN's authority or negate the binding force of Security Council resolutions should be firmly resisted. Thirdly, be promoters of political settlement. BRICS should resolutely promote the political settlement of hotspot issues, uphold the principle of indivisible security, respect each other's legitimate concerns, seek common ground while shelving differences in dialogues, work with each other in the same direction in negotiations, and turn hostility into friendship. Regarding the prolonged spillover of the Ukraine crisis, China and Brazil jointly issued a six-point consensus, which received widespread positive responses. BRICS partners are encouraged to support and participate in this initiative to amplify the rational, balanced and constructive voices within the international community and build more consensus for a political settlement to the crisis. Regarding the Gaza conflict, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive ceasefire as soon as possible, unblock humanitarian aid corridors, and return to the right track of the two-state solution as soon as possible. Fourthly, be defenders of fairness and justice. BRICS should speak for justice and jointly advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. Upholding the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, BRICS should make the global governance system more just and equitable, effectively enhancing the representation and voice of the Global South to ensure equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal rules for every country. BRICS should strengthen the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) and balance development and security to ensure that AI always serves the progress of human civilization.- He added that -China stands ready to work with BRICS partners to fully implement the Global Security Initiative-. Subscribe now Next, there's a report (English report) on Wang's comments during the meeting's work reviewing the BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group and the Cybersecurity Working Group. Wang again made four points: First, adhere to the correct principles. Advocate a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security, and forge a new path for security. Support the United Nations in playing a central coordinating role in global counter-terrorism cooperation, and resist ‘double standards' and politicization and instrumentalization of counter-terrorism issues. Promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable internet governance system reflecting the will and interests of most countries, achieving resource sharing, joint responsibility, and cooperative governance, and ensuring the sharing of digital dividends. Second, strengthen practical cooperation. China fully affirms the results of the Counter-Terrorism and Cybersecurity Working Group and is willing to work with all parties to earnestly implement the ‘BRICS Counter-Terrorism Strategy' and ‘Action Plan' to create a model for international counter-terrorism cooperation. China invites BRICS counter-terrorism officials to visit Xinjiang again and supports the signing of an MoU on BRICS cybersecurity cooperation. Third, demonstrate the spirit of solidarity. BRICS countries should fully leverage the positive effects of the ‘BRICS+' model, unite a broader range of countries with the BRICS spirit, share experiences and practices, expand dialogue and cooperation, provide capacity-building support, and continuously consolidate the common positions and actions of the Global South on counter-terrorism and cybersecurity. Fourth, improve global governance. Promote the implementation of GSI, adhere to the principle of consultation, joint construction and sharing, and establish a fair, reasonable and effective global security governance system centered on the United Nations. Jointly promote the implementation of the Global Data Security Initiative and the Global Artificial Intelligence Governance Initiative, and gather BRICS forces to improve global security governance. Strengthen multilateral coordination, deeply participate in the formulation of rules in areas such as counter-terrorism and cybersecurity, enhance the voice and influence of BRICS countries, and safeguard common interests. 。、、、，。，--、。、，、、，。。，《》《》，。，。。-+-，，，,，--、。。，，、。《》《》，。，、，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Wang's meeting with Youssef Alaa El-Deen, secretary general of the Egyptian National Security Council.

The people of all countries have a stronger yearning for peace and security, and the call for unity and cooperation is more urgent. The cause of world peace and development cannot be separated from the support and participation of all progressive forces. Entering the new century, the ‘Global South' has grown significantly, which is the trend of historical development and the hope of the century of change. Faced with a world intertwined with changes and chaos, the ‘Global South' should bravely stand at the forefront of the tide, take initiative, and contribute positive energy to building a world of lasting peace and universal security.-，，，，，，。，。。，--，，。，--，，、。.

Adhere to the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, respect the legitimate security concerns of all parties, adhere to the general direction of political settlement, resolve disputes through dialogue, resolve differences through consultation, and promote security through cooperation. We must firmly oppose all acts of hegemony, bullying, and power politics, as well as bloc confrontation and military coercion. Second, we must consolidate the solid foundation for development. We should work together to bring development back to the center of the international agenda, revitalize global development partnerships, share development opportunities and outcomes, and achieve common prosperity. We must resist the counter-currents of ‘small yards with high walls' and ‘decoupling and breaking chains', oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, safeguard the legitimate development rights of the ‘Global South', and ensure that no country is left behind on the path to modernization. Third, we must promote solidarity and mutual assistance. We should help each other on the path to development, closely coordinate in international affairs, support each other on issues involving core interests and major concerns, unite and speak with one voice on principles concerning the common interests of the ‘Global South' and the future and destiny of mankind, win respect on the international stage, enhance influence, and gain a greater voice. Fourth, we must demonstrate openness and inclusiveness. We should jointly advocate respect for the diversity of civilizations, promote the common values ​​of all mankind, promote the peaceful coexistence and common prosperity of different civilizations, different systems, and different paths, and make the exchange and mutual learning of civilizations a bond for maintaining world peace. We must firmly resist a few countries from imposing their will on others, turning values ​​into a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, or even a weapon to incite confrontation. 。、、、，，，，，。，。。，，，。----，，--，。。，，，--，，，。。，，、、、，。，，。 The report concludes with Wang saying that: -BRICS countries and the ‘Global South' have natural emotional bonds and broad common interests. China supports the BRICS to open its doors to seek development and open its arms to promote cooperation. We welcome more like-minded southern partners to join the BRICS family, and jointly become a stabilising force for maintaining peace, a backbone force for open development, a constructive force for global governance, and a promoting force for mutual learning among civilizations, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- ，--。，，，、、、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Anyway, back to PD, there's a report (English report) on the first China-Latin America human rights roundtable being held in Brazil.

Page 4: There's a report with comments from Mo Rong, president of the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, discussing the proposal to push back the statutory retirement age. Mo said that: This -is a major reform based on the needs of the development of China's economic, social, and demographic situation. It takes a long-term perspective and is the result of extensive deliberation, thorough research, and careful decision-making. It is an objective requirement for economic and social development and an inevitable choice for China to adapt to the new normal of population development. It is related to supporting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality population development, and it has objective necessity and practical urgency.- -、、，，、、，，，，。-. This reform responds to the objective reality of increased life expectancy and years of education in China, addressing the need to enhance the effectiveness of human resource development and utilisation. With the improvement in living standards, advancements in medical technology, and better health and sanitation conditions, China's average life expectancy has risen to 78.6 years. At the same time, the average years of education for new labour force entrants has increased from 8 years in 1982 to 14 years in 2023, marking a significant rise. ‘This also means that the age at which the labour force starts working has been delayed. If the statutory retirement age remains unchanged, the reduction in average working years will lead to issues such as a lower utilisation rate of human capital,' Mo Rong explained. Drawing from international experience and China's own circumstances, implementing delayed retirement reform helps increase the labour participation rate of younger elderly people, enhances the potential and quality of labour supply, promotes human resource development, and transforms the demographic dividend into a human resource dividend. This reform also addresses changes in the working-age population and the need to increase the effective labour supply across society.- 、，。、，78.6，，19828202314，。-，。，。-，，，，，。，.

Mo added that -in recent years, China's working-age population has declined, and the proportion of working-age population in the total population will continue to decline going ahead. ‘The implementation of delayed retirement age reform is conducive to stabilising the labour participation rate, maintaining the momentum and vitality of economic and social development, and is an important measure to implement the national strategy of actively responding to population ageing. It can better support the high-quality development of the economy and society'.- -、、，。-，2023，602.97，21.1%。，，，-，，，.- He finally clarified that the reform will follow the principles of being voluntary and flexible. In other words it will be implemented -fully considering the needs of different groups, allowing workers to choose a retirement plan that suits their own work and life circumstances. Employees who wish to retire earlier, and meet conditions such as the minimum contribution period for pension insurance, can opt for flexible early retirement. Younger elderly people who are willing, able, and qualified to continue working are not forced out of the labour market prematurely and can choose to keep working-. -、，，。，，。、、，，。-，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has said that Beijing is giving Moscow -very substantial- help to beef up its war machine, and in return Russia is handing over its closely guarded military tech on submarines and missiles, as per Politico. The report says: -Speaking with a group of journalists, including POLITICO, after meetings with European Union and NATO counterparts in Brussels, Campbell upped the ante on Beijing. The U.S. previously focused on Beijing's supply of what's known as dual-use technologies — which can be applied for military or civilian purposes. Now Washington is unambiguously saying that China is aiding the Russian military. With Moscow facing international sanctions, it desperately needs technology to boost its military production to be able to continue its war against Ukraine. ‘These are not dual-use capabilities,- Campbell said, referring to the latest materials China is giving Russia. ‘These are basically being applied directly to the Russian war machine.- -These are component pieces of a very substantial effort on the part of China to help sustain, build and diversify various elements of the Russian war machine', he added. ‘We're seeing efforts at the highest levels of both governments to try to both hide and protect certain elements of this worrisome collaboration ... Most of these activities have been driven underground.' China has frequently issued statements denying it is supplying Russia with arms to use in Ukraine, insisting it does not provide either side with weapons and has an ‘impartial position' on the war. In exchange for Beijing's help, Russia has started giving China submarine, missile and other sensitive technologies. Historically, Moscow has been wary of giving Beijing its very latest military technology. ‘The capabilities that Russia is providing is support in areas where previously they had been frankly reluctant to engage directly with China,' Campbell said. ‘We are concerned about a particular number of military arenas where there appears to be some determination to provide China with greater support. ‘That has to do with submarine operations, activities of aeronautical design, including stealth; that also involves capacities on missile capabilities,' he said.- Xinhua reports that China's Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday expressed willingness to engage in further consultations with the European Union (EU) concerning the anti-subsidy case involving Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). The report says: -The EV case is complex and has a wide impact, and there are certain challenges facing the quest for China and the EU to reach an agreement through consultation, the spokesperson noted, adding that China believes that as long as the EU shows sincerity and works towards the same goal, the two sides can succeed in addressing each other's concerns through consultation. ‘China is willing to continue to work closely with the EU to reach an early solution that meets the common interests of both sides and conforms to World Trade Organization rules, so as to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU economic and trade relations'.- Wang Yi Meets Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council Sergei Shoigu: As per the report, Wang said that -in face of unprecedented changes in a century, the stable and healthy development of China-Russia relations are fundamentally due to the guidance of the two countries' heads of state…He stressed that China is willing to strengthen strategic communication with Russia, give full play to the role of the China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism and the BRICS Meeting of High Representatives on National Security mechanism, and continuously enrich the strategic connotations of China-Russia relations. Meanwhile, Wang said that China supports Russia's work as the rotating chair of BRICS and is willing to join hands to deepen mutual trust and cooperation among BRICS countries, to shape the BRICS mechanism into a major channel for emerging powers to make their voices heard and an important platform for solidarity and cooperation of the ‘Global South' and to continuously create new paradigms for ‘BRICS+' cooperation.- The report adds: -The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis. Shoigu explained Russia's position on the issue. He welcomed the ‘six-point consensus' jointly proposed by China and Brazil, saying Russia is pleased to see this consensus widely recognized by the international community. Wang stated that China has always maintained an objective and fair attitude on the Ukraine issue and will continue to commit to increasing the voice of balance, objectivity, and rationality in the international community, to gather more international consensus and accumulate necessary conditions for an early ceasefire and a political resolution to the crisis.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

But this Reuters report puts it in context. -China's consumer inflation accelerated in August to the fastest pace in half a year but the uptick was due more to higher food costs from weather disruptions than a recovery in domestic demand as producer price deflation worsened. A sputtering start in the second half is mounting pressure on the world's second-largest economy to roll out more policies amid a prolonged housing downturn, persistent joblessness, debt woes and rising trade tensions. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6% from a year earlier last month, versus a 0.5% rise in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, but less than a 0.7% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Extreme weather this summer from deadly floods to scorching heat has pushed up farm produce prices, contributing to faster inflation. China's affected crops due to various natural disasters totalled 1.46 million hectares in August, state media reported on Monday.- Also note that in August, affected by insufficient market demand and the downward trend of some international bulk commodity prices, PPI fell by 0.7% month-on-month.

China-US Talks: The China-U.S. commercial and trade working group held its second vice-ministerial meeting in Tianjin on Saturday. Xinhua says: -During the meeting, the Chinese side expressed concerns regarding the U.S. Section 301 tariffs, the Section 301 investigation into China's shipbuilding and other sectors, the overstretching of the concept of national security, sanctions on Chinese companies, restrictions on bilateral investments, the U.S. trade remedies against China, and unfair treatment of Chinese firms in the United States, among other issues. The Chinese side emphasized that clarifying the boundaries of national security in economic and trade matters would help stabilize business cooperation expectations. It opposes using claims of ‘overcapacity' as a pretext for imposing trade and investment restrictions, according to the MOC. Both sides have agreed to provide necessary support for trade and investment promotion activities hosted by both countries, maintain communications in areas such as cross-border data flows, inspection and quarantine, healthcare and women's health, medical devices as well as clean energy, and continue to facilitate cooperation between Chinese and U.S. businesses by establishing more project offices.

No Party Spirit, No Membership - Breakdown of US NSA's China Visit & Beijing's Questions About VP Harris - India-China Talks - Xi Presses Reform Agend...	Instead of going page-by-page today, I'll go issue-by-issue, since that works better for today. Let's begin with a report on Xi Jinping presiding over the sixth meeting of the Central Committee for Comprehensively Deepening Reform on Thursday morning. Xi said that -further deepening reform is an advancement based on the comprehensive deepening of reform since the new era, and it has a solid foundation and favourable conditions.- ，，. -We should make good use of the existing reform achievements and important experiences, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, keep pace with the times, be realistic and pragmatic, fully mobilise the enthusiasm of all parties, and do our best to organise and implement the reform tasks.- ，、、、，，. The meeting approved: A guideline on upgrading pilot free trade zones Work Plan for the Implementation of Important Reform Measures from the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee by Relevant Departments of the Central and State Organs The report then praises the -landmark and leading institutional innovation achievements- of the 22 free trade pilot zones set up by the CPC Central Committee since the 18th Party Congress. It adds: Share Tracking People's Daily Next, let's look at the report on Xi Jinping meeting with US NSA Jake Sullivan. Xinhua says: As per Xinhua, Sullivan said that his talks with Wang Yi were -candid, substantive and constructive.- He added that: The US readout is very brief. It says: -The two sides discussed further implementation of the commitments President Biden and President Xi made at the November 2023 Woodside Summit, including on counternarcotics, military-to-military communications, and AI safety and risk. They also discussed cross-Strait issues, Russia's war against Ukraine, and the South China Sea. Both sides welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, including planning for a call between President Biden and President Xi in the coming weeks.- Share Tracking People's Daily While in Beijing, Sullivan also met with CMC vice chairman Zhang Youxia. Here is the Chinese reporting on the meeting: The US readout on this meeting says: Subscribe now There's also a press briefing that Sullivan did before leaving Beijing. Key points: -We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy.- -This was a true working visit. Over the course of 14 hours of meetings, we discussed progress and next steps on implementation of the Woodside commitments, including our work on counternarcotics and efforts to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs into the United States; military-to-military communications including an upcoming engagement between our theater commanders; as well as work towards another round of AI safety and risk talks. Among other issues of global concern, we discussed the recent efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.- -The United States will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security without unduly limiting trade or investment. We have continued concerns about China's unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices. We remain deeply concerned about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and its impact on both European and transatlantic security, not to mention on Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine…I also underscored the longstanding U.S. commitment to universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. In all of my meetings, I stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; emphasized the United States' commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; and I reaffirmed the United States' commitment to our Indo-Pacific allies including our concerns about destabilizing actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea.- Then we get to the questions. -I think the meeting with Vice Chairman Zhang was very important. There is no substitute for actually being able to sit across the table, not just with the Vice Chairman but with his whole team, and be able to hear from them their perspective on critical issues, and them be able to hear from us our perspective on those same issues, whether it's cross-Strait relations or the South China Sea or cyber issues. And being able to have that exchange, which is rare, I think allows us to clarify our intentions and our concerns and hear theirs, and try to use that in service of responsible management of the relationship going forward.- This bit is interesting, since it tells us that Beijing was clearly interested in understanding what a Harris presidency would mean for US-China ties. And that there were direct questions, it seems, to that effect. Q Thank you. From the Wall Street Journal. Just to follow up on the question about the U.S. election, I'm curious about what questions, if any, did the Chinese ask you about what a potential Harris administration would represent for U.S.-China relations. And connected to this, did you raise the issue specifically of potential election interference by China during your trip here today? Let me take a moment here and highlight this from a report today in SCMP on Harris' latest interview with CNN: Finally, I do recommend pondering over this paragraph. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also put out a detailed review of the visit. Director General Yang Tao of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs said that Sullivan-Wang conversations spanned six sessions, totaling more than 11 hours. They discussed the China-U.S. relations, sensitive issues and major international and regional hotspots. I am only going to highlight anything not covered above. First, the key to keeping the China-U.S. relations to the right direction lies in the guidance and stewardship of the two presidents; Second, the key to avoiding conflict and confrontation between China and the United States lies in abiding by the three joint communiques; Third, the key to smooth interactions between China and the United States lies in treating each other as equals; Fourth, the key to a steady and sustained China-U.S. relationship lies in cementing the popular foundation; Fifth, the key to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States lies in developing a right perception. These ‘five keys' will help the two sides chart a better future and find a right way for the two major countries to get along with each other.- -The two sides also agreed on a number of specific matters, including: to maintain high-level exchanges and communication at various levels; to continue cooperation in such areas as anti-narcotics, law enforcement, repatriation of illegal immigrants, and tackling climate change; to hold in due course a theater commander-level video call between the two militaries and the second round of intergovernmental dialogue on AI, among other institutionalized arrangements; and to maintain communication on international and regional hotspots including the Middle East, Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula. These new outcomes will help the two sides remove interference, overcome obstacles, and move toward the San Francisco vision, and jointly promote a healthy, stable and sustainable China-U.S. relationship.- On the South China Sea, he said: -Developing alliances and partnerships is something up to the United States itself, but it should not use it to hurt China's interests. The Philippines should keep its word, and the United States should also do things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.- The final bit on China-US ties today is a report confirming that on September 7, the China-US commercial and trade working group will hold its second vice-ministerial meeting in Tianjin. Share Tracking People's Daily The General Office of the Party Central Committee has issued new regulations outlining how underperforming and unqualified Party members should be dealt with. The document is called -Measures for the Organizational Handling of Unqualified Party Members of the Communist Party of China- . The report on this says that the -formulation and implementation of these ‘Measures' are of great significance for implementing the strategy of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, building a Party member team with firm beliefs, political reliability, reasonable structure, high quality, strict discipline, and outstanding performance, and continuously enhancing the Party's vitality and vigor.- 《》，，、、、、、，，. The Measures have 27 articles, mainly covering four aspects: The overall requirements, concepts, methods, and principles of organisational handling of such cadres The applicable situations for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion are detailed, with detailed procedures and subsequent matters for handling The provisions for situations that can be exempted from handling, or where this can be done in a combined manner, and other policy requirements that should be grasped The work responsibilities, work disciplines, etc. for handling of such cases 《》27，4：、、；、，；、；、. If you are further interested, on Page 4, there's an interview with an official from the Central Organisation Department on these new regulations. The official informs that the draft measures were approved by the Politburo Standing Committee on May 21, 2024. I am only covering the question about the applicable circumstances under which someone gets taken to task for organizational handing under this document. The official says that the ‘Measures' discuss 15 scenarios for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion. Persuasion to withdraw from the Party: This covers cases where individuals who threaten to quit the Party in order to achieve their personal goals and do not change after education; and those who have not changed after the rectification within the specified time frame. Expulsion: This mainly includes cases where one is lacking ideals and beliefs, wavering in political stance, being disloyal and dishonest to the Party, abandoning the Party's original aspiration and mission, and having lost the qualifications of a Party member; failure to participate in the Party's organisational activities for 6 consecutive months without justifiable reasons, or failure to pay Party dues, or failure to do the work assigned by the Party; suspension of Party membership due to loss of contact with the Party organisation, and no contact can be made after two years; and where a member, despite being persuaded to withdraw from the Party, insists on not leaving. At the same time, adhering to a practical approach and distinguishing between subjective and objective factors, the ‘Measures' specify situations where no handling is necessary: if the Party organisation to which the Party member belongs is not sound or weak and lax, and the organisational life is not normal, such that the Party member cannot normally participate in the organisational life and fulfil the obligations of the Party member; if the Party member is restricted by objective conditions and cannot temporarily complete the work assigned by the Party organisation, and cannot play a role in the short term or in a certain work, no punishment may be given. ：、《》，、，，《》、15。（1），、、；；，；、，、；6、2。（2），，；。（3），、，，，；，6，，；，2；、。，，，：、，、，，，，.

As of July 31, 2024, the number of enterprises related to energy-saving and environmental protection industries in China was close to 5 million, a year-on-year increase of 19.3%. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese government today issued a new White Paper, titled China's Energy Transition. My colleague Rakshith Shetty, who has been researching China's new energy policies, has provided me with a short summary of the key highlights from the document. The paper documents China's actions and achievements in transitioning to green and low-carbon energy over the past decade. It highlights that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, China's energy sector has entered a stage of high-quality development guided by President Xi Jinping's new energy security strategy. Below are key data and takeaways from the white paper: China's investment in energy transition reached USD 676 billion in 2023 Clean energy consumption increased from 15.5% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2023, while coal consumption dropped by 12.1 percentage points In 2023, clean energy accounted for 58.2% (1,700 GW) of the total installed power generation capacity (2,920 GW) and generated 39.7% (3,800 TWh) of the country's total electricity, up ~15 percentage points from 2013 Over the past decade, clean energy accounted for more than 50% of the increase in total electricity consumption China invested over RMB100 billion from the central budget to upgrade rural power grids, enabling nationwide electricity access by 2015 By 2023, clean energy heating in northern China approached 80%, and charging facilities for new energy vehicles increased from less than 100,000 in 2013 to almost 8.6 million Energy consumption per unit of GDP (energy intensity) decreased by more than 26% from 2013 to 2023 The number of coal-fired boilers and power plants decreased by more than 80% nationwide China collaborated with over 100 countries and regions on green energy projects In 2023, China's wind power and PV exports helped other countries reduce CO2 emissions by about 810 million tonnes The second chapter focuses on China's efforts to promote green energy consumption through energy conservation, efficiency improvements, and strengthening institutional constraints for carbon reduction. As part of its commitment to reducing energy intensity, China has introduced various energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies and industries. These initiatives have led to significant energy savings, equivalent to approximately 1.4 billion tonnes of standard coal, and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of about 3 billion tonnes. To further support these efforts, China has established a comprehensive framework of standards and regulations. By the end of 2023, the country had released 335 national standards on energy consumption limits and product energy efficiency. Moreover, the energy conservation service industry has experienced rapid growth, with its total output value exceeding RMB 500 billion in 2023, a twofold increase compared to 2013. These developments demonstrate China's dedication to promoting sustainable energy consumption and reducing its carbon footprint. The third chapter emphasises the importance of accelerating the development of non-fossil energy sources to pursue eco-environmental progress, promote green and low-carbon economic and social development, and achieve peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals. The fourth chapter highlights China's efforts to implement an innovation-driven development strategy in the energy sector. China is improving top-level design and overall plans to establish innovation as a primary driver in energy technology. It adopts an open competition mechanism for selecting the best candidates to undertake key energy technology projects and a multi-team research mechanism for finding the best pathways and achieving optimal results. China is applying supercritical and ultra-supercritical power generation and deep peak-shaving technologies in the coal-fired power industry to raise its environmental and energy efficiency indicators to world-leading standards. The fifth chapter explains the modernisation of energy governance in China. The country has focused on building a unified national market, removing barriers within the energy market, and facilitating smooth and efficient market operations. The monopoly held by power grid enterprises in the purchase and sale of electricity has been largely eliminated, and energy prices are now determined primarily through market forces. China has strengthened the coordination of fiscal, taxation, investment, financing, and other macroeconomic policies, reinforced market regulation, and improved its public services to ensure both efficiency and fairness in its energy transition. The chapter also highlights how China has established a comprehensive legal framework to support its energy transition, comprising the Energy Conservation Law, the Renewable Energy Law, and other relevant laws and regulations Finally, the last chapter highlights China's contributions to the global energy transition through its own advancements.

It is necessary to understand this situation objectively and dialectically. It is necessary to attach great importance to the challenges brought by ageing, but also see that ageing contains new development opportunities, and the elderly population is also a valuable resource.

Launched on Aug. 21, the demo flight will exceed one month and encompass several high-plateau airports in Xizang, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu. This move aims to fully demonstrate the adaptability of ARJ21 aircraft to high-plateau airports and high-plateau routes, of airport ground service equipment and of special flight procedures, so as to better and more comprehensively meet the requirements of high-altitude operation. Daocheng Yading Airport in Sichuan Province, located at 4,411 meters above sea level, is known as the world's highest-altitude civilian airport. In July 2020, the ARJ21 aircraft completed maximum take-off and landing altitude tests locally. These tests verified that the ARJ21 is capable of serving all high-plateau airports, and paved the way for airlines to use the aircraft along more high-altitude routes, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), its developer. Plateau airports refer to those airports with an altitude of more than 1,500 meters above sea level. They include high-plateau airports that exceed 2,438 meters above sea level.- Page 2: There are two reports on Shanghai and Guangdong holding events to mark the 120th birth anniversary of Deng Xiaoping.

Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems is of great significance to comprehensively promoting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality development- 、、、，. In the first section, Han largely talks about why fiscal and taxation system reform is needed. He argues: The fiscal and taxation system is an important basic system that affects the allocation of resources, and fiscal policy is an important tool for macro-control. We must adapt to the changes in the principal contradiction of our society, accelerate the improvement of fiscal and taxation systems and mechanisms that are conducive to high-quality development, address the prominent issues that hinder the establishment of a new development pattern and the promotion of high-quality development, stimulate the vitality of various business entities, shape new development momentum and advantages, and create social wealth and material foundation that match the modernization level of more than 1.4 billion people. ，。，，、，，，14. Finance is the foundation and important pillar of national governance, and the fiscal and taxation system is an important part of the high-level socialist market economic system. We must adapt to the requirements of advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, strengthen our foundations, leverage our advantages, address weaknesses, and bolster areas of deficiency. Focus on building a unified national market, improve the macroeconomic governance system, accelerate the enhancement of the tax system and fiscal mechanisms, and strengthen coordination with other reforms, fully implement the requirements of modern budget management, and better transform China's institutional advantages into national governance effectiveness. ，。，、，、，、，，，，. Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation system is an objective requirement for promoting Chinese-style modernization… At present, the urban-rural, regional development and income distribution gaps in China are still prominent. The per capita resource availability is low, and the ecological environment is under significant pressure, while the external environment for development is becoming increasingly severe. It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the fiscal and taxation system and mechanism to promote shared development, expanding the ‘cake' while also dividing it better, promoting coordinated development between urban and rural areas, enhancing public welfare, and advancing common prosperity. Improve the fiscal and taxation policy system that supports green and low-carbon development, and promote the construction of a Beautiful China and harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. 。、，。，，、，。，----，，，。，、.

Perfect the individual income tax system that combines comprehensive and graded approaches, standardise tax policies for business income, capital gains, and property income, and implement unified taxation on labour income. Improve the local tax system. Advance the shift of consumption tax collection to later stages and gradually delegate it to local authorities, refine the value-added tax refund policy and deduction chain.

Politburo Meeting - China-Philippine Vessel Collision - Wang-Sullivan Meeting Preview - India Okays Chinese Investments	Hi folks, Instead of covering reports from the paper today — a lot of which I did not find interesting — I am highlighting some key stories over the past few days. First, there was a Politburo meeting on Friday. This was covered in the paper on Saturday. Xinhua has a detailed report on this. It says: The meeting reviewed -policies and measures to open up a new vista in the large-scale development of China's western region.- The report adds that -some other issues- were also discussed at the meeting. Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there's a preview of the upcoming visit by Jake Sullivan from August 27 to 29. The briefing provided by MoFA outlines the following points: -Since the Xi-Biden meeting in San Francisco in November 2022, -Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication. The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the U.S. President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan.- The official adds: On the Ukraine war, the official said: -The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.- On the South China Sea, the official said: -China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.- On the Middle East issue, he called for the US to adopt a -responsible position-. The official ended by saying that -China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the U.N.-Centered international system and international order-. Let's also look at the press briefing by the White House before the visit. Some key points: Each time the two (Sullivan and Wang) have met, they have typically spent about 10 to 12 hours over two days covering bilateral issues, global regional issues, and cross-Strait issues. We expect to follow the same format in Beijing next week…As I mentioned earlier, I expect these meetings will cover roughly the same format as we have in previous rounds, discussing key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship and advancing counternarcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, and AI safety and risk discussions — all outcomes of the Woodside summit. I expect we will also spend some time on areas of difference, as we always do. Mr. Sullivan will raise U.S. concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base, the South China Sea, and various other issues. I expect the two will also exchange views on other global issues, like DPRK, Middle East, and Burma. And I expect they will also discuss cross-Strait issues.- The official talked about pressing Beijing on theater command-level communications and -ensuring the resilience- of military-to-military communications. On counternarcotics, the official said that -we've seen some good action in that space over the last couple of months, including the scheduling for the first time in quite some time of three fentanyl precursors. But there's always more we can do.- On Biden's China policy: -I think what has been so successful in this administration is our China policy is not about changing China at its core, right? It's about positioning the United States to make the investments, build the alliances we need to succeed and grow stronger. And that really is the focus here. Part of that, then, is also ensuring we've got open channels of communication and high-level diplomacy to manage the risks of competition.- Finally, do note that on Friday, the US tightened its export controls to -further restrict the supply of both U.S.-origin and ‘U.S. branded' items to Russia and Belarus for the Kremlin's illegal war on Ukraine.- A total of 123 entities were added to the list, including 42 located in China, 63 from Russia and 14 in Türkiye, Iran, and Cyprus. Beijing reacted angrily -The move is a typical act of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction … It undermines the international trade order and rules, impedes normal international economic and trade exchanges, and affects the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains … The U.S. side should immediately stop its wrong actions, said the spokesperson, adding that China will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.- Subscribe now Third, SCMP reports that a PLA delegation led by Ground Force Commander Li Qiaoming arrived in Moscow for talks on Thursday, as Chinese Premier Li Qiang left for Belarus. -According to a Russian defence ministry statement cited by state news agency Sputnik: ‘A protocol meeting was held between the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Colonel General Alexander Fomin, and the Commander of the Ground Forces of the People's Liberation Army of China, Colonel General Li Qiaoming.' Li Qiaoming was in Moscow on a working visit at the invitation of commander-in-chief of the Russian ground forces, Army General Oleg Salyukov, the statement added. Sputnik News said the two sides discussed topical issues of mutual interest on military cooperation, but did not elaborate. There has so far been no official announcement from the Chinese side about the visit.- Leave a comment Fourth, there's an interesting report in Caixin that Chinese banks have committed 1.4 trillion yuan ($196 billion) in loans to support a total of 5,391 projects, which have been selected by local authorities under the whitelist system. The report says: Share Tracking People's Daily Fifth, the Economic Times has an interesting report on the Indian government green-lighting some Chinese investments. The report says: The report says that this shift has come amid pressure from the industry. As per the report, the electronics industry told the government that the blocking of Chinese investment -cost local manufacturers $15 billion in production losses as well as 100,000 jobs in the past four years.- -In submissions to various ministries, the electronics manufacturing industry had also said that India had lost out on export opportunities worth $10 billion as well as $2 billion in value addition.- It adds: -Last month, ET reported that the government told industry it planned an inter-ministerial panel to expedite the approval of investment proposals by Chinese firms to operate in India or tie up with Indian companies if they meet certain criteria. That plan has been implemented and two rounds of meetings have been held… ‘The inter-ministerial panel is meeting every six-seven weeks to take stock of the situation and grant approvals after doing thorough checks,' an official said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Sixth, there was another collision between a Chinese and Philippine vessel in the South China Sea.

Xi Defines Deng's Legacy - Li Qiang's Belarus Visit - China-Bhutan Boundary Talks - Guideline on Improving Market Access System - The Curious Case of ...	Page 1: Today's front page is largely dedicated to a report on Xi Jinping's remarks at the event marking Deng Xiaoping's 120th birth anniversary. Xi said that Deng was -an outstanding leader with high prestige, who was recognized by the entire Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups across the nation. Deng was a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat. He was a time-tested communist fighter, the core of the Party's second generation central leadership, the chief architect of China's socialist reform and opening up and modernization construction, the pioneer of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the primary founder of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and a great internationalist who made significant contributions to world peace and development. His outstanding contributions to the Party, the people, the country, the nation, and the world have left an indelible mark in history, inspiring future generations.- ，，，、、、，，，，，，。、、、、，、. The report adds that in his speech, Xi lauded the -outstanding contributions to the cause of national independence and people's liberation led by the Party and the establishment of New China, and carried out fruitful work for the establishment of the socialist system and socialist development. After the end of the ‘Cultural Revolution', as the core of the Party's second-generation central leadership, he led the Party and the people in achieving a great historical turning point, promoted a new leap in the sinicization of Marxism, opened up a new phase of socialist modernization, established the correct path for achieving the complete reunification of the motherland, firmly defended the glorious banner of socialism, and successfully pioneered socialism with Chinese characteristics.- ，，、、。、，。--，，，，，，，. ‘Xi Jinping emphasised that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical achievements are comprehensive and pioneering, and their impact on China and the world is profound and long-term. His lifelong struggle fully demonstrated a lofty character of unshakable faith in the ideals of communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics, his great love for the people, his theoretical quality of always adhering to seeking truth from facts, his political courage to constantly pioneering and innovating, his far-sighted strategic thinking, and his broad-minded and selfless character. We will always remember his great historical achievements, and we will forever admire his noble revolutionary spirit.- ，、，、。，、、、、、。，；，. -Xi Jinping emphasised that China is a strong force for maintaining world peace. We must always uphold the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We should champion the common values of all humanity, implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system, and continuously offer new opportunities to the world through the new progress of Chinese-style modernization.- ，。、、、，，，、、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Cai Qi then spoke, praising Xi's speech about Deng. He termed it -insightful and profound, with strong political, ideological and guiding significance-, while calling on everyone to study it. Among the others who spoke at the event were: Qu Qingshan, head of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Miao Hua, member of the CMC and Director of the Political Work Department of the CMC Wang Xiaohui, Party Secretary of Sichuan Province The full text of Xi's speech is available on Page 2. There is a lot of history that Xi covers in the speech. I am sharing below some key excerpts along with my takeaway:- -In the spring and summer of 1989, amid the backdrop of the Soviet Union's dissolution and dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, China experienced a severe political turmoil. At this critical moment, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the Party and the people in firmly opposing the chaos, resolutely defending the socialist state power, and ensuring that the Party and the country withstood a severe test of turbulent storms. Subsequently, he deeply reflected on the lessons learned during the process of reform and opening up, emphasising the need to focus on strengthening Party building, enhancing ideological and political work and education on fine traditions, improve the Party's leadership level and governing ability, and ensure the stability of the red country.- 。，。、，1989。，，，。，，，，，. Subscribe now Also check out this paragraph from Xi's speech: In the new era and on the new journey, we must continue to deeply study and apply Deng Xiaoping Theory, fully and accurately understanding its scientific essence and core essence. For example, Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the Party's basic line should guide us for a hundred years, and that it is necessary to unify around adhering to the economic construction as the center, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhere to reform and opening up throughout the entire process of socialist modernization. Emancipating the mind means seeking truth from facts, aligning thoughts with reality, and ensuring that the subjective conforms to the objective. Both planning and markets are economic tools. As long as they contribute to the development of productive forces, they can be utilized. We must uphold independence and self-reliance; at the same time cannot close the door and be isolated or be blindly xenophobic/anti-foreign influence. Instead, we must implement opening up to the outside world. It is necessary to encourage some regions and individuals to become rich and prosperous first; let those who become rich first help others to become rich later, ultimately realizing common prosperity for all, without permitting polarization. We must adhere to the dual focus on material and spiritual civilization, ensuring both are strengthened. We should take bold and steady steps in pursuing reform, carefully managing the relationship between reform, development, and stability, with stability being the top priority. The key to successfully managing China's affairs lies in the Party, which must simultaneously promote reform and opening up while fighting corruption. These important thoughts and assessments are filled with materialist dialectics, reflecting a broad perspective and strategic vision. They grasp the main contradictions and key aspects of issues, highlighting the distinctive style and unique appeal of Deng Xiaoping Theory. Only by understanding these important ideas and conclusions within the historical background, focusing on an overall and dialectical understanding, knowing both the meaning and the reasoning behind it, understanding not only what is true but also why it is true, can one correctly apply them to guide practice. If we focus on one aspect at the expense of another or place too much emphasis on one while neglecting others, it can lead to deviations in practice, or even to principled and directional errors (、). Our Party has experienced such lessons in history, and we must learn from them deeply.- ，，、、。，，，、、；，，；，、，、；、，，，、；，，；、，、，；、，，，；、；、，、、，；，，。，，，。，，、，，，。、，，、。，。 Finally, I'd like to highlight the paragraph on common prosperity.

This report is from a case in Guangzhou. Delivery driver Mo, who was riding on his electric bike, had an accident with a person named Hu, who was also driving an electric bike. The accident left Hu severely injured, with an open comminuted fracture of the right patella. Following a disagreement on compensation, Hu sued Mo and the delivery company. Hu Ziyuan, a judge of the Huangpu District People's Court of Guangzhou, assessed that the focus of the dispute is whether Mo was performing his duties when he was driving the electric vehicle at the time of the accident. If it is determined that the damage was caused in the course of Mo performing his duties, his employer shall bear the liability for compensation. The delivery company argued that Mo's last order was delivered at 12:06 pm. After this order was completed, he had no new order or delivery records on that day. Therefore, technically, this accident occurred during Mo's personal time, outside the scope of his duties, and therefore, it is unrelated to the company.	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/xi-defines-dengs-legacy-li-qiangs	2024-08-22T23:16:15-07:00
