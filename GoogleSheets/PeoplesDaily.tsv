Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 16, 2025. Page 1: The lead story on the page is about Xi Jinping's meeting (English report) with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Xi talked about the -traditional friendship- between the two countries. He added that -with joint efforts, China and Sri Lanka have continuously promoted strategic cooperative partnership featuring mutual assistance and ever-lasting friendship. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation and cooperation in various fields have achieved fruitful results, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples-. Xi told Dissanayake that China-Sri Lanka ties today face -a historical opportunity-. -The two countries should have a keen grasp of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective and jointly build a China-Sri Lanka community with a shared future- He added: -China takes Sri Lanka as a priority in its neighbourhood diplomacy. China will continue to support Sri Lanka in safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, support Sri Lanka in independently exploring a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to deepen political mutual trust with Sri Lanka, exchange experiences in state governance, and enhance dialogue and communication between various departments of the two countries. China's further comprehensive deepening of reform and promotion of Chinese-style modernization will bring new opportunities for Sri Lanka's development. China will actively support Sri Lanka in focusing on economic construction, promoting high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road', modern agriculture, digital economy, marine economy and other fields of cooperation, and create new highlights. It is necessary to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two sides and enhance linkages between the two peoples. China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Sri Lanka in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, jointly address major issues concerning human development such as climate change, adhere to the solidarity and development of the Global South, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- ，，、，，，，。、，。，--、、、，。，--。，，，. Dissanayake reportedly said that -Sri Lanka admires China's major development achievements in the fields of economy, science and technology, and infrastructure. China has always been a reliable friend and partner of Sri Lanka.

During this visit, deals were signed in such areas as Belt and Road cooperation, agricultural products, social welfare, and news and broadcasting. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report on the page discusses Xi's call with CPV General Secretary To Lam. Xinhua reports: Xi -called on China and Vietnam to step up connectivity, jointly build frontier platform for new quality productive forces cooperation, and build stable and smooth cross-border industrial and supply chains.- -Xi said he is glad to hold phone talks with To Lam at the turn of the year and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, recalling that during To Lam's state visit to China last August, the two leaders had in-depth exchanges and reached broad consensus on deepening relations between the two parties and the two countries, as well as jointly promoting the development of socialist cause. Over the past six months, the two sides have been active in implementation of the consensus, and the cooperation issues the two leaders agreed on have achieved positive progress, Xi said. The year 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period, and a key year for the preparation of 14th National Congress of the CPV, Xi said, noting it is a year of great significance for both countries that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The two sides should continue to rejuvenate and strengthen the two parties, deepen exchanges of socialist theory and practical experience, and promote the development of the socialist cause amid great changes unseen in a century, said Xi. It is necessary to fully leverage the political guidance of high-level exchanges and continue to maintain close exchanges, Xi said, adding the two countries should push for more results in mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides should carry out warm and down to earth people-to-people and cultural exchanges that connect people's hearts, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in areas such as media, culture and tourism, as well as between the youths of the two nations and at the sub-national level, creating more projects that win the hearts of the people, Xi said. The two countries should also strengthen international and regional coordination, safeguard international fairness and justice, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind, he added.- Among other things, To Lam reportedly said -that with the goal of preparing for the 14th National Congress of the CPV, Vietnam is set to embark on a new era of development, which envisions a prosperous, powerful, democratic, equitable, and civilized nation. In this process, Vietnam will learn from China's development experience as much as possible, especially the new theoretical and practical innovation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, he added.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Xi's latest article in Qiushi. I'll look at the original article. The article is an extract from Xi's speech at the special seminar for leading provincial and ministerial-level cadres on studying and implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on October 29, 2024. In the first part of the article, Xi talks about the achievements of reform since the 18th Party Congress. He says that -comprehensively deepening reform in the new era has achieved major practical, institutional and theoretical results, which have attracted worldwide attention and have far-reaching influence.- 、、，，. In terms of practical results, Xi says that: -The new development concept was formed through reforms, the ideological concepts and institutional mechanisms that influence and constrain high-quality development were eliminated through reforms, and the effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth of economic development were gradually achieved through reforms. It is through the comprehensive deepening of reform that China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength have leaped to a new level…- ，，。，、、... In terms of institutional results, Xi says that: -China's fundamental systems, basic systems, and important systems have become more complete. In particular, the Party's leadership system has been established as the country's fundamental leadership system. A systematic, well-structured, scientifically regulated, and effectively functioning institutional framework is gradually maturing and taking shape. We have strengthened the implementation of systems, focusing on transforming institutional advantages into the efficiency of national governance. These efforts are not only aimed at addressing immediate needs but also at ensuring the long-term stability and security of the nation.- 、、，、、，，、、。，。，. Finally, in terms of theoretical results, Xi says that the current phase of reform, i.e., comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era, has been conceived and advanced against the backdrop of China's reform entering a critical stage and deep waters, characterized by its broad scope, deep impact on interests, high difficulty in implementation, and strong interconnectivity and synergy. We have continuously promoted theoretical innovation in reform, scientifically grasped the timing and situation, risks and opportunities that reform faces, summarised fresh experiences in a timely manner, continuously deepened our understanding of reform patterns, and formed a series of new ideas, new perspectives, and new assertions about comprehensively deepening reform. For example, it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the leadership of the Party; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the people-centered approach; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while making innovations, neither returning to a closed and rigid old path nor deviating to the evil path of changing flags and banners; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the overall goal of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to problem orientation; it is emphasized that it must adhere to the reform of the economic system as the driving force; it is emphasized that reform must be promoted on the track of the rule of law; it is emphasized that top-level design must be combined with crossing the river by feeling the stones; it is emphasized that the relationship between reform, development and stability must be properly handled, among other things. The ‘Six Adherences' outlined in the Decision of the Third Plenum are distilled from these new ideas, perspectives, and assertions. These theoretical achievements provide important guidelines for further advancing comprehensive deepening of reform. 。，、、、。，、，，，、、。，；；，，；、；；；；；，。《》--，、、。，. The second section of the article discusses the importance of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. This is important: Reform is not about changing flags and banners. I have said many times that our reform has direction and principles. Upholding the Party's comprehensive leadership, upholding Marxism, upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, upholding the people's democratic dictatorship, taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and enhancement of people's wellbeing as the starting point and ultimate goal—these are all fundamental, directional, and long-term matters that reflect the Party's nature and purpose, conform to China's national conditions, and align with the fundamental interests of the people. These principles must remain unwavering, regardless of circumstances. Therefore, we must uphold the overall reform goal of continuing to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, always moving forward in the direction guided by the overall goal, resolutely reforming what should be reformed and not reforming what should not be reformed. 。，、。、、、，、，、、，，，，。，、，，，。 The central task of the Party and the country in the new era and on the new journey is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Further comprehensive deepening reform must be carried out closely around this central task. We must move forward with unwavering boldness and courage, align with the new trends of the times, meet the new requirements of practice, and respond to the new expectations of the people. We must vigorously promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation, and innovation in all other areas, providing strong momentum and institutional guarantees for Chinese-style modernization. 、，。，、、，、、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily We must focus on economic system reform as the key point. Adhering to the reform direction of the socialist market economy, efforts should be made to fully leverage the decisive role of the market in resource allocation while better exerting the role of the government, accelerate the establishment of a unified national market and improve the macroeconomic governance system; adhere to and implement the ‘two unwaverings', and provide a fair and just legal environment for the development of various types of ownership economies; resolutely eliminate the institutional and mechanism obstacles that hinder and restrict high-quality development, improve production relations that are more compatible with new quality productive forces, and shape new development momentum and advantages; resolutely break through bottlenecks and blockages affecting and restricting comprehensive innovation, coordinate and promote the integrated reform of education, science, technology and talent systems and mechanisms, firmly grasp the strategic initiative in the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation. 。，、，，；--，；，，；，，. The section ends with an emphasis on the requirement of coordinated reforms in other domains too, such as -democracy, rule of law, culture, society, ecological civilisation, national security, national defense and military construction, as well as the reform of the party building system.- Subscribe now In the third section, Xi argues that reform is a -systematic project- that requires scientific methods and proper handling of various relationships. First, uphold the unity of reform and the rule of law. Reform and rule of law are like two wings of a bird or two wheels of a car; they are interdependent and indispensable. It is necessary to use the power of reform to improve the rule of law, further deepen reforms in the field of the rule of law, and continuously refine the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the role of the rule of law should be expanded to better leverage its positive role in eliminating resistance to reform and consolidating reform achievements. We must be good at using the rule of law thinking and the rule of law approach to promote reform, safeguard the authority of the rule of law, and ensure that major reforms are based on the law. We must uphold the principle of equal treatment before the law, and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations. We must not engage in selective law enforcement, let alone extrajudicial leniency. 。、，、。，，。，、。，，。，、，，. Second, adhere to the dialectical unity of breaking and establishing. Reform is a process of breaking down the old and establishing the new - breaking down is the means, establishing is the purpose. Further comprehensively deepening reform must uphold system building as the main thread, and should emphasize the simultaneous process of breaking down and establishing, by establishing first before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, deeply conduct risk assessments, and grasp the timing, degree, and effectiveness well. What should be established should be actively and proactively established, and must be established stably and firmly. It should be feasible and truly effective. What should be broken should be broken in a timely manner, resolutely, and thoroughly on the foundation of establishment, achieving steady and swift reform progress in the unity of breaking down and establishing. We must not break before establishing, resulting in institutional vacuums that leave people at a loss, causing disorder and chaos. 。，，。，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，。，，，. Third, uphold the unity of reform and opening up. Further deepening reform and high-level opening up complement and promote each other. The deeper the reform, the higher the level of opening up required; the higher the level of opening up, the greater the role of promoting reform. We must steadily expand institutional opening up, actively connect with international high-standard economic and trade rules, deepen the reform of foreign trade, foreign investment and outbound investment management systems, and create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. We must implement the free trade pilot zone promotion strategy, encourage innovative and integrated exploration, and create a new highland of reform and opening up with a higher level of opening up and a stronger radiation effect. 。、。，；，。，，、，、、。，、，、. Fourth, we must properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation. ‘One part deployment, nine parts implementation'. The deployments made in the Plenum's ‘Decision' are mainly considered from broad perspectives, many measures are strategic, forward-looking, and directional, and implementation requires formulating practical and feasible specific measures. In designing reform plans, we must grasp objective laws, fully promote democracy, conform to social expectations, pay attention to the coordination and matching of various reform measures, enhance the consistency of reform orientation, and prevent and overcome departmentalism. We must establish and improve a work mechanism with clear responsibilities, complete chains, and interlocking links, strengthen tracking and performance evaluation, promote the implementation of reform measures in detail, prevent the phenomenon of focusing on document formulation and neglecting supervision and implementation, and prevent ‘the water on the beach never reaches the end'. . 。-，-。《》，、、，。，，，，，，。、、，，，、，--。 This section ends with Xi issuing a stern warning: Leaders, especially senior cadres, bear important responsibilities for promoting reform. We must enhance our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge, face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn diseases without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreating, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development. We must be good at using scientific methods to promote reform, make systematic arrangements, and act after careful planning to avoid blind actions and confusion. 。、，、，，，，。，、，、. In the final section, Xi calls to: correctly understand and interpret the spirit of the ‘Decision' of the Plenary Session. reasonably guide reform expectations, i.e., -reform is a process of adjusting the interests structure, and it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy the interests of everyone. We must guide both officials and the public to strengthen their awareness of the overall situation and correctly handle the adjustment of interest relationships and individual gains and losses during the reform. Reform is also a gradual process; it cannot be accomplished overnight, nor can all problems be solved at once. We must avoid being hasty, setting unrealistically high goals, or raising expectations excessively. Instead, we must be practical, base everything on reality, move forward steadily, and accumulate small successes to achieve greater victories. We must also recognize that reform is the people's own cause, requiring the participation of all people, united in tackling difficulties and overcoming challenges. During the reform process, we must adhere to a people-centered approach, using actual results and the satisfaction of the people to assess the effectiveness of reforms. This will ensure that the people's sense of gain, happiness, and security continuously increases through the reform.- 。，，。、，。，、，、，、，，，，。，，，。，，，、、. promote positive propaganda around reform, and -continue to pay attention to and respond to social concerns, and promptly resolve doubts and confusion.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the front page about Li Qiang meeting with the visiting Japanese political delegation led by Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama of the Liberal Democratic Party and Secretary-General Makoto Nishida of the Komeito Party. Xinhua says: Li said that -the resumption of the ruling party exchange mechanism after nearly seven years is an important move in implementing the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. It is hoped that China and Japan will continue working together to enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, manage differences, and promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations that will bring more benefits to the two peoples, Li said. He noted that ruling parties of the two countries should focus on safeguarding the long-term fundamental interests of the two countries and adopt a responsible attitude towards the people and history. More efforts should be made to promote cooperation and common development, explore more new growth points of economic cooperation in such areas as sci-tech innovation, digital economy and green development, step up people-to-people and sub-national exchanges, and cement a social foundation for bilateral relations.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on the meeting of United Front leaders, where Wang Huning delivered a speech. Wang said that: -We should take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of Two Establishments, resolutely implement ‘Two Safeguards', comprehensively implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, improve the overall pattern of United Front work, consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic United Front, give play to the political role of the United Front in rallying people's hearts and minds and gathering strength, and contribute to further deepening reform and promoting Chinese-style modernization.- ，，--、--，、，，，、，、. Wang Huning stated that General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thought on doing well in the Party's United Front work in the new era is the latest achievement in adhering to the ‘two integrations' and advancing the sinicisation and modernisation of Marxist United Front theory, demonstrating strong theoretical creativity and truth power, strong historical penetration and insight into the times, as well as strong political leadership and practical driving force. We must study it deeply, comprehend it thoroughly, and grasp it accurately, in order to promote the high-quality development of United Front work in the new era. ，--、，、、。、、，。 Wang called on United Front officials to -do a solid job in uniting hearts, building consensus, pooling wisdom, and gathering strength- to promote Chinese-style modernisation. We must adhere to, develop, and improve China's new-type political party system, and enhance the political positioning and work efficiency in serving the central tasks of the Party and the country. We must focus on strengthening the consciousness of the Chinese national community, and actively promote the construction of the Chinese national community. We must systematically advance the sinicisation of religion in China, strengthen the rule of law in religious affairs governance, and maintain harmony and stability in the religious sector. We need to strengthen the ideological and political guidance of non-Party intellectuals and individuals from new social strata, encouraging them to make contributions to the construction of Chinese-style modernisation. We must promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of non-public economy individuals, guiding private enterprises and private businesspeople to build confidence, overcome challenges, and drive development. We must strengthen the unity of Chinese people at home and abroad, and leverage the United Front work in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas to win the hearts of the people. We must enhance the Party's overall leadership over United Front work, ensuring that the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee are fully implemented and effectively executed. 。，2025--，，、、、。，。，。、，。，。，、、。，。，.

Xinhua reports that the regulations are -aimed at improving the quality of publicly-listed companies, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors, and promoting the healthy and stable development of the capital market. Effective from Feb. 15, these regulations stipulate that intermediary agencies must not aid companies in committing financial fraud, issuing deceptive offerings or breaching information disclosure rules. Relevant regulators in the securities, finance and judiciary fields should work together closely to strengthen oversight of intermediary institutions' practices in accordance with the law and their obligations, as per the regulations.

Zhejiang eyes ‘around 5.5%' expansion and Fujian aims for 5% to 5.5%. The wealthy provinces' goals suggest China will seek to maintain its growth pace after the economy grew about 5% last year. In 2024, the targets of six out of the eight richest provinces were the same or lower than the national level.- The two charts below are rather telling: This Global Times report also has some details about the plans from Shanghai, Guangdong and Beijing. Second, Secretary-designate Marco Rubio's testimony during his Senate confirmation hearing was interesting. He identified China as the -biggest threat- to American prosperity in the 21st Century. He said: -If we don't change course, we are going to live in the world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis from our security to our health will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not.- AP's report adds: -Rubio blamed America's vulnerability to China on the shift to globalism, which he says ‘is now a weapon being used against us'. He said the U.S. must begin placing ‘our core national interests above all else'.- Meanwhile, the outgoing Biden administration has intensified its tech restrictions.

FT reported: -The top tier, which includes G7 members in addition to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Ireland, will face no restrictions. The third tier includes nations such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea to which US groups can, in effect, not export. The middle tier of more than 100 countries will face caps and licences for export volumes over those limits.- A more detailed assessment of the Regulatory Framework for the Responsible Diffusion of Advanced Artificial Intelligence Technology is available on CFR's website. Yesterday, the US Department of Commerce announced it would implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data science. The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech equipment's technology to bolster its military capabilities and help design new weapons using artificial intelligence. VOA reports: -The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to countries without a U.S. license, such as China. The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can ‘generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and biological design tools'.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Reaches Out to EU's Costa - China & Japan Resume Ruling Parties Dialogue after 6 Years - Tibet Quake Response vs California Wildfires Bickering - 2...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 15, 2025. Page 1: There's a report on Xi Jinping's phone call with European Council President Antonio Costa. Xinhua reports: Xi extended his congratulations once again to Costa on assuming the presidency of the European Council, noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations, an important milestone that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The history of China-EU relations demonstrates that as long as both sides uphold mutual respect, treat each other as equals, and engage in candid dialogue, they can advance cooperation and make significant achievements, Xi said. Xi said that like-mindedness makes for partnership, and seeking common ground while respecting differences also defines partnership. The key lies in respecting each other's choice of social systems and development paths, as well as each other's core interests and major concerns, Xi said, adding that China has always regarded Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, firmly supported European integration, and backed the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy. Both sides should summarize the experiences of China-EU relations, draw important lessons, jointly safeguard the political foundation of their relations, and advance their relationship, so as to bring greater benefits to the peoples of China and Europe and contribute more stability and certainty to an increasingly turbulent international landscape.- The report adds: Xi Jinping stressed that China and Europe have no fundamental conflicts of interest or geopolitical contradictions, and are partners of mutual achievement. Over the past 50 years, China-EU relations have not only contributed to their respective development but also made significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, Xi said, adding that the more severe and complex the international situation becomes, the more China and Europe should adhere to the original aspirations of their diplomatic ties. Calling on both sides to strengthen strategic communication, enhance strategic mutual trust, and uphold their partnership, Xi said that China remains confident in the EU and hopes the EU will also prove to be a trustworthy cooperation partner for China.- (Note: This is quite a remarkable and rather condescending comment.) -The economic and trade cooperation between China and the EU is mutually complementary and beneficial, with both sides serving as defenders of the multilateral trading system, Xi said, adding that the two sides have already formed a strong economic symbiotic relationship. Noting that China remains committed to high-quality development and high-level opening up, Xi said that it will bring new opportunities for China-EU cooperation. The two sides should expand mutual openness, consolidate existing cooperation mechanisms, and foster new growth points in their cooperation, Xi said. Both sides should also ensure the success of activities celebrating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, enhance cultural exchanges and people-to-people interactions, encourage mutual visits between their people, and support local exchanges and educational cooperation, so as to strengthen the foundation of public goodwill in China-EU relations, Xi added.- As per Xinhua, Costa said: -The EU is ready to properly address economic and trade differences with China through dialogue and consultation, Costa said.

The effort created 3.147 million jobs. Finally, there's a long feature talking about the earthquake rescue and relief work that has been carried out in Tibet. It says that -at present, the earthquake relief work is at a critical stage. All parties are working tirelessly to win the tough battle…- The piece offers an official relay of events in terms of the state's response. So -after the earthquake, General Secretary Xi Jinping attached great importance to it and issued important instructions … In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping's instructions and the request of Premier Li Qiang, Politburo member and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led relevant department officials on January 7 to the earthquake-stricken area in Shigatse, Tibet, to guide emergency rescue and response efforts on site. The safety and well-being of the affected people has always been close to the General Secretary's heart. On January 9, Xi Jinping presided over a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee to discuss and plan the earthquake relief efforts in Dingri, Tibet. The meeting emphasised the need to handle the work with even greater precision and to resolutely win the tough battle of earthquake relief.- ，，-，--，--，-。，、7。，。9，，。，，. The next bit in this section of the article essentially and rather emphatically talks about the Party's flag flying high at the forefront of the earthquake relief effort. There's no useful information, just charged rhetoric. For instance, -‘Be together with the masses', this is the solemn promise of Communist Party members when faced with a disaster-. --，. The next section is even more dramatic, with rescuers, with blistered hands, pulling people out of the rubble; doctors and volunteers working long hours with bloodshot eyes, etc. It also informs that -less than two days after the earthquake, a total of more than 12,000 rescue forces from various parties rushed to the scene and rescued 407 trapped people.- Another relevant data point is that as of 18:00 on January 12, a total of 2,198 prefabricated houses had been built to relocate people…166,200 blankets, 40,737 stoves for heating, and 118,000 sets of clothing had been provided. So whom should we thank for all this? -‘The smooth progress of earthquake relief work fully demonstrates the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, fully displays the magnificent scene of Chinese nation's unity as one family, watching out for and helping each other, and fully reflects the remarkable superiority of the socialist system and the incomparable warmth of the motherland's big family', said Wang Junzheng, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee.- -，，、，。-. The next section has some details on response times and processes. Note: This is really important not just in itself — i.e., to understand the approach and mobilisation during a disaster — but also from a propaganda point of view. One cannot help juxtaposing this narrative from China with the political bickering that has taken place in the US in the past few months around natural disasters, be it with the storms before the election or the fires in California. Now, that said, this article does not mention the US or draw that comparison directly. But Chinese media has prominently covered the political back and forth in the US over the LA fires. For instance, this Xinhua report says that while wildfires rage, American politicians are busy spitting at each other/exchanging verbal attacks ( ). Ta Kung Pao's coverage talks about officials shirking responsibility. Also checkout this VOA report discussing Chinese media and social media comments on the California wildfires. It discusses the different approaches of Chinese media when covering the two natural disasters in California and Tibet. Anyway, the PD article says that: -On the morning of the 7th, just after 9 a.m., an earthquake alarm sounded at the National Emergency Command Center, and within 30 seconds, the internal response mechanism was activated… The heads of the Ministry of Emergency Management and other departments remotely connected with the local emergency command and rescue teams in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The emergency mechanism was launched immediately. The State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters set up a working group to strengthen overall coordination, bringing together various departments to fully carry out disaster relief efforts. The coordinated ‘game of chess' approach was clear, highlighting the advantages of the emergency management system with Chinese characteristics… Within 10 minutes of the earthquake, rescue aircraft had already flown over the disaster area; in less than 30 minutes, rescue teams began breaking through debris at the epicenter, the olive green, fire rescue orange, and emergency blue—various units entered the disaster-stricken area in an orderly manner and began their work. The effectiveness of China's emergency rescue system was immediately evident. Within a single day, local communication, networks, roads, and power supplies were gradually restored, and the affected residents were housed in emergency tents, enjoying hot meals three times a day… Emergency disaster relief supplies from the central government were immediately dispatched!On the evening of the 7th, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Emergency Management allocated 100 million yuan of central natural disaster relief funds, and the first batch of central disaster relief materials arrived in the disaster area… Whatever Tibet lacked, the central government allocated. On the evening of the 11th, the Tibet Autonomous Region requested the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters for an additional 2,000 prefabricated shelters. By the morning of the 12th, the emergency management departments of Sichuan and Gansu provinces had begun organizing shipments… As of now, the Ministry of Natural Resources has completed 3,841 emergency inspections of geological hazard risks; the National Energy Administration has completed emergency power connections for 278 resettlement sites; and the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine continue to develop treatment plans for the injured on a ‘one person, one policy' basis. ‘Earthquake relief measures the leadership capacity of the ruling party, tests the government's execution ability, evaluates national mobilization capacity, and demonstrates national cohesion. The superiority of our socialist system is most evident in handling urgent, difficult, and critical challenges,' said Ma Liang, a professor at Peking University's School of Government.- 7，9，，，。-？--，，，。-。。，，，。--，。——。10，；，，、、……，。。，、、、，，。——。！7，、1，……，。11，2000；12，、。——。-，200，。-10，，，。，3841；278；、--……-，、、、。，。-.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two pieces to note on the page. First, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary on China-US ties. It argues that this year's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show showed how China-US cooperation is in mutual interest. It informs that at this year's show more than 1,300 Chinese companies participated, accounting for about 27% of all exhibitors. -Under the current circumstances, the common interests between China and the United States have not decreased but have instead increased. This is a shared perception among the vast majority of businesses and people in both countries and serves as an important foundation for both sides to move towards each other and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. Looking back at 2024, China hosted over 3,800 economic and trade exhibitions. Whether it was U.S. companies having the largest exhibition area at the Import Expo, or U.S. companies ranking first among overseas exhibitors at the Supply Chain Expo, or the frequent visits to China by many US business executives, the business communities of China and the US have been creating opportunities and achieving mutual success through their exchanges. The cooperation between enterprises from both sides shows that as long as we adhere to mutual respect, mutual benefit, equal consultation, follow economic laws and market rules, and expand and deepen mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, China and the US can absolutely achieve win-win results. ，，，，、。2024，3800，，，，、。，、、，，，. It adds: -no matter from which angle we look at Sino-US relations, we can find that China and the United States have extensive common interests, and mutual benefit and win-win are the essential characteristics of Sino-US relations. This is sufficient to enlighten both sides that they should be partners, not opponents; should achieve success together, not harm each other; should seek common ground while reserving differences, rather than engage in malicious competition. China has proposed that both sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation to find a correct way for China-U.S. relations in the new era. This is both a profound summary of past experience and an important guide toward the future.- 46，，，，，。，；，；，。、、，，，. The next paragraph says: -Ancient Chinese said, ‘trade is a path of mutual benevolence and a path of mutual benefit.' There is an inscription at the entrance of the US Department of Commerce Library: ‘Promoting peace and commerce with all people.' Mutual benefit is a principle that holds true both in ancient times and today, and is the consensus of the business communities of China and the US. In 2024, Tesla's sales in China exceeded 657,000 vehicles, an 8.8% year-on-year increase, setting a record high. In the fourth quarter, Starbucks added a net of 290 new stores in mainland China, entering 78 new county-level markets. By the end of 2024, the number of US companies established in China reached 73,000, with a total investment exceeding $1.2 trillion, covering fields such as electronics and communications, automobile manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services. Countless cases show that US companies investing and doing business in China not only make profits but also benefit the people of both countries. China is committed to advancing Chinese-style modernisation, while the US is working to revitalise its economy, creating boundless space for cooperation between both sides. By focusing on common interests, the list of China-US cooperation can be made longer, and the cake of cooperation can be made bigger.- ，-，，-。--。，，。2024，65.7，8.8%，；290，78……2024，7.3，1.2，、、、。，，，。，，。，，. The interests of China and the US are deeply intertwined, and it is normal for contradictions and differences to arise, but this should not become an obstacle to the two countries' cooperation. Facing the new situation and changes in Sino-US economic and trade relations in recent years, both sides should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and adopt constructive ways to enhance understanding and expand consensus. Starting tariff wars, trade wars, and technology wars for various reasons goes against historical trends and economic laws, and there will be no winners. Artificially setting limits or engaging in protectionism will only interfere with normal trade exchanges and the stability of global industrial and supply chains, which does not serve the interests of any party. Gary Shapiro, CEO of the US Consumer Technology Association, organizer of the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, said that raising tariffs will threaten the growth of the US technology industry. The report published by the association predicts that if the new US government implements its proposed high tariff policy, the purchasing power of US consumers for consumer technology industry products and services will decrease by $90 billion to $143 billion in 2025. Maurice Obstfeld, former Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund, also recently stated that attempting to use tariffs to enhance US influence in the global economy could backfire and harm the US economy. ，，。，、，、。、、，，。，，。、·，。，，20259001430。·，，.

Page 9: There's an article by Dong Zhiyong who is a Vice President at Peking University and a member of the Standing Committee of the PKU Party Committee. Dong writes about China's approach of AI+ development. I don't usually cover such pieces, but I thought this was a good read for an overview of the policy direction with regard to AI. Dong writes: In recent times, driven by policy guidance, technological breakthroughs and industrial applications, China has made remarkable achievements in the development of AI. AI technology development in China has achieved continuous breakthroughs, especially in the fields of speech recognition, image processing, intelligent manufacturing, and autonomous driving. In these domains, China is at the international leading level. At the same time, with the continuous maturity of technology and the continuous expansion of application scenarios, AI development in China is steadily advancing toward deep integration and innovation-driven development, contributing Chinese wisdom to the development of the global intelligent economy. ，、，。，、、、。，，，. He added that -in recent years, China has accelerated the construction of new information infrastructure and laid a solid foundation for the development of AI. As of November 2024, China has built a total of 4.191 million 5G base stations; there are around 1.002 billion 5G mobile phone users. It has also built the world's largest 5G network, accumulating rich technology, data, industry, scenarios and market foundations for the development of AI. For example, some e-commerce platforms and social platforms have relied on new information infrastructure and massive user data to deeply integrate big data analysis, AI algorithms, cloud computing and other technologies to promote the intelligent upgrading of industries and form a virtuous circle. From ‘Internet+' and digitalisation to ‘AI+', this is not only a leap in the ‘technology-economy' paradigm but also a profound transformation in development models, capable of fostering new economic growth points and injecting new momentum into high-quality economic development.- 。，。，，。202411，5G419.1，5G10.02，5G，、、、。，、，、、，，。-+-、-+-，-—-，，，. The continuously optimised policy environment provides support for AI development. China places great emphasis on AI development, evidenced by initiatives like the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of the New Generation AI Industry (2018–2020), and the ‘AI+' Action. These efforts have strengthened the top-level design for AI development. At the same time, local governments are encouraged to integrate their unique characteristics into exploratory practices, creating AI development hubs. For example, Beijing released its ‘AI+' Action Plan, focusing on creating benchmark applications in robotics, education, healthcare, culture, transportation, and other fields. Shenzhen introduced measures to build itself into a pioneer AI city, emphasizing advanced manufacturing, modern services, and scientific research to enable AI to empower a wide range of industries. Shanghai advanced its ‘AI+' initiative in government services, creating a convenient and efficient ‘Smart Easy Service' brand for public administration. Other regions have successively launched special action plans to promote the deep integration of AI with local economies, accelerate the creation of AI ecosystems with regional characteristics, and establish development patterns with demonstrative effects. 。，《》《（2018—2020）》-+-，。，，。，-+-，、、、、；，、，；-+-，--；。，，，. Rich application scenarios have expanded the space for the development of AI. In terms of technology research and development, innovative applications of AI technology have not only driven the optimisation of algorithms but also facilitated breakthroughs in intelligent chips and hardware. According to statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization, from 2014 to 2023, China filed more than 38,000 patents for generative AI, ranking first globally. At present, China has initially established a relatively comprehensive AI industrial system, with an industry chain covering key upstream and downstream segments such as chips, algorithms, data, platforms, and applications. Several large AI models independently developed by China have been widely applied in areas such as transportation, online shopping, learning, and office work. From an industry perspective, AI technology has been widely used in fields such as intelligent manufacturing, smart cities, and autonomous driving, promoting the growth and strengthening of emerging industries. It has also facilitated the intelligent upgrading and digital transformation of traditional industries. According to the 2023–2024 China Intelligent Manufacturing Development Annual Report, in 2023, the scale of industries related to smart manufacturing in China grew by 14.9% year-on-year, reaching 2.88416 trillion yuan, with high growth expected to continue over the next three years. From a regional perspective, China has formed several internationally competitive AI industry clusters centered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. These clusters have provided strong momentum for the development of the AI industry while promoting coordinated regional economic development. The abundance of application scenarios has explored new models and paths for AI development. 。，，。，2014—2023，3.8，。，，、、、、。，、、。，、、，，、。《2023—2024》，202314.9%，28841.6，3。，、、，，。，.

Only by coordinating development and security and giving equal importance to both can we ensure that the ship of China rides winds and waves and moves steadily toward the future. AI opens up new development space for new quality productive forces. Empowering the development of new quality productive forces with ‘AI+' is of great significance for achieving high-quality development and high-level security.- ，，。，，、。。-+-，. Inject momentum into economic transformation and upgrading. At present, China's economy is at a critical juncture of high-quality development, and the task of achieving the transformation of development drivers, mode change, and structural adjustment is arduous. AI promotes comprehensive changes in production methods, business models, and consumption patterns through in-depth analysis and processing of various types of data, providing strong impetus for economic transformation and upgrading. In traditional industries, using AI to promote intelligent transformation and digital transformation can improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and develop towards high-end, intelligent, and green development. For example, some intelligent garment factories have achieved seamless integration of integrated production processes from cutting, sewing, ironing to warehousing matching by introducing auxiliary design large models, greatly increasing the proportion of customized clothing in total production. In the field of emerging industries, AI has created a large number of business opportunities and development space, giving birth to new industries and new models such as autonomous driving and smart medical care, and creating new economic growth points. 。，，、、。，、、，。，，、，、、。，，、、，。，，、，. Providing support for economic security. As the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, ensuring economic security is crucial for continuously enhancing China's economic competitiveness, innovation capacity, and resilience to risks. The application of AI can, on the basis of promoting industrial structure optimization and upgrading, increase the overall added value of industries, enhance the diversity of industrial entities, reduce dependence on single markets or resources, improve the ability to cope with uncertainty, and thereby enhance the resilience and security level of industrial and supply chains. As AI integrates more deeply with the real economy, data security has become a global and systemic issue. The application of AI helps build a secure and controllable technological framework, enhances real-time responses to cybersecurity threats through automated monitoring systems, prevents risks such as data leaks and hacker attacks, and ensures information security across various fields. 。，、、。，，，，，，。，、。，，，、，. Lay a solid foundation for improving the inclusiveness of development. As an important force for empowering new quality productive forces, AI improves the inclusiveness of development by improving resource allocation and service efficiency. For example, in the field of rural revitalization, AI provides more accurate demand forecasting and resource allocation plans for poverty-stricken areas through big data analysis and intelligent algorithms, which helps to increase farmers' income and improve local production and living conditions. In the field of education, AI has improved the popularity and fairness of educational resources through personalized teaching and intelligent tutoring. In terms of public services, the application of AI in data governance, intelligent decision-making and other fields can improve the efficiency and accuracy of social governance and help promote the modernization of national governance. 。，，。，，，，，。，、，。，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, he writes: At present, China's AI development has entered a new stage. It is necessary to be cognisant that there is still a gap between the overall development level of AI in China and that of developed countries. To implement the task of ‘launching the -AI+- action and cultivating future industries' proposed by the Central Economic Work Conference, we must…firmly grasp the major historical opportunities for the development of AI, and accelerate the innovative development of AI. ，。，。-‘+'，-，、、，，。 The tasks, therefore, are to: Build a healthy and complete industrial ecology: -It is necessary to establish a market-oriented innovation system that promotes deep cooperation and collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including technology researchers, investors, and market participants, forming a digital innovation ecosystem with integrated development of industry, academia, research, and application. Build an industrial ecology with technology research and development, scenario application, and industrial upgrading as the core, and create an interconnected and resource-sharing ecosystem. Based on the resource endowments and industrial foundations of each region, differentiated industrial cluster development strategies should be formulated to promote the distinctive development of local industrial clusters. Give full play to the leading role of leading enterprises in the cluster, drive innovation and resource integration of upstream and downstream enterprises, enhance the overall competitiveness of the cluster, encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to integrate into the AI industry cluster, and form competitive advantages in their respective segments through collaborative innovation A regional coordination development mechanism should be established to promote cross-regional exchange and dissemination of AI technologies, gradually expanding the application scenarios and coverage of ‘AI+'. 。，。，、、，。、，、。，，。，，，，。，，-+-. Build an effective data factor market: Building an efficient, open and innovative data factor market is an important guarantee for the development of AI. It is necessary to explore the establishment of a data property rights system, promote the structural division and orderly circulation of data property rights, and coordinate the construction of standardized and efficient data trading platforms. As an important part of social resources, public data plays an irreplaceable role in promoting the application and innovation of AI. To this end, we should promote the implementation of the public data rights confirmation and authorization mechanism, further increase the intensity of data openness, and promote the expansion of the supply and use scope of public data that does not carry personal information and does not affect public safety according to its purposes. Respect the labor and other factors of data processors such as data collection and processing, and fully guarantee the rights of data processors to use data and obtain benefits. 。、。、，。，，。，。，，，，。、，. Build a multi-level talent training system. -It is necessary to strengthen the reform of basic education and higher education in AI, strengthen the popularization of basic knowledge of AI in primary and secondary schools, strengthen vocational training, focus on improving the digital literacy of workers, and adjust and optimize the curriculum in colleges and universities according to the needs of the development of the AI industry. Optimize talent introduction policies, improve talent incentive mechanisms, and attract and retain top global talents. Pay attention to the career development and subsequent security of talent, ensuring that more high-end talent can be introduced and retained, strengthening their sense of belonging and creativity. Actively promote cooperation and exchanges between domestic institutions and international organizations or overseas universities, utilizing global intellectual resources to advance China's AI innovation and development. 。，。，，，，。，，。，、，。、，。 Optimize AI regulatory policies: It is necessary to promote the standardized development of AI and optimize regulatory policies. Improve the legal framework in terms of data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and technical ethics, clarify the red lines for technology development and application and the boundaries of responsibility of each subject, and ensure the safety and fairness of technology.Establish a multi-party communication mechanism, establish a cross-departmental and cross-field regulatory coordination mechanism, and form a joint force in technology research and development, data use, and ethical assessment.Strengthen international cooperation, promote global coordination of rules and unified technical standards, accelerate the construction of an inclusive and prudent governance mechanism, encourage all sectors to actively participate in the ethical and safety supervision of AI, and ensure that the development of AI technology is in line with human welfare.。。，，。、、，，。，、，、、。，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasised that ‘maintaining a high degree of alignment with the Party Central Committee must be carried out in words and deeds'. This is not only an intrinsic requirement for ensuring the Party's unity and cohesion but also an urgent necessity for overcoming challenges and seizing the initiative. In the new era and on the new journey, we must unremittingly use Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite our hearts and forge our souls, promote political supervision to focus on specific issues, pursue precise results, and implement it as regular practice, ensuring that the whole Party maintains a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in terms of thought, politics, and actions and ensuring that all decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee are effectively implemented, and work together to promote reform and promote high-quality development. ，，。：-。-，、。，，、、，、、，，、. The commentary then calls for strict self-discipline. It says that -strengthening the Party's discipline is an ongoing task. Only by establishing a normalised and long-term discipline education mechanism, strictly enforcing the Party's discipline, and accurately applying the ‘four forms' can we guide Party members and cadres to transform external restraint into self-discipline, internalizing it as a subconscious standard for daily words and actions. The Party's discipline and the pursuit of reform and innovation are inherently unified. The Party's discipline not only serves as a tool for education and constraint but also provides protection and encouragement. It is both an ‘incantation for control' and a ‘protective talisman'. Efforts must unify strict management and supervision with encouragement for taking responsibility, enabling cadres to pursue reform and innovation while adhering to rules and discipline.- ，，，，--，、，。，，，--，--。，、。 The next bit calls for a focus on top leaders and for all institutions to fulfill their responsibilities.

Share Tracking People's Daily Another report (English report) on the page informs that Prime Minister of Grenada Dickon Mitchell will pay an official visit to China from January 11 to 17. One other report to note, although it's not in the paper today. China's Ministry of Commerce has said that the EU's practices in its foreign subsidy investigations against Chinese enterprises have constituted trade and investment barriers. The announcement followed the conclusion of a six-month probe, which was initiated at the request of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products. Xinhua reports: -Under its foreign subsidies regulation, the EU has conducted preliminary, in-depth and raid investigations into Chinese companies in sectors such as locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security check equipment, said the ministry when initiating the probe into trade and investment barriers last July. The EU's investigations involved unreasonable practices that violated the World Trade Organization's core principles, including non-discrimination, the ministry said, citing stakeholders who participated in the probe. The stakeholders believe that the EU's investigations consisted of inappropriate penalties and unreasonable time constraints, and lacked procedural transparency and legitimacy, according to the ministry. The probe found that during the investigations, regulations were ‘selectively enforced' and the criteria used to determine foreign subsidies were vague. It also noted that the scope of the EU's investigations was overly broad, placing an ‘immense burden' on the companies, and that key concepts, such as market distortion, were defined in a ‘subjective and arbitrary' manner. Such investigations have harmed trade and investment between China and the EU by restricting Chinese companies' products, services and investments from entering the EU market, thereby damaging the competitiveness of relevant Chinese companies and products, the ministry said. The probe results revealed that Chinese enterprises have incurred significant economic losses, both directly and indirectly, due to the EU's investigations, including approximately 7.6 billion yuan (about 1.06 billion U.S. dollars) in abandoned bidding projects, with other affected projects valued at over 8 billion yuan.- It adds: -The ministry will take measures, including bilateral consultations, to urge the European side to adjust or change relevant practices in order to ensure an open, fair, just, non-discriminatory and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and operate in Europe.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

CCDI Plenary Communiqué Outlines Tougher Action Plans in Anti-Corruption Struggle - Boosting Support for 'Two New' Policies in 2025	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 9, 2025. Page 1: Let's begin with the full communique after the CCDI plenary session. 131 CCDI members and 247 observers attended the plenary session. The first substantive paragraph outlines what was done during the plenary. It begins by saying that the -session thoroughly studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.- The next bit says: The plenary session earnestly studied and deeply understood the important speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It unanimously held that the speech fully affirmed the new progress and achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance over the past year, grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle from the strategic height of realizing the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and new journey, and deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, unequivocally clarified erroneous understandings and cleared ideological fog with a clear-cut stance, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battles against corruption, made strategic plans to provide strong guarantees for advancing Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance, and placed high expectations on discipline inspection and supervision cadres. 、。，，，，，、，、、，，.

A sense of reverence must always be maintained, efforts must be intensified to strengthen the standardization, legalisation, and professionalization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and truly achieve loyalty, cleanliness and responsibility, and dare to struggle and be good at struggle. 、、、，、、，、、。，，、，、，--，，，、、，。，，、. The long paragraph below gives a recap of the work from 2024. The plenary session pointed out that in 2024, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Party adhered to leading the great social revolution through self-revolution, united and guided the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups to focus their efforts and overcome challenges and took new and solid strides in advancing Chinese-style modernisation. The CCDI, NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly supported the Two Establishments and resolutely implemented the Two Safeguards'; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the country, they continued to deepen political supervision, rectify work styles, discipline and the fight against corruption; promoted the improvement of the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party system, improved the supervision system of the Party and the country, consolidated and expanded the results of thematic education and education rectification, and ensured that the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey achieved new results. The CCDI Standing Committee made the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution, the central theme and focus throughout the year, leading the whole system to deeply study and understand the Party's innovative theories, and firmly follow the correct direction of discipline inspection and supervision work. The mechanism for making political oversight more specific, precise, and normalised were improved, with political supervision being focussed around the major decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee to ensure the effective implementation of the Party Central Committee's policies and plans. In the study and education of Party discipline, efforts are made to excel as the ‘first phalanx', thoroughly studying and comprehending General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses on comprehensively strengthening the Party's disciplinary construction. Focusing closely on the ‘Six Disciplines', each was studied item by item and discussed in depth, guiding the entire system to learn more profoundly, become familiar with and effectively apply the knowledge, and promote the entire Party to study, understand, respect, and abide by discipline. We continued to severely curb hedonism and extravagance, severely rectified formalism and bureaucratism, and ensured the implementation of the eight-point central regulation in an in-depth and practical manner through effective and long-term governance. The anti-corruption struggle was pushed forward in depth, with intensified efforts in key sectors such as finance, state-owned enterprises, energy, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, sports, infrastructure projects, and bidding processes; corruption involving collusion between officials and businesses were severely investigated and dealt with; new and hidden forms of corruption were thoroughly investigated and deal with; efforts to investigate both bribe-taking and bribe giving were strengthened, and reforms based on cases were deepened to eliminate the soil and conditions that breed corruption. Focused rectification was carried out on misconduct and corruption directly affecting the people, with extraordinary measures being taken to punish ‘fly and ant' corruption, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the people and consolidating the Party's governance foundation. Political inspections were deepened, with routine inspections conducted for 68 departments and units, the first-ever coordinated inspections in the financial sector, and higher-level inspections conducted in prefecture-level cities. Immediate investigations and corrections were carried out during inspections, further highlighting the comprehensive supervisory role of inspections. The discipline inspection and supervision system and legal framework were further improved. The CCDI cooperated with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to amend the Supervision Law, comprehensively advanced the construction of a digital discipline inspection and supervision system, and promoted the better transformation of institutional advantages into the effectiveness of rectifying misconduct and combating corruption. While affirming the achievements, the plenary session conducted a realistic analysis of existing problems in discipline inspection and supervision work and in the building of the cadre team, calling for great attention and practical solutions to address these issues. ，2024，，、，。，--、--，，、，、，，。，，。、、，，。--，，--、，、，。、，、，。，、、、、、、，，，，，。，--，，。，68，、，、，。，，，。，，、. The plenary session emphasized that comprehensively promoting the development of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization has placed new and higher requirements for the fight against corruption. The discipline inspection and supervision organs should: truly unify their thoughts and actions with the accurate judgment of the situation and the scientific deployment of tasks by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core deeply grasp the historic achievements made in the fight against corruption in the new era, and firmly believe in winning the tough battle against corruption; deeply grasp the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, which is still severe and complex, and firmly maintain the determination to win the protracted battle against corruption; deeply grasp the policy and strategy of promoting the principle of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, and firmly maintain the strong determination to win the overall battle against corruption. ，、，。、，，；，；、、，. The plenary session proposed that 2025 is the final year of implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan. To do a good job this year, it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on Party building and the Party's self-revolution, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, strengthen the four consciousnesses, enhance the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, promote the implementation of the political responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, promote the improvement of the system of comprehensive and strict Party governance, deepen the rectification of work style, discipline and anti-corruption struggle, and continuously promote the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey, thereby providing strong guarantees for promoting Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance. ，2025--。，，、，、，--，--、--、--，，，，，，. After this, the communique makes 8 points for work going forward: First, strengthen political supervision around the major arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and strive to promote further comprehensive deepening of reform and steady progress in China-style modernization. Resolutely safeguard the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over the further comprehensive deepening of reform, closely focus on the progress of achieving the overall reform goal and progress in the ‘seven focuses' and 13 goals, refine and substantiate the content of supervision, driving Party organizations at all levels to concentrate efforts on reform and focus on implementation. ，，、。，--、13，，、.

Promote the improvement of the Party and state supervision system with intra-Party supervision as the leading factor, specialized supervision as the main body, grassroots supervision as the support, and coordination of various types of supervision as the guarantee. ，，。，、，，、--。（）--，。、、、，. Seventh, strengthen the political responsibility for comprehensive and strict Party governance, striving to maintain a consistent tone of strictness from start to finish. With the ‘two responsibilities' as the guide, promote the main responsibility of the Party committee (Party group), the regulatory responsibility of functional departments, and the supervision responsibility of discipline inspection commissions (or discipline inspection teams), ensuring that all work in the same direction, thereby improving the responsibility pattern of managing and governing the Party with each entity assuming their responsibility and maintaining coordination.

Calling the Republic of the Congo a staunch friend and important partner of China, Wang praised the country's vibrant development under Sassou's leadership. China will remain the country's most reliable friend and partner during its development and revitalization journey, he said. The Republic of the Congo's role as the FOCAC's co-chair reflects Africa's confidence in the country, Wang said. As the best platform for deepening China-Africa cooperation and achieving common development, the FOCAC has been leading global cooperation with Africa, Wang said, noting that China is willing to work closely with the Republic of the Congo to comprehensively implement the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, support Africa's development and jointly pursue modernization. These efforts will also enhance the Republic of the Congo's development and elevate its global standing, he added.- The report on Wang's meeting with Jean-Claude Gakosso says that the two sides pledged to implement the outcomes of FOCAC. Wang -said that it has long been a tradition for China's foreign minister to make Africa the destination of the first overseas trip each year. The longstanding tradition, which underscores China's enduring solidarity and cooperation with Africa, is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy and a firm strategic choice. He added that regardless of changes in the international landscape, China will remain committed to deepening its relations and cooperation with Africa. Describing the Republic of the Congo as a steadfast friend of China, Wang said that the two countries have shared an unbreakable bond for more than 60 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, which is characterized by consistent mutual understanding and support through challenges… As co-chair of the FOCAC, the Republic of the Congo reflects the high-level partnership between the two nations and embodies the aspirations of the African continent, Wang said, expressing his confidence in the Republic of the Congo's active fulfillment of its responsibilities as chair, contributing to the implementation of the FOCAC Beijing Summit's outcomes and advancing China-Africa cooperation. These efforts, Wang added, will not only strengthen the Republic of the Congo's development but also enhance its international influence. Wang also reaffirmed China's commitment to working with African nations toward building an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- As per Xinhua, -Gakosso emphasized that the two nations have forged a unique and enduring bond, making their relationship a model for international relations. He attributed this success to their shared dedication to safeguarding global peace, upholding international justice, and pursuing common development…Gakosso reaffirmed the Republic of the Congo's unwavering support for the one-China principle and China's efforts to achieve national reunification, stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. He also voiced support for the Belt and Road Initiative and China's three global initiatives, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and expects to learn from China's governance experience.- Second, Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno on Wednesday. Mahamat reportedly said that -Xi is a visionary leader, steering China toward remarkable economic achievements and a pivotal role on the global stage…China's cooperation with Africa has always been based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, yielding fruitful results, he said. He also expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Africa's development, particularly Chad's progress. China is Chad's important strategic partner and a reliable friend, with their bilateral relations serving as a model of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Mahamat said. Chad firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and achieve national unity while opposing interference in its internal affairs, he stressed. China is committed to upholding global fairness and justice, playing a constructive role in addressing key international issues, the Chadian president said, noting that Chad is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to uphold shared positions and protect common interests.- Xinhua adds: -China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal, Wang said, noting that China opposes all forms of hegemony, bullying, and unilateralism. He expressed China's willingness to strengthen strategic coordination with Chad and continue to provide steadfast mutual support. China appreciates Chad's efforts in staying independent and self-reliant, and pursuing development and revitalization that suits its national conditions and is ready to work with Chad to actively implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, Wang said. China seeks to deepen exchanges on governance experience, solidify political trust through shared values, and comprehensively expand mutually beneficial cooperation to support Chad's development and revitalization and jointly build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- Page 7: There's a report informing that Guangzhou is now focussing on developing 15 strategic industrial clusters.

Tibet Quake - Elderly Care Services Guideline - Tasks to Build a Unified National Market - Guideline for Government Investment Funds - Japanese Politi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 8, 2025. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping's instructions following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Shigatse in Tibet yesterday. Xi -ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties.- Xinhua adds that he called for -utmost efforts to carry out search and rescue and provide medical treatment for the injured. He also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath effectively. It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate disaster relief supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all-. In addition, Li Qiang issued instructions. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing is leading officials in Tibet, it seems. The Office of the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched the national earthquake level 3 emergency response. Of course, the story says nothing about the impact of the earthquake or casualties. As per reports, the death toll is at around 126. If you are interested in the official details of the emergency response, there's a report that provides those. Next, there's a commentary drawing from Xi's speech at the CCDI plenary. Some key excerpts: -Over the past year, ‘tigers' have been targeted without exception, while ‘flies' and ‘ants' (minor corrupt officials) have also been punished, with more than 700,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption among the masses being investigated and dealt with. Since the new era, the Party, military, and public have experienced unprecedented cohesion and unity; one important reason is that our Party has always punished corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude. ，--，--，70。，，. And then we have a new slogan: -In his important speech, General Secretary Xi Jinping made encapsulated the Party's achievements as the ‘two historical initiatives' (): we secured the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change colour, or change flavour, and won the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation-. --：-、、，、.- The article reiterates that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains severe and complex, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption is still arduous. The key point is to -dispel the ideological fog- so that one can -further build consensus and enhance the awareness of action.- ，，。，，。，。，，、。 The next bit says that -corruption and power often go hand in hand, which makes the fight against corruption a long-term historical process. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption exist, the fight against corruption will remain ongoing … deeply analyzing the corrupt elements investigated and dealt with since the 20th Party Congress shows that the vast majority of their disciplinary violations and illegal behaviors continued from before the 18th Party Congress and till after the 20th Party Congress, indicating both new and residual corruption. With new anti-corruption technologies, tools, and methods, corrupt officials are finding it increasingly difficult to hide. Corruption undermines fairness and justice, disrupts the business environment, and disturbs economic order. Only by resolutely removing this malignant tumor can we enable cadres to work cleanly and boldly and allow various economic actors to innovate and develop with confidence. ，，。，。，，，。、、，。、、。，、，. The next paragraph discusses what Xi means when he says that combating corruption requires adopting a historical perspective. -It means learning lessons from history, grasping the core values from the Party's century-long struggle, and understanding that to remain true to its original mission, the Party must eliminate corruption—the greatest threat. From a strategic perspective, we are in the critical period of China's modernisation construction, with the domestic and international environments undergoing profound and extensive changes, only by unswervingly combating corruption and ensuring the Party health, advanced nature, and purity can we steadily and successfully follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and remain invincible amid the profound changes unseen in a century. For Party members and cadres, when faced with temptations and enticements, they must reflect on the Party's revolutionary ideals, think about the countless revolutionary ancestors who have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, the weight of the Party and people in their hearts, think about the weight of the party and the people in their hearts, think about the consequences and harm of corruption, and think about the different fates of Marxist parties around the world. Only by rectifying their ideological roots and clearing the muddied waters, they can truly stay steady, maintain their integrity, and always uphold the political character of a Communist Party member.- ：-，、，。-？，，，。，，，，、，，。，、，，、，，，。、，、，. The piece ends by calling on the Party to never slacken or ease up in what is a tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guidelines on Deepening the Reform and Development of Elderly Care Services is published in the paper. As per the document, the main goals are: by 2029, the elderly care service network will be basically established, service capabilities and levels will be significantly enhanced, significant progress will be made in expanding capacity, improving quality and increasing efficiency, and the supply of basic elderly care services will be continuously optimized; by 2035, the elderly care service network will be more complete, service supply and demand will be more coordinated and adapted, all elderly people will enjoy basic elderly care services, and an elderly care service system suitable for my country's national conditions will be mature and established. ：2029，，，，；2035，，，，. I am not detailing the full document, but Xinhua reports: -According to the guidelines, basic elderly care services consist of material assistance, nursing, and caregiving services, among others. They are provided directly by the government or by parties supported by the government. The guidelines noted that the system should follow the principles of meeting essential needs and be universally accessible. In the meantime, the system should also allow families with financial difficulties to be supported in elderly care and ensure all institutional resources regarding elderly care are optimized and integrated. The guidelines listed five key aspects where more work should be done. They include forming and implementing a list of elderly care services, establishing an active response mechanism for providing accurate services, enhancing the mechanism that ensures sound elderly care services, improving service capacity, and making such services more accessible.- China Daily's report says: -The government will pay more attention to the nursing and care work of elderly people living in countryside or rural areas, especially those at older elderly, those who lost their self-care ability or with disabilities. Supervision over elderly care service companies or nursing houses will be further tightened, to make sure these companies and nursing house operators have proper fee-charging and caring behaviors. According to the guidelines, the government will encourage foreign companies to invest in the domestic pension industries by giving them some preferential treatment. The government also encourages companies to develop and promote products for the elderly and enrich their services to the elderly, aiming for a prosperous silver economy. The government will cultivate more talent for the elderly care industry by optimizing the nursing workers' evaluation system and setting up pioneer training programs for nursing workers at designated vocational schools, according to the guidelines. Also, the nation will channel resources and investment into technological programs on elderly care services such as humanoid robots and artificial intelligence. The State-level elderly care service information platform will be optimized to better balance the market's supplies and the elderly's needs.- This bit might be useful for businesses: -Actively cultivate specialized service organizations, and encourage communities, domestic service providers, Internet platform enterprises, and others to offer diverse door-to-door services such as meal assistance, bathing assistance, cleaning assistance, mobility assistance, medical assistance, and emergency assistance for the elderly, to better meet the needs of home-based care services. Accelerate the construction of elderly-friendly housing, promote home modifications for aging, support the installation of elevators in old residential communities, and strengthen the construction of barrier-free environments.- ，、、、、、、，。，，，. -Encourage social forces to newly build or renovate and expand elderly care service facilities, support expanding high-quality institutional elderly care service supply through methods such as public construction and private operation. Fully utilize elderly care institutions' roles in technical innovation demonstration, service skills training, equipment promotion and application, promote professional services extending to homes and communities.- ，。、、，. Take the development of rural elderly care services as an important part of implementing the rural revitalization strategy, and include rural elderly care service facilities in the land space planning or village planning at the township level. ，. Guide urban elderly care service institutions to operate rural elderly care service facilities and promote the balanced development of urban and rural elderly care services. ，. Encourage state-owned enterprises and public institutions to revitalize idle assets to carry out elderly care services. For those implementing entrusted operations, the lease term shall be determined based on the principle of stable operational expectations; if the operator makes significant investments, the lease term may be appropriately extended. 、，，；，. Encourage foreign investment in the domestic elderly care service industry and grant it national treatment. Vigorously develop the silver economy, strengthen the research, development, and promotion of products for the elderly, enrich elderly care service scenarios, and unlock the consumption potential of elderly care. Develop the residential tourism elderly care market, adapt to local conditions to develop new formats such as wellness-oriented residential tourism, and promote the construction of residential tourism elderly care destinations. 。，，，。，，. Another point later worth noting, since it can be part of the common prosperity agenda: -Encourage supporting the provision of elderly care services through the establishment of charitable trusts and social donations.- 、. Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the State Council's new Guidelines on Promoting the High-quality Development of Government Investment Funds. The report says that the guidelines put forward 25 measures across 7 areas. It calls for the -operation of government investment funds in accordance with the principles of marketisation, rule of law, and specialisation, developing patient capital, and focusing on achieving practical results. Reasonably coordinate the layout of funds to prevent homogeneous competition and the crowding-out effect on social capital. Improve the responsibility mechanism with aligned rights and obligations and compatible incentives and constraints, to promote the formation of a high-quality development pattern for government investment funds with moderate scale, reasonable layout, standardised operation, scientific efficiency, and controllable risks.- 《》，，、，，、、，，。，。、，、、、、. The article then makes seven points: First, identify the correct positioning to better serve the overall development of the country. Focus on major strategies, key areas, and weak links where the market cannot fully play its role, attract and drive more social capital, support the construction of a modern industrial system, and accelerate the cultivation of new productive forces. Leverage the role of funds as long-term and patient capital for cross-cycle and counter-cyclical adjustments. Second, improve the tiered and categorized management mechanism. Specify tiered management requirements for fund establishment, refine differentiated management mechanisms for different types of funds, and standardize budget management for various government investments. Third, strengthen coordination and optimize fund allocation. Achieve synergy between national-level and local-level funds, with provincial governments enhancing the overall management of funds within their regions. Fourth, improve the level of professional and market-oriented fund operations. Standardize fund operation management, optimize fund investment methods, and fully utilize the role of fund managers. Enhance fund performance management, establish and improve an error-tolerance mechanism, and optimize a full-chain and life-cycle assessment system that avoids relying on a single project or a single year's profit and loss as the basis for assessment, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure. Optimize the fund development environment, emphasize positive incentive policies, and boost market investment confidence. Fifth, optimize the exit mechanism to promote a virtuous investment cycle. Broaden fund exit channels, encourage the development of private equity secondary market funds, mergers and acquisitions funds, etc., improve the multi-level capital market system, and explore ways to simplify the project exit process. Sixth, strengthen internal control construction to prevent and resolve risks. Improve the risk prevention and control system and enforce financial discipline. Seventh, strengthen organizational guarantees. Adhere to and strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen departmental coordination, and standardize regulatory behavior. ，。、，，，。、。。，，。，。，。。，，。，，、，，、。，，。，。，、，，。，。，。。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is an article about the NDRC issuing a guideline building a unified national market. The report covers the NDRC's press conference on the guideline. Some data from Xinhua English: -Key measures outlined in the guideline include unifying the underlying institutions and rules of the market, improving the high-standard market infrastructure connectivity, building a unified market for factors and resources, advancing the high-standard integration of goods and services markets, enhancing fair and unified regulation, and curbing unfair market competition and improper intervention.- It adds: -Liu Rihong, an official from the Research Office of the State Council, noted that the relatively weak domestic demand, especially in consumption, is a vital bottleneck for economic circulation. Liu emphasized that building a unified national market is essential to unleashing domestic demand potential, facilitating the efficient flow of goods and factors, improving resource allocation, and fully harnessing the market's industrial and demand advantages. The guideline aims to tackle these challenges by drawing firm -red lines- to eliminate local protectionism, regional barriers, and unfair practices in market access, bidding and government procurement, NDRC official Wang Shancheng told a press conference on Tuesday. Local authorities are prohibited from using administrative or penal measures to intervene in economic disputes or infringe on business rights illegally, the guideline said, adding that unlawful cross-jurisdictional law enforcement or administration are also banned. It stated that the cross-regional flow of goods and factors must not be restricted, and bidding and government procurement should avoid limiting or designating specific patents, trademarks, brands, parts, origins or suppliers. The document also calls for establishing a unified national social security public service platform, allowing people to access social security in the locality where they work even if they do not hold local residency. Wang said work is underway to revise and publish a new negative list for market access to further optimize market access management.- The PD report says that Wang also told reporters that the Guidelines put forward specific requirements and goals from three perspectives: required to do, prohibited from doing and encouraged to do. Under required to do, Wang placed the following: Breaking bottlenecks in regional transportation infrastructure, including highways and waterways Unification of data collection standards, formats and fields between different regulatory departments so as to address the problem of inconsistent regulatory standards in various regions Addressing inconsistencies in government service standards Under prohibited from doing, Wang talked about the -red lines- that I have mentioned above. In the context of encouraged actions, Wang said: -Different regions have different resource endowments. Regions with good basic conditions and high marketization can benchmark higher standards to accelerate the construction of unified markets in their regions and across regions… Wang said that the guidelines ‘encourage qualified regions to carry out regional market integration, promoting the strengthening of communication and coordination of systems, rules and major policies in key areas, and increasing the exploration of cost sharing and benefit sharing in regional cooperation'.- -，、。-，《》-，，-. For future work, Wang said: We will revise and issue the Negative List for Market Access (2025 Edition), further reduce the items on the list, and optimise market access management. We will improve the management system for business entity registration and improve the efficiency of enterprise relocation services. We will build a unified urban and rural construction land market, improve the basic system to promote the standardised development of the capital market, accelerate the formation of a unified and interconnected national technology trading network, cultivate a national integrated data market, and accelerate the construction of a unified national power market system. We will further promote the mutual recognition of medical examination and inspection results, returns and exchanges in different places and stores, withdrawals from housing provident funds in different places, and settlements of medical insurance accounts in different places. We will continuously improve the high-standard connectivity of market facilities. This entails improving the comprehensive three-dimensional transportation network. Going forward. new Implementation Measures for the Fair Competition Review Regulations shall be issued to further refine the review standards, consolidate the review responsibilities, and maintain a unified fair competition system. Clean up and abolish various regulations and practices that hinder the national unified market and fair competition. Break down market access barriers that business entities strongly reflect on and that the masses closely follow. Advance special rectification in areas such as bidding and tendering, enterprise relocation. Improve the long-term mechanism for transferring, investigating and rectifying clues to problems that violate the unified large market, and report typical cases in due time. The Ministry of Commerce will focus on improving foreign investment market access, optimising the business environment, connecting with international high-standard economic and trade rules, and accelerating the integration of domestic and foreign trade. ，。。《（2025）》，，。，。，。，，、，，。、、、。，。-、、、、。，，。-。----，。，，。-2024，《》，，7299。-，《》，，，。。、。、。，。、。，--、--、、，-，。- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: A couple of reports to note. First, He Lifeng talked to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Xinhua reports: Both sides agreed -to maintain communication, manage differences and continue stabilization of China-U.S. economic relations during the political transition period in the U.S. The two lead persons for China-U.S. economic and trade affairs reviewed the experience of China-U.S. economic exchanges and cooperation in recent years and spoke highly of the important role of China-U.S. economic and financial working groups and other dialogue mechanisms in implementing the important consensus reached by the two heads of state.

Xi's Anti-Corruption Warning at CCDI Plenary - Qu Qingshan on Zunyi Conference Anniversary & the Importance of Xi as Core - National Data Infrastructu...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, January 7, 2025. The lead story covers Xi Jinping's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI of the CPC on Monday. Xi -emphasized that since the new era, the intensity of advancing comprehensive and strict Party governance and the fight against corruption has been unprecedented, with results being obvious to all. It is necessary to always maintain tenacious perseverance that the fight against corruption is always ongoing, maintain strategic determination and sustain a high-pressure stance, move forward without pausing for a single step or retreating even half a step. Efforts must be made to integrate the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, resolutely winning this tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption.- ，，，。，，、，、、，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that in 2024, the Central Committee of the Party adhered to leading the social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, consistently advancing the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and achieving new progress and results. The entire Party has gained a clearer understanding and stronger determination regarding the major issue of self-revolution. Solid efforts have been made in carrying out the Party discipline education campaign, with all Party members' awareness of abiding by rules and discipline having been significantly enhanced; the fight against corruption has been intensified, eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption; deeply carried out concentrated rectification of unhealthy trends and corruption problems around the masses, addressing a large batch of prominent problems strongly reflected by the masses; the governance of the Party through systems and regulations has been further advanced, improving the Party's ability to lead the fight against corruption and promote comprehensive and strict governance. ，2024，，，。、；，；，；，；、，、. Xi Jinping emphasized that corruption is the greatest threat facing our Party, and the anti-corruption campaign is the most thorough form of self-revolution. In the new era, facing prominent problems in Party conduct, clean governance construction and anti-corruption struggle within the Party, we have adhered to the principles of resolutely opposing corruption wherever it exists and punishing corruption wherever it arises, continuously purifying the cadre ranks, safeguarding the Party's image, consolidating the red country, securing the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change color, or change flavor, and winning the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. ，，。，，、，，，，、、，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains grim and complex. The existing corruption has not yet been eliminated, new cases continue to occur, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption remains arduous and heavy. Understanding the fight against corruption requires adopting a historical perspective and a strategic vision, focusing on achieving the Party's mission and tasks. The fight against corruption must remain unswerving; any hesitation and wavering, laxity and softness, or abandoning midway would constitute subversive mistakes. It is necessary to resolutely clarify various misconceptions, dispel ideological confusion, and further strengthen the determination and confidence in the fight against corruption. ，。，，。，、，。，、，。，，. He then called for maintaining the -spirit of reform and strict standards- for Party governance in the new era, and -ensure the implementation of the arrangements of the 20th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, ensure that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and promote the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to promote the specificity, precision and normalization of political supervision. Maintaining a high degree of alignment/consistency with the Party Central Committee must be reflected in both words and actions. In terms of ideology, it is necessary to unremittingly strengthen the Party's innovative theoretical armament, accurately grasp the Party Central Committee's goals, positioning and deployment requirements for reform and development in this region, department and domain, ensuring unity in thought and consistency in direction. Politically, it is necessary to adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strictly enforce political discipline and political rules, and absolutely forbid engaging in the ‘seven types of conduct' to ensure consistency between words and actions, with orders being followed and prohibitions strictly observed. In terms of actions, it is necessary to adhere to making the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee the focus of political supervision, and work together to drive reform breakthroughs and promote high-quality development. ，、、。。，，，、。，，，--，、。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that strengthening the Party's discipline construction is a regular task and that it is necessary to guide Party members and cadres to transform external discipline into self-discipline, internalising it as daily and unconscious standards of behavior. A regularised and long-term discipline education mechanism should be established, ensuring that discipline education runs through the entire growth cycle of cadres and is integrated into the whole process of organizational management. Strictly enforce the Party's discipline, accurately apply the ‘four forms', adhere to seeking truth from facts, neither being unjust or indulgent, identify and address problems early when they are nascent, prevent minor issues from growing, and unify strict management and supervision with encouragement of responsibility, enabling cadres to innovate reforms and pursue achievements while complying with regulations and discipline. ，，、，。，、。，--，、，、，，、。 Xi Jinping pointed out that we must deeply promote the simultaneous investigation and treatment of both formalism and corruption. Always adhere to zero tolerance, treat the eight-point central regulations as iron rules and hard limits, seriously investigate and punish the ‘four winds' problems that defy discipline and undergo hidden mutations, supervise Party members and cadres to resolutely oppose privileged thinking and phenomena, and firmly establish correct views of power, performance, and career. Always maintain high-pressure posture against corruption, focus on grasping and investigating key problems, key areas, and key targets, deepen the simultaneous investigation of both taking and giving bribes, and resolutely eliminate systemic corruption risks and hidden dangers. Enhance the effectiveness of using cases to promote reform and governance, promote the improvement of the constraints and supervision mechanisms for the allocation and operation of power, and enrich effective methods for preventing and controlling new types of corruption and hidden corruption. Adhere to the integration of rectifying conduct, enforcing discipline, and fighting corruption, use ‘joint investigation' to severely punish intertwined problems of unhealthy work styles and corruption, use ‘joint treatment' to eliminate common roots of unhealthy work styles and corruption.- ，。，、，、--，、，、、。，、、、，，。，，。，--，--. Xi Jinping emphasized it is necessary to strengthen the primary responsibility and supervisory responsibility for comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline. The Party committee must take the initiative to grasp and manage, the discipline inspection commission must carry out its specialized supervisory duties well, focus on its main responsibilities, and perform its primary tasks. All responsible entities must know their responsibilities, take responsibility, and fulfill their duties. It is necessary to optimize the responsibility implementation and evaluation mechanisms, and precisely and scientifically hold accountable those who fail in their duties and responsibilities. ，。、，，、，、、。，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to continue to promote the extension of comprehensive and strict Party governance to the grassroots level. Party committees at all levels, especially municipal and county Party committees, should take the rectification of unhealthy practices and corruption around the masses as an important and routine task, making it tangible and perceptible to the people. We must deepen the reform of the grassroots supervision system and mechanism, combine discipline inspection and supervision with grassroots inspections, and coordinate supervision from all aspects. Implement a long-term mechanism to reduce the burden on the grassroots by rectifying formalism, allowing grassroots cadres to have more energy to focus on implementation. ，。，。，、。，. Xi Jinping emphasized that the disciplinary inspection and supervision organs are an important force in advancing the Party's self-revolution, and that the Party and the people have full trust and high expectations for this team. We must deepen the reform of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system, adhere to combining authorization and control of power, and put power in the cage of institutional regulations. We must focus on strengthening the standardization, legalization and regularization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and continuously improve the ability to rectify conduct, ensure discipline and fight corruption. We must consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education campaign and education rectification, adhere to ‘those who forge iron must themselves be strong', strengthen strict management and supervision, build an iron army of disciplinary inspection and supervision that is loyal, clean, responsible, and dares to struggle and is good at struggle. ，，、。，，。，。，，，、. In his remarks, Li Xi said that Xi's speech -with a lofty historical perspective, deeply grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle, deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption, and made strategic arrangements for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party.- The speech was -far-sighted, profound, confronted problems directly, and was striking in clarity/would arouse even the apathetic-. -It has provided important guidance for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party and the fight against corruption.- He added: It is necessary to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, strengthen confidence, dare to struggle, conscientiously perform the political responsibility of comprehensive and strictly Party governance, and promote the integration of the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, and unswervingly advance the anti-corruption struggle in depth. ，，，，，、、，。、、、，。，--，--、--、--，、，，、、，.

Xinhua says: Xi said that -China-Botswana relations have always maintained a good momentum of development, and the two countries have become good friends who treat each other equally and good partners who develop hand in hand. Xi said he firmly believes that as long as the two countries adhere to sincere friendship, solidarity and cooperation, the development path of China-Botswana relations will surely become wider, and the prospects for bilateral cooperation will surely be brighter. 2025 marks the opening year for the implementation of the outcomes of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Xi said. He said standing on a new starting point, he is ready to work together with Boko to further strengthen mutual political trust, resolutely support each other's major concerns, jointly advance each other's modernization drive, and open a new chapter in the China-Botswana strategic partnership.- The two other reports on the page are about Wang Huning and Zhao Leji meeting with the visiting President of the Congress of Peru Eduardo Salhuana. Xinhua's report on Zhao's meeting with him says: -Noting that deepening China-Peru friendly cooperation is the common expectation of the two peoples, Zhao said that the legislative bodies of the two countries should contribute to promoting the steady and long-term development of bilateral relations. The NPC of China is willing to work with the Congress of Peru to strengthen exchanges between high-level officials, special committees, bilateral friendship groups and more, deepen mutual learning on governance experience, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and support each other in pursuing development paths suited to their respective national conditions, he said. Chancay port in Peru, a landmark China-Peru cooperation project, will help promote the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road between China and Peru as well as China and Latin America, Zhao said, adding that it is hoped that the Congress of Peru will continue to support the construction of the port. ‘China and Peru have carried out fruitful cooperation in fields such as energy, mining, infrastructure construction and communications, and are actively exploring ways to expand cooperation on digital economy, green development and artificial intelligence. It is hoped that the legislatures of the two countries will jointly create a sound legal environment for China-Peru practical cooperation,' Zhao said.- The report on Wang's meeting with him says: Wang -said China is willing to make joint efforts with Peru to push for more achievements in China-Peru relations and bring more benefits to the two peoples, and the CPPCC is ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Peru to make contributions to promoting the joint advance of the two countries on the road of national modernization.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the new guidelines for the construction of national data infrastructure. The guidelines set 2029 as the date for completing the building of the main structure of China's national data infrastructure. The plan proposes the creation of a unified national ‘ledger' of data, establishing a nationally integrated distributed data directory covering entities such as government, industries, and enterprises, as well as national, provincial, city, and county levels, supporting orderly data circulation and shared applications across levels, regions, systems, departments, and operations.

Xinhua reports: -Indonesia, as a major developing country and an important force in the Global South, highly recognizes the BRICS spirit and has taken an active part in ‘BRICS Plus' cooperation. The spokesperson said Indonesia's official entry into BRICS serves the common interests of BRICS countries and the Global South, adding that ‘we believe that Indonesia will make active contribution to the development of BRICS.' The spokesperson said BRICS is a main platform for promoting solidarity and cooperation of the Global South and a major force driving the reform of the global governance system, and BRICS countries are always committed to multilateralism, fairness and justice, and common development. BRICS's latest addition follows the historic trend of the collective rise of the Global South. China stands ready to work with Indonesia and other BRICS members to jointly build a more comprehensive, close, practical and inclusive partnership, advance the high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make greater contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind, the spokesperson added.- Second, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba on Monday. Xinhua reports: -Despite the geographical distance, the bond between China and Africa has remained strong, Wang said. The China-Africa relationship has withstood the test of changing global circumstances and is showing new promising prospects, he said, stressing that China remains a trustworthy partner for Africa, consistently prioritizing Africa in its overall diplomatic strategy. For 35 years, Chinese foreign ministers have made Africa the destination of their first overseas visit of each year, a tradition that reflects China's unwavering commitment, Wang said, adding that this tradition will continue because strengthening China-Africa cooperation is more crucial than ever for the world, and their joint development symbolizes the rise of the Global South and the growing influence of justice. Namibia, an important member of the African family, is also a comprehensive strategic cooperation partner of China, he noted. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed 10 partnership action plans to jointly advance modernization and announced that the overall characterization of China-Africa relations was elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. This has charted the course for the future development of China-Africa relations, Wang said, noting that China is ready to work with Namibia to implement the 10 partnership action plans, helping Namibia accelerate its modernization process. Acknowledging Namibia's unique resources and vast development potential, Wang said that the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Party of Namibia has adopted a people-centered governance philosophy and guided the country along a development path suited to its national conditions. China is willing to strengthen exchanges on governance with Namibia and deepen cooperation in various fields to achieve common development, Wang said.- Apart from reportedly supporting the -one-China principle-, Mbumba also said that -Namibia supports the three global initiatives proposed by Xi, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and looks forward to continued mutual support and collaboration with China in international and regional affairs to safeguard shared interests.- Wang also met with President-elect Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 6: There's a brief report (English report) on the launch of a high-speed train connecting Xi'an to Hong Kong. Page 10: It's no coincidence that Qu Qingshan's piece commemorating the 90th anniversary of the Zunyi Conference is published today as the CCDI plenary continues in Beijing. Qu reminds us that the conference was a -vital turning point ()- in the Party's history and process. Qu writes that the CCP's history during the New Democratic Revolution period lasted for 28 years. This period can be divided into two halves of 14 years each, with the Zunyi Conference lying in the middle. In the first 14 years, our Party made one right-leaning mistake and three ‘left-leaning' mistakes, leading to two major setbacks in the Chinese revolution: one being the failure of the Great Revolution and the other being the failure of the fifth counter-'encirclement and suppression' campaign in the Central Revolutionary Base, forcing the Red Army to undertake a strategic retreat. In the latter 14 years, starting from the Zunyi Conference, our Party rose again, united and led the people to overcome one difficulty after another and triumph over one challenge after another. First, it achieved victory in the Long March, survived the most difficult period, and pioneered a new phase of the Chinese revolution. Subsequently, it successively achieved victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, overthrew the ‘three mountains' of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic-capitalism, and finally established the People's Republic of China, achieving national independence and people's liberation, inaugurating a new era in Chinese historical development. 28，28，1414。14，、--，，，--，；14，，，、，，，，、，、、，，、，. Qu adds: So, why did such a tremendous historical transformation occur before and after the Zunyi Conference? What are its profound historical reasons and internal logic? Regarding this, the ‘Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century' adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party made a profound summary: The Zunyi Conference ensured that -Comrade Mao Zedong was confirmed as the de facto leader of the Central Committee and the Red Army. The meeting laid the groundwork for establishing the leading position within the Central Committee of the correct Marxist line chiefly represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as for the formation of the first generation of the central collective leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. The meeting opened a new stage in which the Party would act on its own initiative to address practical problems concerning the Chinese revolution, and saved the Party, the Red Army, and the Chinese revolution at a moment of greatest peril.- ，？？，《》，：-，，，-. And then he writes this: -The history of the Party shows that the issue of having a core is of paramount importance. The core is the banner, the core is the direction, and the core is the strength. Marxism tells us that the core arises from practice, the core represents the people, the core guides the way forward, and the core is the choice of history and the people.- ，，，，。，，，，. -The development of history has its inherent logic and essential laws. The materialist conception of history holds that the masses create history. Great figures embody the will of the people and are faithful representatives of the fundamental interests of the masses. Great figures do not appear out of thin air, but are produced in practice and are the product of history and the times. It is no accident that Comrade Mao Zedong became the core of the first generation of the central leadership of our Party. During the Great Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted a profound analysis of the structure of Chinese society and the class situation and engaged in deep thought on issues such as the nature, targets, tasks, and driving forces of the Chinese revolution. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he thoroughly summarized the experiences and lessons of the revolutionary struggle, proposing the idea that ‘political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'; organized and launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the border regions of Hunan and Jiangxi and led the uprising forces to Jinggangshan, where he directed the establishment of China's first rural revolutionary base. This laid the foundation for the correct revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. He emphasized that the ‘textbooks' of Marxism must be studied, but must be combined with China's actual conditions. He proposed, ‘what is the true iron bastion? It is the masses, it is the millions of masses who sincerely support the revolution.' Comrade Mao Zedong's profound analytical power of China's revolutionary situation, deep insight into historical development trends, and scientific judgment of the direction of the era's progress have been tested by practice and verified by history. 。，。，。，，。，。，，、、。，，--，，，，、。，-‘'，。-，-？，。-、、，. And then Qu writes: -The materialist view of history also holds that every person has a certain role in the development of history, but the nature and magnitude of their role differ. Great figures usually stand higher and see farther than ordinary people, are able to concentrate collective wisdom, listen to the voice of the people, conform to the trends of the times, grasp the laws of history, propose and solve major historical tasks, and guide the direction of historical progress. Therefore, their role is unique and special, and they can play an accelerating and promoting role in the development of history.- ，，、。、，，，，，，，、，. The examples he gives for this are the success of Mao's strategies through the first to third anti-encirclement and suppression campaigns in the Central Revolutionary Base Area. He argues that Zhou Enlai and Zhu De sustained Mao's tactics during the fourth campaign too, and achieved victory. But Li De or Otto Braun and others deviated from these during the fifth campaign and thus suffered defeat. Consequently, -due to the erroneous leadership of ‘left' dogmatism- several revolutionary bases were lost. The lessons from the failure of the fifth counter-encirclement and suppression campaign were painfully profound! At the critical juncture and key moment of historical transition, the Party chose Mao Zedong, the Red Army chose Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution chose Mao Zedong, and history and the people chose Mao Zedong. This chapter of history concerning the Party and the Red Army must not be forgotten but should be remembered forever! --！，，，，。，，! He then talks about 2012, with the 18th Party Congress being historic, and marking a new historical orientation for the Party. In other words, -after long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era.- -Since the beginning of the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with a great spirit of historical initiative, immense political courage, and a strong sense of responsibility, coordinated the domestic and international situations, implemented the Party's basic theories, line, and strategies, and taken charge of the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, adhered to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, issued a series of major policies, launched a series of major initiatives, advanced a series of major works, overcome a series of major risks and challenges, solved many tough problems that were long on the agenda but never resolved and accomplished many things that were wanted but never got done, and promoted historic achievements and historic shifts in the cause of the Party and the country.- 2012。，。。：，。，，、、，，、、，、、、，，，，，，，，、. -In the practice of governing the country, General Secretary Xi Jinping, with the magnificent spirit, foresight, and grand strategy of a Marxist statesman, thinker, and strategist, has calmly handled various complex situations, effectively responded to various domestic and foreign risks and challenges, fully demonstrated outstanding political wisdom, strong strategic determination, intense mission responsibility, deep feelings for the people, and superior leadership skills, winning the heartfelt support of the entire Party, military, and people of all ethnic groups, receiving high praise from the international community, becoming the widely supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people's leader, and commander-in-chief of the military.- ，、、、、，，，、、、、，，，、、、. He then quotes the third history resolution again, saying: -The Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and defined the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This reflects the common will of the Party, the armed forces, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and is of decisive significance for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and for driving forward the historic process of national rejuvenation.- He also doubles down on the Two Establishments as the -greatest certainty, confidence and guarantee for the Party and the people to deal with all uncertainties.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xinhua Commentary on Biden Blocking Nippon Steel Deal - Sun Zhuangzhi on 'Window of Opportunity' for Ukraine Deal - Shen Yi: BRICS Expansion Allows Gl...	The People's Daily today was rather uninteresting. The front page had a feature previewing the CCDI plenary session, which begins today. I am going to wait for reporting from the session to get something substantive to cover. In the meantime, I thought I'd highlight three interesting pieces that I read in Chinese media today. First, there's a Xinhua commentary on the Biden administration's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel. It argues that the move is another example of the US -putting political considerations above economic logic and generalising the concept of ‘national security' to practice protectionism.- ，、--. The commentary says: -Tetsuo Kotani, a professor at Meikai University in Japan, argues that the US government's claim of security risks is merely a pretext. Hidetoshi Tashiro, chief economist at Infinity LLC., says that the essence of this acquisition is an ‘economic action' by Nippon Steel aimed at maximizing profits, while the US obstruction is entirely driven by ‘political considerations'. ‘From a historical perspective, this is yet another instance of the US implementing trade protectionist measures to suppress Japan'. In recent years, the US has been obsessed with wielding the ‘tariff stick', continuously escalating unilateral sanctions, pursuing a ‘small yard, high fence' approach and ‘decoupling and breaking chains'. From the slogan of ‘America First' to the signing and implementation of the ‘Inflation Reduction Act' and ‘CHIPS and Science Act', to the unlimited expansion of the concept of ‘national security' ... the US has infused protectionism into an increasing number of industries.- ，。，--，--。-，。-，--，，----。--《》《》，--……. -Any enterprise or country that threatens America's hegemonic position can become a target of the US hunt, and even allies are not immune. The US signed the Plaza Accord with Japan using coercion. This dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economic vitality and led Japan to experience the ‘lost 30 years'; it adopted ‘long-arm jurisdiction' and other means to ‘dismember' the French manufacturing firm Alstom, which eventually led to its main power business being acquired by its American competitor General Electric; it imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products from the European Union and other countries and regions; it restricted the free trade of ASML, a Dutch lithography giant, and included more foreign companies in the export control ‘Entity List' ... such unilateral and protectionist measures disrupt the normal operation of global industrial and supply chains, seriously infringe upon enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, destroy the fairness and stability of international economic and trade cooperation, and show none of the free market spirit of openness, inclusiveness, and cooperation that the US preaches to other countries.- ，，。--，，--；----，；；，--……，，，，、、. The commentary adds that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the WTO. It says that the US -has become the biggest ‘violator' of WTO rules, with -two-thirds of the WTO's violations caused by the US.- -As a consequence, the US has simply refused to implement the WTO's rulings, paralysing the WTO's Appellate Body. The US approach to international law and international rules is ‘use if it suits, abandon if it doesn't suit', ‘liberalism when prospering and protectionism when facing adversity'; the essence is to seek its own selfish interests. 。、，--：。，，--。-、--，-，. The commentary then says that US Steel's failings are due to -over-protectionism-. It adds: -The decline of the US steel industry from prosperity is deeply connected to the US economy's development path of ‘moving away from the real towards the virtual', while the long-term trade protection policies implemented to cope with overseas competition have led to persistently high domestic steel prices in the US, no improvement in steel mills' profitability, and caused downstream industries like automobiles and construction to pay a heavy price in global competition. Bloomberg reported last year that in the past decade, US protectionist measures related to the steel industry have not prevented the loss of manufacturing jobs, and have rather increased costs in other areas of the US economy, reducing industry competitiveness.- ，。10，，，？，。--，，，，、。，，，，. (Note: The emphasis on real to virtual is as much a comment about the US economy as it is a message domestically. One of the primary concerns articulated by Xi Jinping has been about the flow of capital in China to what he calls the virtual and speculative economy.) Towards the end, the article quotes from Nippon Steel and US Steel's joint statement, saying that the Biden administration's decision -sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.- Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Second, Sun Zhuangzhi, Director of the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, discussed the prospect of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Sun argued there may be a -window of opportunity- to achieve a ceasefire or end the conflict in 2025. He believes -that the goals of both sides have changed. In the past, the goal was to win at all costs, but now it is about not losing, and both sides feel enormous pressure.- Sun argues that the reasons for the change in goals are: First, the immense consumption on the battlefield, with human and material resources being stretched to their limits. For Russia, it is difficult to maintain this wartime economy for an extended period of time. For Ukraine, the continuous large fiscal deficits and the need for more Western aid are pressing issues. If US aid were to stop, it would be a huge problem for Ukraine. Second, there is tremendous political pressure. Both sides realise that fully defeating the other is difficult, but neither can afford to retreat. For the leaders of both countries, compromise would mean total failure, so there is no room for concession. Third, there are huge escalation costs. Both sides understand that escalating the conflict would mean paying an even higher price. So on the one hand, both sides are continuing to test each other's bottom line, and on the other, they have reservations. 3，，，，，。，，，、。，。，，。，。。，。，，。。，。，. Sun adds that for both sides things are already rather bad and it shouldn't get any worse than this. From this perspective, there may be a ‘window of opportunity' to resolve the conflict or achieve a ceasefire; both sides realize that it is actually very difficult to ultimately defeat the other side. ，，，。，--，. -Sun believes that this year, there is a possibility of high-level talks between Russia and the US. Trump will actively strive for this, and Putin has also said he is ready and can meet with Trump anytime, as long as the conditions are appropriate. In addition to Russia-US talks, Russia-EU dialogue is also possible, and Ukraine might even be invited to participate. However, he also pointed out that dialogue does not equate to peace talks. It is difficult for Russia and Ukraine to negotiate face to face and come up with a solution to the conflict. Currently, both sides claim they are open to talks, but the conditions they propose are far apart.- ，。，，，，。，，。，。，。，.

In the first episode, I speak to former Indian National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon about the churn in the world order. You can also access the podcast via my Substack, on Apple Podcasts via Substack or Spotify below. Third, in an article dated January 1, 2025, in the Global Times, Director of the Centre for BRICS Studies at Fudan University, Shen Yi, discussed the evolution of the BRICS with new partners joining. He writes that on January 1, 2025, nine countries, including Belarus, Bolivia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Cuba, Uganda, Malaysia and Uzbekistan, officially became BRICS partner countries. Shen adds: This is -another successful strategic practice of the ‘BRICS+' mechanism proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS Xiamen Summit in 2017. Nine countries from the Global South becoming BRICS partner countries not only reflects the trend of the global economic centre of gravity shifting towards the Global South but also provides an important perspective for understanding the deep driving forces of restructuring of power in the international system.- ...2017-+-。9--，--，. -The concept of BRICS cooperation partners transcends the traditional economic cooperation framework. As representatives of emerging economies and developing countries, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has carried the call for establishing a more equitable international order since its inception, and countries joining this mechanism are regarded as important partners sharing this vision. Partnership not only implies collaboration in economic and financial fields but also includes joint efforts in global governance reform, technological innovation, and social development. The addition of new members enhances BRICS' geopolitical and economic representation, injecting new momentum into the formation of a multipolar world.- 。，，。，、。，，. -The backdrop of BRICS' expansion is the pursuit and desire of the ‘Global South' for a more fair and reasonable international order in the new era. In the past decades, after the end of the Cold War, although the first round of globalisation led by Western countries, stressing on the so-called ‘common values' and ‘rules', did promote economic development, it also made all parties generally realise the intensification of global inequality, as well as Western countries' increasingly apparent lack of sustainable and effective leadership capability. There is a large amount of evidence proving that the international economic system dominated by Western countries is structurally unfair to the Global South countries, including but not limited to insufficient representation of developing countries in decision-making in organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which objectively puts Global South countries at a long-term disadvantage.- ，--。，，、----，，。，--，（IMF），--. At the same time, the world is increasingly feeling the negative impacts and shocks that can come from the abuse of hegemony by dominant Western countries, especially the structural hegemonic power with dollar hegemony at the core. In sharp contrast, the achievements made by the BRICS countries in their own development and collaborative development, their adherence to and promotion of the multi-polarization of the international system, and the development needs and preferences for participating in international mechanisms faced by Global South countries including BRICS countries. As a result, joining the BRICS mechanism in a flexible and adaptable manner has naturally become a widely recognised and increasingly accepted pragmatic model for global cooperation. ，，。，，，--，。，，、、. -From a practical perspective, against the backdrop of continuously rising traditional geopolitical risks, becoming a BRICS partner country provides Global South countries with a more inclusive, flexible and resilient set of diversified choices. Joining the ‘Greater BRICS' as partner countries not only provides opportunities for economic cooperation, but also creates conditions for developing countries to voice opinions and participate in global governance reform. Through the BRICS platform, the Global South' can break free from the so-called pressure to ‘choose sides' within the traditional geopolitical framework and pursue greater autonomy in a multipolar world.- ，，--、。--，，。，----，. -At the level of development philosophy and pathways, BRICS emphasizes inclusive development, which aligns closely with the development aspirations of many Global South countries. It is reasonable to believe that the inclusion of new members will help BRICS' pragmatic cooperation continuously improve global representation, garnering more support and recognition. At the same time, the addition of new members has infused vitality and diversity into the BRICS cooperation mechanism. This expansion has enhanced BRICS' global influence, significantly strengthening its voice in international affairs. The BRICS mechanism is no longer confined to traditional economic cooperation but is gradually expanding into areas such as international security, technological innovation, and cultural exchange. The nine new partner countries, with their wide geographic distribution and diverse historical and cultural backgrounds, on the one hand, help enhance the global representation of BRICS; on the other hand, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has not adopted Western-style ideological confrontations or bloc divisions. Its advocacy for a multilateral cooperation model avoids zero-sum games between major powers, offering a more inclusive paradigm for international relations. This openness and flexibility encourage more countries to join the BRICS family, collectively advancing reforms in global governance.- ，，--。，，，。，。，。，、。9，，；，。，。，。 Shen then adds: The impact of the BRICS expansion on the international system can be analysed from three aspects. First, it has injected new impetus into international multilateral cooperation. Against the backdrop of an increasingly dysfunctional multilateral system dominated by the West, the BRICS mechanism provides an alternative to bridge the global governance deficit. By promoting multipolar development, the BRICS countries have provided certain possibilities for reshaping the international order. Second, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has initiated internal discussions on healthier operational models and mechanisms for the global financial system beyond the US dollar system. The addition of new members not only enhances the stability of the BRICS currency basket but also supports the advancement of related initiatives. Although this process remains in its early stages, its potential systemic impact cannot be ignored. Finally, the expansion of the BRICS has enhanced the representativeness and fairness of global governance. As a collective action of developing countries and emerging economies, the BRICS mechanism has broken the monopoly of Western countries in rule-making in traditional international institutions and brought a more balanced perspective to global governance. The expansion of the BRICS countries marks the deepening of cooperation among the ‘Global South' countries and the acceleration of the global multi-polarisation process. In the face of various challenges in the current international system, the BRICS mechanism provides a potential cooperation platform. By promoting inclusive development, advocating multilateralism and reforming the global governance system, the BRICS countries and their partners have made important contributions to shaping a more equitable international order. Although this process is constrained by many complex factors, its prospects undoubtedly bring hope for building a multipolar world. 。，。，。，。，，。，。，。，。，，。--。，。、，。，.

US Companies on Export Control & Unreliable Entities Lists - New Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future - 58 Tigers Taken Down in 2024 - ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, January 3, 2025. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan sending a New Year card in return to representatives of middle school teachers and students in the US State of Washington. Xinhua reports: -In the card, Xi and Peng said the year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. During the Second World War, China and the United States fought together for peace and justice, and the friendship between the two peoples stood the test of blood and fire and is growing ever stronger, they said. The couple expressed their hope that the youth of China and the United States will continue to participate in China's initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study programs in a five-year span, strengthen exchanges and interactions, enhance mutual understanding, carry forward traditional friendship, and contribute to the development of China-U.S. relations and world peace.- China's Ministry of Commerce didn't get that friendship memo. Although it is not in the paper today, in a first-ever development, Beijing on Thursday put 28 American companies on its export control list. This was done in order to -safeguard national security and interests and fulfil international obligations, including non-proliferation commitments.- As a consequence, -it is prohibited to export dual-use items to the 28 US entities; related export activities currently underway should be stopped immediately. Also, -in exceptional cases where export is deemed necessary, the exporter must apply for approval.- The 28 entities are: 1. General Dynamics 2. L3 L3 Harris Technologies） 3.

In addition, the Ministry placed 10 American companies on its unreliable entities list for selling arms to Taiwan. Xinhua reports that these companies: Will be prohibited from engaging in China-related import or export activities Will be barred from making new investments in China Senior executives of these companies will be banned from entering China The work permits and visitor or residency status of senior executives of these companies will be revoked, and any related applications they submit will not be approved. The report adds: -The MOC stated that these companies have engaged in arms sales to the Taiwan region and conducted so-called cooperation on military technologies in recent years, despite China's strong opposition. Their actions severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, severely violated the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and severely undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, the ministry said, adding that the companies will be legally held accountable. Noting that China's unreliable entity provisions only target a few foreign entities that undermine China's national security, the ministry said the Chinese government will always welcome foreign companies to invest and expand their businesses in China, and is committed to providing a stable, fair and predictable business environment for law-abiding companies operating in China.- The 10 companies that have been added to the list are: Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Lockheed Martin Missile Systems Integration Laboratory Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories Lockheed Martin Ventures Javelin Joint Venture Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems General Dynamics Information Technology General Dynamics Mission Systems Share Tracking People's Daily Back to news about Xi. The Chinese president exchanged messages of congratulations with Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on the 45th anniversary of bilateral ties. Xinhua reports: Xi said that -In recent years, the political mutual trust between the two sides has been strengthened, practical cooperation in various fields has delivered fruitful results, and the China-Ecuador friendship has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people…Notably the China-Ecuador Free Trade Agreement, which has been successfully signed and entered into force, has given a strong boost to upgrading economic and trade cooperation and injected fresh impetus into the development of bilateral relations, the Chinese president said. ‘I attach great importance to the growth of China-Ecuador relations and stand ready to work with President Noboa to take the 45th anniversary as a new starting point to renew the traditional China-Ecuador friendship and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields so as to lift China-Ecuador relations to a higher level,' Xi said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's visit to Jinan in Shandong Province. Li said that -entering the new year, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference, with a sense of responsibility and urgency that time waits for no one, seize every moment, promote early implementation of policies, quick advancement of projects, ensure tangible outcomes of measures, and strive to achieve a good start to this year's economic development.- ，，，，、，、、，.

Visiting a home appliance store, Li said that -the government's consumer goods trade-in scheme is of great significance to meet the needs of people for high-quality life, unlock consumption potential, promote industry upgrades and facilitate economic circulation. China will continue to implement this initiative with greater support, Li said, adding that procedures will be optimized to facilitate consumer spending.- He also visited a charging and battery-swapping station. Li -encouraged exploratory and innovative efforts in developing charging and battery-swapping services and related areas. Measures should be taken to deepen reform of the energy management system, transform the energy sector and foster new drivers of growth,- he added. Li then visited a sports stadium and a water management project. He said that -stadiums and modern water networks are not only significant infrastructure projects, but also important for public welfare, and called for efforts to strengthen supply of resources such as funds and land. Concerning urban renewal, it is important to stress the planning and layout of drainage networks and maintain strict oversight throughout the entire construction process to ensure that the project quality is able to stand the test of time, Li added. Efforts should be made to attract more private investment to participate in the construction of infrastructure and public services, he said.- Finally, there's a long, long article reviewing the development of work related to propaganda, ideology and culture in 2024. I am not detailing this. But the most significant development of course was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Culture in particular, which was formally established in October 2023. Patriotism is also a key trait that is highlighted in the article. Subscribe now Page 2: Wang Yi spoke at the opening ceremony of the new Research Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind in Beijing. This has been established by the China Foreign Affairs University. Wang said: -Building a community with a shared future for mankind is a significant original concept proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It is the core idea of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and represents China's answer to the era's question of ‘What kind of world to build and how to build it?' It holds valuable theoretical significance, major contemporary relevance, and profound global influence.- ，，，，-、-，、. -Wang Yi said that the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind highlights the original mission of the CPC. General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that the CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and strives for the cause of human progress. Building a community with a shared future for mankind reflects our Party's innate internationalist sentiment, organically combines the fundamental interests of the Chinese people with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, and closely links the future and destiny of China with the future and destiny of the world; transcends the differences in social systems and ideologies, and transcends the differences in history, culture, and development stages, and establishes a banner and direction for China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on the new journey.- ，。，，。，，，、，、，、. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind promotes the fine traditions of Chinese culture. This major initiative is a vivid practice of the ‘two integrations' and an innovative achievement of the sinicization of Marxism. It embodies the Chinese nation's worldview of ‘Great Unity' , the value of ‘harmony is the most precious' , and the perspective of righteousness/morality and interests that ‘puts righteousness first' . It demonstrates the peaceful, inclusive and innovative nature of Chinese civilization. It is the promotion and sublimation of China's excellent traditional culture under new historical conditions. It will surely unleash the timeless appeal and inspiration of Chinese culture, and will surely promote Chinese civilization to make new contributions to the progress of human civilization. 。--，，--、--、--，、，，，. -The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind demonstrates the profound power of scientific theory. Since its proposal in 2013, this concept has evolved into a broad and complete structure, with the construction of ‘five worlds' (these are: building a world of lasting peace, building a world of universal security, building a world of common prosperity, building an open and inclusive world, and building a clean and beautiful world) as its goal, global governance through consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits as its implementation path, the practice of universal human values as its guiding principle, the building of a new type of international relations as its foundational support, the ‘three major global initiatives' as its strategic guidance, and high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road' as its practical platform It enriches and develops Marxist theories of international relations, transcends traditional theories of international relations, and illuminates the path forward for global governance.- 。2013，、，--，，，，--，--，，，. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind clarifies China's proposition amid the once-in-a-century changes that are unfolding. Facing changes of the times and historical questions, building a community of shared future for mankind clearly advocates the spirit of ‘working together for this one and only planet Earth', an open and inclusive mindset, and a vision of win-win cooperation. It proposes transcending conflict and confrontation through peaceful development, replacing absolute security with common security, discarding zero-sum games for mutual benefit and win-win results, preventing clashes between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning, and protecting the homeland of Earth through green development, promoting state-to-state relations from peaceful coexistence toward shared destiny, injecting strong momentum into promoting world peace and development cause.- 。、，--、、，，，，，，，.

He also stressed adhering to the people-centered development philosophy, serving the modernization featuring harmonious coexistence between man and nature, and improving development of China's geographical space while doing the natural resources work. Efforts should also be made to effectively translate learning outcomes into practical work results, he added.- Finally, a report informs that Li Dianxun has been appointed as acting Governor of Hubei.

Xinhua informs: -The national average reading in 2024 stood at 10.9 degrees Celsius, 1.01 degrees Celsius above the annual average, breaking the previous record set in 2023, which was 10.71 degrees Celsius. A total of 19 provincial-level regions logged record-high temperatures last year -- including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi. Average precipitation across the country reached 697.7 mm in 2024, 9 percent more than the annual average- Outside of the People's Daily, I found this article by Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute, China Institute of International Studies, making the pitch for a Pan-Asian Railway Network, rather interesting. It points to continued Chinese interest in pursuing railway connectivity projects abroad. Xiang also makes the case that this is not simply about economic efficiency but also a strategic requirement. The article begins by discussing the history of this idea, dating it back to the 1960s. Back then, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) had proposed a plan for constructing a freight railway network spanning the Eurasian continent, known as the Trans-Asian Railway project. Fast forward to April 2010, when representatives from 18 Asian countries signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Trans-Asian Railway Network in Busan, proposing the construction of a Trans-Asian Railway network spanning 81,000 kilometers. 60，、，（ESCAP），。，。，，19999，，。20104，18《》，8.1。，. Apart from making the economic argument for such a network, Xiang writes that for Asian countries -collaborating on the construction and operation of cross-border railways can strengthen economic interests and cultural ties, while fostering mutual understanding and trust, reducing conflicts, and maintaining regional peace and stability.- ，，，，，. He then discusses the challenges, writing that indeed, advancing such a grand project -not only requires gathering the political will and cooperative consensus of various countries, but also overcoming difficult and complex practical problems.- -The planning of the Pan-Asian Railway Network will first have to deal with the complexity and diversity of countries in the region, which have differences in terms of development levels and interests, making coordination costs high and difficulties great in aspects like route planning, construction standards, and operational management. Additionally, railway construction requires enormous investment, has long construction periods, and slow capital recovery. For cross-border railways, different countries will also have disputes surrounding benefit distribution and operational models, affecting cooperation enthusiasm and smooth project implementation. At the same time, engineering and technical problems cannot be ignored. Eurasian countries' railways have multiple track gauges; if cross-border connectivity is only based on the existing different track gauges, it will inevitably significantly constrain transportation efficiency. Whether ‘trains running on the same track gauge' can be achieved is a significant test of the quality of the Pan-Asian Railway Network. And to lay new electrified tracks, Asia's terrain is complex, some railway sections need to traverse mountains, deserts, rivers, tropical rainforests and other challenging sections, construction difficulty is high, engineering technical requirements are high, this will not only increase construction costs, but also involve many thorny environmental and socio-cultural issues. ，，，。，、，、、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，。--，。，，、、、，，，，. But Xiang sounds optimistic, citing China's high-speed rail network development as an example that has -demonstrative and radiative effect, encouraging neighbouring countries to accelerate their railway construction plans.- He adds: -Through BRI's framework for interconnectivity cooperation, China and its neighbours have launched numerous benchmark projects for the Pan-Asian Railway Network. In addition to the operational China-Laos Railway and Jakarta-Bandung HSR, there are over a dozen cross-border railway projects under construction or planning. A groundbreaking development is the China-Europe Railway Express, which, since its launch in 2016, has exceeded 100,000 cumulative trips, connecting 227 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries. ，4.6，，--，--，。，。--，。，。，201610，25227、11100. He adds: -As an ‘infrastructure fanatic' , China's experience and technology can help the Pan-Asian Railway Network ‘dream come true'. The China-Laos Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung HSR have activated the ‘high-speed rail dream' of ASEAN countries. The three lines of the Pan-Asian Railway Network in Southeast Asia, namely the East Line, the Central Line and the West Line, have all made progress to varying degrees. China and ASEAN are deeply integrating the Pan-Asian Railway Network planning with development plans such as the ‘ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan 2025', jointly formulating detailed construction plans and timetables, and solidly promoting pragmatic cooperation, committed to complete the strategic jigsaw puzzle of land and sea connectivity among ASEAN countries as soon as possible, and laying a solid foundation for the development of the ASEAN Community. --，--。--。、、，。《2025》，，，，. Currently, with the rise of trade protectionism and anti-globalization trends, major power competition, and geopolitical tensions, Asia-Pacific regional cooperation is facing bottlenecks and constraints. The more this is the case, the more urgent it becomes for regional countries to build consensus around connectivity, and the construction of the Pan-Asian Railway Network is also most timely. Under the new circumstances, the construction of the Pan-Asia Railway will help break down trade barriers, provide an efficient and low-cost cross-border transportation channel for the Asia-Pacific region, inject new impetus into economic and trade exchanges within the region, and help integrate resources in the Asia-Pacific region, promote the process of regional economic integration, and enhance the overall competitiveness of the regional economy. For countries prioritizing security and development, cross-border railway cooperation can strengthen strategic collaboration, increase political trust, reinforce a sense of shared destiny, hedge against geopolitical risks and challenges, and can also reduce dependence on maritime energy transportation through opening up land energy channels, thereby better ensuring their energy security, enhancing regional strategic stability, and improving the collective ability to respond to complex challenges.- ，、，。，，。，、，，，，。，，，，，，，，，.

Previewing CCDI Plenary - How Xi Has Led Reform - China's Flexible Retirement System - Commemorating Shen Junru's Life to Support for Xi - Wang Shida ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 2, 2025. Page 1: There's a long, long Xinhua article on how Xi Jinping led China in 2024 to take new and solid steps towards modernisation. It says that in 2024, Xi visited -more than 10 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the Macao Special Administrative Region, made four visits abroad, presided over a series of important meetings, attended a series of major events, delivered a series of important speeches, and put forth a series of important instructions, which promoted new achievements in the theory and practice of governing the country.- I am not going to detail the full article. Rather, let me just point to some key extracts: The piece says that -this is an era of great changes, and even more so an era of great possibilities.- ，。 Xi Jinping -personally served as the head of the drafting group for the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Congress, throughout the process laying out plans, organizing research, carefully guiding, and taking the pulse/setting the direction.- 2023，2024，7。，、、、. The article specifically references this speech that Xi delivered towards the end of October on the subject of reform. In it, Xi outlined the approach to properly handle four key relationships. In it, Xi had also called on leading cadres to -strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge; we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development.- The article reiterates that -high-quality development- remains the Party's -primary task.- The article touches upon policy shifts since the September 26, 2024, Politburo meeting, praising Xi for demonstrating -great foresight- and -extraordinary wisdom and ability in steering China's economy.- 、，、，、，. What are new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping provided a profound explanation: ‘Its characteristic is innovation, its key lies in high quality, and its essence is advanced productivity. How to develop new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward clear requirements: ‘Cannot rush in hastily, surge up in a rush all together and disperse in a rush together, must adapt measures to local conditions, each having their own strengths'.- ？：-，，。-？：-、、，，.- The piece then discusses China's achievements in technology and innovation, progress in regional coordinated development, and coordinating development and security. The last of these includes -preventing and resolving financial risks, especially systemic risks-, -development of new energy and national energy security- and -food security.- The third section of the article deals with employment, rural revitalisation, urban-rural integrated development, and the work done to -narrow the urban-rural gap, regional gap, and income gap, and promote the common prosperity of all people-. Two bits to note in the foreign policy section. -China's poverty alleviation process shows that with the tenacity, perseverance and a fighting spirit of ‘dripping water wears away a stone and following a blueprint to the end', the poverty problem in developing countries can be solved, and weak birds can fly first and fly high. If China can succeed, other developing countries can also succeed. This is the global significance of China's successful victory in the battle against poverty.- -，、、，，、。，。.- Also: -‘We admire the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and are willing to learn from the experience of the Communist Party of China.' ‘We will continue to deepen cooperation with China and actively participate in the process of Chinese-style modernization.' ‘President Xi Jinping seeks the well-being of the people, maintains social fairness and justice, advocates peace rather than war, cooperation rather than confrontation, and creation rather than destruction, and has set an example for the world' ... This is the echo of the times of Chinese-style modernization, and this is the global significance of the new form of human civilization created by China today.- -，--，--，，、、，-……，. Subscribe now Next, there's a piece that previews the upcoming CCDI plenary session. It says that: In 2024, the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission along with discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to making the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and directives, and the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the top priority of political supervision, focusing on key tasks such as the implementation of a package of incremental policy deployments, keeping watch on important deployments such as high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, strengthening supervision and inspection, ensuring proper implementation, and resolutely preventing disobedience of orders and violations of prohibitions. 2024，，，，，，、. Then we get some data: In terms of inadequate supervision and abuse of power in the field of ecological and environmental protection, -from January to November 2024, more than 24,000 related issues were investigated and dealt with, and more than 34,000 people were criticized, educated and dealt with, of which more than 19,000 were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- ，、。2024111，2.4，3.4，1.9. The CCDI and NSC made -special arrangements to strictly investigate corruption in the field of grain purchase and sales.- -From January to November 2024, discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels across the country investigated and dealt with more than 14,000 related issues, criticized and educated more than 21,000 people, of which more than 13,000 people were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- 2024111，1.4，2.1，1.3. The piece talks about how supervision is following the agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, with -discipline inspection and supervision organs actively performing political supervision duties to clear obstacles and further the development of new quality productive forces.- --。，. How does it do this? Here's an example: -Shanghai's Shibei Hi-Tech Service Industry Park has gathered a batch of technological innovation enterprises. Shanghai Jing'an District's Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, through visits, learned that small and micro enterprises face problems of having few tangible assets and difficulty in financing. They actively promoted functional departments and financial enterprises to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, provided enterprises with personalized financing loan solutions, while also supervising the park to accelerate the systematic construction of intellectual property operation and maintenance services. As of now, nearly 20 enterprises have received intellectual property pledge financing services, and their funding problems have been effectively solved.- 。、，、，，。，20，. (Note: I don't think that this is the norm for the CCDI and NSC to facilitate financing solutions for enterprises. It also is an example of significant political and Party interference in financing decisions. But then the piece also talks about the CCDI engaged in supervision with regard to cultural relics protection.) Towards the end, the article says: Inspection tours are a strategic institutional arrangement for strict and comprehensive Party governance. In 2024, according to the Party Central Committee's deployment, the Central Inspection Work Leading Group organized two rounds of inspections, inspecting 68 units in total. As of now, the completion rate of the 20th Central Committee's full-coverage inspection task is nearly 50%. The Central Inspection Groups put the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important instructions and directives in the primary position, closely monitored power and responsibility to strengthen political supervision, deeply understood the inspected Party organizations' situations regarding fulfilling functional responsibilities, implementation of major reform deployments, preventing and resolving major risks, deepening strict and comprehensive Party governance, strengthening leadership teams and cadre talent team building, and carefully finding political deviations. 。2024，，，68。，50%。，，、、、、，.

It says that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, the statutory retirement age for men will be gradually raised from 60 to 63 in the course of 15 years, while that for women cadres will be raised from 55 to 58, and that for women blue-collar workers will be raised from 50 to 55.- The document adds that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, employees who have reached the minimum years of contribution required by the state to receive a basic pension on a monthly basis may voluntarily choose flexible early retirement. The maximum early retirement period is up to three years before the statutory retirement age, and the retirement age cannot be lower than the original statutory retirement ages of 50 years for women blue-collar workers, 55 years for women cadres, and 60 years for men. When employees reach the statutory retirement age, the employer can flexibly delay retirement by reaching an agreement with the employee, with the delay time no longer than 3 years from the statutory retirement age.- 《》，202511，，，3，50、5560。，，，3. Page 3: There's a brief report informing that the China-Maldives FTA has taken effect from January 1, 2025. Also on the page, there's a report based on comments by MoFA's Mao Ning on China's focus on the Global South. I guess this is signalling for the year ahead. Mao said: -As Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out, the collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. In the past year, greater BRICS cooperation made a good start, the new model of ‘SCO plus' came into shape, and the African Union took part in the G20 Summit for the first time. Global South countries have joined hands to take part in multilateral cooperation more actively and extensively, bringing new impetus for the transformation of economic globalization, and adding new dynamism to global governance. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations. China will continue to practice true multilateralism, firmly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and bring the Global South together in solidarity for greater strength, so as to leave the mark of the Global South on the progress of humanity.- Leave a comment Page 6: There's a long piece marking the 150th birth anniversary of Shen Junru, who among other things was the chairman of the China Democratic League. One key excerpt from the article, given that history is never about history, but rather about the present. -We commemorate Mr. Shen Junru in order to learn from his spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, being selfless and fearless, and having the courage to struggle; to learn from his admirable qualities of advocating democracy, pursuing the rule of law, seeking truth, and striving for progress; more importantly, it is to learn from his steadfast political conviction of close cooperation and solidarity with the Communist Party of China and sharing weal and woe. Throughout the long revolutionary struggle, he forged deep friendships with CPC leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, becoming a trustworthy and candid friend of the Party. In his later years, Mr. Shen Junru held even deeper affection for the CPC. During the 1962 National Day celebration, Mao Zedong inquired about his health on the Tiananmen Rostrum and personally supported him as they descended the elevator after the event. Upon returning home, he emotionally declared, ‘We must always listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party of China.' This was not only Mr. Shen's earnest exhortation to the younger generations but also a vivid embodiment of the Democratic League's close alignment and resolute support for the CPC. Today, in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, members of democratic parties should take Mr. Shen Junru and other predecessors as role models, inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of multi-party cooperation, unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th CPC Central Committee, deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', strengthen the ‘Four Consciousnesses' and ‘Four Confidences', and achieve the ‘Two Safeguards', remain unwavering in thinking together, standing together, and working together with the CPC, upholding, developing, and perfecting China's new political party system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、、，、、、，、。，、，。。1962，，，：-，。-，、。，，，，，、，--，--、--、--，、、，、、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily On December 26, 2024, there was a piece by Wang Shida from China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Global Times in Chinese, arguing that while the world marks the 20th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, even today countries are realising that they need to -work together to overcome difficulties, as the region faces many new challenges requiring urgent attention.- Wang writes: -On one hand, the risk of bloc confrontation in the Indian Ocean region is intensifying. The Indian Ocean region is vast and densely populated, encompassing about 20% of the world's water bodies, a quarter of its landmass, and three-quarters of its oil, iron, and tin reserves. More importantly, the region is crucial for ensuring the safety and stability of global shipping lanes and trade routes, carrying over one-third of the world's bulk cargo and two-thirds of its oil shipments. International chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab el-Mandeb are located in the region, underscoring its significance in both economic and geopolitical terms. It is precisely because of the political and economic importance of the region that some countries have increased their involvement or interference in the Indian Ocean in recent years. The United States has been particularly active, pushing its ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy' to unite and integrate so-called ‘Indo-Pacific' allies and partners in an attempt to strengthen the containment of China. Currently, 3 of the US Unified Combat Commands are related to the Indian Ocean region, US military frequently conducts various joint exercises with regional countries, and has become the largest weapons supplier to the Indian Ocean region. Additionally, the US is leveraging mechanisms such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to bolster its influence and presence. Obviously, such actions amount to forming cliques in the Indian Ocean region, binding regional countries to America's war chariot, with growing risks of regional countries being ‘forced into camp confrontation'.- ，。、，20%、1/43/4、。，，1/3、2/3，、，。，。，--，--。，3，，。--、--。，，，--. On the other hand, the Indian Ocean region today is in urgent need of achieving sustainable development. At present, countries in the region are having to shoulder the heavy responsibility of developing the national economies and improving people's well-being, while at the same time facing several new and old challenges, such as environmental and climate change. Over the past few decades, climate change has caused countries in the region to experience increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations reported in 2021 that since the 1950s, the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than any other waters, which will lead to decreased fishing yields across the entire ocean, harming countries that are highly dependent on fisheries and lack the ability to adapt to climate shocks. In addition, by 2030, the population density of the Indian Ocean coastal areas is expected to reach the highest level in the world, with 340 million people living in potentially dangerous coastal areas. Obviously, avoiding risks of camp confrontation, opposing external power interference, or achieving regional stability and sustainable growth, including resolving lingering sovereignty disputes left behind from the decolonisation period, cannot be accomplished by any single country alone. It requires joint efforts from all Indian Ocean countries and regions as well as external () ‘positive energy countries'.- ，。，、，，。，、。2021，2050，，，。，2030，，3.4。，、，，，，--. -Although the US and other countries have been exaggerating the ‘China threat' and intensifying the containment and suppression of China under the framework of the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy', China has always developed relations with the countries in the Indian Ocean region with an attitude of equal cooperation and mutual benefit and win-win. In recent years, China's trade cooperation with the region has developed well, with increasing trade scale and growing mutual trade dependence. Currently, China is the largest import partner for over 20 countries in the Indian Ocean region, and the largest export partner for 13 countries in the region, with many regional countries joining high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. At the same time, China actively participates in multilateral cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and has hosted three China-Indian Ocean Regional Development Cooperation Forums. When the Indian Ocean tsunami occurred 20 years ago, China was a firm supporter of ‘working together to rebuild a beautiful home'. Looking to the future, China and the Indian Ocean region have broad cooperation space and huge development potential, with prospects to further advance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with regional countries, working together to achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the region.- ----、，、。，，，。，20，13，--。，，—。20，-，-。，，，，、.

Xi's New Year's Message & Warning - Putin-Xi Exchange Greetings - New Party Chiefs for Henan, Hubei, Guangxi & Qinghai	Wish all of you a very Happy New Year. Here's to another year of China-watching and analysis! If you work in a domain that requires you to conduct open-source China analysis, do please consider applying for my Watching China course. The course begins on February 1, 2025. Students and Takshashila alumni are eligible for discounts. Click here or on the image below for all the details. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 1, 2025. The front page today is dominated by Xi Jinping. The lead story is based on Xi's annual new year message. The speech (English text) essentially was a positive recap of 2024. He said: -We have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China's economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark. Grain output has surpassed 700 million tons, and China's bowls are now filled with more Chinese grain. Coordinated development across regions has gained stronger momentum, and mutually reinforcing advances have been made in both new urbanization and rural revitalization. Green and low-carbon development has been further enhanced. Indeed, a more beautiful China is unfolding before us. We have fostered new quality productive forces in light of actual conditions. New business sectors, forms and models have kept emerging. For the first time, China has produced more than 10 million new energy vehicles in a year. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields. Also for the first time, the Chang'e-6 lunar probe collected samples from the far side of the moon. The Mengxiang drilling vessel explored the mystery of the deep ocean. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link now connects the two cities across the sea. The Antarctic Qinling Station is now in operation on the frozen continent. All this epitomizes the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.- For 2025, he said: -In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan. We will implement more proactive and effective policies, pursue high-quality development as a top priority, promote greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and maintain sound momentum in economic and social development. The Chinese economy now faces some new conditions, including challenges of uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones. But we can prevail with our hard work. As always, we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident. Of all the jobs in front of us, the most important is to ensure a happy life for our people. Every family hopes that their children can have a good education, their seniors can enjoy good elderly services, and their youngsters can have more and better opportunities. These simple wishes are our people's aspirations for a better life. We should work together to steadily improve social undertakings and governance, build a harmonious and inclusive atmosphere, and settle real issues, big or small, for our people. We must bring more smiles to our people and greater warmth to their hearts. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, I visited the city again, and I was gratified to see the new progress and changes there. We will unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family. No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times. As changes unseen in a century accelerate across the world, it is important to rise above estrangement and conflict with a broad vision, and care for the future of humanity with great passion. China will work with all countries to promote friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual learning among different cultures, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We must jointly create a better future for the world.- Another report on the page covers Xi's meeting with representatives of retired officials and groups who received awards for their outstanding work. Li Ganjie spoke at this meeting. He called on everyone to -thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses and instructions on the work of veteran cadres; deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', resolutely implement the ‘Two Safeguards', and do a good job in the work of veteran cadres in the new era and new journey with high standards and high quality.- ，，--，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on Xi's remarks at the tea party arranged by the CPPCC on Tuesday morning. The full text of this speech is published on Page 2. Xi said: 2024 was a critical year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Over the past year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, we have responded calmly and adopted comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development. Chinese-style modernization has taken new and solid steps forward. 2024--。，，、，，. Xi added that -the development process over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements are encouraging. The economic operation is generally stable, progressing with stability, high-quality development is advancing solidly, scientific and technological innovation has made important progress, new quality productive forces are developing steadily, and it is expected that the annual GDP growth will be around 5%, with grain production exceeding 1.4 trillion jin for the first time.Reform and opening up continues to deepen, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee was successfully held, making arrangements for further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. Risks in key areas have been resolved in an orderly and effective manner, people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and employment and prices have remained stable. The 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the National People's Congress, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland were solemnly celebrated, and the construction of democracy and the rule of law, the practice of ‘one country, two systems' and the great cause of national reunification have made steady progress. We deeply advanced major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. We solidly carried out Party discipline learning and education, and unswervingly improved conduct, enforced discipline, and fought corruption. These achievements have further strengthened our determination and confidence in advancing Chinese-style modernization.- ，。、，，，，5%，1.4。，，、。，，、。75、70、75、25，、--。。，。，. He then added: -2025 is the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan. We must adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, better coordinate development and security, implement more active and effective macroeconomic policies, promote the sustained recovery of the economy, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, and complete the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start of the 15th Five-Year Plan.- 2025--。，，，，，，，，，，，--，--. He called on the CPPCC to -adhere to the organic integration of the Party's leadership, the united front, and consultative democracy, focus on the central tasks and serve the overall situation…- He also warned that: -in the process of Chinese-style modernization, there will not only be clear skies and gentle breezes but also fierce storms and even turbulent waves. We must maintain strategic determination, gather the powerful joint force of all Chinese people to unite and struggle, break through winds and waves, march forward bravely, and continuously push forward the great cause of building a strong country and national rejuvenation!- 、、，、，，，，、、、。、！，，。，，、，、!

Xinhua reports: -Xi said that 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of China-Russia diplomatic relations, a new significant milestone in the bilateral relationship. In the extraordinary journey over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have grown more mature and stable, he said. In face of the accelerated transformation unseen in a century and a volatile international landscape, China and Russia always move forward hand in hand along the right path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party, Xi said. Over the past year, the two heads of state held three meetings in Beijing, Astana, and Kazan, and maintained communication through phone calls, exchanges of letters, and other means, Xi said, adding that they had candid exchanges of views and reached broad consensus on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of common concern. The political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have been advancing toward higher levels under the strategic guidance of the two leaders, he added. Practical cooperation in various fields has yielded tangible outcomes, such as the completion of the China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline, and the successful launch of the China-Russia Years of Culture has fostered a closer bond connecting the two peoples through generations, Xi said. China and Russia also support each other as chairs of the BRICS mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), contributing significantly to solidarity and cooperation among the Global South, he added.- -Noting that 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, Xi said that no matter how the international landscape evolves, China remains committed to deepening comprehensive reforms, advancing Chinese modernization, and promoting global peace and development. Xi also expressed confidence that China-Russia cooperation in various fields would continue to create new opportunities for growth. The Chinese president voiced readiness to maintain close exchanges with Putin and keep China-Russia cooperation on the right course so as to continue consolidating and deepening China-Russia ties featuring permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation, injecting strong momentum into the development and modernization of the two countries, and contributing to the well-being of the two peoples and safeguarding international fairness and justice.- Share Tracking People's Daily As per Xinhua, Putin said that -looking ahead to 2025, Putin said that he stands ready to maintain close communication with Xi to jointly promote the development of bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, and further strengthen coordination and cooperation on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, BRICS, the SCO and the G20. Such efforts, he noted, will not only fully serve the interests of the two peoples but also contribute to international and regional security and stability.- Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also exchanged greetings.

Xi's anti-Corruption Warning at Politburo's Democratic Life Meeting	Since 2015, the Politburo has been holding annual democratic life meetings at the end of the year. These meetings entail discussions on ideological and disciplinary issues, with senior Party members offering self-criticisms before Xi. Today's People's Daily's front page covers the report on this year's democratic life meeting. Xi's remarks about the need to prioritise -political cultivation,- for Politburo members to persist with lifelong learning, the seemingly endless nature of the anti-corruption campaign and the call for them to strengthen education of family members and surrounding staff are striking. It is quite a chilling message that is being sent to the Party elite about the sword that hangs above them. The report says that: From December 26 to 27, the Politburo held its annual democratic life meeting, deeply studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The meeting focussed on consolidating and deepening the results of the Party discipline education campaign and comprehensively exerting the restraint and guarantee incentive role of party discipline education. It also focussed on taking the study and implementation of disciplinary regulations and implementation of the eight-point central regulations as important content for inspection. It also combined ideological understanding with actual work performance to conduct self-examination and Party spirit analysis, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. 122627，，、，、，、，. Xi Jinping presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. But before detailing Xi's remarks, the report says: Before the meeting, relevant departments made careful preparations. Politburo comrades had heart-to-heart talks with relevant responsible comrades, listened to opinions and suggestions, and wrote speech outlines. The meeting first heard reports on the Politburo's implementation of the 8-point central regulation and on the work of reducing grassroots burden by rectifying formalism through the year. Politburo comrades spoke one by one, focusing on the meeting's theme, conducting thorough self-examination in light of the ‘Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Chinese Communist Party', ‘Several Regulations of the CCP Central Politburo on Strengthening and Maintaining the Central Party's Centralised Unified Leadership', and ‘Detailed Rules for the CPC Central Politburo's Implementation of the Central Eight-Point Regulations', seriously identifying problems, deeply analysing, being frank and open-minded, meeting with candour and sincerity, in a serious yet lively atmosphere, achieving the expected results. ，。，，。，20242024。，，《》、《》、《》，、，、，，. The report says that the speeches by Politburo members made five points: First, more firmly safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralised and unified leadership; Second, more firmly pursuing the value of serving and benefiting the people; Third, more firmly implementing the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee; Fourth, more firmly taking the lead in learning, knowing, understanding, and observing discipline; and Fifth, more firmly fulfilling the political responsibility of strict Party governance. ，5。；、；；；. The meeting stressed that since the beginning of this year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, the Party Central Committee has united and led the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country to calmly respond and adopt comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development, ensuring that Chinese-style modernisation advances through new and solid steps. People's livelihood security has been solid and effective, the overall social situation remains stable, new achievements have been made in promoting the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law, major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has created new situations, and comprehensive and strict governance of the Party has been deepened. These achievements are hard-won. ，，，，、，，。，，，，。. Politburo comrades unanimously believe that the centralised unified leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well, ensuring that the ship of Chinese-style modernisation breaks waves and maintains steady progress. The whole Party must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the two safeguards', and unswervingly implement the principles, policies and work arrangements of the Party Central Committee. Next year is the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan; it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, promote sustained economic recovery and improvement, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, unswervingly comprehensively and strictly govern the Party, and complete the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start of the 15th Five-Year Plan. ，，、。--，--、--、--，。--，，、，，，，，，，，，，，--，--. Following this, the report details Xi's remarks, who began commenting on the self-examination speech by each Politburo member, offering -specific requirements for each, and delivering a summary.- He then said that -this democratic life meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee was very effective, achieving the purpose of exchanging ideas, examining problems, and clarifying directions, which is conducive to the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee to enhance unity, improve work, and fulfil its mission.- 、，。，，、、，、、. Xi Jinping emphasised that this Party discipline study and education campaign had effectively solved some problems of Party members and cadres being indifferent, not understanding, and not mastering Party rules and discipline, promoted Party organizations and leadership groups at all levels to strictly manage Party discipline building, promoted the broad masses of Party members and cadres to consciously become loyal, clean, and responsible, achieving obvious results. The awareness of discipline and rules and the consciousness of integrity and self-discipline among the broad masses of Party members and cadres has been effectively enhanced, the endogenous motivation for taking responsibility and doing practical work has been further stimulated, the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere have been further strengthened, and the effectiveness of rectifying formalism to reduce grassroots burden has been further demonstrated. ，、、、，，、，。、、，、，、、，. Xi Jinping noted that cultivating a strong Party spirit will naturally lead to more conscious observance of Party discipline and rules. Leading cadres must treat cultivating Party spirit and enhancing ideological consciousness as lifelong pursuits, living to old age, learning to old age, cultivating to old age. Political cultivation should be the top when it comes to Party spirit cultivation, and Party spirit should be nourished through the Party's innovative theories, and take learning, observing, and implementing Party constitution, Party rules, and Party discipline as important content of Party spirit cultivation. Politburo comrades must adhere to strictly requiring themselves to measure up to the standards of Marxist politicians, take the lead in studying the Party's innovative theory, take the lead in implementing democratic centralism, take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, take the lead in strictly observing Party discipline and rules, take the lead in promoting the Party's fine traditions and work style, truly achieving ideological beliefs as firm as rock, absolute loyalty to the Party, and selfless dedication to the cause of the Party and people. ，、，。、，、、。，，。，，，，，，，，. Xi Jinping emphasised that Party discipline has both an educational and restraining function, as well as a guarantee and incentivising role. Party discipline and doing practical work are internally unified. Discipline not only clarifies the bottom line and boundaries that cannot be touched, but also provides a code of conduct for Party members and cadres to do things cleanly and boldly. If you abide by the rules and disciplines, you will have full freedom and broad space to do things and be entrepreneurial. Politburo comrades should set benchmarks and set examples. They should not only become models of abiding by discipline and rules and doing practical work, but also establishing clear orientation, supporting and encouraging those who dare to take responsibility, fostering a dynamic atmosphere of striving forward with determination and competing for progress. ，，。。，、、。，。、，、，，，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that Party discipline draws bottom lines and sets forbidden zones for correctly exercising power and preventing the abuse of power for personal gain, serving as a safety guardrail for Party members and cadres to maintain integrity and honesty. Revering discipline and observing discipline enables one to resist corrosion and be immune to all poisons. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption still exist, the anti-corruption struggle will always be ongoing. We must remain extremely clear-headed and resolute in the fight against corruption, and never slacken or hesitate. Politburo comrades shoulder heavy responsibilities and must be more strict with themselves and be extremely cautious with the power they command. It is necessary to focus on strengthening the Party work style and clean governance construction in the areas under one's supervision or regions under one's leadership, resolutely fight against various unhealthy trends and corruption phenomena, and strengthen the education and management of family members and surrounding staff. ，、、，、。、，、。，。、，，。，，。，，. Xi Jinping stressed that strictly enforcing and maintaining Party discipline is the common responsibility of the whole Party. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must assume the main responsibility, Party organisation secretaries must perform the duties of the first responsible person, and other members of the leading group must perform ‘one post, two responsibilities,' with each level leading the next, and ensure that the Party's discipline construction continuously achieves new results. Politburo comrades must earnestly shoulder the political responsibility for the Party's discipline construction, understand discipline construction situations in their supervising fields or governing localities in a timely and comprehensive manner, dare to manage and address problems within their scope of responsibilities with strict governance They have no choice but to be the leaders, executors, and dutifully serve as leaders, implementers, and promoters of strengthening Party discipline construction. ，，。（），，--，，。，，、，、、. Xi Jinping finally emphasised that next year's reform, development, and stability tasks are very heavy, leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots and masses, strengthen investigation and research, figure out the urgent difficulties and anxieties of the people, figure out prominent problems urgently needing solution at the grassroots level, and study to solve them in a targeted manner. ，，、，，，，.

Ideology Matters: My Review of Kevin Rudd's 'On Xi Jinping'	Welcome to Books and Ideas, a space dedicated to exploring thought-provoking concepts and writing. This section is designed as a platform for deeper dives into ideas that I encounter and engage with, whether they are China-specific or have broader significance. This section is also a personal challenge and commitment. By curating and sharing my perspectives on books from various genres, I aim to push myself toward a more disciplined and diverse reading habit. Perhaps, it's also a firewall against being numbed by the constant engagement with Chinese official discourse. My immediate goal is to read and review two books a month. Over the years, I have found that writing detailed reviews allows me to retain the key insights. They also become useful when I'd want to refer to some specific aspects of the argument that someone has made in the past. Finally, I would also like this is to become a collaborative space for conversations and ideas. So I welcome engagement, and if there is a book that you would like to recommend, please feel free to do so. Cheers, Manoj Kewalramani Over the past decade, policymakers, scholars, and analysts have been grappling with a particularly difficult puzzle amid China's emergence as a global power. Could the trajectory of China's rise have unfolded differently? Were there alternate pathways that Xi Jinping could have taken to ensure that the country kept growing economically and accumulating international influence, while maintaining the Communist Party's unrivalled control over political power and the military instrument? Furthermore, could such a path have minimised or even avoided the intensifying strategic competition with the United States—a competition that is likely to shape the future of the world order? Addressing these questions require deep consideration of individual and systemic motivations, impulses and constraints. Are the sweeping changes in policies—from the centralisation of power, intensified Party-state intervention in the economy and society, and assertive foreign and security policies—the product of Xi's ambition and ideological convictions? Or have they been a rational political response by a Leninist Party-state system to internal and external circumstances? This further leads to a deeper theoretical consideration: in a Leninist Party-state system, can one meaningfully distinguish between the leader and the structural logic of survival of the system? In other words, is Xi Jinping's emergence as a dominant and transformative figure a product of his peculiarities or an inherent design flaw of the Marxist-Leninist Party-state system? In his new book, On Xi Jinping How Xi's Marxist Nationalism is Shaping China and the World, Kevin Rudd essentially contends that it is the man that matters today. Rudd's argument is that China under Xi has witnessed the -unalloyed rebirth- of the -ideological man.- Xi, as per Rudd, is a -convicted Marxist-Leninist-, who is driving China's politics and policy towards what he envisions is the goal of national rejuvenation. Understanding his ideological positions and prescriptions for China are, therefore, essential. Or as Rudd, rather helpfully summarises: -Xi's ideological worldview offers us a unifying ‘red thread', providing a useful, albeit incomplete, illumination of the unfolding contours of Xi's plans for China and the world.- Essentially, he argues that in China today, ideology is -a real barometer of much deeper change.- That it -represents a new and significant driving force, which we ignore at our peril.- -Understanding Xi's ideational world a useful guide to understanding the ‘real world' of politics and public policy- within Zhongnanhai. Another reason why understanding ideological shift matters is because in the Chinese system, ideological messaging -sets the parameters within which a more granular, internal political and policy discourse can proceed.- The ideological framework that Rudd ascribes to Xi is one of ‘Marxist-Leninist Nationalism'. He argues that in his approach, Xi has moved China to a Marxist and Leninist left along with a Nationalistic right. In particular, he describes Xi Jinping Thought as follows: -It does not offer an alternative epistemology or methodology to that of classical Marxism-Leninism as interpreted through Mao Zedong's principal works on historical and dialectical materialism, contradiction, and practice. Indeed, Xi explicitly affirms these previous approaches but is critical of the party for not having rigorously applied classical Marxist methodologies to the contradictions confronting it under his immediate predecessors. As noted previously, where XJPT does differ significantly from the past is in its periodization of recent Chinese history, its redefinition of the party's principal contradiction, and its articulation of the party's more detailed policy challenges arising in this new era. Beyond these three major changes, however, XJPT does not offer the party a new, free-standing ideological system. Rather, XJPT is highly elastic, building on the ideological inheritance of Mao and Deng, albeit with a decidedly stronger preference for the methodological approach and many of the conceptual conclusions of the former. And, as with Mao Zedong Thought, XJPT can be moulded to meet the party's future political needs by legitimizing actions that Xi may need to take in response to as-yet-unknown policy pressures in the years that lie ahead.- At this point, it is useful to unpack some of the key concepts that help one understand the argument. The author does in the early chapters: Ideology: Rudd defines it as -a systematic body of ideas that provides an organization with a defined unity of purpose, giving rise to a program of action, irrespective of whether those actions arise as a direct or indirect consequence of that body of ideas.- Worldview: When exploring the concept of worldview, Rudd engages in a discussion on the distinction between pure and practical ideology. This is because -a world view may give the individual a certain outlook, but it does not indicate to him how he should act. Therefore, he distinguishes pure ideology from practical ideology. -Pure ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual a unified and conscious world view; practical ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual rational instruments for action…of practical ideology have no legitimation. But without practical ideology, an organization cannot transform its Weltanschauung into consistent action.- In his analysis, Rudd eventually brings these two concepts together: -China's ideological worldview should therefore be defined as the CCP's analytical methodology for understanding the world both at home and abroad and its conclusions about the changing nature of the world they face, including the range of strategic threats and opportunities they identify as a result of this analysis. It also includes their view on how the Chinese party and state should respond to these changing circumstances through political and policy action.- Let's now turn to some of the other concepts from the book. The Leninist Party: Rudd defines a Leninist party -as a political organization that applies the disciplines of historical and dialectical materialism, the theory of contradiction, and the targeting of political struggle, on the one hand, to the praxis of current, real-world circumstances, on the other. It therefore analyses where contradictions exist, whether they are major or minor, whether they are violent or non-violent, and what form of struggle is required in order to achieve resolution and progress. The Leninist party is also responsible for maintaining both ideological and organizational discipline within the party so that revolution at home and abroad can be achieved without internal political dissolution, or through deviation from the agreed ideological line. These form the core tenets of Chinese Leninism.- Left &amp; Right in CCP Context: This is an important explanation. -In CCP history, ‘left' and ‘right' as political labels have been shaped around several recurring, core issues within the party's debates over more than a century. Principal among these are: the scope of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the dangers of bourgeois liberalism and democracy; the primacy and permanency of class struggle; the centrality of the relations of production over the factors of production; the importance of equality and inequality; deep questions of the periodization of party history, including the primary stage of socialism; the socialist law of value; the socialist market economy; the relative roles of the party, the government, and the state; and the legitimacy of supporting world-wide revolution beyond China's borders. In other words, the ideological epithets of ‘left' and ‘right' are therefore not simply hollow phrases designed for prosecutorial purposes and devoid of substantive meaning. Indeed, throughout party history, they have been both tools of intra-party politics as well as means of expressing real-world ideational, political, and policy divergence.- The Leninist Left in his view, encompasses -reasserting the leader's power over the party's collective leadership, redeploying a Mao-like party rectification movement to restore party discipline, and reinforcing the dominant role of the party over the professional technocratic machinery of the Chinese state.- The Marxist Left: Rudd also identifies 7 essential feature of Chinese Marxism. Key among these is that Chinese Marxism is fundamentally -materialist rather than idealist,- and that its -machinery of change- -is dialectical materialism, based on the concept of the unity of opposites, the inter-permeation of phenomena, and the theory of contradiction.- He defines the shift to Marxist Left essentially in the context of the economy. Rudd argues that Xi has done so by -asserting the primacy of state planning over market forces, the state-owned enterprise sector over private firms, and greater income equality over rampant inequality.- Nationalistic Right: This refers to the changes in Chinese foreign and security policy. This, he argues, is reflected in increasing, top-down, nationalist campaigns about Chinese civilisational centrality, an enhanced grievance culture about the West's past occupation and continued containment of China, the prospect now for the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation', articulated by a new ‘wolf warrior' diplomacy legitimizing a more assertive and aggressive posture towards the world, all harnessed by a new, ideological assertion that China's time has now come with ‘the rise of the East, and the decline of the West'.- Importantly, Rudd contends that -Xi's nationalism is sui generis—it differs significantly from the forms of defensive nationalism often found in the Deng-Jiang-Hu era, but neither is it a simple reprise of Mao-type revolutionary nationalism. Although the nationalist component of Xi's overall ideological worldview is clearly driven by a number of revisionist ambitions from ‘the right', there is also evidence of a number of residual Marxist-Leninist concepts. These are further reinforced by certain classical Chinese ideations of the ‘Middle Kingdom', all combined in an eclectic vision of a form of future Chinese-led international order. In other words, Chinese nationalism under Xi is emerging as a composite of three inter-connected traditions. It evidences: a nationalist-revisionist core; a Marxist, historically determinist rationale concerning the inevitable collapse of the international capitalist order led by the United States; while also wrapping itself in the classical garmentry of universal Confucian values, Tianxia, and other forms of more ancient Sino-centrism.- Next, I'd like to highlight two key arguments from the book, which I found deeply thought-provoking. One of the most intriguing arguments in the book deals with changes in China's economic policy under Xi. Rudd argues that Xi believes that -the analytical paradigm of dialectical (and historical) materialism was important for China's ‘strategic thinking' across the board.- In other words, it is an essential tool to analyse and respond to the changes in China's internal and external environments. In discussing China's shifting policies, Rudd explains that it is not his view that Marxist-Leninist ideology or the instrument of dialectical materialism did not matter during the Deng-Jiang-Hu era. He says that it mattered -in terms of the party's ongoing claims to national political legitimacy in the eyes of its membership and the people- and -it mattered as a central medium for both internal party discourse and as a guide to substantive policy action by the Chinese state.- The key difference, however, was that Deng, Jiang, and Hu -remained ideologically disciplined in their respective levels of policy activism- for a variety of reasons. This is not the case with Xi, who is the first leader since Mao -to deliver speeches explicitly dedicated to Marxist analytical methodology.- Xi's policy activism is primary due to his assessment of the changes in China's domestic and external contradictions. In addition, something about the 2015-16 stock market crash also seemed to leave a deep impact on Xi. From the perspective of the economy, Rudd explains that the change in the understanding of China's principal contradiction at the 19th Party Congress in 2017 was incredibly important. He argues that Xi seems to have assessed that although China continues to remain in the primary stage of socialism, the progress made since the era of Reform and Opening up has brought it to towards latter phase of this stage. Discussing the concept of periodising development into different stages of socialism, Rudd explains: -The underlying ideological logic of this official periodization of China's development trajectory is that it determined the level of class inequality to be tolerated at each stage in order to raise the people's overall living standards. But, in Xi's logic, the ideological purpose of generating greater wealth was not to permit higher levels of inequality forever; it was to accelerate the overall economic development process towards higher levels of socialism. In the primary stage of socialism, higher levels of class inequality have been permitted in order to generate more rapid economic growth. However, as the party moved towards more advanced levels of socialism, that inequality must be moderated before being eliminated altogether under communism.- This requires purposeful action to correct the imbalances that decades of pro-market policies had generated. Xi's answer to this challenge is the New Development Concept, which Rudd says -represents his overarching ideological alternative to Deng's concept of ‘reform and opening'.- He adds: -It is designed for the ‘new era' that had been heralded by the ‘higher phase' of the primary stage of socialism that Xi believed China had now reached, as the country proceeded along its pre-ordained path—one that had been determined long ago by the ineluctable forces of historical materialism.- Interestingly, examining Xi's speeches, Rudd concludes that Xi seems to be suggesting that the -mid-century goal (2049 goal of modernisation) as the official benchmark for formally ending the primary stage of socialism-. It is within this context that Rudd also characterises Xi's drive for common prosperity, which the Chinese leader has classified as an essential aspect of Chinese-style modernisation. A direct consequence of this assessment is intensified intervention in the markets and the need to constrain and direct the growth of the private sector and wealth creation. Rudd is rather clear-eyed in his assessment of Xi's global ambitions. Examining Xi's speeches, he concludes that the Chinese leader views foreign policy and the shape of the international order within the context of his broader goal of national rejuvenation. In this context, he views competition with the US as an inevitable contest between national systems. He also appears to believe that in this regard, China's Party-state system enjoys superiority. This not only has implications for domestic policy and bilateral relationships with other countries but also for the future of the world order. Rudd argues: -Xi Jinping is signalling loudly and clearly through his expanding nationalist narrative that the time has come to take active measures to change the international status quo in a direction that is more compatible with Chinese national interests, values, and power. This includes consciously and actively reshaping the international rules-based order. It also means resolving outstanding challenges to China's perception of its territorial integrity.- He further writes that in Xi's view, going forward, -China's growing national power would be the fulcrum of the emerging international system; it would not be an international structure still underpinned by historical American power—or by some loose, power-sharing arrangement with others.- Rudd argues that Xi's vision for the world order is that -China should lead the building of this order, and that it should draw on its own reservoir of national wisdom in doing so.- This vision for order is encapsulated in the concept of the community of common destiny for mankind. -These propositions-, Rudd writes, -represent a major departure from Deng's underlying argument that Beijing should work within the framework and structures of the existing international order as a continued precondition for maximizing China's national economic development.- From Rudd's perspective, this is a product of a sense of new nationalism but also the outcome of Xi's assessment of the state of the world through the methodology of dialectical and historical materialism. He adds: -the central ideological construct of ‘struggle' unifies both Xi's domestic and international missions. Xi also refers to Marxist understandings of the ‘underlying trends' that warrant this new exercise in international institutional reform or ‘struggle', as an old, American-led order passes away and a new Chinese-led order comes into being.- On Xi Jinping is a truly compelling read. Rudd has waded through vast amounts of Xi Jinping's writings, official discourse and scholarly work distilling important insights for analysts and policymakers around the world. Indeed, we are in an era where tracking ideological discourse is critical to understand the long-term, strategic policy trends. However, ideological clarity from Xi Jinping does not necessarily imply rigidity in policymaking. In fact, at different points in the book, Rudd argues that Xi himself does not view Marxism as a rigid, dogmatic ideology. Furthermore, towards the latter part of the book, Rudd delves into Xi's discourse on strategy and tactics. Xi has argued that -strategy and tactics are powerful weapons for our party to lead the people to transform the world, change practice, and promote historical development. The correct application of strategy and tactics is the secret of our party's success in creating a glorious history…To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must pass on, apply, and develop this successful secret well.- The secret essentially implies persisting with strategic objectives while maintaining tactical flexibility because the -environmental conditions for implementing the strategy change at any time-. Of course, this proposition does not take into account the elephant in the room, i.e., there can always be a moment when tactical changes acquire critical mass thereby having a strategic effect. Anyway, while I am not going to detail it, Rudd's eventual prognosis for China and the world is not terribly optimistic. He believes that Xi is set to hold the reigns of power for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will continue to yield tumult and turbulence at home and abroad. Beyond this, as an analyst studying Chinese politics and policy-making and as someone who reads an unhealthy amount of official discourse, there are five practical lessons that I would like to draw from the book. First, while official language and discourse is often dull, repetitive and exhausting, it is important to go slow and take your time with it. Often the difference lies small changes in language or the use of certain adjectives and adverbs. These can be significant. Analysts tend to be most acutely aware of these changes when examining language related to monetary or fiscal policy, but even on ideological issues, it is important to not glaze over such changes. Second, ideological framing of policy shifts might take place after the fact but that does not render ideological discourse meaningless. It is still critical to continue deciphering the ideological casting of real-world policy changes because it sets the parameters for and can circumscribe the scope of action. More importantly, it sets the terms of debate for the future. This is because demonstrating ideological continuity even when breaking from the past is critical to the party's legitimacy. Therefore, understanding the codes of communication within the Marxist-Leninist system is critical for any analyst of China. Third, when engaging with the system's codes of communication, it is important to unpack how certain terms are understood within the Marxist ideological worldview. For instance, what does Xi mean when uses terms like modernisation, democratisation or common prosperity? What are the constituents of national rejuvenation, and what is its linkage with an emerging trend of global interventionism by China? This underscores the importance of work like The Decoding China Dictionary that the good folks at MERICS have put together. Fourth, analysing the use of banner terms is important. I have often been guilty of underplaying some of this in my assessments. For instance, I have seldom put as much stock in counting the number of references to terms like security or development in key speeches. But, after reading Rudd's book, I think it is worthwhile to take this into account far more than I have, particularly through the use of historical comparisons. In other words, changes in the number of times a concept is mentioned by Xi in comparison to his predecessors is useful. Likewise, increased references to a certain concept in speeches at recurring forums or changing prioritisation of tasks compared to the past can be useful markers of shifting objectives. It doesn't tell the whole story, but it is an important data point. Finally, everything has a purpose, and timing matters. This is perhaps one of the most significant analytical tools that I draw from Rudd's work. Editorial decisions taken by the Chinese media and theory ecosystem are not ad hoc, driven by market demands or conventional metrics of newsworthiness of a development. These are purposeful choices to communicate primarily to a domestic and, more narrowly, a party audience. It is, therefore, important to understand the timing and context within which a certain speech delivered or made public through Qiushi months or even years after it was delivered. Understanding the thought-process behind such communication and how it intervenes in or shapes ongoing debate on an issue is essential. One must also view this from the perspective of different stakeholders, i.e., officials, bureaucracies, cadres and private sector actors.

Analysis of India-China SRs Meeting	Hello everyone, Xi Jinping's in Macao marking the 25th anniversary of the region's return to China. Today's paper is essentially full of the coverage of that trip. If you are interested, Xi's speech at the dinner last night is available via Xinhua English. Alas, I am unable to do the full newsletter owing to personal commitments. And I am going to take a break till the end of the year, unless something really significant develops. For the moment, I am leaving you with a brief discussion I had last night with StratNews Global on the meeting between the Indian and Chinese special representatives on the boundary issue in Beijing. Hope this is useful for those watching India-China ties. Wish you all a very happy holiday season! Manoj Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

New Survey on India-China Relations - Xi Visits Sanya - Wang Yi on China's Global Outlook in 2025 - Li Qiang on Plan to Ease Law-enforcement Challenge...	Hi folks, In today's People's Daily, there is a brief report confirming that India and China will be holding a meeting of the Special Representative on the India-China boundary question in Beijing today. This is a key outcome from the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October. So I guess this is an opportune moment to share that last night, the Takshashila Institution released a new public opinion survey report on India-China ties. And not surprisingly, the report found that over half of Indians believe that the boundary issue is the biggest stressor between India and China. The report also has some rather counter-intuitive findings on issues related to trade, investment and skilled talent. But let me leave you with this bit, which I thought was rather interesting and perhaps said more about Indians' positive assessment of the system of multi-party democracy Cheers, Manoj Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 18, 2024. Page 1: The main report on the page is on Xi Jinping's visit to Sanya, where he heard work reports of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. Xi -affirmed the achievements made in Hainan's various work, and put forward clear requirements for the next step of work.- In his speech, Xi first called for efforts -to build a modern industrial system- with local characteristics and strengths. -Promote the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and promote the extension of industrial chains of leading industries such as tourism, modern services, high-tech, and tropical high-efficiency agriculture and to promote their optimization and upgrading. Actively align with the national strategic scientific and technological forces, strengthen international scientific and technological cooperation, build a more open talent attraction mechanism, create a multi-level scientific and technological innovation system, increase efforts to tackle core technologies, strengthen the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. Adhere to prioritising the environment and green development, strengthen the rectification of prominent environmental problems, and safeguard lush mountains, clear waters, and blue seas and skies. Promote the integrated development of industries such as culture, sports, tourism, and health care, and promote open cooperation in the tourism industry. Cultivate and expand new consumption and promote consumption transformation and upgrading.

Strengthen coordinated development with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and deepen cooperation with the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the Yangtze River Delta and other regions. Accelerate the implementation of the core policies of the Hainan Free Trade Port, carefully make all preparations, and ensure the smooth and orderly operation of customs clearance. ，。，。、、、、，，，、、。，--。，、。，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out the need to continuously enhance the civility of residents and the level of social civilization. Persistently use the Party's innovative theories to unite minds and forge souls, cultivate and promote socialist core values, extensively carry out mass activities for spiritual civilization building, and strive to achieve simultaneous improvements in material and spiritual civilization. Effectively protect, utilize, and inherit historical culture, revolutionary culture, marine culture, and folk culture resources, enhance cultural innovation and creativity, and develop and expand the cultural industry. Improve the public cultural service system in urban and rural areas, enrich the spiritual and cultural lives of urban and rural residents, and continue to promote the transformation of outdated customs and practices.- ，。，，，。、、、，，。，，. -Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to comprehensively improve the level of people's livelihood security and social governance. Strengthen the basic, universal and bottom-line/safety-net (、、) livelihood construction, improve the urban and rural public service system and social security system, and solve the urgent problems of the people. Enhance support for employment and entrepreneurship among key groups, and maintain overall employment stability. Coordinate the layout of urban and rural infrastructure and public services, and steadily advance urbanization. Improve the effectiveness of assistance for populations lifted out of poverty, and firmly prevent large-scale relapse into poverty. Coordinate development and security, improve the risk prevention and control system, strengthen disaster prevention, mitigation and relief capacity building, and enhance the ability to respond to major risks and challenges. Strengthen the urban and rural community governance system, normalize efforts to combat organized crime and eliminate evildoers, and punish all illegal activities according to law.- ，。、、，，。，。，。，。，，，。，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the Party's political building should guide all Party building work and promote the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party to a deeper level. Consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education campaign, promote the normalization and long-term effectiveness of Party discipline learning and education, continue to implement the spirit of the Central Committee's eight-point regulation to promote the transformation of work conduct, encourage the majority of cadres to continue to carry forward the special zone spirit of daring to explore, daring to be pioneers, and working hard with their heads down, and to establish and practice a correct view of political achievements. Unremittingly grasp the anti-corruption struggle and strive to eradicate the soil and conditions for the breeding of corruption. Strengthen the restraint and supervision of exercise of power, and educate and guide cadres to enhance their ability to resist and prevent corruption.- ，，。，，，、、，。，。，. He ended by talking about the need to implement the priorities from the CEWC and ensure social stability, food and energy supplies, etc, ahead of the New Year and Spring Festival. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the State Council study session, which discussed the need to strengthen enforcement procedures, improve methods and enhance supervision to boost the quality and effectiveness of administrative law enforcement. Professor Hu Jianmiao of the Central Party School was the guest speaker at the session. Li Qiang then spoke. He said -that administrative law enforcement is an important means for the government to perform its duties according to law and manage economic and social affairs, and promoting strict, standardised, impartial, and civilised law enforcement is a key aspect of building a law-based government. Currently, there are still instances of abuse of administrative discretion and unjust law enforcement in certain areas and localities. Efforts must begin with issues strongly raised by the public and businesses, further improving the benchmark system for administrative discretion and standardising the operation of power. To address the issue of incomplete benchmark coverage, it is necessary to promptly improve benchmarks for discretion in areas such as licensing, collection, enforcement, and inspection. To resolve the problem of unreasonable discretion ranges, the severity of violations by business entities and their capacity to bear penalties should be considered, and the principle of ‘proportionality of offence and punishment' should be followed to determine penalty limits. Regarding the issue of inconsistent local standards, coordination and guidance should be strengthened, and timely adjustments should be promoted.- ，、，。、。，，。，、、、。，，--。，，. -Li Qiang pointed out that next year will launch a special action to standardise law enforcement involving enterprises, continuously optimise the business environment, promote stable expectations and strengthen confidence. It is necessary to standardise the law enforcement procedures, fully implement the publicity of administrative law enforcement, the record of the whole process of law enforcement, and the legal review system of major law enforcement decisions, unblock the channels of appeal, and protect the appeal rights of those being supervised according to law. In improving enforcement methods, flexible measures can be applied to minor offences that involve no intent and pose limited social harm. Strengthen law enforcement supervision, pay attention to abnormal growth in fines and confiscations, a large number of off-site law enforcement (this is largely about issues of jurisdiction), and large-scale maximum penalties, review and verify relevant law enforcement behaviours, and correct any problems in a timely manner. Strengthen the use of information technology to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement supervision.- ，，，。，、、，，。，、、，。，、、，，。，. Li ended with the need to -safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the people and enterprises, and maintain a fair and competitive market order.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a brief report on Wang Yi's speech on China's diplomacy in 2024. The full English version of the speech is available on the Ministry's website. Let me highlight key excerpts. Wang began by talking about Xi Jinping's head of state diplomacy. He then said: -Over the past year, new breakthroughs have been made in building a community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village…In the course of 2024, China and Brazil have announced joint efforts to build a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as two emerging countries; China and Serbia have launched efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the first of its kind in China's relations with European countries. Globally, a growing number of countries have pitched in to build a community with a shared future. What's worth mentioning in particular is that Chinese and African leaders have agreed to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, giving expression to the shared desire of the 2.8 billion Chinese and Africans to pursue common development in greater solidarity. China has also made efforts to build communities with a shared future with particular regions, including with Central Asia, ASEAN, countries in the Lancang-Mekong river basin, Arab states, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. These efforts are opening up new vistas of harmonious coexistence between different civilizations…With the joint efforts of China and other countries, the notion of humanity sharing a common future has been written into multiple resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (U.N.) and multilateral documents, and the goal of building a community with a shared future has been established in various fields such as cybersecurity, climate change, and health. We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N., supported the U.N. in holding theSummit for the Future, and endeavored to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We have accelerated the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives. To date, 82 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, 119 countries and international organizations have given support to the Global Security Initiative, and the 78th U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China to establish an International Day of Dialogue among Civilizations. Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been established as the noble goal for practicing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.- -We have actively worked for the restoration of world peace and endeavored to save human lives. On the Ukraine crisis, we have always maintained an objective and impartial position, and actively pushed for peace talks. Over the past year, our special envoy conducted three rounds of shuttle diplomacy. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We also brought other Global South countries together to launch the group of ‘friends for peace' to gather consensus for finding a path to peace. The Gaza conflict has taken too many civilian lives. The immediate priority is a comprehensive ceasefire, the key is to ensure humanitarian assistance, and the fundamental way out is to realize the two-state solution. Over the past year, we have pushed for the adoption of the first resolution by the Security Council on a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitated the reconciliation dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration by various Palestinian factions, and delivered multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. We will continue to make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. We have mediated peace in northern Myanmar and facilitated multiple rounds of peace talks among conflicting parties. We have supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and realizing peace and reconstruction. We have also made consistent efforts to promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. Facing the dramatic change in Syria, China will continue to stand with the Syrian people and uphold the ‘Syrian-led and Syrian-owned' principle. China opposes the attempt of terrorist forces to exploit the situation to create chaos, and will help Syria maintain its sovereignty and restore stability.- He then talked about how Chinese modernisation has created opportunities for the world. Under this, he said that 155 countries had joined BRI. The next bit was on the Global South. Wang said: -The collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. China promoted new proposals and new developments of mechanisms and strengthened the force for unity and progress in the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations, so as to leave their mark on the progress of humanity. Building on its historic expansion last year and setting off this year from the new starting point of greater BRICS cooperation, BRICS is bringing more partners into its big family to make the platform a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations. Considering the reasonable concerns of developing countries, China promoted the adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building, proposed the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, worked with fellow Global South nations to jointly launch an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science with fellow Global South nations, and pushed for the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance at COP29. China called on developed countries to take concrete actions to earnestly fulfill their due responsibilities, provide sufficient financial support to developing countries, and uphold global climate justice. China has stayed committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and helped fellow developing countries move faster in rejuvenation. At FOCAC, China and Africa agreed on the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan for stronger cooperation between the two sides in the next three years, and agreed on ten partnership actions for modernization covering 10 key areas such as trade and investment, industrial chain cooperation and green development in an all-dimensional boost to Africa's development. China and Arab states saw significant early harvests from the ‘eight major cooperation initiatives' and went on to develop ‘five cooperation frameworks' in five dimensions: innovation, finance, energy, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchanges. China deepened the synergy of development strategies with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and continued to upgrade its cooperation with Pacific island countries.- Then Wang talked about specific relations. He cast this in terms of -all-round diplomacy, which has built up the trend toward a new type of international relations-. One of the goals for this is to build a -amicable and harmonious home in Asia-. He said that China-Russia ties had -grown more mature and stable, demonstrated in a clearer way its independence and resilience, and set an example of friendly exchanges between major countries and neighbors.- He added: -China-Russia relations are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party, and are not subject to interference or coercion from any external factor. Amid shifting global dynamics, China and Russia will maintain a high degree of strategic mutual trust, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard global strategic stability.- On Europe, he said: -Europe holds an important position in China's diplomatic agenda. A healthier and more stable China-Europe relationship serves the fundamental interests of both sides and the common aspiration of the world.- During engagements with European leaders, Xi -encouraged the European side to take a long-term and strategic perspective, see China as a partner and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to the benefit of both sides and the world at large. China and Europe are two great civilizations of the world and two major forces of the times. China stands ready to work with the European side to handle differences and disputes properly, seek win-win solutions, and jointly safeguard free trade and multilateralism.- This is the paragraph on India and Japan, which are clubbed together. -China is having more trust and less suspicion with major countries in this region. When meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping put forth important propositions on improving China-India relations, which received positive response from Prime Minister Modi. The two sides agreed to step up strategic communication, safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas, and strive to bring the bilateral relationship back to the track of stable development at an early date. China and Japan reaffirmed the commitment to promoting the China-Japan strategic relationship of mutual benefit in an all-round way, and to building a constructive and stable relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. In line with Japan's commitment on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water, China has recently started independent sampling and monitoring and will work with the international community to urge the Japanese side to earnestly fulfill its international obligations and responsibilities.- Share Tracking People's Daily Then there are two paragraphs dealing with the US. -There is a lot of interest in China-U.S. relations. How China and the United States get along concerns the well-being of the two peoples and also the future of the world. This year, we have followed the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, focused on implementing the San Francisco Vision, and worked to maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations. China and the United States held two rounds of strategic communication and five meetings of the Financial Working Group and the Economic Working Group respectively. The two sides advanced practical cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, law enforcement and climate change,extended the science and technology agreement, and co-signed each other's resolution on artificial intelligence at the U.N. General Assembly. Nearly 15,000 young Americans visited China through the initiative of ‘50,000 in five years', sowing the seeds of friendship between the two countries. Such progress has been widely welcomed by Chinese and Americans across the sectors as well as the international community at large. This fully shows that as long as China and the United States cooperate with each other, they can accomplish many great things together. In the meantime, China firmly safeguards its sovereignty, security and development interests, and firmly opposes the illegal and unreasonable suppression by the U.S. side. In particular, with regard to the U.S.' gross interference in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan, China has to make a firm and robust response to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests and safeguard the basic norms governing international relations. Last month, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden and sent a congratulatory message to President-Elect Trump, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-U.S. relationship at this critical juncture. President Xi Jinping summed up seven pieces of experience and inspiration based on a thorough account of bilateral exchanges in recent years, and drew four clear red lines that must not be challenged, namely, the Taiwan question, China's path and system, democracy and human rights, and China's development right. He stressed that China's goal of a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged; its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged; its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged; and its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remains unchanged. This is not only the authoritative interpretation of China's U.S. policy, but also our earnest expectation on future China-U.S. relationship. The fact that China has maintained its U.S. policy stable and consistent demonstrates its firm strategic resolve and broad-mindedness as a major country. We will engage in dialogue, manage differences, enhance mutual trust, remove misunderstandings and expand cooperation with the U.S. side, and work with the U.S. to explore the right way for our two major countries to get along with each other on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world.- Subscribe now Wang then made three points about China's diplomacy: First, China's diplomacy upholds Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy -as the fundamental guideline- and that -the Party's leadership is the most defining feature of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and our greatest political strength to overcome all risks and challenges.- Second, China's diplomacy is -people's diplomacy.- Third, -China's diplomacy is always about standing up for responsibilities-, i.e., -We have resolutely countered the attempt of using Taiwan to contain China and the myth of seeking U.S. support for ‘Taiwan independence', firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and effectively strengthened the international community's commitment to the one-China principle. We have taken justified and firm measures to safeguard China's rights against certain countries' provocations in the South China Sea, and worked with ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have refuted false narratives hyping up the so-called ‘human rights issues', set the record straight, and gained overwhelming support from over 100 countries for China's just position. More countries have come to realize that playing double standards will only disgrace oneself and interfering in others' internal affairs is ultimately unpopular.- Leave a comment He then made five points about China's diplomacy for 2025. Before doing so, this is how he assessed China's global standing. -China today is already a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to lead new endeavors, and greater moral appeal.- First, China will be a firm force for peace in a world of turbulence and conflicts. We hope the incoming U.S. administration will make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions, overcome obstacles, and achieve the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. We will deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and all-round practical cooperation with Russia, and work for steady progress in China-EU relations toward independence, mutual success and benefit to the world. Stability in China will provide a strong underpinning for global strategic stability, and certainty in China will help cushion uncertainties in other parts of the world. We will carry forward the Chinese way of settling hotspot issues and continue our constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and other hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar. Second, China will be a firm force for unity in the face of division and confrontation. We support the holding of the second China-Central Asia Summit, and will work for the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Protocol. We have properly handled differences and are working with India to find the right and bright path for big, neighboring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side. We will partner with Africa in implementing the ten partnership actions for modernization, expedite the building of ‘five cooperation frameworks' with Arab states, and use the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum as an opportunity to open a new chapter of cooperation. We will continue to pool the collective strength of the Global South through unity. Third, China will be a firm force for openness in the face of decoupling and severing supply chains. We will deliver on the eight major steps of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, advance both the major flagship projects and the ‘small and beautiful' livelihood programs, and create new space for win-win cooperation of higher quality, enhanced resilience and greater sustainability. We are determined to pursue higher-standard opening up, accelerate the development of the FTAAP, and safeguard the global free trade system as well as the stable and unimpeded functioning of the industrial and supply chains. We advocate a world economy that is cooperative, stable, open, innovative and eco-friendly, and we are ready to join hands with all countries on the path toward modernization. Fourth, China will be a firm force for justice in the face of the counter currents of unilateralism and bullying. We will hold solemn commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war, promote a correct view of history, uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We will effectively fulfill the role as the SCO rotating chair, support Brazil in hosting the BRICS summit and the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), support South Africa in hosting the G20 summit, and work for a more just and equitable international order. Fifth, China will be a firm force for inclusiveness in the face of ideological differences. We will promote the common values of humanity, deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries, join forces for the progress of human civilization, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship among people of different countries. We will step up experience-sharing on governance and development, tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and cement China's friendship with countries around the globe. We will expand two-way exchanges between the Chinese people and people elsewhere, and do our best to stage a successful Asian Winter Games to showcase a diverse China through the charm of ice and snow.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) foreign ministers' meeting. Xinhua reports: -Emphasizing that ensuring security, promoting development, pursuing cooperation and seeking win-win results are the urgent aspirations of the overwhelming majority of countries, Wang called on CICA to play a unique role in this regard, build an Asian community with a shared future and expand new space for win-win development. Wang called on CICA member countries to adhere to peaceful coexistence and seek common security; jointly advance Belt and Road cooperation to promote prosperity and development; respect diverse civilizations and promote exchanges and mutual learning; practice multilateralism and build a beautiful home together. Noting that Chinese modernization is a modernization that follows the path of peaceful development and brings more opportunities to Asian countries, Wang said that China stands ready to work with CICA member states to forge a new form of Asian civilization featuring win-win development through solidarity and coordination.- Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report with data from China's National Energy Administration.
