Cultivate a team of researchers with firm political positions, strong theoretical grounding, solid theoretical cultivation, and comprehensive quality for border governance studies. ，，。，。，、。，。、. Share Tracking People's Daily The other lead report on the page is on Xi's remarks when meeting with the heads of major international economic organizations, who were in Beijing to attend the ‘1+10' dialogue. Xinhua says: -Xi briefed the guests on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially the important measures recently adopted by China. He said that after more than 40 years of sustained and rapid development, the Chinese economy has ushered in a phase of high-quality development, contributing around 30 percent to the world economic growth. China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and continuing to play the role of the largest engine of world economic growth. China's development is open and inclusive. China will further opening-up to the outside world, proactively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and build a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for and share more development dividends with other countries, he said.- -Noting the progress in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) over the past decade, Xi welcomed international economic organizations to continue actively participating in the BRI cooperation and promote the modernization of all countries that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- Regarding global economic governance, Xi stressed that promoting world economic growth is inseparable from effective and proactive global economic governance. International economic organizations should keep pace with the times, respond to the call of the times and the expectations of the people of the world; they should actively participate in and promote the reform of the global economic governance system, build a more fair and reasonable global economic governance system, reflect the development and changes in the global economic structure, and increase the representation and voice of the Global South. All parties have already reached some consensus in this regard; the key is to turn the vision into reality. Regardless of how global economic governance is reformed, it must adhere to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and ensure equality of rights, opportunities, and rules for all countries. ，，，、。，，，，，。，。，，，、、. The on ties with the US, Xi said: -China is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with the U.S. government, and push bilateral relations forward in the direction of steady, healthy and sustainable development, Xi said, expressing the hope that the U.S. side will work with China in the same direction. ‘Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners,' he said. China will always focus on doing its own things well and resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests. At the same time, China's determination to promote high-level opening up will not change. ，、、，、、，。、、，。，、、。. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a very long feature article that says that as 2024 draws to a close -China's economy is entering a new and critical phase-, which will require critical decisions. It says that: -The road ahead is by no means smooth. Looking at the outside world, the international environment is more severe and complex, the global economic growth momentum is insufficient, and some countries continue to increase their containment and suppression of China. Looking inside, domestic effective demand is insufficient, economic performance shows divergences, there are still several risks and hidden dangers in key areas, and there are pains associated with the transition between old and new drivers of growth … At present, China is at a critical stage of accelerating the pace of transformation and upgrading, striving to advance high-quality development. It is at a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Critical periods require critical decisions. Facing various risks, challenges, and uncertainties, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has taken a comprehensive view and courageously taken on responsibilities, uniting and leading the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to tackle difficulties and forge ahead, steering the giant ship of China's economy fearlessly and bravely.- 。，，，。，，，，。-、，。-。，、，、。。，、，、，、. The first section of the article talks about the significance of the September 26 Politburo meeting. It says that the meeting sent -a strong signal to stabilize the overall economic development and continue the long-term positive trend.- It adds that -before and after this meeting, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the State Financial Regulatory Administration, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments released a package of incremental policies.- There's a detailing of some of the steps that have been announced since September. But the focus of this section is essentially Xi's leadership. The second section talks about the development of new quality productive forces. It says: -At present, the world is at a new stage where informatization fully drives innovation and serves as the foundation for reshaping a nation's core competitiveness. Whoever can better understand and grasp this trend, better adapt to and lead the direction of productivity development, will be able to comprehensively enhance their overall national strength.- ，、。，，. This section essentially reiterates the importance of transforming traditional industries, focussing on emerging industries, and building a modern industrial layout with a focus on technology, along with the agenda of green transformation. For instance, it says: -Green development is the underlying color of high-quality development, and the new quality of productivity itself is green productivity.- ，. The third section discusses the need to focus on livelihood issues. It acknowledges that: -At present, some local governments are facing financial difficulties, incidents of companies laying off workers and delaying wages are increasing, employment pressure is rising, and the task of improving people's well-being has become even more arduous and challenging.- ，，，，. The section also touches on the issues of demographics, food security, urbanisation, etc. The fourth and final section discusses opening up. The basic idea here is that reform and opening up is a -firm choice- that comes from the Party's and Xi's -scientific assessment-. At one point, the article also says: At present, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and transformations of the world, the times, and history are unfolding in unprecedented ways. A few countries are engaging in ‘decoupling and breaking chains' and building ‘small yards with high walls', while protectionism, unilateralism, and hegemonism continue to rise. The more we encounter countercurrents, the more we must actively embrace and promote economic globalization. At the crossroads of choices in this era, China consistently stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress.- ，，、、，----，、、。，。，，. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

During the same period, China's ODI accounted for 11.4% of the global total, while its share of international export markets remained stable at around 14%, which is no small feat. 2023，（FDI）2%、，8.7%。，11.4%，14%，. The essence of the global layout of enterprises is to achieve the best allocation of global resources. Going global to participate in global competition and cooperation is an inevitable choice for many Chinese enterprises to grow and develop. 。，. -For China's economy, Chinese enterprises pursuing a path of globalisation and leveraging the synergy between two markets and two types of resources contribute to China's economic transformation, upgrading, and high-quality development, thereby better serving the new development pattern. For the global economy, as Chinese enterprises ‘go global', their products, technologies, business models, and management expertise promote connectivity in trade, economics, and other fields. This helps stabilise global supply chains and inject new vitality into the world economy. The ‘going global' of Chinese enterprises makes the Chinese economy more closely interconnected with the global economy.- ，，、，，。，--，、、，，，。--，. The final section talks about the policy determination to facilitate Chinese enterprises to go global. It refers to several initiatives, including BRI, and says that the Third Plenum Decision has proposed to improve the system and mechanism for promoting and safeguarding outbound investment, improve the outbound investment management service system, and promote international cooperation in the industrial chain and supply chain. This bit is interesting: -At present, China is more actively connecting with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and steadily expanding institutional opening up such as rules, regulations, management, and standards. This requires Chinese companies to not only focus on building hard power, such as high-quality products and projects, but also to be more familiar with and master international common rules, respect the laws and regulations of the host country, strengthen compliance awareness, brand awareness, and corporate management, and lay a solid foundation for sustainable development.- ，，、、、。，、，、、，.

Hello everyone, Let me begin today by sharing that the applications for my Watching China course are now open. The course will run every Saturday from February 1, 2025 to March 1, 2025. All the details with regard to the curriculum, learning outcomes, admissions process and fees are available on this page. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any specific questions. Warmly, Manoj Kewalramani Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 09, 2024. Page 1: We have a report on the publication of a new book of Xi Jinping's discourses. This one deals with his remarks about upholding and improving the system of people's congresses. Xinhua says: -The book features a collection of 37 important works by Xi expounding on the theme between December 2012 and October 2024. Some of these works are made public for the first time. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has comprehensively strengthened the Party's leadership over the work of people's congresses and vigorously promoted whole-process people's democracy. Xi has integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture, systematically summarized the practical experience of the CPC in strengthening socialist democracy, continuously advanced theoretical and practical innovations of the system of people's congresses, and put forward a series of new thinking, new ideas and new requirements, thus providing the fundamental guidance for upholding, improving and running well the system of people's congresses.- Subscribe now Next, today marks the beginning of a new series on the Chinese economy. It says that the -overall economic operation is stable- and -high-quality development is being steadily promoted.- It says that -in the first three quarters, China's GDP grew by 4.8% year-on-year, laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual target. ‘China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and continuing to serve as the biggest driver of global economic growth'.- ，4.8%，。-，.- The first section of the article says that through this year -stability has been consolidated.- The key points made are: Although the growth rate has fluctuated through the year, it has remained near the expected target 10.49 million new jobs were created in urban areas across the country in the first three quarters. The employment situation is -generally stable.- Prices have risen -moderately- Balance of payments has been maintained In October, China's manufacturing PMI returned to expansion range, at 50.1%; and the consumer confidence index rebounded by 1.2 percentage points from the previous month, the first rebound after a continuous decline for 6 months. The annual railway passenger volume exceeded 4 billion people The annual express delivery business volume exceeded 150 billion pieces -Looking back, this year's economic achievements in China have not come easily. A series of existing policies and new measures have worked in synergy and delivered sustained results, helping the economy stabilise, and continue improving.- ，。、，、. Then the piece talks about the policy steps that have been taken. Among these, it says: -The issuance of new special bonds reached 3.9 trillion yuan; 10 trillion yuan in local debt resolution resources were added, forming a ‘combination punch' for debt resolution; starting September 27, the RRR was lowered by 0.5 percentage points, releasing approximately 1 trillion yuan in long-term liquidity ... With the effective implementation of proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies, positive factors are continuously increasing.- 3.9；10，--；9270.5，1……，. The piece mentions policies related to the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' goals, real estate policies, etc. The second section talks about the focus on technology and innovation. It says: In the first 10 months, investment in high-tech industries increased by 9.3% year-on-year, and the number of invention patents authorised was 889,000; in October, the added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.4% year-on-year. 10，9.3%，88.9；109.4%. The piece highlights some breakthroughs, such as the formal commercial operation of China's first self-developed F-class heavy-duty gas turbine. This happened in late November. It mentions the C919 aircraft being picked up by three airlines and Origin Wukong, China's third-generation superconducting quantum computer, going into operation. It adds: -In the first three quarters, listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D, up 3.9% year-on-year; by the end of October, the number of domestic valid invention patents reached 4.66 million ... R&amp;D investment increased, innovative achievements emerged, and industrial upgrading took solid steps. In 2024, China's global innovation ranking jumped to 11th place…- 1.10，3.9%；10，466……，，。2024，，. -A total of 4.141 million 5G base stations have been built, with over 15,000 ‘5G + Industrial Internet' projects, and more than 4,500 enterprises in the core artificial intelligence industry ... Efforts are accelerating in deploying new industries and new tracks such as the low-altitude economy, commercial space, and bio-manufacturing. Emerging industries are developing rapidly, and new drivers of growth are continuously accumulating.- 5G414.1，-5G+-1.5，4500……、、，，。 The final section talks about policies related to reform and opening up. Finally, there's a report informing that -as of 24:00 on December 6, 29.638 million consumers had purchased 45.85 million units of eight major categories of home appliances, driving sales of 201.97 billion yuan, with over 90% of the sales revenue coming from first-level energy-efficient products. Recently, various regions have actively promoted home appliance trade-in programs, with policy effects becoming increasingly evident. Nationwide, it took 79 days for trade-in sales to surpass 100 billion yuan, while the jump from 100 billion to 200 billion yuan took only 40 days, accelerating the release of consumption potential for upgrades.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 6: Today's Xinhua piece on the economy deals with the policy shifts in the property sector since the September 26 Politburo meeting. The first sentence says that -the housing issue is both a people's livelihood issue and a development issue.- ，. The article says that after the Politburo meeting, -multiple departments introduced policies to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, summarised as ‘Four Cancellations', ‘Four Reductions', and ‘Two Increases.' Many regions, especially first-tier cities, have actively adjusted and optimized related policies to help the market recover…Local governments have implemented city-specific measures to cancel or reduce restrictive policies, unlocking housing demand; tax policies have been optimized to lower transaction costs; land policies have been adjusted to control new supply and manage existing inventory, enhancing the ‘reservoir' function of land reserves; and financial support has been increased, injecting liquidity into the sector. How effective have these policy combinations been? Let's observe several key indicators.- The first indicator is sales data: -The latest data from the NBS shows that, from the sales situation of 40 key cities monitored, second-tier cities that previously had experienced larger declines earlier showed significant marginal improvement, with monthly sales area in October achieving positive growth, and the decline in sales volume narrowing significantly. From January to October, the nationwide newly-built commercial housing sales area year-on-year declined by 15.8%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.3 percentage points compared to January to September; newly-built commercial housing sales amount year-on-year declined by 20.9%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.8 percentage points compared to January to September. The online signing data of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development showed that in October, the online signing volume of newly-built commercial housing transactions in China increased by 0.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 15 consecutive months of decline; the total transaction volume of newly-built commercial housing and second-hand housing increased by 3.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 8 consecutive months of decline. 926，--，，------。，。，，----：，；，；，、，--；，--……--？。——，40，，10，。110，15.8%，191.3；20.9%，191.8。，10，0.9%，15；3.9%，8. The second indicator is that the number of visits to first-hand houses and the number of viewings of second-hand houses have increased significantly. The third indicator is market confidence. It says that -According to the PMI survey, the real estate business activity index in October rebounded by 2.5 percentage points from the previous month, and the market expectation index rebounded by 1.8 percentage points. This indicates that under the influence of various policies, the real estate market's prosperity has begun to recover.- PMI，102.5，1.8。，。 The section ends by quoting the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development as assessing that: -‘Overall, the comprehensive set of measures to promote the stabilisation of the real estate market has shown effectiveness, with positive changes appearing in the real estate market in October. As the policy effectiveness of various measures continues to be released, the momentum to drive real estate market stabilisation will strengthen' … ‘Under the effect of a series of policies, after three years of adjustment, China's real estate market has begun to bottom out'.- -，，10。，。--，，.- The second section argues that: -On the one hand, we should see that the package of policies has begun to take effect; on the other hand, we should also see that the bottoming out of the real estate market is a process that requires a combination of long-term and short-term measures, addressing symptoms and root causes.- First, we must ‘adapt to the new situation in which the supply and demand relationship of China's real estate market has undergone major changes'. This was a major judgment made by the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee on July 24, 2023. To understand the current real estate situation, we must first grasp this change. The supply and demand relationship is a key factor affecting market prices, which is one of the basic principles of economics. Over the past 20-plus years, China's real estate market has generally shown an upward trend, playing an important role in guaranteeing and improving people's livelihood and supporting China's economic and social development. At the same time, the rapid expansion of the real estate market also saw some issues such as excessive capital concentration in real estate, and some real estate enterprises exhibiting ‘high debt, high leverage, high turnover'. From the past, when supply fell short of demand, leading to a booming market and even price distortions, to recent years, where the main contradiction has shifted from total quantity shortage to basically balanced total quantity with structural supply insufficiency, the underlying logic of the real estate market has changed. (Note: My understanding of this is that there are enough units available in the market but these do not match with consumer demand requirements, either in type, quality or price, etc.) Therefore, to further stabilize and improve the real estate market, commercial housing construction must focus on ‘strictly controlling new supply, optimizing existing inventory, and improving quality'. From the perspective of existing stock, China's new commercial housing supply scale is large, and stock digestion is an important adjustment direction. At the policy level, it has been clearly stated that in cities with relatively large commercial housing inventory, the government can purchase as needed, actively supporting the acquisition of existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing. Currently, various regions are accelerating the process of acquiring existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing, and special bond support for reclaiming idle existing stock land and adding new land reserves is also being rapidly implemented. From the perspective of increments and quality, people's housing demand has transformed from focussing on whether one has or not to quality, and meeting this market demand is an important direction for adjusting increments and improving quality.- ，；，，、。，--。724。，。，。20，，、。，，，-、、-。，、，。，，-、、-. ，，。，，，。，，、。，----，. -Secondly, it is essential to repair the credit chain, rebuild market confidence, and promote a virtuous cycle between finance and real estate. Winning the battle to ensure housing delivery is the top priority among these. For some time, during the adjustment of the real estate market, some commercial housing projects that are under construction or have been pre-sold have faced difficulties in delivery due to funding and debt problems. This phenomenon not only seriously damages the rights and interests of home buyers, but also affects market confidence and hinders the orderly operation of the market. In response to this ‘pain point', the work of ensuring the delivery of houses has been steadily promoted, and the urban real estate financing coordination mechanism has been launched in a timely manner — incorporating compliant real estate projects into a ‘white list', ensuring all eligible projects receive loans, satisfying projects' reasonable financing needs. This has become an important measure and strong guarantee for achieving a virtuous cycle between financial and real estate and improving market expectations. At present, 297 cities at or above the prefecture level across the country have established a real estate project financing coordination mechanism. As of October 31, 2024, the amount of loans approved for ‘white list' projects exceeded 3 trillion yuan. By the end of the year, as the ‘white list' is expanded in an orderly manner, this scale will increase to 4 trillion yuan. The increase in the scale of credit indicates that the financing of real estate projects is picking up pace and becoming more convenient, and the continued advancement of guaranteed housing delivery is increasingly secure. As of November 13, 2024, the battle for guaranteed housing delivery has been vigorously promoted, and 2.85 million units have been delivered nationwide. This has not only protected the legitimate rights and interests of home buyers, but also effectively improved market expectations. In addition, it is necessary to release the potential demand of the market and further activate the real estate market from both the supply and demand sides. Based on the current main contradiction in the real estate market, in terms of supply structure, the supply of affordable housing is relatively insufficient, housing prices in large cities are high, and the housing burden of new citizens and youth is relatively heavy. In terms of housing demand, improved housing demand continues to upgrade, with residents' desire to enhance living quality becoming stronger. Therefore, by ‘four cancellations' and ‘four reductions' to lower purchasing costs and increasing affordable housing construction and urban village transformation will inject new demand into the real estate market. From the medium and long-term trend of the real estate market, there is still development space in meeting the rigid and improved housing needs. China is still in the middle to late stages of urbanization, and continuously promoting people-oriented new-type urbanization will release greater real estate market demand potential.- ，，，。。，，、，。，，。--，，——--，、，，、。，297。1031，--3。，--，4。，，。1113，，285，，。，，。，，，，、。，，。，----，，。，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The final section says that the earlier real estate sector -development model is no longer adapted to the new requirements of high-quality development-. It adds that -accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model is the fundamental solution for stable and healthy real estate market development. Better satisfying rigid and improved housing needs, perfecting real estate development, transaction and usage systems, establishing a new mechanism for coordinated linkage of the factors of ‘people, houses, land, and money' are important aspects of accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model.- ，。，、，-、、、-，. -Creating safe, comfortable, green, and intelligent houses has become an important path to meet people's beautiful life needs, and is also the rightful meaning of promoting high-quality development of the real estate industry. From supporting urban expansion to participating in urban renewal, from driving growth through new supply to linking new supply with existing stock... Real estate development must focus on the diversified housing needs of the people in the new development stage, addressing aspects such as outdoor environments, age-friendly design, and green low-carbon features, and promoting a comprehensive upgrade in the quality of housing construction. At present, the policy support scope for urban village renovation has expanded from only 35 major cities at the beginning to all cities at prefecture level and above. A total of 1,632 urban village renovation projects have been implemented in major cities. From January to October, 3.17 million sets of affordable housing and urban village renovation resettlement housing have been built and raised nationwide; by the end of this year, more than 10 million people in need can be helped to improve their housing conditions. Actively implementing urban renewal actions is an important measure to transform urban development methods and achieve high-quality development. Systematically promoting ‘four good' construction, i.e., construction of good houses, good neighborhoods, good communities, and good urban areas, is the focus of real estate industry's future development. The nation has implemented over 66,000 urban renewal projects, with cumulative investment of 2.6 trillion yuan. The comprehensive effectiveness brought by urban renewal actions is gradually emerging. In 2024, the plan was to begin renovation of 54,000 old urban residential areas; 53,000 of these have already started in the first 10 months. Coordinated linkage and preventing dramatic fluctuations are key to achieving stable, healthy, and high-quality real estate market development.- 20，，。、、、，，。，……，、、，。，35。1632。110，317（）；，1000。，、。、、、--，。6.6，2.6，。2024，5.4，105.3. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Ding Duo, deputy director of the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy, the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. Ding's basic argument is that -the Philippines' violations of China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, as well as other practices that deviate from the track of resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation and maliciously escalate the situation, violate international law, including the UN Charter, go against the spirit of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea and the region.- The specific things that he points to are: -Instigated by extra-regional countries, the current Philippine government has frequently infringed, provoked and created trouble at at Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal), Ren'ai Reef (Second Thomas Shoal), Xianbin Reef (Sabina Shoal), Tiexian Reef (Sandy Cay) and other places, hyping the so-called illegal arbitration ruling of the South China Sea case in the international public opinion arena, disguising itself as a victim to deceive the world. Such manipulation cannot change the mainstream perception of the South China Sea issue within the international community, nor can it change China's firm will to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.- ，、、、、，，。，. Ding ends with this: -For a long time, China has resolutely safeguarded its legitimate rights and interests in the South China Sea, firmly maintained peace and stability in the South China Sea, and insisted on resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation. China's claims and position will not change due to fluctuations in the maritime situation, and China's determination and will will not be shaken by external interference. The Philippine side should abandon any baseless, unreasonable, and unhelpful fantasies, and work with China to seek a stable and long-term solution to the South China Sea issue.- ，，，。，。、、，，. Finally, there's a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the developments in Syria. It said: -China is closely following the situation in Syria and hopes that stability will return as soon as possible. The Chinese government has been actively helping Chinese nationals who wish to leave the country to do so in a safe and orderly way, and staying in contact with those Chinese still in Syria and offering them advice on how to stay safe. We urge relevant parties in Syria to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria. The Chinese Embassy is still up and running and carrying out its duty in Syria.

This shouldn't take more than 5 minutes of your time. You can take the survey by clicking here. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, December 06, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's inspection of the Information Support Force of the PLA on Wednesday. Zhang Youxia, He Weidong, Liu Zhenli, and Zhang Shengmin were present for this. Xi emphasized that -it is necessary to implement the thought of strengthening the army in the new era, implement the new era's military strategic guidelines, strengthen mission responsibility, bravely innovate and break through, consolidate the foundation of the military, strive to build a powerful modern information support force, and realize the leapfrog development of the Chinese military's network information system.- ，，，，，，，. The report says: -Xi Jinping listened to the work report of the Information Support Force and delivered an important speech. He pointed out that currently, a new round of technological revolution and military revolution is developing rapidly, war forms are accelerating their evolution, and the position and role of network information systems in modern warfare are unprecedented. The Information Support Force is first and foremost a combat force. It must stand at the height of strengthening the military and being victorious in war, fully recognize the extreme importance of network information system construction, understand the historical mission it bears, and rapidly advance the construction of network information systems and service support capabilities for the military's combat readiness.- ，，。，，，，。，，，，. -Xi Jinping emphasized that it is necessary to persist in emancipating thinking, seeking truth from facts, keeping up with the times, strengthen overall planning, innovate development models, actively explore and practice, and solidly carry out various network information system construction tasks. It is necessary to focus on being able to fight and win wars, optimize information service guarantee methods, steadily promote the construction of network information public service platforms, integrate and make good use of various types of data and information, attach great importance to network information security protection, quickly integrate into the system, drive the system, and empower the system, and lead innovations in command models and transformations of combat methods. It is necessary to continuously promote the implementation of reform tasks, establish and improve work operation mechanisms, improve relevant laws and regulations, create a good ecology of co-construction and sharing, and improve the quality and efficiency of network information system construction.- ，、、，，，，。、，，，，，、、，、。，，，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the Information Support Force is currently in its initial creation period and must comprehensively strengthen self-construction, pay attention to laying foundations and planning for the long term, and solidify the developmental roots of the force. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Military Commission's Political Work Conference, uphold the fundamental principle and system of the Party's absolute leadership over the military, strengthen its arming with the Party's innovative theories, focus on deepening ideological rectification at the root of thought, strictly maintain political discipline and combat corruption, and ensure the force remains absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable. The first Party Committee of the Information Support Force must strengthen the sense of entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit, take on their first responsibilities, select and strengthen Party committees at all levels, build strong front-line command posts and front-line combat fortresses, and improve the leadership, organizational, and executive capabilities of Party organizations. It is necessary to implement the whole-chain construction concept, innovate talent cultivation models, and build a high-quality professional network information talent formation. It is necessary to adhere to precise construction, strengthen scientific management, focus on classified guidance, solidly promote grassroots construction, and maintain the force's normal order and stability.- ，，，、，。，，，，，、、。，，，，、、。，，。，，，，. Xi Jinping finally emphasized that the CMC should strengthen overall coordination, the relevant departments of the Commission should take the initiative to provide guidance, and all units should actively cooperate to jointly build the Information Support Force and create a new situation in the construction of the military's network information system. ，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory letter to Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on her election as president of Namibia. Xinhua reports: -Noting that China and Namibia enjoy a long-standing traditional friendship, Xi said that in recent years, the two countries have strengthened their political mutual trust, achieved fruitful outcomes in practical cooperation, and firmly supported each other on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns. Also in the message, Xi said that he highly regards the development of China-Namibia relations, and stands ready to work with Nandi-Ndaitwah to take the implementation of the outcomes of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit as an opportunity to carry forward the traditional friendship, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples.- Third, there's a report on Wang Huning meeting a Vietnamese delegation led by Nguyen Xuan Thang, a member of the Politburo of the CPV Central Committee, president of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics and chairman of the Central Theoretical Council. Xinhua reports: Wang said that -China will work with Vietnam to follow through on the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties, said Wang, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC National Committee is willing to maintain close communication and cooperation with the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Wang said. The CPV hopes to continuously learn from the CPC experience in national governance, strengthen the overall leadership of the party, and improve Vietnam's socialist development system, head of the delegation Nguyen Xuan Thang said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, there's a report on Han Zheng meeting with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.

Rodriguez said that Venezuela firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports the series of major initiatives put forward by China and is willing to learn from China's successful experience in governance. Moreover, the country aims to strengthen bilateral cooperation and multilateral coordination, oppose unilateral illegal sanctions, and safeguard national security and development, as well as international fairness and justice.- Subscribe now Fifth, there's another commentary drawing from Xi's speech on BRI. It says: -In October 2023, President Xi Jinping announced eight action items at the Third BRI Forum, indicating that the joint construction of BRI has entered a new stage of high-quality development. This new stage of high-quality development is a new stage of three-dimensional connectivity across the Eurasian continent, led by the Green Silk Road, and empowered by the Digital Silk Road, marking a new starting point for China and all parties to make unremitting efforts to achieve modernization for countries worldwide, demonstrating the broad-minded approach of seeking progress for humanity, pursuing great harmony for the world, and showcasing the great power responsibility of having a global perspective and leading the era.- 202310，--，--。、、，，、、. General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly elaborated on the overall requirements, guiding principles, practical paths, and key work for high-quality joint construction of BRI, providing important guidance and pointing out the direction for promoting high-quality development in the new stage. We must deeply recognise that seeking progress while maintaining stability is an important principle of our Party's governance. The more complex the international situation becomes, the more we must adhere to the work guideline of seeking progress while maintaining stability, steadily and cautiously advance project construction, and gradually expand new areas of cooperation. Adhering to consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, openness, greenness, integrity, high standards, and benefiting people's livelihoods in a sustainable way; these are the guiding principles for the high-quality joint construction of BRI. We must actively advocate the concept of win-win cooperation and a correct view of righteousness and gain, uphold the essence of openness, the foundation of greenness, and the highlight of integrity, seek the points of intersection of interests and the greatest common divisor of cooperation, and continuously expand new spaces for win-win cooperation and development.- --、、、，--、。，。，，、，。、、，--。，、、，，. -The joint construction of BRI is a long-term, cross-border, and systemic global project; a century-long project. Looking toward the future, it is necessary to be guided by the eight action items for high-quality joint construction of BRI, take interconnectivity as the main line, combine high-quality development with high-level security, government guidance with market operations, scientific layout with dynamic optimisation, and quantitative growth with quality improvement coordinate the deepening of infrastructure ‘hard connectivity', the ‘soft connectivity' of rules and standards, and ‘heart connectivity' through people-to-people linkages across partner countries, coordinate the promotion of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects, and coordinate the consolidation of cooperation in traditional fields and steady expansion of cooperation in emerging fields. Only then can we promote the joint construction of BRI to continuously advance along the direction of high-quality development.- --，、、、。，--，，、、、，--、----，--，，--. The final bit calls for mechanism or institutional construction. -At the symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a systematic deployment for promoting high-quality joint construction of the BRI mechanism, clearly defining the major requirements for improving the ‘nine mechanisms'. All regions, departments, and units must raise their political standing, focus on implementation and execution, continuously strengthen strategic thinking, security awareness, systemic perspective, and international vision, put more effort into coordination and achieve results practically. It is necessary to focus on advancing systematization and institutionalization, continuously improve top-level design, formulate practical measures, deepen external cooperation, and promote the steady and long-term advancement of high-quality joint construction of BRI.- 、、。，--。，--，--。、，、、、，--，--。，，，，--。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guideline on promoting the construction of new urban infrastructure and building resilient cities is published today. I am not detailing the entire document. Xinhua summarises it as follows: -By 2027, significant progress should have been made in the construction of new-type urban infrastructure, providing ever-increasing support for the development of resilient cities, while a number of experiences and practices that can be copied and expanded should have been established. By 2030, the construction of new-type urban infrastructure should have achieved remarkable results, to help push forward the building of a group of high-level resilient cities, improve urban safety and resilience, and ensure safer, more orderly, smarter and more efficient urban operations. To achieve these aims, major tasks must be fulfilled in 11 aspects, including implementing the building and upgrading of intelligent municipal infrastructure, promoting the coordinated development of smart city infrastructure and intelligent connected vehicles, and developing smart residential quarters, according to the guideline. In addition, there are other important tasks such as raising the intelligence level of housing and building management, carrying out digital home construction, improving city information modeling platforms, and maintaining cyber and data security.- Subscribe now Page 2: Just one report to note. It says that so far, 700 billion yuan of ultra-long-term special government bonds have been issued for the -two heavy- projects, i.e., projects related to major national strategies and those to build up security capacity in key areas. This allocation was done in three batches. Another 300 billion yuan has been allocated to increase support for the ‘two new' work, i.e., large-scale equipment renewal and consumer goods replacement. In all, 1 trillion yuan worth of bonds have been issued so far. ，--7000，3000--，，1. -The ‘two heavy' construction projects focus on supporting the development of railways, trunk highways, and airport construction along the Yangtze River, the construction of the new western land-sea corridor, high-standard farmland construction in the black soil region of Northeast China, the ‘Three-North' project, the public service system for the urbanization of agricultural migrant populations, and the upgrading of higher education quality, among other areas.- --、、，，，--，，. Subscribe now Page 3: China's Minister of National Defense Dong Jun made his first public appearance after the recent rumours about a corruption probe against him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had dismissed those rumours earlier. But then CMC member Admiral Miao Hua was officially removed, and that fuelled further speculation about Dong's fate. So this appearance is a statement of sorts. In the past few weeks, I have had a fair few people ask me what I made of the FT report on Dong and whether he was being probed. It is in such moments that China watchers must look to deeper truths, such as those in poetry. So here's the amateur poetic take that I offered for such questions: Kuch baaten hum hum tab jaan paate hai, jab hum unhe jaan paate hai; tab tak kuch afwah, kuch shikwah, aur kabhi umeed ke beech jeete hai hum Or the English version, which sounds less poetic to me at least: Some things we can only know, when we really know them; until then, we exist in a mist of rumours, grievances, and sometimes, hope. Anyway, back to the report. So Dong Jun met with the heads of delegations from various countries attending the Second Seminar on the Security Situation in the Gulf of Guinea in Shanghai on Thursday. He said that China is willing to work with the armed forces of regional countries to share the responsibility of maintaining security in the Gulf of Guinea. Xinhua reports: -Hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, the seminar brought together maritime armed force leaders and defense attachés from 18 nations, including Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. During the meeting, Dong also called for efforts to promote systematic maritime cooperation, carry forward the traditional friendship with regional countries, and contribute to the building of an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Beijing. Xinhua reports: He said that -China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China … He said China is further deepening the reform of its financial system and steadily expanding the institutional opening up of the financial sector, providing greater convenience for foreign enterprises operating in the country. China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including BlackRock, to invest and do business in China, sharing China's development opportunities, the vice premier said. Fink said that BlackRock is optimistic about the prospects of the development of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to continue to deepen its engagement with the Chinese market and contribute to U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. Xinhua reports: -Zhang emphasized that Iran holds significant regional and international influence and is a key comprehensive strategic partner for China. He highlighted the successful meeting between the presidents of both countries at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, in October, during which they provided top-level guidance for strengthening China-Iran relations. Zhang reiterated China's firm support for Iran in safeguarding its sovereignty, security, territorial integrity, and legitimate rights, expressing Beijing's readiness to implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders and to promote the stable and long-term growth of China-Iran relations. Pezeshkian, in turn, asked Zhang to convey his sincere regards to the Chinese president. He underscored Iran's strong commitment to developing its relations with China, highlighting the strategic importance of bilateral ties. Pezeshkian reaffirmed Iran's readiness to continue mutual support, deepen practical cooperation, and promote further growth in the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Also on Wednesday, Zhang held talks with Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref. The two officials engaged in in-depth discussions on implementing the China-Iran comprehensive cooperation plan.- Although it is not in the paper today, for folks tracking India-China relations, do note that ILD chief Liu Jianchao -met with a delegation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) cadres led by Rama Krushna Panda, a national secretariat member of the CPI, in Beijing on Thursday. Both sides agreed on the necessity of delivering on the latest important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, of strengthening party-to-party exchanges and dialogues, of managing differences properly, and of promoting the improvement and development of China-India relations.- Subscribe now Page 5: Today's Xinhua article on the economy deals with the difficulties being encountered by enterprises. The first bit talks about challenges on the demand and supply side. It says: From a demand point of view, -some business leaders say that competition over ‘quantity' is becoming increasingly fierce, and every day when they open their eyes, they think about how to retain customers. Meanwhile, some companies report that the contest over ‘quality' is becoming more pronounced. With consumer demand growing increasingly diverse and personalized, if they cannot adapt to changes, they risk being replaced ‘at any moment'.- 、，。，--，。，--，、，，--. From the supply side perspective, the article claims: -In-depth analysis reveals that the various difficulties currently faced by enterprises are related to the broader economic development environment: Insufficient domestic effective demand. During the structural adjustment process, on the investment side, fixed asset investment growth has been below expectations; on the consumption side, the total retail sales of consumer goods are in a recovery phase. These factors all impact the sales of enterprise goods and services. Industrial upgrading continues to advance, and the squeeze from new and old momentum conversion is inevitable. On one hand, the development of emerging industries creates certain impacts and substitutions for traditional industries, with the market scale of some traditional industries shrinking; on the other hand, technological changes are accelerating, with time and opportunities waiting for no one. These factors place enterprises both in the midst of adjustment pains and compel them to race towards innovation. Global economic recovery is weak, global trade protectionism is intensifying, and uncertainty and instability are increasing. Some industries are experiencing cyclical fluctuations, and some enterprises have not yet adapted to changes in market and industrial development. These difficulties arise from both external pressures and internal challenges, involving environmental factors and enterprise-specific reasons. They are the result of multiple complex factors and are also the inevitable test that our country's economy must directly face while climbing over obstacles and moving towards high-quality development. ，，：。，，；，。。，。，，；，，、。，。、、。，。，，，，、. Subscribe now Do note that there is no comment or analysis about the Chinese government's policies and their impact on the economic environment. Anyway, the second section offers advice and a bit of a pep talk to enterprises. -The market is found, not waited for. When facing problems in the market, seek answers from the market. Recently, some changes are intriguing: The steel industry has been under short-term pressure, but by focusing on new ‘steel' demand through electric vehicles, high added-value product sales have been robust; the laptop market is approaching saturation, but market segments like gaming laptops and ultra-thin laptops targeting personalised needs have shown significant growth; large-scale performances have driven cultural tourism, with online e-commerce transactions in tourism, sightseeing, and entertainment services increasing by 15.3% year-on-year in the first three quarters...these emerging growth points in niche sectors are precisely the new business opportunities that enterprises have captured by recognizing change, responding to change, and seeking change. Exploring broader markets. In the first 10 months, China's private enterprises' exports increased by 9.3% year-on-year, new energy vehicle exports grew by 6.3%, and mechanical and electrical product exports increased by 8.5% ... behind these numbers are Chinese enterprises going out and battling waves in the international market. Competition is always intense, and difficulties will always exist. What determines an enterprise's development prospects is not the number of difficulties, but the perspective on difficulties, the methods of addressing difficulties, and the determination to resolve difficulties.- ，。，。，：，--，；，、；，15.3%……，、、，。。10，9.3%，6.3%，8.5%……，，。，。，，、、. The other piece of advice is to focus on innovation. Some useful data here is that -in the first three quarters, China's listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D. The R&amp;D intensity of companies on the ChiNext Board, the STAR Market, and the Beijing Stock Exchange was 4.74%, 9.94%, and 4.73%, respectively, indicating strengthened innovation efforts. In the first three quarters, 6.191 million new private enterprises were established nationwide, with 40% of them belonging to the ‘four new' economy, signifying an expansion in business fields.- ，1.10。、、4.74%、9.94%、4.73%，。，619.1，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The third and final section deals with the policy steps that have been taken to support enterprise. It says that steps have been taken to Effectively reduce the burden on enterprises: establish a coordination mechanism to support the financing of small and micro enterprises, promote the further reduction of the comprehensive financing costs of enterprises, maintain policies such as the tax deduction of R&amp;D expenses, and introduce a series of measures to effectively reduce the logistics costs of the whole society. Strictly regulate law enforcement supervision: improve the legal system and judicial mechanism for clearing enterprise account arrears, establish a cross-regional administrative law enforcement assistance system, improve a normalized mechanism for collecting problem clues, resolutely correct and seriously hold accountable behaviours of arbitrary fee collection, arbitrary fines, and arbitrary levies Precisely support enterprise development: multiple departments have established normalised communication mechanisms with enterprises, a new round of support policies for specialised, refined, and innovative enterprises has been launched, support has been provided to over 1,000 key Little Giant enterprises through central funds. ，，，，；，，，，、；，，，1000--. It also mentions policy support around the two heavy projects and two new work, the work related to the draft law on promoting the private economy, guidelines to support foreign trade and the building of a unified national market. The article adds: -At present, the effects of the policy changes are being released, and the trend of market recovery and stabilizing positive expectations is becoming more obvious. In the first three quarters, the main policies supporting scientific and technological innovation and manufacturing development in the current policies were tax reduction, fee reduction and tax rebate exceeding 2 trillion yuan. In October, nationwide enterprise sales revenue increased year-on-year, rising 1.3 percentage points month-on-month; the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 50.1%, returning to the expansion zone for the first time since May this year; the Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index has remained stable around 50% for several consecutive months; and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Index rose 0.3 points from September, the largest increase this year. Although current difficulties are still numerous, the confidence of economic entities is recovering, and more and more enterprises are moving forward more resolutely.- ，，、。，2。10，，1.3；PMI50.1%，5；50%；90.3，。，，. The piece ends by saying that the -Chinese economy is resilient, has great potential, and is full of vitality-. Its -long-term positive fundamentals will not change.- It also praises Chinese entrepreneurs as -courageous, visionary, brave in innovation, and exceling at taking action…- 、、、，. (My Note: It is noteworthy that the nationalism rhetoric seems to have taken a bit of a back seat when discussing economic issues. This article is an example of that. It argues that the current challenges are a product of several factors, including just something inherent to the stage of development that China is in. It does refer to the external environment as a factor but there's no nationalistic rabble-rousing. I also find it striking that patriotism is not one of the qualities that the authors mention when discussing entrepreneurs; a few years ago, patriotism was the rage.) Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Bobby M. Tuazon, Director for Policy Studies of a Philippine think tank, Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG). He basically says that the Philippines government has adopted a -confrontational and reckless- approach with regard to China on the South China Sea issue. These actions -undermine ASEAN unity, damage its own reputation, and weaken its policy autonomy.- He writes- -The changes in the Philippine government's foreign policy are mainly reflected in three aspects. First, it has abandoned its earlier relatively pragmatic position, ignored China's concerns, and actively moved closer to the United States militarily, offering four more military bases to the United States in the northern Philippines near Taiwan and sensitive areas near the South China Sea. Although the Philippines claims this is -not targeting any third country,- it clearly aims to join the US' so-called ‘defense alliance', raising concerns among regional countries. Second, regardless of the content of the ‘Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' such as -the directly concerned sovereign states shall resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means through friendly consultations and negotiations without resorting to force or the threat of force', it promoted its wrong stance on the South China Sea at the Shangri-La Dialogue and on other occasions, distorted and exaggerated the situation at sea, and held a series of military exercises with the United States and other extra-regional forces, posing challenges to regional peace and tranquility. Third, it has not fully adhered to or has even obscured the 2016 consensus reached between China and the Philippines. Instead, it has leaned toward seeking US ‘assistance', weakening the dialogue mechanisms established between China and the Philippines to peacefully resolve maritime disputes.- 。，，，4。--，--，。-，，-《》，，，，。2016。--，. He further warns: -The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining ASEAN unity. Military adventurism is a dangerous attempt by the US to maintain its global hegemony. The Philippines, disregarding the common interests of regional countries, insisted on establishing a dangerous ‘alliance' with the US, which is more than 10,000 km away from its homeland. This violates the common desire of ASEAN countries to pursue regional peace, security and stability. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining its own reputation. The Philippines has ignored the historical facts that the Chinese people began to sail and engage in production activities in the South China Sea more than 2,000 years ago, and that China was the first to discover, name and develop and utilize the South China Sea islands and related waters. It has continued to escalate tensions and claim so-called ‘Chinese aggression', which has not only affected the peaceful dialogue between the Philippines and China, a major trading partner, but also impacted the credibility of the Philippine government. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining the Philippines' policy autonomy. The Philippines has provided support for the US geostrategy, helped the US military carry out so-called ‘freedom of navigation' operations in the South China Sea, opened additional military bases for the US, allowed the US military to deploy medium-range missiles in the Philippines, and blindly devoted itself to building the so-called ‘US-Japan-Philippines alliance', gradually exacerbating regional tensions and putting the Philippines at risk of becoming a US ‘tool of war'.- ，。。，1--，、。，。2000，、，--，，。，。，--，，，--，，--.

PD Commentary on BRI Warns of 'Empty Promises' & 'Unrealistic Expectations' - China-Japan Ties - He Lifeng Meets Goldman Sachs COO - Xinhua Series on ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, December 05, 2024. Page 1: There's another BRI-related commentary on the page today. It reiterates Xi's call to maintain -strategic determination- because -opportunities outweigh the challenges.- It says that Xi's speech provided -important ideological guidance and strategic leadership for overcoming various risks and challenges and promoting the steady and long-term development of the high-quality joint construction of BRI.- This bit below in the commentary is worth noting. -General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ‘to promote the high-quality development of BRI, it is essential to appropriately address various risks and challenges and effectively mitigate the impacts of geopolitical conflicts.' At present, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, marked by rising unilateralism and protectionism, frequent local conflicts and unrest, and increasing deficits in peace, development, security, and governance; uncertainty, instability, and unpredictability are on the rise. In this increasingly complex international environment, advancing the high-quality development of the BRI hinges on integrating high-quality development with high-level security. It is necessary to skillfully leverage advantages, avoid pitfalls, turn crises into opportunities, be proactive in analysis and forecasting, strengthen strategic, operational, and adaptive capacities, consolidate the basic foundation of cooperation, and expand new space for cooperation.- ，-‘'，，-。，，、，，、、、，、、。--，。、，，、、，、. -Correctly handling the relationship between enhancing the sense of gain of partner countries and adhering to what is beneficial to us is an inherent requirement for promoting the high-quality development of BRI, and it is also an important principle and direction that must be firmly grasped at all times. It is necessary to persist in doing our best and acting within our capabilities, find the points of cooperation and the intersection of interests, coordinate the construction of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects — helping to jointly build national economic and social development of partner countries and improving people's livelihood—and continuously enhance the sense of participation, gain, and happiness of the people of partner countries. It is necessary to persist in what is beneficial to us, mutual benefit and win-win, do what should be done and not doing what should not be done, do not issue any ‘dishonoured/phony checks/empty promises' () and do not raise appetites/don't create unrealistic expectations (), balance the political, strategic, overall, long-term, and economic accounts, and effectively safeguard China's strategic interests.- ，--，。、，、，--，，、、。、，，--、，、、、、，. -As BRI continues to be further promoted, there is an increase in China's overseas assets. How to better safeguard the security of China's overseas interests is a major issue facing the country. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made arrangements around improving the foreign-related national security mechanism, and proposed a series of reform measures such as ‘establishing and improving the coordination mechanism for peripheral security work', ‘strengthening the system and mechanism for early warning, prevention and control, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks, and deepening international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security'. It is necessary to establish a bottom-line thinking, enhance risk awareness, speed up the improvement of various mechanisms and plans, and carry out risk investigation, monitoring, assessment, and early warning on a regular basis in order to effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons overseas and ensure the security of China's overseas interests.- --，。，。《》，---、、，-。、，，、、、，、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a Zhong Yin commentary, which focuses on the publication of the new reader on Xi Jinping Thought on Culture. It talks about how Xi's thought on this has outlined a -new cultural mission in the new era-. It says that: -Deeply rooted in excellent Chinese traditional culture, drawing on and absorbing all excellent achievements of human civilization, Chinese-style modernization represents the development direction of human civilization's progress, presents a new landscape different from Western modernization models, and creates a new form of human civilization.- ，，，，. It adds that the new reader -systematically expounds the core essence, spiritual substance, rich connotations, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, comprehensively reflecting the original contributions of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the cultural field, and provides an important study guide for us to deeply study and comprehend Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, feel the modern power of Chinese civilization, and consolidate the cultural foundation for national construction and national rejuvenation.- 《》，、、、，，，，、. The commentary is then divided into three parts, each making a specific point. The first of these stresses the importance of the -continuous and unceasing flow of Chinese civilization- which has remained -unbroken- for -thousands of years- and repeatedly encountered challenges yet enduring without decline-, thereby forging a -miracle of human civilization-. 。，，? So what accounts for this? The piece says: -The shared belief that ‘civilization cannot be interrupted' and the cultural consciousness of passing the torch are precisely the important codes for Chinese civilization's continuation to this day. The modern power of Chinese civilization is manifested in the unprecedented strengthening of our confidence, forged into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the entire nation, firmly grasping the fate of the country's development and progress in our own hands.- --、，。，，，. The second point is that -reform and innovation and keeping pace with the times are the eternal spiritual temperament of Chinese civilization.- 、. It adds: -The modern strength of Chinese civilization is manifested in our innovative power continuously condensing, exploring and innovating in frontier practices and unknown domains, continuously expanding new paths to realize modernization.- ，，、，. The third point is the experience of inclusiveness and tolerance. -Chinese civilization is a civilization that originated on the land of China, and it is also a civilization that has been formed through continuous exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations. In the new era, China is embracing the world with a more open attitude and contributing to the world with more dynamic civilizational achievements.- ，。、. In this context, the piece mentions BRI, GCI, GDI and GSI along with the proposal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Finally, there's a report on Zhao Leji meeting Hun Sen. Xinhua reports Zhao said that -China stands ready to work with Cambodia to firmly support each other, deepen practical cooperation and expand people-to-people exchanges in accordance with the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties. The NPC of China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Cambodia's Senate and National Assembly to contribute to the building of the China-Cambodia community with a shared future, Zhao added.- Subscribe now Page 2: A few reports to note. First, Wang Yi addressed (English report) the 20th Beijing-Tokyo Forum via video conference. He said that -not long ago, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met for the first time during the APEC meeting. The two sides agreed to work together to comprehensively promote the strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between China and Japan in accordance with the principles and directions established in the four political documents between China and Japan, and to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. Both sides should be guided by the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, adhere to the original aspirations of relations, follow the right path, seek common ground, and coordinate actions, all with the aim of promoting stable, lasting bilateral relations. He then made four points. First, Wang said that the two sides should understand the correct positioning of bilateral relations. China has always regarded Japan as an important cooperation partner, and hopes that Japan can view China's development objectively and rationally. He also hoped that Japan will work with China to follow the correct positioning of the comprehensive advancement of the strategic, mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan, and implement the important consensus that the two countries should be cooperative partners and should not pose a threat to each other. Second, the two sides should maintain the political foundations of bilateral relations. The four political documents between China and Japan have laid the political and legal foundations for bilateral relations, and they should not be blurred, retrogressed or undermined. Third, China and Japan need to promote an open strategy of mutual benefits. Both sides should cherish their cooperation space and common interests that have already been established, and work together to maintain the stability and smooth operations of the global free trade system and industrial and supply chains. Fourth, Wang called on the two countries to uphold regional and international peace and stability. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China and Japan need to work in tandem to safeguard Asian unity and cooperation to prevent external forces from fomenting confrontation. Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there's a report on Wang's meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister of Chile Alberto van Klaveren Stork. Xinhua says: Wang said that -although China and Chile were separated by the long geographical distance, the people of the two countries have shared amity and friendship, and bilateral relations have developed steadily. Hailing the exemplary role Chile has played in developing ties with China, Wang said the meetings between the two countries' leaders over the past years have guided bilateral cooperation to achieve gratifying results. ‘China-Chile relations have entered the best period', said Wang. Noting that next year will mark the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the 20th anniversary of the free trade agreement signed by the two sides, Wang said China is ready to work with Chile to act on the consensus reached by the two countries' heads of state, and advance the comprehensive strategic partnership by promoting high-level political mutual trust, pragmatic cooperation and connectivity. He said China is willing to maintain high-level exchanges with Chile and close communication at all levels, constantly improve economic and trade cooperation, expand cooperation in emerging fields such as information and clean energy, and strengthen the synergy of development strategies. Wang said China and Chile, both as important Asia-Pacific countries, should strengthen international coordination and jointly uphold multilateralism and free trade.- Subscribe now Third, there's a report on the comments from people attending the Understanding China conference in Guangzhou. Some of the key foreign commentators are: Yves Camille Désiré Leterme, former Prime Minister of Belgium: Wolfgang Schüssel, former Chancellor of Austria: Hassan Diab, former Prime Minister of Lebanon: Mulatu Teshome Wirtu, former President of Ethiopia: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi: Andrey Bystritskiy, Chairman of the Board of the Foundation for Development and Support of the Valdai Discussion Club Joseph Stiglitz Fourth, there's a report on the Foreign Ministry hosting a promotional event to present the Hainan Free Trade Port to the world. Wang Yi said that -China is committed to development through high-level opening up and will continue to foster a business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and implement the Global Development Initiative.- Xinhua explains: -Major officials of the island province of Hainan were invited to make presentations to more than 500 attendees, including diplomats and officials from over 160 countries, representatives from international organizations, central and local government officials, and representatives from enterprises, international trade associations, and domestic and foreign media.- -Wang said that the construction of the Hainan free trade port has gained momentum and the region has attracted an increasing number of regional and global enterprises to invest and operate business, presenting a new and dynamic environment of openness and progress. The Hainan Free Trade Port has become a new frontier of China's institutional opening up, a new hot spot for regional mutually beneficial cooperation, and a new engine driving economic globalization, Wang said. ‘Seeing is believing, and everyone is welcome to visit Hainan and gain firsthand experience,' he added. Wang said China will adhere to open, innovative, green, inclusive, and peaceful development. ‘Choosing China means choosing opportunities, and embracing China means embracing the future,' he said.- Fifth, there's a report on He Lifeng's meeting with John Waldron, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group, in Beijing. Xinhua says: He told Waldron that -China welcomes more U.S. financial institutions and long-term capital to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China…China is fully implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC Central Committee's third plenary session, steadily advancing major measures to deepen comprehensive reform, and continuously expanding opening-up at a high level, He noted. ‘We welcome more U.S. financial institutions and long-term capital, including Goldman Sachs Group, to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China, and to play a greater role in promoting the healthy development of China-U.S. relations,' He said. The Goldman Sachs Group is full of confidence in China's economy and future development, and is willing to continue expanding cooperation with China and making contributions to promoting U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation, Waldron said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Sixth, there's a brief report on Zhang Qingwei, Vice Chairman of the NPCSC, leading a delegation to Djibouti. Zhang met with President Ismail Omar Guelleh. Two other reports also inform of Party delegations visiting Malawi and Austria. Page 3: There's a report informing that in the first three quarters of the year, the scale of agricultural insurance premiums reached 137.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.2%, providing risk protection of 4.3 trillion yuan for 136 million insured farmers. Another report informs that in the first 10 months, the added value of China's machinery industry increased by 5.5% year-on-year, production and sales were generally stable, foreign trade saw accelerated development, and the overall operating situation was stable and improving. Page 5: Yesterday, there was a Xinhua article in the paper discussing the economy. This is a series that is likely to continue. All this leads to the CEWC meeting in the days ahead. The article yesterday did lead to some media kerfuffle, owing to this bit below. I did not find it particularly remarkable, perhaps because I didn't see the novelty in it. To me, this has been the leadership's consensus on the direction of economic development for some time. But it is useful to note it as a signal before the CEWC. -When looking at economic growth rate, we must not only look at the present or the immediate moment, but more importantly look dialectically and long-term. Valuing speed but not being solely focused on speed is the dialectical approach currently followed by China's economic development. GDP and its growth rate are typically used to measure a comprehensive economic strength and level of an economic entity. However, as a quantitative indicator, GDP emphasizes the concept of quantity and cannot comprehensively reflect the quality and efficiency of economic activities. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: Understanding economic development as simply an increase or decrease in quantity and simple repetition is a metaphysical view of development. Since the 1960s, among more than 100 middle-income economies globally, only a dozen have successfully become high-income economies. The ones who were successful have achieved a shift in economic development from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement after experiencing a period of high-speed growth. Those countries that have stagnated or even regressed have not achieved this fundamental transformation. The extensive economic development model once played a significant role in our country, but also made us pay enormous resource and environmental costs, concealing some contradictions and risks. If we do not break the ‘speed worship', and continue to lay out projects and launch initiatives, even if we temporarily increase the speed, we will be overdrawing future growth. ‘No matter how fast the speed, it is not that we cannot, but that we choose not to.' Entering the new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping has distinctly proposed that our economic development has entered a new normal of speed changes, structural optimization, and motivation transformation, making the important assertion that our economy has shifted from high-speed growth to high-quality development stage. Development is a hard truth, and high-quality development is the hard truth of the new era. From comprehensively implementing the new development concept, to accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, to developing new quality productivity according to local conditions, the Chinese economy continues to be injected with new connotations of high-quality development. The current Chinese economy pays more attention to achieving effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth, rather than simply hero-worshipping GDP. This year's annual economic growth target is around 5%, and we have been striving towards this goal. Through effort, whether it's slightly left or right of 5%, is acceptable. Compared to speed, to assess whether the economy is good, we must more importantly see whether the development momentum is strong, whether the economic structure is reasonable, whether the innovation drive is stronger, whether development is more coordinated, whether the green foundation is thicker, whether the opening-up level is higher, and whether the people are happier and more secure. ，、，、。、，。GDP，。，GDP，。：-、，。-60，100。，。，。，，。--，、，，。-，，。-，、、，。，。，，，。，，GDP。5%，。，5%，。，，、，、、、、. Share Tracking People's Daily Today's article deals with boosting domestic demand. Perhaps, the most significant bit to note is that while demand is being seen as a challenge, there are no new ideas being discussed. The article is a re-affirmation of the current policy path. It says: -At present, my country faces a complex and severe international environment, and the challenge of insufficient domestic demand is still significant. Striving to expand domestic demand is an important task of economic work at present and in the future.- ，，.，. The first part of the article talks about improving numbers, such as retail sales, fixed assets investments, and many others. The second part of the article says this: -For a period of time, our economic operation has faced challenges including insufficient domestic effective demand. In the first three quarters, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth was at its lowest level in recent years. Challenges and opportunities coexist. How to respond to challenges and seize opportunities? ... ‘Is Chinese consumption facing a crisis?' Recently, consulting firm McKinsey released a report titled ‘2024 Chinese Consumer Market Truth', responding to misreadings about Chinese consumption. ‘Although the growth rate of domestic consumption has declined, it is still growing, especially in some industries such as the service industry and tourism industry.' From the perspective of investment, the growth rate of private investment in the first 10 months fell by 0.3% year-on-year, the lowest growth rate since the beginning of this year. However, excluding real estate development investment, private investment increased by 6.3% year-on-year, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the overall investment growth rate. Private investment in manufacturing, general equipment manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing and other fields maintained double-digit growth. Understanding the Chinese economy requires not just looking at current data fluctuations, but seeing how challenges are addressed, how obstacles are overcome, continuously striving towards established goals, and solidly taking each step.- -In November, the General Office of the State Council issued the ‘Guidelines on Stimulating the Vitality of the Ice and Snow Economy through the High-quality Development of Ice and Snow Sports'. According to the document, by 2030, the total scale of the ice and snow economy will reach 1.5 trillion yuan. This will be an increase of nearly 70% over 2023. Entering the new era, the primary social contradictions in our country have undergone historic changes. By focusing on meeting people's needs for ‘good or not'/quality, the potential and opportunities of the domestic market are limitless. Cultivate new engines. Since the beginning of this year, from developing the silver economy to stimulating the vitality of the ice and snow economy, from the ‘take-off' of the low-altitude economy to the ‘ignition' of the pioneering economy, efforts on both supply and demand sides are leveraging investment and consumption, continuously upgrading and expanding the ultra-large-scale market. Expanding new spaces. Deeply promoting green low-carbon development, releasing the new-type urbanization strategic five-year action plan, cultivating and developing county-level economies, improving the level of regional coordinated development, promoting comprehensive rural revitalization, there is greater depth in terms of new spaces in the Chinese economy.- ，。，...。、？-？-，《2024》，：-，，。-，100.3%，。，6.3%，3，、、。，，、，，。11，《》。，2030，1.5。2023。，。--，、。。，，----，、，，。。、、、、，.

Facing new situations and problems in economic operation, the Party Central Committee made decisive decisions, with a coordinated package of policies working in the same direction, with a very clear orientation of expanding domestic demand. The 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds for the ‘two heavy' construction and ‘two new' work have already been all issued. The 100 billion yuan central budget investment plan for next year and the 100 billion yuan list of -two-heavy- construction projects were issued ahead of schedule this year. Research and proposals have been made to further strengthen support for the ‘two new', expand the scope of support policies, and intensify efforts to boost investment and promote consumption. The reserve requirement ratio and policy interest rates were reduced, structural monetary policy tools to support the stable development of the stock market have been put in place, and greater support has been provided for the financing and investment activities of business entities. The most significant debt optimization measures in recent years to enhance local governments' spending capacity have been introduced, directing more resources toward expanding investment, promoting consumption, and safeguarding livelihoods. A ‘combination punch' to reduce home purchase costs, stimulate housing demand, and increase support for specific groups has been implemented. Going forward, we must strive at the key points of the national economy and people's livelihood, continue to stimulate potential consumption, and expand effective and profitable investment. International organizations have assessed that the package of policies aims to improve social welfare, ensure the healthy operation of local governments, and bring price and asset price expectations into a positive cycle. It is beneficial for clearing bottlenecks in economic development, livelihood, and employment, promoting a smoother economic rebalancing process, and reflecting further innovation and breakthroughs in China's economic policy approach.- ，，，，。，，、，。----1，10001000--，--、，；、，；，，、、；--、，……，、。，、、，，，.

Takeaways from Indian FM's Statement on Ties with China - Nepal's Oli Meets Xi - New Book on Xi's Thought on Culture - Panchen Lama's Tibet Visit - Wa...	Hi folks, I am beginning today's edition with a look at India-China relations. Yesterday Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar delivered a statement in Parliament on -recent developments in the India China border areas and their implications for our overall bilateral relations-. Before I detail the text, let me offer a few takeaways: First, it is really good to finally have such a statement from the government in Parliament. This is really important for informed discussion and debate within India about the nature of the situation along the border with China and the broader outlook from New Delhi's perspective. It is also important to build political consensus across party lines on China policy. Second, on disengagement from friction points, Jaishankar was clear that this was India's -immediate priority- and that it has been -achieved in full-. However, it is important to note that he does not say that this implies a return to normalcy in ties. In fact, Jaishankar reiterated that -we are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties. In the coming days, we will be discussing both de-escalation as well as effective management of our activities in the border areas.- Third, in describing what disengagement entails, Jaishankar addressed the issue of the creation of buffer zones at several friction points. To me, his comments in this regard essentially seemed to suggest their acceptance by New Delhi. In that sense, the status quo has changed and is accepted as a new status quo. For instance, he said that -steps of a temporary and limited nature- that have been worked out in other places -can be revisited as the situation demands.- This seems to imply that the current situation does not demand this effort. Jaishankar seemed to justify this position by arguing that -in the past, earlier Governments have agreed to a range of steps to defuse situations that have arisen at different times, including offers on our side to create de-militarized zones, limited non-patrolling zones, relocation or withdrawal of posts, disengagement of troops and dismantlement of structures.- Fourth, towards the end, the EAM discussed India's border infrastructure building effort. To me, this was an important point being made, and I hope it is signalling that the agreement with Beijing in Ladakh does not entail any commitment from the Indian side to curtail or scale down border infrastructure development. Fifth, he ended with this bit: -The conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping our national security interests first and foremost.- This is extremely important from my perspective, since it is indicative of the significance of security considerations in different dimensions of ties with China going forward, particularly when it comes to economic ties. Share Tracking People's Daily Leave a comment Anyway, below are key excerpts from the speech, and the full video if you would like to watch. -The House is cognizant of the fact that China is in illegal occupation of 38,000 Sq. kms. of Indian territory in Aksai Chin as a result of the 1962 conflict and the events that preceded it. Furthermore, Pakistan illegally ceded 5180 Sq. kms. of Indian territory to China in 1963, which had been under its occupation since 1948. India and China have held talks for multiple decades to resolve the boundary issue. While there is a Line of Actual Control (LAC), it does not have a common understanding in some areas. We remain committed to engaging with China through bilateral discussions to arrive at a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for a boundary settlement. Hon'ble Members would recall that the amassing of a large number of troops by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh in April/May 2020 resulted in face offs with our forces at a number of points. The situation also led to disruption of patrolling activities. It is to the credit of our armed forces that despite logistical challenges and the then-prevailing Covid situation, they were able to counter-deploy rapidly and effectively.- He termed China's actions in 2020 as an -unprecedented disruption- to a process of building ties which began in 1988. He added: -The situation arising after our counter-deployment in 2020 called for multiple set of responses. The immediate priority was to ensure disengagement from friction points so that there would be no further untoward incidents or clashes. This Sir, has been fully achieved as I will explain. The next priority will be to consider de-escalation, that would address the massing of troops along the LAC with associated accompaniments. It is also evident that the management of the border areas will require further attention in the light of our recent experiences. In all of this, we were and we remain very clear that the three key principles must be observed in all circumstances: (i) both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC, (ii) neither side should attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo, and (iii) agreements and understandings reached in the past must be fully abided by in their entirety.- Jaishankar then highlighted the diplomatic effort in negotiating with China since the standoff of 2020. -Throughout this period, Hon'ble Members would also be aware that Government has maintained that India-China relations cannot be normal in the absence of peace and tranquility in the border areas. The combination of a firm and principled stance on the situation in the border areas as well as our clearly articulated approach to the totality of our ties have been the foundation of our engagement with China for the last four years. We have been very clear that the restoration of peace and tranquility would be the basis for the rest of the relationship to move forward. Since 2020, our engagement was therefore focused on that objective. This took place at various levels, involving different arms of the government. I myself have had meetings with my Chinese counterpart, as indeed has my senior colleague, Raksha Mantri ji. Our NSA has also engaged his Chinese counterpart, both being the Special Representatives on the boundary question. More detailed discussions were conducted by the Working Mechanism for Cooperation and Coordination (WMCC) at the diplomatic level. Its military counterpart was the Senior Highest Military Commanders meeting (SHMC) mechanism. The interactions were naturally very tightly coordinated with the combined presence in the negotiations of both diplomatic and military officials. Since June 2020, 17 meetings of the WMCC and 21 rounds of SHMC have taken place.- -In this background, I would like to inform the House today about the agreement reached on 21 October, 2024 regarding Depsang and Demchok. The twin considerations of an unstable local situation and an impacted bilateral relationship were clearly the drivers for these recent endeavors. These two areas have been the focus of our discussions in both WMCC and SHMC with the Chinese side since September 2022, when the last disengagement agreement was concluded at Hot Springs area. In the lead up to the October 21 agreement, I had discussed both the specific disengagement issue as well as the larger relationship with my Chinese counterpart in Astana on 4 July and Vientiane on 25 July. Our National Security Advisor and his Chinese counterpart also met in St. Petersburg on 12 September. The problem in these two areas pertained primarily to obstructions of our long-standing patrolling activity. In Demchok, there was also the question of access by our nomadic population to traditional grazing grounds, as well as to sites of significance to the local people. As a result of this recent understanding arrived at after intensive negotiations, resumption of patrolling to the traditional areas is underway. It was initially tested by sending out patrols for verification of disengagement on the ground and is being followed up by regular activities as per the agreed understanding. Following the October 21 understanding, Prime Minister and President Xi Jinping had a meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Kazan on October 23. They welcomed the understanding and directed the Foreign Ministers to meet and stabilize and rebuild the relationship. The Special Representatives are also to oversee the management of peace and tranquility besides exploring a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question.- This is how he explained the completion of disengagement. -Through you I would like to inform the House, that disengagement has now been achieved in full in Eastern Ladakh through a step by step process, culminating in Depsang and Demchok. With the task of disengagement completed, it is now our expectation that discussions would commence in regard to the remaining issues that we had placed on the agenda. For the benefit of Hon'ble Members, I would also flag for your attention the previous positions articulated by the Government in Parliament previously on this issue. On 15 September, 2020, Raksha Mantri ji had made a detailed statement on Chinese attempts to transgress the LAC and the appropriate response given by our armed forces. On 11 February, 2021, Raksha Mantri ji again briefed the House about our disengagement agreement in the North and South banks of the Pangong Lake. Thereafter, in August 2021, a third phase of disengagement took place in the area of Gogra, whereby troops would henceforth be in their respective bases. The next step took place in September 2022, pertaining to the Hot Springs area. Again, forward deployments ceased in a phased, coordinated and verified manner, resulting in the return of troops to their respective areas. The most recent October 21, 2024 agreement comes in the wake of the earlier ones. It completes the first phase of what we had agreed to in Moscow in September 2020.- -As Members are aware, there is a long history of frictions, transgressions and face offs in several sectors of the India-China border. This goes back to Barahoti from 1954, to Longju in 1959, to Sumdorong Chu from 1986-1995 and Depsang in 2013, amongst others. In the past, earlier Governments have agreed to a range of steps to defuse situations that have arisen at different times, including offers on our side to create de-militarized zones, limited non-patrolling zones, relocation or withdrawal of posts, disengagement of troops and dismantlement of structures. Different locations have seen different solutions being examined. Where the October 21 understanding is concerned, our objective has been to ensure patrolling as in the past to the relevant patrolling points, as well as resumption of grazing by our civilians as per longstanding practice. This is indeed what we have agreed upon in regard to Depsang and Demchok. In a few other places where friction occurred in 2020, steps of a temporary and limited nature were worked out, based on local conditions, to obviate the possibility of further friction. This, I must stress, applies to both sides and can be revisited as the situation demands. In that sense, our stance has been resolute and firm and serves our national interest fully.- -In that context, the House would also recognize that there has been a significant improvement in the border infrastructure which has made such effective counter-deployment possible. This is reflected, amongst others, in the increase of border infrastructure allocations in the last decade. The Border Roads Organization (BRO) alone has incurred three times the expenditure level of what it was a decade ago. Whether it is the length of the road networks, of bridges or of the number of tunnels, there has been a substantial increase over the earlier period. Notable milestones in recent years include the Atal Tunnel to Lahul Spiti, the Sela and Nechiphu Tunnels to Tawang, the Umlingla Pass road in Southern Ladakh and the extended opening of the Zojila Axis. Work is progressing on some strategically important roads and air fields in Ladakh. The adoption of new technologies in high altitude, remote, inaccessible and permafrost areas has also been significant. All of this reflects the Government's firm commitment to protecting our borders and ensuring that our armed forces get the facilities and the logistical support that they deserve.- He ended with this: -We are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties. In the coming days, we will be discussing both de-escalation as well as effective management of our activities in the border areas. The conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping our national security interests first and foremost. In my recent meeting with FM Wang Yi, we reached an understanding that the Special Representatives and the Foreign Secretary level mechanisms will be convening soon.- Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 04, 2024.

But I thought this was useful in terms of how the commentary department summarises the achievements of BRI. -We have used the joint construction of BRI as a practical platform to promote the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, establishing bilateral and regional communities of shared future with multiple countries and regions, and making the concept of building a community with a shared future for humanity deeply ingrained in people's hearts. We have signed BRI cooperation documents with over 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations, continuously expanding our network of cooperative partnerships. We have advanced regional openness, focusing on optimizing the regional opening-up layout, achieving mutual promotion and co-development between coastal opening and inland border opening, forming a comprehensive opening-up pattern of interconnected inland and maritime, east-west mutual assistance. From signing 23 free trade agreements with 30 countries and regions, to steadily expanding a high-standard global free trade zone network, from continuously reducing the negative list for foreign investment access to granting zero-tariff treatment for 100% of product categories from the least developed countries that have established diplomatic relations with China…through the joint construction of BRI, China's doors to the outside world are opening wider, and new horizons for open development are constantly being explored.- --，，。150、30--，。，，、，、。3023，，，100%……--，，.

Xi said that -in the current severe and complex international environment, advancing the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative presents both opportunities and challenges, but overall, opportunities outweigh challenges. We must firmly maintain strategic confidence and strategic determination, take bold responsibility, and work to create an even brighter future for the joint construction of the Belt and Road.- 、、2--，，--，。，，，--. Cai Qi and Ding Xuexiang were in attendance. Ding presided over the symposium. Also in attendance were Wang Yi, He Lifeng and Wu Zhenglong. Among the officials who spoke were: Zheng Shanjie, Director of the National Development and Reform Commission Ma Zhaoxu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yin Li, Beijing Party Secretary Wang Menghui, Hubei Party Secretary Hu Wangming, Chairman of China Baowu Steel Group Co., Ltd. Feng Xubin, Chairman of YXE Trade Service Group Co., Ltd. Xing Guangcheng, CASS Member, director of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies Xi then spoke. He said that since BRI was announced in 2013, it has -adhered to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits; the areas of cooperation have continuously expanded, the scope of cooperation has steadily broadened, and the levels of cooperation have consistently deepened; its international appeal, influence, and cohesion have been increasingly enhanced, achieving significant accomplishments and making China's contribution to strengthening friendships with participating countries and promoting their economic and social development.- ，。，2013--，，，--、、、，，、、，、、，，、. -Xi Jinping emphasized that in recent years, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, with unilateralism and protectionism increasing significantly, and local conflicts and unrest occurring frequently. In this context, in promoting the high-quality joint construction of BRI, we must properly respond to various risks and challenges, effectively overcome the impact of geopolitical conflicts, correctly handle enhancing the sense of gain for partner countries while maintaining relations beneficial to ourselves, and effectively safeguard China's overseas interests and security.- ，，，、，。，--，，，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the joint construction of BRI has entered a new stage of high-quality development. We must adhere to the overall work principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, comprehensively and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for humanity, adhere to the guiding principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, as well as openness, greenness, and integrity, high standards, people-centered benefits, and sustainability. Guided by the eight actions for high-quality BRI construction, with connectivity as the main line, we must combine high-quality development with high-level security, government guidance with market operations, scientific planning with dynamic optimization, and quantitative growth with qualitative improvement. Efforts should be coordinated to deepen ‘hard connectivity' in infrastructure, ‘soft connectivity' in rules and standards, and ‘people-to-people connectivity' with the populations of participating countries. There should be a balanced advancement of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects, consolidation of cooperation in traditional fields, and steady expansion into emerging areas. Mechanisms for promoting high-quality BRI construction should be improved, continuously expanding a new space for higher-level, more resilient, and more sustainable win-win development.- ，--。，，，，、、，--，，、、、，--、----，--，，--，、、。 -Xi Jinping stressed that we should focus on advancing the construction of high-quality BRI mechanism, improve the overall management mechanism of cooperation planning for BRI, improve the coordination and promotion mechanism for ‘hard connectivity', ‘soft connectivity', and ‘people-to-people connectivity', improve the practical cooperation mechanisms for industrial and supply chains, improve the mechanisms for international exchanges and cooperation in emerging fields, improve the diversified investment and financing guarantee mechanisms, improve the internal and external coordination mechanisms for risk prevention and control, improve the mechanisms for safeguarding overseas interests, improve the high-level international communication mechanisms, and improve the clean Silk Road cooperation mechanisms, to ensure the stable and long-term development of high-quality joint construction of BRI.- ，--，--，--、--、--，，，，，，，，--. -Xi Jinping pointed out that we must persist with the blueprint to the end, continuing work from one phase to the next, bravely overcoming various risks and challenges, resolutely advancing the high-quality joint construction of BRI, and making greater contributions to promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity.- ，，，，--，. Ding Xuexiang then said that Xi's speech had -made comprehensive arrangements for promoting the high-quality development of the joint construction of BRI in the current and future period.- He praised the speech for its -lofty intentions, profound thinking, refined arguments, and rich connotations- adding that -it provides important guidance and points out the direction forward for promoting high-quality joint construction of BRI in the next golden decade. We must study and understand it carefully and resolutely implement it. All regions, departments, and units must continuously strengthen strategic thinking, security awareness, systemic perspective, and international vision. They should focus on advancing systematization and institutional/mechanism-based approaches, continuously improve top-level design, formulate practical measures, deepen external cooperation, strive to cultivate a batch of well-known and substantial cooperation brands, form more exemplary and leading major achievements, and jointly create new spaces for win-win development of the Belt and Road Initiative that are at a higher level, more resilient, and more sustainable.- ，--，--。、、、，--、，，。、、、，，，，，、，、，、、--.

We will carry out reforms to provide a strong impetus for Chinese-style modernization; unswervingly expand high-level opening up to the outside world and share development opportunities with countries around the world; closely focus on the primary task of high-quality development to promote the effective improvement of economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity; adhere to the path of peaceful development and provide more stability and certainty for the world.

Xinhua says: Wang said that -China is willing to work with Cambodia to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and promote the continuous development of China-Cambodia relations. The CPPCC is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Cambodia to promote greater achievements in the building of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era, Wang said.- Also on the page is a feature article marking the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to China. I am not detailing this.

Page 3: Let's now cover the Chinese readout of the meeting between Wang Yi and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock for the 7th round of China-Germany Strategic Dialogue on Diplomacy and Security. It says: Wang Yi said that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Germany. Both sides need to seriously review the past and actively explore the future. The world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and human society faces multiple challenges, with noticeable increases in uncertainty, instability, and unpredictability. The more turbulent the world becomes, the more major powers need to maintain composure, and the more it is required for major-power relations to maintain stability. China is responding to all external uncertainties with its own certainty. China's policy towards Germany also remains stable and consistent. Over the 52 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China has always regarded Germany as an important partner. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the two peoples, China-Germany relations have generally maintained a momentum of development, which has not only brought important benefits to the people of the two countries, but also become a stabilizer in China-Europe relations and even the international situation. There are differences and disagreements between China and Germany, but differences should not be an obstacle to cooperation, and disagreements should not be a reason for confrontation. The positive results and beneficial experience achieved in China-Germany relations so far are worth cherishing and inheriting by both sides. ，10，，。，，、、。，，。。，52。，，，。，，。，。 Wang added that earlier this year, the CPC held the third plenary session, which launched a new reform agenda. He said that -in the past few months, the Chinese government has successively introduced new measures for reform and opening up, which have garnered the attention of and been welcomed by the international community, including the German business community; practical cooperation between China and Germany faces an even broader prospect. As the world's second and third largest economies, respectively, China and Germany must overcome interference and eliminate resistance; adhere to the main tone of dialogue and cooperation; abandon outdated confrontational Cold War mentality; jointly resist external risks and jointly respond to global challenges; strive to be promoters of pragmatic cooperation, advocates of open development, and exemplars of multilateralism; and showcase the responsibilities of major powers the turbulent changes and turmoil in the international situation.- ，7，，，。，，，。、，、，、，，，、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Wang Yi stressed that in order to maintain the stable development of China-Germany relations, it is necessary to first correct strategic perception. China is a force for peace, growth and stability in the world. Its strategic intentions and policy orientations are open and transparent. It is the only major country that has written its adherence to the path of peaceful development into its constitution. The historical logic that a ‘strong country will inevitably seek hegemony' () does not apply to China. The systems of China and Germany and China and Europe are different. This is a product of their respective historical and cultural traditions and is also the choice made by the people. Both sides should uphold mutual respect and mutual understanding as the foundation for mutually beneficial cooperation. China-Germany relations are not directed against third parties and should not be affected by third parties. ，。、，，，。、，，。、，。，. -Wang Yi pointed out that competition should be fair, not a zero-sum game. The EU's high anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles violate the principles of fair competition and free trade and have become a prominent issue between China and Europe. It is hoped that Germany and the EU will view China's development objectively and rationally, adopt a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation.- ，，。，。、，，. Among other things, the readout quotes Baerbock as saying that -Germany supports the EU and China to continue negotiations on the EVs anti-subsidy issue and strive to find a solution acceptable to both sides.- ，，. They also discussed the war in Ukraine. The readout only says that Baerbock -hoped that China, as a partner of Europe, would play an active role in this regard. Wang Yi comprehensively and systematically elaborated China's position on promoting peace and dialogue.- ，，. Subscribe now I haven't seen a German readout, but Baerbock told reporters in Beijing that: -every permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has a responsibility for peace and security in the world; they must not fuel conflicts that threaten the security of us all with its support…Drones from Chinese factories, and North Korean troops attacking peace in the middle of Europe, violate our core European security interests- -The Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now also dragging Asia into it via North Korea. My Chinese counterpart and I have discussed extensively why this cannot be in China's interest,- she said. Acknowledging that Berlin and Beijing hold different perspectives on the conflict, Baerbock said both sides engaged in substantive discussions about diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution. ‘A process for a just peace is needed more urgently than ever, as these thousand days of brutal Russian aggression have brought not only devastation to Ukraine,' Baerbock said. ‘They have also caused worldwide consequences, with the soaring food prices and now with the risk of involvement of other regions to this conflict'.- Share Tracking People's Daily ILD chief Liu Jianchao also met with Baerbock. The report on that in the paper is far too brief. Next, there's a report on MoFA's statement on Lithuania asking Chinese personnel to leave the country. -On November 29, Lithuania's Foreign Ministry, without any reason, declared relevant diplomatic personnel of the Office of the Chargé d'Affaires of China in Lithuania ‘persona non grata' and demanded that they leave the country within the time required. China strongly condemns and firmly rejects this wanton and provocative action. As many are aware, on issues concerning China's Taiwan region, Lithuania has been acting in serious violation of the one-China principle and breached the political commitment Lithuania made in the communiqué on the establishment of China-Lithuania diplomatic relations. This has caused severe difficulty for bilateral ties. Three years on since the downgrade of bilateral ties with China, Lithuania has again taken detrimental action that further exacerbates the relations. China calls on Lithuania to immediately stop undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop creating difficulty for bilateral relations. China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania. We hope the upcoming new government of Lithuania will follow the prevailing international consensus, abide by the one-China principle, and foster conditions for the normalization of China-Lithuania relations.- Another report (related English report) informs that Remin University of China and Complutense University of Madrid have jointly launched a research center in Madrid, with the aim of enhancing educational collaboration and promoting cultural exchange and mutual learning of civilizations between China and Spain.

The report says that -representatives from central media outlets, provincial Party committee propaganda departments, over 30 provincial-level Party newspapers, academia, and new media platforms gathered to exchange ideas and pool their efforts to strengthen and expand mainstream ideological discourse in the new era-. Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and head of its Propaganda Department, and Ma Hongwei, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Daily, attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

BRI Takes Centrestage - China-Central Asia Foreign Ministers Meeting Outcomes - Lashing Out at the US on Taiwan - China-Russia Strategic Air Patrol	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 02, 2024. Page 1: There's a long article on the page, which talks about the continued deepening of BRI's development. The headline reads: -Benefit people's livelihoods, win people's hearts, and benefit the world- . On BRI, there are two propositions that I frequently hear. First, that it has been de-prioritised or has met its quiet demise. Second, that BRI has been replaced by GDI. Both of these arguments are misplaced. On the first point, there has, of course, been a re-orientation of BRI in terms of quantum of investments, sectoral focus, and type of projects. But I cannot fathom the BRI brand not remaining a priority since it has been formally included in the CPC constitution and is linked to Xi Jinping's legacy. On the second point, I have consistently argued that GDI and BRI are distinct pillars in the grand edifice of building a community of common destiny/shared future for mankind. There are overlaps in project areas. But these are distinct brands, which approach development and project funding and execution differently. Anyway, the article today begins by talking about the opening of the port in Chancay. The piece informs that over the past 11 years, more than 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations have signed cooperation documents on the Belt and Road Initiative. Some key excerpts: -The high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative is an important cooperative platform through which China, with an open mind, invites countries to share the opportunities of Chinese-style modernization and build a community with a shared future for humanity. It represents a magnificent chapter in China's head-of-state diplomacy.- --、，. -Under the personal planning, deployment, and promotion of President Xi Jinping, the joint construction of the Belt and Road has transformed from a concept into action, from a vision into reality. It has evolved from the broad brushstrokes of a ‘freehand sketch' to the meticulous refinement of a ‘fine brush painting', showcasing the outstanding political wisdom and mission of the leader of a major country. In the face of changes in the world, the era, and history, the joint construction of the Belt and Road takes the building of a community with a shared future for humanity as its ultimate goal, consistently upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, adheres to openness as its essence, green development as its foundation, and integrity as its hallmark. It emphasises high standards, sustainability, and benefits for people's livelihoods, and constantly realizss the people's desire for exchanges among civilisations, expectations for peace and tranquility, pursuit of common development and yearning for a better life. More than 11 years of progress have demonstrated that the joint construction of the Belt and Road stands on the right side of history.- 、、，--，，----，。、、，--，，、、，、、，、、、。11，--. The joint construction of the Belt and Road has driven an investment scale of nearly $1 trillion and helped nearly 40 million people get rid of poverty. --，4000. -The Luban Workshop has established 32 ‘technical stations' in countries jointly building the Belt and Road, providing vocational and technical training for local youth and continuously enhancing the endogenous development momentum of these countries.- --32--，，. -As the vast number of developing countries seek answers through exploration, Chinese-style modernization offers the world a brand-new mode of thinking and action — ‘The modernization of the world should be one of peaceful development, mutual benefit and cooperation, and shared prosperity'. ‘We must pursue a path of globalization that is people-centered, with more balanced development and more equitable opportunities, enabling different countries, social classes, and groups of people to share in the fruits of development'.- ，——-、、。--、、，、、.- -In July 2024, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China outlined a grand blueprint for further deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. The meeting resolved to improve mechanisms for promoting high-quality joint construction of BRI. It decided to continue implementing the Belt and Road Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan, strengthen the construction of multilateral cooperation platforms in fields such as green development, digital economy, artificial intelligence, energy, taxation, finance, and disaster reduction. It also called for improving the integrated layout of land, sea, air, and cyberspace to build a multidimensional connectivity network under the Belt and Road. Efforts will also be coordinated to advance major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects.- 20247，、。--。--，、、、、、、。，--。--. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Fifth China-Central Asia Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Xinhua says: -Wang noted that the China-Central Asia Mechanism has been in place for four years, during which the six countries, driven by good neighborliness, solidarity and pragmatism, have worked together to promote its development. He said that significant progress has been made since the first summit in Xi'an last May, with over half of the relevant projects being implemented or making substantial progress. The two sides have established ministerial platforms in areas such as trade, customs, agriculture, transportation, and industrial investment, Wang said, adding that China is willing to enhance cooperation with Central Asian countries and align development strategies.- Wang Yi made five points: First, we must adhere to the leadership of the heads of state. In accordance with the blueprint drawn up by the six heads of state, we will continue to implement the consensus reached at the Xi'an Summit and carefully prepare for the second summit to be held in Kazakhstan next year. Second, we should prioritise development. We should focus on the six priority areas of cooperation, namely, trade facilitation, industrial investment, connectivity, green mining, agricultural modernization, and streamlined people-to-people exchanges, improve the overall level of China-Central Asia cooperation, and implement GDI with practical actions. Third, we must uphold the principle of sharing weal and woe. We must implement the Global Security Initiative, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, work together to respond to crises and challenges, and maintain a stable and peaceful development environment for the six countries. Fourth, we should uphold our generational friendship. We should jointly implement the Global Civilization Initiative, uphold the concept of civilization based on equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, and perpetuate the concept of good-neighborliness, friendship and peace from generation to generation. Fifth, we must uphold multilateralism. We must oppose any form of ‘decoupling' and ‘small yards and high fences', promote cooperation across the Global South, and promote the development of an equal and orderly multipolar world and inclusive economic globalization. 。，，。。、、、、、，，。。，，，。。，、、、，、。。----，，、. The English reporting has some differences. It says that: The Chinese foreign minister summed up five consensus reached by the six foreign ministers during the meeting. First, the six countries agree to adhere to the guidance of the head of states and make the China-Central Asia mechanism better and stronger. Second, the six countries will adhere to the goal of modernization and deepen all-round cooperation. China is willing to expand cooperation with Central Asian countries in BeiDou Navigation Satellite System applications, poverty reduction and alleviation, desertification control, higher education and people-to-people exchanges, and build platforms for exchanges. Third, the six countries will share weal and woe and uphold regional peace and tranquility and actively implement the China-proposed Global Security Initiative, oppose external interference in the internal affairs of Central Asian countries and assist Afghanistan in realizing peaceful reconstruction as early as possible. Fourth, the six countries will adhere to mutual learning among civilizations and strengthen the foundation of everlasting friendship. ‘In the coming three years, China will provide 1,500 training opportunities to the five Central Asian countries and increase the number of scholarships by 600, so as to train more talents in various fields that are urgently needed for their development'. Fifth, the six countries will uphold multilateralism and safeguard international equity and justice, continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, promote solidarity and coordination in the Global South, and oppose any form of ‘decoupling and breaking chains.' The six countries will fully support China in assuming the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and jointly push the SCO to achieve new development and raise it to a new level.- Subscribe now The meeting ended with a joint statement. Key points: All parties pointed out that the ministerial cooperation mechanisms in the fields of economy and trade, industry and investment, agriculture, transportation, customs, security law enforcement, and emergency management established within the framework of the China-Central Asia Mechanism have been operating efficiently and have played an important role in promoting China-Central Asia cooperation.

Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report (English report) on Wang Yi's meetings with Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Murat Nurtleu, Tajikistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sirojiddin Muhriddin and Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov. Page 10: Much of this page is dedicated to express anger over Lai Ching-te's stopover in the US. MoFA said (Chinese text): -China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the US and the Taiwan region, firmly opposes any trip by leader of the Taiwan authorities to the US in any name or under whatever pretext, and firmly opposes any form of US connivance or support for ‘Taiwan independence' separatists and their separatist activities. China strongly condemns the US's arranging for Lai Ching-te's ‘stopover' and has lodged serious protests with the US. The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. We urge the US to fully see the separatist nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities, fully understand the grave damage that ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities do to cross-Strait peace and stability, fully abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, act on the commitments made by US leaders such as not supporting ‘Taiwan independence,' stop having official interaction with the Taiwan region, and stop sending any wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces. China will closely follow the developments and take resolute and strong measures to defend our nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.- The foreign ministry also responded to a question on the State Department clearing arms sales to Taiwan totaling $385 million. It said: -The US arms sales to China's Taiwan region seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué of 1982 and China's sovereignty and security interests. The sales are a severe breach of international law, send a gravely wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces, and are detrimental to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. The decision to sell arms to Taiwan is simply inconsistent with US leaders' commitment of not supporting ‘Taiwan independence.' China deplores and firmly opposes it and has lodged serious protests to the US, according to the statement. The spokesperson called on the US to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop abetting and supporting ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces in seeking ‘Taiwan independence' by building up its military.- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council also issued remarks regarding the arms sales and Lai's stopover. Global Times reports: -China firmly opposes official interaction between the US and Taiwan region, firmly opposes leader of the Taiwan region making ‘stopover' in the US in any name or under whatever pretext, a long-standing and clear position, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office said on Sunday. Spokesperson Chen Binhua made the remarks in response to a media question on Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's ‘stopover' in Hawaii in his trip to so-called ‘diplomatic allies' in the Pacific. Chen noted that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged serious protests with the US. Since Lai took office, his authorities have stubbornly adhered to a separatist stance of ‘Taiwan independence', continuously sought ‘independence' and made provocations, escalating cross-Straits confrontation, threatening peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and severely harming the safety and well-being of the Taiwan compatriots, Chen said. No matter what tricks the Lai authorities adopt to manipulate in the pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence', they cannot shake the basic pattern of the international community's adherence to the one-China principle, nor can they obstruct the historical trend of China's eventual reunification, the spokesperson said. ‘We urge the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, fully see the separatist nature and damage of Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, handle the Taiwan question with prudence,' Chen said.- On the arms sales, the spokesperson basically reiterated MoFA's remarks. When asked about the DPP's reaction to the arms package, Global Times reports: -Chen (Binhua) warned the Lai Ching-te authorities that buying weapons will not bring security, and ‘protection fees' cannot save ‘Taiwan independence'. Relying on the US to pursue ‘independence' is destined to fail, and attempting to achieve ‘independence' through military means will only lead Taiwan to danger and ultimately to its own demise. The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests, Chen said. ‘No one and no force should underestimate the firm will and strong capability of the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.'- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua reports: Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, said that on Nov. 29 and 30, the militaries of China and Russia conducted a joint strategic air patrol over the Sea of Japan and the western part of the Pacific Ocean. The strategic patrol jointly conducted by the two air forces effectively tested and enhanced the joint training and operation capabilities. Reuters reports that -President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday the presence of a Russian attack submarine in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea was ‘very worrisome'. ‘That's very concerning. Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines, is very worrisome,' Marcos told reporters, referring to part of the South China Sea within the Philippines' maritime zone. A Russian Kilo-class submarine was sighted 80 nautical miles off the western province of Occidental Mindoro on Nov. 28, Navy spokesperson Roy Vincent Trinidad said in a statement on Monday, confirming a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper. Philippine navy frigate Jose Rizal established radio contact with the Russian submarine, which confirmed its identity as UFA 490 and its intent. ‘The Russian vessel stated it was awaiting improved weather conditions before proceeding to Vladivostok, Russia,' Trinidad said, without elaborating on why it was in the area.- Just before heading to Beijing, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock lashed out at China. Bloomberg reports: -‘Instead of taking responsibility for peace and security in the world as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is opposing our core European interests with its economic and weapons aid to Russia,' Baerbock said in an emailed statement before departing Berlin airport on Sunday for her two-day visit to Beijing. Vladimir ‘Putin's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is a direct threat to our peace. I will also speak in Beijing about the fact that we cannot simply ignore this in our relations with China'. The European Union is proposing to sanction several Chinese firms that it claims helped Russian companies develop attack drones that were deployed against Ukraine. Baerbock will meet her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing to address this issue, her spokesman said. Germany's top diplomat will also discuss the humanitarian situation in China, as well as EU tariffs against Chinese electric vehicles that were introduced in October. Brussels has claimed that Chinese state subsidies for EVs distort competition. The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz voted against the tariffs because it fears counter measures against its own car industry. But in contrast to Scholz, who advocates a more pragmatic approach to China, Baerbock, a member of the co-governing Greens, is known for her more critical position. ‘As Europe's largest economy, we stand up for our interests just as the Chinese leadership does for its interests,' Baerbock said. ‘If our economic competition is abused for system competition, we will not turn a blind eye to it.' Germany would therefore ‘not tolerate others violating the international rules of the game to the detriment of German and European industry — be it through state-subsidized overproduction or on the subject of human rights, when ILO core labor standards are ignored for competitive advantage,' she added.

MSS' Warning on Open-Source Information	Hi folks, I am summarising a piece that was published on the Ministry of State Security's WeChat account. This was republished by Xinhua today. The piece basically talks about the need to be cautious with open-source information. The warning is that open-source information can become a source of leaking of secret and sensitive information. Before I get to the article, I think this is the opportune moment to announce that the next edition of my 6-week online course Watching China is scheduled for early February 2025. The course is designed to equip those aspiring to study and analyse China's domestic and foreign policies with the skills that are essential to engage in such a task. Over a period of six weeks, Watching China will provide an introduction to the philosophy, structures and processes of the Leninist Party-state system, discuss the role of ideology and familiarise students with the language of Communist Party discourse. Students will also be introduced to key analytical frameworks and China's information ecosystem allowing them to undertake effective open source research. Further details will be provided in the days ahead. If you would like to be personally notified when applications open, please can drop me a line through the link below or by replying to this email. Back to the MSS' article. The article says that in the era of big data and cyberspace, -some sensitive information is being publicly disseminated through the Internet without undergoing declassification processing or risk assessment, thereby becoming an important source of open source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security.- It adds: -Open-source information generally refers to legally accessible information resources, including but not limited to social media posts, online forum discussions, blog articles, news reports, satellite images, etc. These information sources are extensive, have low acquisition costs, and often contain a wealth of valuable data and intelligence, which may become a critical source of network-based intelligence theft for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Be vigilant when it comes to leaks in procurement bidding. Classified procurement refers to procurement activities that require confidentiality measures during the process to ensure the security of state secrets, such as classified construction projects or digitization of classified archives. In practice, due to inadequate management or weak confidentiality awareness among personnel, procurement content or purposes may be improperly disclosed, or classified technical parameters may be marked in public bidding documents on occasion, threatening the security of state secrets. Be vigilant of leaks during information disclosure. According to regulations, government agencies must, as per the law, conduct confidentiality reviews of information proposed for public disclosure before making it public. However, it has been found in practice that some agencies fail to strictly follow confidentiality review regulations when publishing information, uploading classified documents to public websites, thereby leading to incidents of information leaks. Be vigilant of leaks on social media. In today's society, self-media is flourishing, and videos casually filmed or comments posted by netizens can attract widespread attention. Some outdoor enthusiasts share images with classified sensitive forbidden areas as backgrounds on social media to attract attention. Such behaviour not only severely disrupts the management order of classified and sensitive areas but may also be exploited by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security. ，、、、、。，，，。——。，，、。，、，、，。——。，，。，，，，。——。，，、。，，，. The next bit of the article says that: -The openness and easy accessibility of open-source information makes sensitive information easily exploitable by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Foreign espionage and intelligence agencies can gather fragmented, blurred data together, and through big data correlation analysis, can implement precise, continuous, and stable information tracking on targets, obtaining valuable intelligence. This poses great challenges when it comes to maintaining confidentiality, necessitating the adoption of stricter and more effective measures to prevent information leaks. Improve systems and clarify responsibilities. Relevant units should establish and improve confidentiality responsibility systems and management protocols, clearly defining the confidentiality duties and authorities of leaders and staff at all levels. Strengthen the management and supervision of personnel involved in dealing with classified information to ensure strict compliance with confidentiality regulations and systems. Strengthen control and conduct strict reviews. Relevant units should strengthen information disclosure control at the source, strictly implement confidentiality review systems, absolutely prohibit the disclosure of classified information, and implement categorised and graded protection for non-classified but sensitive information. Network platforms should strictly fulfil main body responsibilities, strengthen full-process management of information circulation, improve content review mechanisms, and ensure compliance in editing and compilation, conduct declassification before publication, and review materials before re-sharing. Raise awareness and be cautious in speech and action. Citizens in general should enhance risk prevention awareness, be vigilant against behaviours that endanger national security, maintain clear-headedness and caution in network-related behaviours, and prevent themselves from becoming sources of open-source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. 。、，，、、，，，。——，。，。，。——，。，，，。，，，、、。——，。，，、，. The piece ends with a call to action, i.e., to report suspicious activities through the 12339 hotline, through www.12339.gov.cn, the WeChat public account of the Ministry of State Security or directly to the local national security authorities.

Zhao met with Spanish King Felipe VI and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and held talks with Pedro Rollan, president of the Spanish Senate, and Francina Armengol, speaker of the Spanish Congress of Deputies. Xinhua reports: Zhao told King Felipe VI that -China is committed to collaborating with Spain to deepen their traditional friendship, uphold mutual understanding and respect for each other's core interests and major concerns, achieve new cooperation achievements, and tackle global challenges like climate change together, ultimately striving for shared development and prosperity…The King said as next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of China-Spain comprehensive strategic partnership, Spain will deepen its cooperation with China in areas such as trade and investment, new energy, climate change, culture, education, and the promotion of each other's languages, bringing fresh momentum to the growth of their relationship.- The report adds: -When meeting with Sanchez, Zhao said Spain is an important strategic partner of China in Europe.

He stressed the need to establish a fair, safe, non-discriminatory, and predictable business environment for enterprises. China has always regarded Europe as a key priority in its diplomacy and an important partner in achieving Chinese-style modernization. China is willing to promote the high-level development of China-Spain relations to contribute to the steady and long-term growth of China-Europe relations, said Zhao. Sanchez said Spain abides by the one-China policy. Extending welcome for China's investment, the prime minister called for more cooperation in such fields as trade, electric vehicles, agricultural products, culture and sports. Spain is willing to play an active role in the European Union (EU) and push for better development of EU-China relations, said Sanchez, adding the Spanish side will strengthen coordination with China on international and multilateral affairs, uphold the authority of international law, and work together to safeguard global peace and stability.- In his meetings with Rollan and Armengol, Xinhua reports that Zhao said the NPC -is willing to strengthen exchanges with the Spanish Senate and the Congress of Deputies at all levels, promote mutual learning on legislation and supervision, and timely formulate, revise and approve legal documents conducive to bilateral cooperation…Zhao underscored the readiness to advance the exchanges between the two countries' legislators, and cement bilateral collaboration within multilateral frameworks such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

Dragon TV: China recently rolled out measures to facilitate cross-border travel. Last week, a new batch of countries were added to the visa-free list. We noticed that China is becoming an increasingly popular destination for foreign tourists. Places in China have become trending searches on multiple tourism platforms, and the number of reservations for tours to China surged on many foreign e-commerce tourism platforms. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning: China has extended the visa-free policy to 38 countries since the end of last year and so far has realized comprehensive mutual visa exemption with 25 countries in total. We have also made Chinese visa application more efficient and easier by improving the visa application form, canceling visa reservation, expanding the scope of fingerprinting exemption, lowering visa fees and other measures. While streamlining the procedure of travelling to China, we are also committed to making life and work in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign friends. Places including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong Province improved payment services, including by mobile devices, bank cards and cash, to make online shopping and transportation more problem-free for foreign friends. Chinese telecom providers, by opening new shops, improving foreign language services and launching new packages, have enabled foreign friends to access and use 5G network more conveniently. More cities have set up special windows to provide one-stop service to help foreign nationals to get work permit and residence permit faster. We will make continued effort to facilitate cross-border travel. We welcome friends from all countries to visit China, experience the country's glamour and share in the dividends of China's development. Subscribe now Mao Ning also responded to the G7 Foreign Ministers' statement, which had a lot of content related to China. The G7 statement said: -We will take appropriate measures, consistent with our legal systems, against actors in China and in other third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions and other entities that facilitate Russia's acquisition of equipment and items for its defense industrial base…We urge countries with ties to Russia and the DPRK, including China, to uphold international law by opposing this dangerous expansion of the conflict and implementing all relevant UNSC resolutions.- And then there is this big chunk on China: -As we seek constructive and stable relations with China, we recognize the importance of direct and candid engagement to express concerns and manage differences. We reaffirm our readiness to cooperate with China to address global challenges We are deeply concerned by China's increasing support to Russia and Russia's defense industrial base, which is decisively enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and to reconstitute its armed forces and has significant broad-based security implications. China must prevent its companies from transferring weapons, especially attack Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), dual-use materials, including weapons components, and equipment. We also call on China to step up efforts to promote international peace and security and to press Russia to stop its military aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine.- We recognize the importance of China in global trade. We are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development, indeed a growing China that plays by international rules and norms would be of global interest. However, we express our concerns about China's non-market policies and practices that are leading to harmful overcapacity and market distortions, undermining our workers, industries and economic resilience and security. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. Together with our partners, we are de-risking and diversifying supply chains, where necessary and appropriate to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities and to foster resilience to economic coercion. We further call on China to refrain from adopting export control measures, particularly on critical minerals, that could lead to significant supply chain disruptions. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea. We reiterate our opposition to China's militarization and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and reaffirm its important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and seas. We continue to oppose China's dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries' freedom of navigation and overflight. We express deep concern over the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine and Vietnamese vessels. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties. Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic position of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated One-China policies. We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it is. We remain concerned by the human rights situation in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We remain concerned by the erosion of civil society, human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. The sentencing of 45 pro-democracy politicians and activists marks a further deterioration of democratic participation and pluralism, which undermines confidence in the rule of law as enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and therefore Hong Kong's and the People's Republic of China's international legal obligations. We urge China and the Hong Kong authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations. We call on China not to conduct or condone activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities and the integrity of our democratic institutions, and to act in strict accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Meets Lee Hsien Loong - China-Samoa Joint Statement - Zhong Yin Commentary on Recent Violent Crimes - CPC Delegation Visits Sri Lanka - Boosting Te...	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. Before we get to today's paper, I am sharing my latest podcast with my colleague Anushka Saxena, discussing the key takeaways from Xi Jinping's recent visit to Peru and Brazil. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong. Xi praised the -remarkable achievements Singapore made during Lee's tenure as prime minister.- He called on the two sides to -strengthen high-level exchanges, further strengthen the alignment of development strategies, deepen cooperation in various fields, bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, and make greater contributions to regional peace and prosperity.- He said that the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park is a -vivid example of bilateral cooperation and bears witness to Singapore's deep involvement in China's reform and opening up-. Xi added: -China will always focus on running its own affairs well, and has confidence in maintaining sound economic momentum in the long run and achieving high-quality development. China welcomes Singapore to continue being a forerunner in cooperation with China, advance major cooperation projects, seize the opportunities brought by digital and green development, and write a new chapter in bilateral cooperation in the new era. Xi Jinping pointed out that the world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. In the face of risks and challenges, no single country can be immune. Upholding solidarity, cooperation, openness and inclusiveness is the right path to tread. China is willing to work together with Singapore to practice genuine multilateralism, follow the trend of economic globalization, safeguard international fairness and justice, resist bloc confrontation and division, and build an Asian community with a shared destiny.- ，，。，，，、，。，。，，、。，，，，、，. As per the report, Lee said: -China has already found a successful path to modernization. Singapore is full of confidence in China's future and believes that China will maintain development and prosperity, making greater contributions to global peace and development. Singapore will continue to commit to deepening cooperation with China and actively participate in China's modernization process. In the current complex international situation, all countries should adopt a long-term perspective, uphold multilateralism, commit to unity and cooperation, and jointly address risks and challenges to better benefit their peoples.- ，，，。，。，，，，，. They also discussed China-US relations and the regional situation. Wang Huning also met with Lee. Xinhua reports Wang said that -China is willing to maintain close, high-level exchange with Singapore, strengthen practical cooperation in various fields, enhance the friendship between the two peoples, push for new progress in China-Singapore relations, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- Do also note that on Tuesday, the militaries of China and Singapore held a -force-on-force joint drill- at a training base in Henan. China's Ministry of National Defense said that the exercise was divided into three main phases: infiltration and positioning, assault and rescue, and evacuation. Subscribe now Xi also met with visiting Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in Beijing. Xinhua's report says: Xi said that -China is willing to make empowering Pacific Island countries to tackle climate change a priority in its cooperation with these countries. China will work with Pacific Island countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, uphold fairness, justice and the common interests of the Global South, and build a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi told Mata'afa. Noting that Samoa was among the first Pacific Island countries to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China nearly five decades ago, Xi said the two countries have maintained traditional friendship, mutual respect, equal treatment and win-win cooperation. He said China supports Samoa in safeguarding its sovereignty and independence, and exploring a development path suited to its national conditions. China will continue to provide assistance to Samoa in its economic and social development, and tap the potential of economy, trade, investment, agriculture and fisheries to achieve common development, Xi said. Xi stressed that China does not attach political strings to its assistance to the Pacific Island countries, and China's policy toward Pacific Island countries is open and inclusive, without targeting any third party or engaging in geopolitical competition or spheres of influence.- Among other things, -Mata'afa said Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle and supports the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi.- The two sides issued a joint statement too. This is available on Page 3. The English version is also available. Key points: -The Chinese side supports Samoa in upholding its sovereignty and independence. Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle, and recognizes there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory; the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Furthermore, Samoa recognizes efforts by the Chinese government to realize national reunification, and that issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang and human rights are internal matters for China to deal with. By the same token, Samoa believes that the South China Sea issue is a matter for China to settle amicably through peaceful negotiations and dialogue with all parties involved.- -China reiterated the principles of respect President Xi Jinping believes are essential for developing relations with Pacific island countries, namely: respect for sovereignty and independence; respect for the will of the countries; respect the ethnic and cultural traditions and respect for the countries' commitment to unity. China reaffirms the absence of conditionality to its assistance. It neither imposes its will onto countries nor makes empty promises in assisting countries, values commended by Samoa.- It mentions GDI, GSI, GCI and building a community for a shared future of mankind, along with BRI. -The two sides agreed to reaching a mutual visa free arrangement as soon as possible. The Chinese side will continue to send medical team to Samoa, provide scholarships and various training opportunities and support Samoa in Chinese language teaching.- -The two sides agreed to advocate humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, strengthen communication and coordination on international and regional affairs, defend the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, oppose hegemony and power politics, and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- -The Chinese side will within the framework of South-South cooperation continue to provide assistance and support within its capacity to Samoa's climate response through bilateral and multilateral channels. The two sides will deepen cooperation in disaster prevention and mitigation and emergency management and will cooperate to build a low carbon demonstration zone for addressing climate change under South-South cooperation.- -The two sides agreed to deepen practical maritime cooperation in ocean observation and forecasting, marine disaster prevention and mitigation, marine ecosystem protection and restoration, marine spatial planning, blue economy and other fields, consider a blue partnership, and promote the building of a sustainable maritime community. The two sides reiterated their commitment to firmly upholding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the cornerstone and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and called on all countries to fulfill international obligations and the prudent handling of related issues.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the front page is a report on Li Qiang meeting with the Samoan PM. Xinhua reports: -China is ready to work with Samoa to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, further deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other's core interests, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation, and constantly enrich the connotation of China-Samoa comprehensive strategic partnership, he said. Li pointed out that China is willing to strengthen the synergy of development strategies with Samoa, expand economic and trade cooperation, promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen cooperation on agriculture, fisheries, clean energy, and disaster prevention and mitigation, and promote common development and prosperity. Noting that both China and Samoa belong to the Global South, Li expressed China's willingness to strengthen communication and coordination with Samoa in the multilateral arena, jointly tackle the challenge of climate change, promote an equal and orderly multi-polar world and economic globalization that benefits all, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Vice President Han Zheng's remarks at the second China International Supply Chain Expo. Han said: -President Xi Jinping has emphasized that maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for promoting world economic development. Over the years, China has been not only a participant and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation but also a steadfast defender and builder, making active contributions to global economic development. China continues to improve its industrial system, providing strong support for the operation of global industrial and supply chains; adheres to open cooperation, injecting continuous momentum into global industrial and supply chains; and leverages its ultra-large-scale market, opening vast space for the operation of global industrial and supply chains. China is willing to work with all countries to promote the establishment of an open global economic system and to ensure the stability and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.- ，，。，、，、，。，；，；，。，. Han then made three points: China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalization, promote industrial and production capacity cooperation with various countries, and better achieve mutual promotion of industries, shared benefits, and win-win development. China will deeply implement its innovation-driven development strategy, accelerate the development of new quality productive forces, and create greater opportunities for cooperation to foster the deep integration of industrial and supply chains. China is willing to expand cooperation with various countries in green industries, clean energy and other fields to help the world's green development. 。，。，、，、、。，。，，。，。、，. Subscribe now Page 2: There is an important Zhong Yin commentary today discussing the spate of recent knife and car attacks that have taken place in China. The fact that we are seeing this commentary is an indication of the serious concern at the highest levels about the increase in these incidents. The article, however, is rather shallow. There is no reflection about policy issues, economic or social, that are leading to the rise in such crimes. Rather, the call is to intensify crackdowns and prevention at source to remedial actions. The article says: -Recently, several extreme cases endangering public safety have occurred one after another, with their nature being exceptionally vile. In this regard, we must learn profound lessons, draw broader conclusions from specific instances, and maintain a high level of vigilance as if treading on thin ice, strengthen the prevention of risks at their source, intensify efforts in combating, managing, and preventing such incidents, and strive with all efforts to safeguard the lives and safety of the people and maintain social stability.- ，。，、，，，，. -Nothing is more precious than the lives and safety of the people. Innocent citizens suffering harm and vibrant lives being abruptly lost are profoundly shocking and heartbreaking! The public deeply empathises with the pain of the victims and their families and strongly condemns these extreme, retaliatory crimes against society. There is a unified call for the perpetrators to be punished severely in accordance with the law to serve as a deterrent. People from all walks of life have extended a helping hand, doing their utmost to treat the injured, save lives, and minimize harm to the greatest extent possible. Defending life and preventing crime have become a shared understanding and collective action.- 。，，、！，，。，、，，、. -Using extreme actions to retaliate against society and harm others is utterly unforgivable. Such criminals who obliterate humanity and conscience are despicable. Regardless of any personal reasons, any attempts to excuse such extreme behavior have no rationality, no legitimacy, will not obtain any person's understanding or sympathy, and will only receive universal condemnation and disdain. Venting personal grievances by targeting innocent people's lives and seeking attention through extreme means are actions that leave an eternal stain of infamy. They solve no problems but instead expose the perpetrators' inner malice and depravity, permanently nailing them to the pillar of shame. What awaits them is the stern punishment of the law and the contempt of the public.- ，，。，、，，，。，，，，、，。，，. The commentary then says that we must never relax or waver in safeguarding people's lives. -Party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions of the Party Central Committee. They must bear in mind that public safety is the most fundamental aspect of people's livelihoods and must put the protection of people's lives and safety in a more important position. They must severely crack down on extreme criminal acts in accordance with the law without mercy and severe violent crimes must be punished with a heavy hand, leaving no opportunity for any criminal to exploit. It is imperative to fully assume the political responsibility of ‘promoting local development and ensuring local safety'. We must adhere to and develop the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, building a comprehensive governance mechanism to address social conflicts that includes prevention at the source, investigation and screening, dispute resolution, and emergency response. A robust public safety protection network should be established, along with improved systems for social psychological services and crisis intervention, to fully safeguard the peace and stability of the broader social landscape.- ，、。，，，、，，，-、-。--，、、、，，，. The article ends by saying that -each of us is a beneficiary of social stability and should also be a guardian of public safety. We must take a clear stand against actions that harm social stability, fulfil our social responsibilities, be law-abiding citizens, cherish the hard-won safe environment, and work together to foster a harmonious and friendly social atmosphere.- ，，，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Wang Yi's meeting with Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto in Beijing. Xinhua says: -Wang said the practical bilateral cooperation has yielded fruitful results, which fully demonstrates that as long as there is mutual respect, trust, and support, economic cooperation between the two sides will enjoy broad prospects. Wang expressed the hope that the new European Union institutions will adhere to the orientation and cooperative tone of the China-EU partnership, view China's development objectively, pursue a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and promote the sustained, healthy, and stable development of China-EU relations.- On the issue of China's ties with Europe, do note this SCMP report: -The European Union and China are not close to finalising a deal that would end their long-running electric vehicle dispute, according to a senior EU official, who called reports suggesting otherwise -confusing-. -I think there have been some quite confusing reports about the imminent deal on battery electric vehicles,- said Sabine Weyand, the EU's director general for trade, said in Brussels on Tuesday. -We have had 50 hours of discussions with our Chinese counterparts. They were constructive, but they have not led to an agreement on price undertakings. And there are structural issues that remain unresolved,- she said. The dispute concerns an anti-subsidy investigation conducted over the course of a year by the European Commission. The inquiry found that Beijing had distributed substantial state subsidies across China's electric vehicle sector and led to the EU imposing countervailing duties on EV imports from China at the end of October. The commission argues that the subsidies have assisted in China's enormous growth in the sector and fears that if allowed to continue unfettered, the underpriced imports will harm the sales of Europe's own EV industry. The tariffs, which range from 7 per cent for Tesla to a top end of 35.3 per cent for state-owned SAIC, have become a huge bone of contention in the EU-China relationship. Some EU member states – including Germany, Sweden and Spain – have urged the commission to negotiate a settlement which would make some tariff reductions in exchange for a commitment from Chinese companies to set a minimum price on EVs sold in the EU. The trade dispute has spread to other sectors too, with Beijing retaliating by launching anti-dumping probes against EU brandy, dairy and pork shipments.- Meanwhile, the European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc.

During the meetings, the delegation introduced the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and had in-depth exchanges with the Sri Lankan side on China-Sri Lanka relations and cooperation in various fields. Expressing its firm commitment to a friendly policy toward China, the Sri Lankan side hoped to deepen cooperation in various fields between China and Sri Lanka, share China's development opportunities, further strengthen inter-party relations and exchanges of experience in governance, and promote the comprehensive development and expansion of China-Sri Lanka relations.- Subscribe now Page 4: Two reports to note.

The report says that in April this year, the People's Bank of China, together with the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments, set up a 500 billion yuan re-lending facility to support scientific and technological innovation and technological transformation. Since relevant policies were issued, -as of November 15, banks have signed loan contracts with 1,737 enterprises and projects totaling nearly 400 billion yuan-. The report says that financial institutions have made independent decisions on these loans. For the loans that meet the requirements, the PBOC can issue re-lending funds to financial institutions amounting to 60% of the loan principal. The report adds: -In line with the meeting's directives, banking institutions will fully leverage policy resources to comprehensively support listed enterprises and projects, ensuring maximum coverage of financial support. They will focus on improving the efficiency of loan review and disbursement, optimizing mechanisms and processes, enhancing resource allocation, revising and refining credit management policies based on the latest industrial policy standards, establishing a ‘green channel' for loan review and approval, and developing loan products that better align with the financing needs of startup technology companies and small-to-medium-sized enterprises undergoing technological transformation. This includes expanding the range of acceptable collateral and accelerating loan signing and investment timelines. The PBOC's branch offices will work closely with relevant government departments, strategically directing more support towards private and small-to-medium enterprises. By implementing nuanced, targeted approaches, they aim to enhance the efficiency of financial institution-business interactions and create a more supportive environment for financial services.- ，，-、-；，，，，--，，，。，，，.

Preventing Food Waste - Li Qiang Meets CEOs on Supply Chain Stability - Coordinating Development & Security - CPC-CEEC Political Parties Dialogue	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 26, 2024. Page 1: There's a report on the publication of the full action plan for food conservation and the reduction of food waste is published in the paper today. The plan seeks to establish a more sound long-term mechanism by the end of 2027. Xinhua reports that: -The loss rates of grain and food during their production, storage, transportation and processing will be below the average international levels by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, per capita food waste per meal in the catering industry, government canteens, school canteens and enterprise canteens will decrease significantly, and food waste will be effectively curbed.- I am not detailing the entire document. But I thought this was interesting, because it identifies certain incentives to encourage reduced consumption. -Encourage consumers to purchase small-portion meals through methods such as establishing environmental protection virtual accounts, granting conservation points, and issuing discount coupons, etc. Support food producers, operators, retailers and others to directly donate food that meets safety and quality requirements to welfare institutions and assistance institutions in their locality on a regular basis. Strictly implement price tagging regulations, with catering service operators clearly indicating to consumers the prices of the catering and services provided, as well as prices of individual dishes within set meals. Encourage catering service operators hosting banquets to negotiate anti-food waste obligations with consumers, with contracts able to include a separate anti-waste clause.- 、、。、、。，、。，. The document also calls to -make food conservation an important part of the life of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers-, as part of a campaign of Youth Guarding China's Grain. In addition, it calls to -integrate food security education and thrift education into ideological and political courses, national conditions education and other educational and teaching activities in primary, secondary and high schools…- --，、，--，。、、，、，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, a report on the page informs that the Arabic language version of a book featuring discourses on Chinese modernization by President Xi Jinping has been published by the Central Compilation and Translation Press. The book collects a series of important discourses by Xi between November 2012 and October 2023. Third, there's a report with Li Qiang's comments at a symposium with representatives of enterprises and organizations participating in the upcoming second China International Supply Chain Expo. Xinhua says that present at the symposium were representatives of Apple Inc., Rio Tinto, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. and the US-China Business Council, among others. Li told them that -China is a key link in the global supply chain and will continue to take practical actions to maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain.- He added that -while global economic growth now lacks momentum, certain protectionist acts and moves that overstretch the concept of security continue to damage global industrial and supply chains, pushing up corporate costs further, reducing economic efficiency and hindering common development…Li called for firm efforts to safeguard stable, unimpeded global industrial and supply chains, as well as the common interests of all parties.- He then said: -Since the beginning of this year, China's economic operation has been generally stable and steady. We will continue to increase counter-cyclical adjustments, promote the continued improvement of China's economy, continuously cultivate and strengthen new momentum, and solidly promote high-quality development, so as to contribute more to deepening global supply chain cooperation and promoting global economic recovery. We will accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system, and continue to provide solid support for the efficient operation of the global supply chain with stronger supporting capabilities and more stable production capacity supply. We will focus on strengthening the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, better integrate into international innovation cooperation, and continue to provide strong momentum for the transformation and upgrading of the global supply chain. We will firmly promote high-level opening up to the outside world, further expand market access, welcome more foreign companies to carry out industrial cooperation in China, and continue to provide a broad space for the expansion of global supply chain cooperation.- ，，。，、，，，，，、。，、，。，，。，，，.

As reported on Page 1, Bettel also met with Ding Xuexiang and with ILD chief Liu Jianchao. Xinhua's report on the Wang-Bettel meeting says: -China speaks highly of Luxembourg's positive and practical policy toward China, and stands ready to work with Luxembourg to consolidate political mutual trust, enhance complementarity, create new growth points for green development cooperation, increase people-to-people exchanges and push for further progress in bilateral relations, he said. Wang noted that next year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations. China and the EU are partners not rivals, he said, expressing the hope that the EU side will uphold its strategic autonomy. China is willing to work with Luxembourg to promote the sustained and sound development of China-EU relations, Wang said. Bettel said that Luxembourg firmly adheres to the one-China principle and looks forward to closer cooperation with China. As one of the founding members of the EU, Luxembourg is willing to enhance EU-China mutual trust and promote EU-China partnership. Bettel noted that China is a major country worthy of trust, voicing the hope that China will play a bigger role in world peace and stability.- Next, there's a report on the CPC's Dialogue with Political Parties of Central and Eastern European Countries. Xinhua reports: -Noting that the 2021 China-CEEC Summit outlined a blueprint for the development of China-CEEC relations, Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that the CPC is willing to work with CEEC political parties to deepen strategic and theoretical communication, tap into the potential of relevant cooperation platforms, and promote the quality and effectiveness of China-CEEC cooperation. The foreign attendees said that China's development path has provided an alternative approach to development for the world, and that they are willing to strengthen exchange and dialogue with the CPC to enhance mutual understanding, and to promote the development of Europe-China relations. The event was themed ‘China's Modernization and New Opportunities for China-CEEC Relations: Contribution of Political Parties' and attracted nearly 50 representatives of 19 political parties in 12 countries across Central and Eastern Europe.- Finally, there's a report on He Lifeng's meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong in Suzhou. Xinhua says: He said that -the two sides should focus on the new positioning of bilateral relations, make full use of cooperation platforms such as the Suzhou Industrial Park, and work together to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. Noting that Singapore-China relations have been deepening with strong development momentum under the guidance of the two countries' top leaders, Lee said Singapore is willing to work with China to push for new development in major cooperative projects, and further consolidate and upgrade bilateral relations. The two senior officials also attended the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park High-Quality Development Forum on Monday. The two sides comprehensively reviewed the achievements of the park in the past 30 years, and mapped out the direction and focus of cooperation for its next stage. They agreed the two countries should give better play to the pioneering role of the park, deepen institutional reform, and work together to build a world-class science and technology park that is open and innovative. They also witnessed the signing of cooperation documents.- Leave a comment Page 9: There's an article by He Yiting, from the Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era of the Central Party School, discussing the significance of national security. He writes that: -In a certain sense, the history of human social development is also the history of human efforts to achieve and satisfy security needs, and to promote societal development in relative stability. Security also reflects the level of human civilization, especially at the national and social levels, where humans increasingly view security as the foundation of civilizational progress. It is precisely this concept of security that motivates human society as a whole to continuously pursue tranquility, stability, and peace, striving to eliminate various conflicts, chaos, and disorder. Security is like air and sunlight - beneficial without being noticed, but difficult to survive without.- ，、。，，。、，、。，，. National security is the foundation of national rejuvenation and an important cornerstone of stabilizing the country. With the deepening of economic globalization and the development of human civilization, the connotation and extension of security are constantly expanding. Today, national security mainly refers to the state power, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, people's well-being, sustainable economic and social development and other major interests of the country being relatively free from danger and internal and external threats, as well as the ability to guarantee such a continuous state of security. National security is not only the goal pursued by all the people, but also an important foundation for national development and the fundamental guarantee for the happiness and well-being of the people. ，。，。，、、、、，。，. Subscribe now In the second section, He adds that -one of the keys to achieving modernization is to properly handle the relationship between development and security-; -high-quality development must promote high-level security, and high-level security must be used to ensure high-quality development-. He adds: -Development is the foundation and purpose of security. Only by continuously promoting high-quality development can there be a solid material foundation for people to live and work in peace, for society to be stable and orderly, and for the country to enjoy long-term peace and security, and only then can powerful force support for achieving high-level security be provided. Security is the condition and guarantee of development. If a country cannot hold its security baseline, its political regime may be overturned at any time, its core interests may be invaded at any time, and economic and social development may be interrupted or stagnate at any time. Adhering to the equal emphasis on development and security must mean adhering to the overall planning of development and security as two major matters, being adept at using development achievements to reinforce the strength foundation of national security, and being adept at shaping a security environment favorable to economic and social development. At present, China has entered a period prone to various contradictions and risks. Advancing Chinese-style modernization requires balancing development and security, focusing on resolving various contradictions and problems, and effectively fighting a strategic proactive battle to turn dangers into safety and crises into opportunities.- 。，、、，。。，，，。，，，。，，，，、. This next bit is important: -Achieving high-quality development is the essential requirement of Chinese-style modernization. Development is the Party's top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country. Without the improvement of material conditions through development, it would be impossible to achieve the remarkable accomplishments of Chinese-style modernization, let alone gain broad support from the people. Properly handling the relationship between development and security means we cannot discuss security without development, nor can we halt development due to the existence of risks. Our country is the largest developing nation in the world, and development is the foundation and key to solving all problems. On the new journey, resolving prominent contradictions and problems and preventing and defusing various risks ultimately rely on development. Only by promoting the sustained and healthy development of the economy and society can we lay a solid material foundation for the prosperity of the country, the happiness and well-being of the people, and the harmony and stability of society. This requires the complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, adhering to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, taking the promotion of high-quality development as the theme, deepening supply-side structural reform as the main line, reform and innovation as the fundamental driving force, and meeting the people's growing needs for a better life as the fundamental purpose, constantly enhancing China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength, and providing a more solid foundation and conditions for achieving higher levels and higher levels of security.- 。。，，。，，。，。，，，。，、、。、、，，，，，，、、，. Achieving high-level security is an important guarantee of Chinese-style modernization. Ensuring people live and work in peace and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are inseparable from high-level security guarantees. High-level security is both an inherent requirement of achieving high-quality development and an important yardstick for measuring developmental effectiveness. Without high-level security guarantees, development is like a tree without roots, and the development achievements already made in modernization construction may be lost. With the high-quality advancement of Chinese-style modernization and the continuous expansion of high-level opening up, various foreseeable and unforeseeable risk factors have increased significantly. We must enhance awareness of opportunities and risks, estimate difficulties more fully, think about risks more deeply, grasp contradictions more comprehensively and thoroughly, strengthen foundations, leverage advantages, make up for shortcomings, and reinforce weaknesses in the process of advancing Chinese-style modernization, effectively preventing and responding to potential systemic risks, and guaranteeing the continuous stability of high-quality development through the controllability of one's own security. We must be adept at integrating various conditions and utilizing diverse resources, effectively identifying risk factors across broad spatial and temporal dimensions, reasonably allocating resources between security and development, clarifying the methods for addressing and resolving national security issues, and effectively safeguarding national security.- 。、，。，。，，。、，。，，，，、、、，，。、，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, He writes that to effectively address the challenges of this era, one must adhere to the -overall national security concept as the fundamental guideline, better coordinate development and security, solidly promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities, strive to build a higher level of safe China, and provide strong security guarantees for Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. He makes three points: First, implement the overall national security concept. He calls this -a powerful ideological weapon and action guide for safeguarding and shaping- China's security. He says that it is important to -integrate the maintenance of national security into all aspects of the work of the Party and the state-. -Adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over national security work is the fundamental principle for ensuring the success of national security efforts and the fundamental guarantee for safeguarding national security and social stability. We must uphold the Party's absolute leadership over national security work, prioritize the prevention and resolution of national security risks, and coordinate the advancement of security across various domains. We must adhere to the principle of people-centered security as our purpose, political security as the foundation, economic security as the basis, and military, technological, cultural, and social security as safeguards, and promote international security as the support, integrating external and internal security, territorial and citizen security, traditional and non-traditional security, self-security and collective security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, consolidate the grassroots foundation of national security and social stability, improve the mechanism for participating in global security governance, and safeguard the new development pattern with a new security pattern.- ，，。，，。、、、、，、、、，，，，. Second, establish the correct thinking for maintaining national security. It is necessary to establish the strategic awareness of ‘a game of chess', base ourselves on China and look to the world, and effectively respond to the new situations, new problems and new challenges brought about by the changes in the domestic and international environments by coordinating the domestic and international situations and utilizing domestic and international resources. Adhere to using systematic thinking to grasp the main thread of national security work, comprehensively analyzing security issues and their mutual influences in multiple domains such as politics, military, economy, finance, culture, society, science and technology, network, food, and ecology, placing various types of security within the overall national development framework for coordinated planning, continuously enhancing the ability to shape national security situations, coordinating the relationship between high-quality development and high-level security, promoting linkage and integration of national security work in all aspects, jointly constructing a comprehensive security pattern. Adhere to bottom line thinking and extreme-case thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and use high-probability thinking to deal with low-probability events, having both proactive risk prevention and high-level strategies for responding to and resolving risks and challenges, fighting a well-prepared battle to prevent and resist risks, firmly maintaining the bottom line of not allowing systemic risks to occur. Adhere to using legal thinking and legal means to consolidate ruling position, improve governing methods, enhance governing capabilities, better leveraging the fundamental, stabilizing, and far-reaching guarantee role of rule of law, ensuring long-term peace and stability for the Party and the country, guaranteeing orderly advancement of Chinese-style modernization through comprehensive rule of law. Adhere to dialectical thinking, enhance national security strength through development, and deepen the innovation of national security ideas, systems, and means, create a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, and strive to achieve a dynamic balance between development and security. 。--，、，、，。，、、、、、、、、、，，，，，。，、，，，，，。、、，、、，，。，，、、，，. Third, promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities. In this context, He calls to -strengthen the coordination mechanism for national security work, improve the national security legal system, strategic system, policy system, and risk monitoring and early warning system, improve the security guarantee system in key areas and the coordination and command system for important projects, and build a coordinated and efficient national security protection system.- ，，、、、，，. He also calls to improve public security governance mechanism, emergency response guarantee system, improve the food and drug safety responsibility system, improve the biosafety supervision early warning and prevention and control system, strengthen the network security system construction, and establish an AI safety supervision system. He also wants to improve the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, social work system and mechanism, the legalization of petition work, urban social governance capacity, and social organization management system. The final bit is this: -Improve foreign-related national security mechanisms, establish and refine coordination mechanisms for peripheral security work, strengthen early warning, prevention, control, and protection systems for risks related to overseas interests and investments, deepen international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens and legal entities abroad, improve mechanisms for counter-sanctions, counter-interference, and countering ‘long-arm jurisdiction', enhance mechanisms for safeguarding maritime rights and interests, and improve mechanisms for participating in global security governance.- ，，、、，，、，、、--，，.

Messages from Xi's APEC, G20 Visits - Discussing the Building of the Chinese Discourse and Narrative System	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 25, 2024. Page 1: Today's front page carries two feature articles discussing Xi's trips to Peru and Brazil. The first article talks about his visit to Lima for the APEC summit. It says that: -The diplomatic footprints of this great Eastern power demonstrate its pioneering and enterprising spirit, its vision and responsibility, and reflect its growing international influence, appeal and shaping power.- The first part of the article talks about some of the key developments: China-Peru ties were upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Since Xi's last visit to Peru in 2016, bilateral trade volume has increased by 1.6 times, and the stock of Chinese companies' investment in Peru has doubled, bringing tangible benefits to the people of both countries. 15 years ago, Peru became the first Latin American country to sign a package of FTAs with China. During this visit, the two sides formally signed the protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement. The two heads of state attended the opening ceremony of the Port of Chancay. The second part deals with APEC: The article reiterates that economic globalisation was the theme of Xi's speech. It quotes this bit from Xi's speech: -Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail.- And this: -We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- There's this quote when talking about economic globalisation: -The world watches and sighs: -China is the true leader of openness and cooperation- ... -Chairman Xi makes us feel China's stability and reliability- … -The world needs leaders like Chairman Xi-... ，：------… The final section deals with Xi's bilateral meetings, beginning with the meeting with Biden. The article says: Over the past 4 years, although China-US relations have experienced ups and downs, they have also carried out dialogue and cooperation, and overall achieved stability. 4，，，. President Xi listed seven experiences and inspirations that the two countries should draw from the course of their relations, i.e., to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. ，7：，、，，、，，，. The report adds: -The dust has settled on the US election, and the world is paying close attention to the future direction of China-US relations. ‘China is willing to continue to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the US government, and strive to achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations for the benefit of the people of both countries', President Xi Jinping clarified his position. ，。-、、，，。-. It also talks about Xi's argument for the four unchanged: China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged.- The piece then talks about Xi's other bilateral meetings. It ends with this: -Each dazzling achievement in cooperation makes the world more certain that China is not only an ancient civilization, but also an opportunity for prosperity and a model for development. Each firm policy declaration also makes the Asia-Pacific and the world more convinced that ‘the next ‘China' will still be China'. Listen to these Chinese voices resonating on the grand stage of Asia-Pacific cooperation: ‘China will comprehensively deepen reform and continue to inject strong momentum into the global economy'; ‘China will promote high-quality development and continue to lead the world economy in improving quality and efficiency'; ‘China will unswervingly follow the path of green development and continue to provide important momentum for global green transformation'; ‘China will build a new system of open economy at a higher level and continue to share China's development opportunities with the world'; ‘China welcomes all parties to continue riding China's development express train, develop together with China's economy, and work together to achieve modernization of all countries in the world characterized by peaceful development, mutual benefit and cooperation, and common prosperity' ... Some scholars point out that unlike the historical ‘rise of great powers', China's development is the rise of a ‘civilizational state'. Having seen so many landscapes and experienced so many storms, Chinese civilization has, over more than 5,000 years, forged a progressive spirit, an inclusive mindset, and an unwavering belief in peaceful development.- ，，，、。，，-‘'，-。：-，-；-，-；-，-；-，-；-，，、、-……，--，--。，，5000，、、. The second article deals with the G20 summit in Rio. The first section talks about poverty alleviation and covers Xi's speech in which he talks about It says that China's achievements provide -accumulation of poverty alleviation experience and innovation in poverty reduction methods- along with giving the Global South -confidence and hope from China's story.- ，、，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The second section says that in his other speech, Xi made the -most systematic and complete exposition on the issue of global governance reform.- The article adds: -Every step is a choice for the future. In the face of increasingly intense competition between economic globalisation and anti-globalisation, the world expects the G20 to make the right choice: continuously promoting the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, avoiding the politicisation of economic issues and the artificial fragmentation of global markets, and refraining from using the banner of green and low-carbon initiatives to implement protectionism ... These voices are not only China's proposals but have also become a harmonious chorus gathering strength from more and more contributors.- ，。，G20。，、，、……，，. It adds: -Looking around the world today, governance deficits are often closely related to fairness deficits. The international balance of power has undergone profound changes, and the long-delayed reform of the global governance system is imperative … China firmly advocates guiding the reform of global governance with the principles of fairness and justice. ‘Building a just world requires the G20 to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equal cooperation, and win-win outcomes, supporting the ‘Global South' countries in achieving greater development. Within and beyond the venue, the resonance and support for China's proposals are unceasing…- ，。，，。，。：-，、、，‘'。-，：---，-……，，-，-. The next few sections simply recap Xi's bilateral meetings. I've covered those over the past week. Next, there's a report on the publication of a new book on Xi's discourses on law-based governance of the military. Xinhua says: -The discourses were excerpted from speeches and written works by Xi between November 2012 and June 2024. The CMC has urged military officers and soldiers at all levels to thoroughly study the book and especially required senior officers to play an exemplary role in respecting, learning about, observing and applying laws.- As this Economist article notes, data from China Media Project shows that in his first decade in power, around 120 volumes of Xi's discourses have been published. Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the BRI emergency rescue drill for Pacific Island countries being held in Jiangmen City, Guangdong, on Sunday. A total of 300 participants, including emergency rescue teams from 8 Pacific Island countries and Chinese rescue teams took part in the drill. Subscribe now Page 9: The entire page is dedicated to articles drawn from the Fifth High-End Forum on Chinese Discourse, which was held in Jinan, Shandong Province. This was organised by the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center at the Central Party School, the School of Marxism of the Central Party School, Chinese Marxism Research Foundation, and Shandong University. The first piece is by Hao Lixin from the School of Philosophy at Renmin University of China. Hao writes: -Accelerating the construction of the Chinese discourse and narrative system is an inevitable requirement of advancing Chinese-style modernization, an urgent necessity for enhancing the international influence of Chinese culture, and an important manifestation of the developmental laws of modern civilization. This profoundly reflects the dialectical relationship between cognition and practice, and embodies the adherence to and development of Marxist epistemology.- ，，，。，. -The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system is a cultural expression based on Chinese practice. The discourse system mainly refers to the cognitive relationships between expression, interpretation, evaluation and acceptance, understanding, recognition that people establish through linguistic symbols in practice and cultural exchange, including two basic aspects of discourse content and form, specifically manifested as certain thoughts, viewpoints, concepts and modes of expression. The narrative system mainly refers to the sum of narrative processes, narrative elements and narrative methods for certain objects, texts, and facts. The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, based on Chinese practice, has distinctive Chinese characteristics, Chinese style, and Chinese manner, possessing both significant national character and prominent global character.- 。，、、、、，，、、。、、、。，、、，，. Hao adds: -Why should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and how should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system? The answer lies in the practice of Chinese-style modernization, in the interactive relationship between China and the world, and in the development process of mutual influence between Chinese civilization and world civilization. Engels pointed out: ‘Civilization is a matter of practice.' In the process of creating a new form of human civilization and in further opening up to the outside world, China's connection with the world is becoming closer and cultural exchanges are increasingly frequent. Practical development requires us to present a true, multi-dimensional, and comprehensive China to the world, and better express and contribute Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions. However, in reality, our international communication still faces problems such as insufficient appeal and influence in the construction of discourse and narrative systems. Facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future are important directions for constructing China's discourse and narrative system; responding to issues of modernization, world issues, and future issues are important topics in constructing China's discourse and narrative system; better adapting to the needs of practical development and civilizational exchange and mutual learning, focusing on enhancing the appeal and influence of discourse and narrative, are important tasks in constructing China's discourse and narrative system.- 。，？，，。：--。，，，，、、，。，、。、、，；、，；、，、，. Hao also says that -Accurately and concisely summarising and expressing Chinese practices and experiences, and telling China's story well, is aimed at enabling the world to comprehensively and authentically understand China's development and the changes in the lives of the Chinese people, to grasp Chinese-style modernization and the new forms of human civilization, and to create favourable conditions for both China's development and global progress.- 、，，，，. Subscribe now In the second section, Hao calls for -highlighting cultural subjectivity- when constructing the Chinese discourse and narrative system. In this context, he calls to: Adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, strengthen cultural confidence, uphold openness and tolerance, and adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. Strengthening cultural confidence is specifically manifested in adhering to one's own path, achieving independence in spirit and discourse, and taking the construction of an independent knowledge system of Chinese philosophy and social sciences as the theoretical basis for building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. Adhering to openness and tolerance is reflected in maintaining a broad mind and looking at the world, and treating all the outstanding achievements of human civilization with an open mind. Adhering to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation is reflected in adhering to the position of Chinese culture, inheriting the genes of Chinese culture, and constantly exploring and innovating in light of new situations and new problems on the basis of adhering to the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, and constantly achieving new breakthroughs in building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. ，、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，、，. Adopt different discourse methods, narrative methods, and carrier channels based on different objects and different situations, and vividly present the Chinese-style modernization that leads the trend in the process of world modernization and the Chinese civilization that shines in the world's garden of civilization. ，，、、，、. Understand that -generally speaking, the construction of discourse and narrative systems in international communication and cultural exchange should possess characteristics of objectivity, uniqueness, specificity, compatibility, complementarity, and vividness. Among these, objectivity mainly refers to authenticity, which is the prerequisite for discourse and narrative to have influence. Uniqueness mainly refers to the cultural characteristics formed by different ethnic groups and countries in the long historical evolution. Specificity mainly implies that discourse and narrative should be concrete and clear, rather than remaining at the level of empty language and abstract grand narratives. Compatibility mainly refers to the fact that both parties in cultural exchange should be easily understood by each other in terms of discourse semantics, narrative content and form, and should be able to generate a certain resonance in expression. Complementarity mainly refers to discourse and narrative between different subjects should have commensurability and mutual benefit. Vividness mainly refers to in the narrative process, there should be both rational exposition and emotional expression.- ，，、、、、、。，，。。，。、，。。，。 In the final section, Hao says: To build the Chinese discourse and narrative system, we need to follow the law of cognitive development. On this basis, we can refine the iconic concepts of Chinese discourse and grasp the key contents of Chinese narrative. The series of iconic concepts and original viewpoints contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, such as ‘community of human destiny', ‘common values ​​of all mankind' and ‘new form of human civilization', provide scientific guidelines and practical examples for building Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，。------、，. To build a Chinese discourse and a Chinese narrative system, it is important to tell the story of Chinese-style modernization well…and make clear the historical inevitability, distinctive features and global significance of Chinese-style modernization, and that Chinese-style modernization is a major innovation in world modernization. ，，、，、，。 -Demonstrate the outstanding inclusiveness of Chinese civilization…Openness and inclusiveness are the cultural genes of the Chinese nation, and inclusiveness is the outstanding characteristic of Chinese civilization. In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is necessary to deeply grasp the characteristics of the coexistence and integration of human civilization, highlight the remarkable inclusiveness of Chinese civilization, and showcase the values and ideas contained in Chinese culture, Chinese wisdom, and Chinese solutions, such as harmony without uniformity, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and the profound wisdom of ‘all things grow together without harming each other, and all paths run parallel without contradicting each other'.- 。。、、，、，、。，。，、，，、、、，-，-。 In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is important to grasp the logic, focus the narrative on people living in a community of shared future for mankind, take the personal feelings, real situations and common expectations of people from different countries and cultures in life as the entry point and foothold, integrate the values ​​generally accepted by the people into the construction of Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and continuously enhance the empathy and appeal of the Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，、、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Hu Daping from the School of Philosophy at Nanjing University. Hu writes about the principle of learning while keeping the world in mind. Hu laments, and I agree with this lament: -Today, China is increasingly approaching the centre of the world stage, and our international discourse power and cultural soft power continue to strengthen. The system of disciplines in our philosophy and social sciences is constantly improving, the research team is continuously growing, and the level of research and innovation capabilities is consistently advancing, with its influence in the international academic community and global society steadily increasing. In this process, the global vision of Chinese philosophy and social science workers is continuously expanding, and the spirit of openness is increasingly enhanced. Significant research achievements at the forefront of international academia have been made in many fields. At the same time, some issues and phenomena in domestic academia also require attention. For instance, some scholars are accustomed to ‘closing the door' to do their research, and they do not pay enough attention to new things, new phenomena, and new trends in the outside world, and lack the interest and awareness of deepening research. Some scholars become engrossed in obscure and cumbersome conceptual constructions, failing to explain clearly to themselves and making it difficult for others to understand, thus losing the openness and accessibility that philosophical and social science research should have. In reality, the so-called ‘world' is not an abstract and isolated existence. It manifests as the world where people coexist under the same sky, it manifests as people of the world pursuing a better life, and it manifests as vibrant, lively common practices. Without engaging with fresh and vivid life, and being confined to the mere words and phrases in books, the academic research loses the ‘liveliness' and practicality it should have. Without this, there can be no world in one's sight, and no ‘world' in one's heart, making the idea of doing research with a global perspective impossible to talk about.- ，，、。，，，。，、，。，，，--，、、，；，、，、。，--，，，。，，--，，，. Hu subsequently calls for adhering to -people-centred research orientation- and to recognize and understand the traditional culture of different nations. More importantly, Hu writes: -Adhering to doing scholarly work with a global perspective does not mean pursuing or catering to so-called ‘universality'. Instead, it involves approaching research with confidence and awareness of ‘what makes me, me' (what defines or constitutes one's unique self) while firmly upholding cultural and academic subjectivity. On this foundation, it seeks to understand and grasp the relationship between oneself and the external world, to discern regularity from universality and diversity from particularity. Through learning from and absorbing all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, it aims to safeguard Marxism as the spiritual core and China's excellent traditional culture as the foundational root, thereby promoting and developing philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics.- ，--，--，，，、，，，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report (English report) on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. He told her that -China is deepening the reform of its financial system and continuing to expand the high-level, two-way opening-up of its financial sector. China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including Citigroup, to invest and do business in China, and to share opportunities and participate in the development of the country's financial market.- As per Xinhua, -Fraser said that Citigroup is optimistic about the prospects of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to explore the Chinese market further, contributing to the promotion of U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation and maintaining the healthy development of the global economy.- Next, there's a report on China, Brazil, South Africa and the African Union launching the Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science. Xinhua says: -The initiative also aims to promote global scientific and technological innovation to benefit the Global South. It notes that the open and sustainable sci-tech innovation is conducive to enhancing the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the global economy. The initiative proposes that governments, scientific communities, enterprises, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders should support the free flow of sci-tech innovation personnel and resources on a global scale, and ensure that different stakeholders can equitably participate in and are treated fairly in the open science cause. Scientific knowledge should be publicly available, according to the initiative, which also states that scientific practices should be diverse, inclusive and sustainable. The initiative says that governments of all countries should increase investment in open science and encourage the cooperation, joint construction and sharing of major scientific research infrastructure.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Defense Minister Dong Jun's speech at the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Plus Meeting. -The Asia-Pacific region remains generally stable, but the risk of being drawn into geopolitical conflicts is a real possibility. The strategic choices we make today will affect the future safety and well-being of the region and its people. All countries should join hands and work together to safeguard our shared beautiful homeland. Dong Jun stated that China is willing to work with all parties to resolutely consolidate ASEAN's central position, firmly support the improvement and upgrading of existing cooperation frameworks, and oppose ‘creating a new architecture' or forming ‘exclusive cliques'. China is committed to firmly maintain unity among regional countries, oppose bringing bloc politics and camp confrontation into the region. China firmly supports resolving problems through dialogue, opposes provoking disputes, resorting to force, ganging up together or even bringing in external forces. China is dedicated to deepen defense and security cooperation, promote the implementation of the Global Security Initiative in the region, and build a closer security community. In particular, China and ASEAN should take a long-term view to expand common maritime interests, conduct flexible and diverse maritime security cooperation, enhance joint capacity to maintain maritime security, and contribute to maintaining regional and even world peace and stability.- ，。。，。，，，，--、--。，、。，、、。，，。，，，. Subscribe now Dong also met with the defense ministers of India, Malaysia and New Zealand. There was no meeting between Dong and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Beijing's official reasoning was as follows: -Senior Colonel Wu pointed out that the US can't damage China's core interests on the Taiwan question while seeking to communicate with the Chinese military as if nothing has happened. ‘It is imperative for the US to immediately correct its mistake, earnestly respect China's core interests, and strive to create favorable conditions for high-level exchanges between the two militaries.- (Note: This is clearly bunkum. It appears that Beijing wants to set new baselines for military talks with the incoming Trump administration. This likely is a step towards that.) The US Defense Secretary said: -It's unfortunate. It affects the region because the region really wants to see us, you know, two significant players in the region, two significant powers, talk to each other…I don't think that it has any sort of implications for the future. I just think that it's something that they chose to do at this point in time and only they can explain why they chose to not take advantage of a good opportunity.- Anyway, Dong did meet India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. I have not been able to locate a substantive Chinese readout. The Indian readout from that meeting says: -This was the first meeting of the two Defence Ministers following the recent disengagement agreements, and the meeting of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi &amp; Chinese President Mr Xi Jinping on the sidelines of BRICS summit. Raksha Mantri highlighted the fact that amicable relations between India and China, the two largest nations in the world, would have positive implications for global peace and prosperity. Considering that both countries are and will continue to remain neighbours, he mentioned that ‘we need to focus on cooperation rather than conflict'. Shri Rajnath Singh called for reflecting on the lessons learnt from the unfortunate border clashes of 2020, take measures to prevent recurrence of such events and safeguard peace and tranquility along the India-China border. He emphasised and looked forward to greater trust and confidence building between the two sides through de-escalation. Both sides agreed to work together towards a roadmap for rebuilding mutual trust and understanding.- Finally, there's a report on the 14th China-ASEAN Defense Ministers' Informal Meeting. The report says: -Dong Jun said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of leaders from both sides, China-ASEAN security cooperation has not only benefited both parties but also the region and even the world. Regardless of how the international situation evolves, China will unswervingly work with ASEAN to strengthen solidarity and mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, promote Eastern wisdom, properly manage differences, and always be good partners who share safety and risks and support each other. Maritime issues concern the common interests of all parties and require adopting a long-term strategic perspective, steadily advancing maritime security cooperation, and striving to transform contradictions and challenges into opportunities for cooperation.- ，，，—，。，，，，，，、。，，，. Dong also met with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani. Kyodo reports: -Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, that he is ‘seriously concerned' about the intensifying military activities near Japan, as they met in Laos months after an airspace breach involving a Chinese spy plane. Nakatani lodged a stern protest with China over the violation of Japan's airspace on Aug. 26 and demanded that it not be repeated, according to Japanese officials. However, the two agreed to promote dialogue between their defense authorities to foster ‘mutually beneficial' relations, as recently agreed by the countries' leaders. Noting that the two countries have various outstanding security issues, Nakatani said at the outset of the meeting, which was held on the sidelines of an annual regional security meeting, ‘It is extremely important to hold candid discussions between defense authorities and continue communications.' Dong agreed that face-to-face discussions between the two countries' defense authorities are important for the bilateral relationship and regional peace. However, he countered that China is concerned about Japan's actions on issues such as Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.- Share Tracking People's Daily First, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new notice with measures to support foreign trade. These include: First, insurance companies are encouraged to increase underwriting support for ‘little giant' and ‘hidden champion' firms in their efforts to expand to diversified markets, according to the notice. ‘Little giants' refer to the novel elites of China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are engaged in manufacturing, specialising in a niche market and boasting cutting-edge technologies. ‘Hidden champions' refer to highly successful yet lesser-known SMEs that are global leaders in terms of market share in their respective niches. Second, banking institutions should continuously optimise financial services for foreign trade enterprises in areas such as credit approval, loan disbursement, and repayment while ensuring rigorous verification of trade authenticity and effective risk management. Third, financial institutions are encouraged to increase financing support for micro, small and medium-sized companies based on market-oriented and law-based principles, said the notice. Fourth, efforts should be made to optimise cross-border trade settlement, promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, expand agricultural product exports, and support the imports of key equipment and energy resources. Second, Xinhua reports that -China's Ministry of Public Security on Thursday declared that all large-scale telecom fraud centers located near the China-Myanmar border in northern Myanmar had been wiped out. Over 53,000 Chinese nationals suspected of telecom frauds have been arrested with cooperative efforts from Chinese and Myanmar police since the ministry launched a crackdown on telecom frauds in northern Myanmar last year, the ministry said in a statement. In a recent coup, 1,079 telecom fraud suspects were arrested in northern Myanmar's Tangyan area for the first time. The suspects were caught during a joint operation by police of southwest China's Yunnan Province and local law enforcers of Myanmar. All of the 763 Chinese citizens among them have been handed over to China, the ministry said, calling the operation another breakthrough in the crackdown campaign. According to the statement, China's public security bodies will continue to maintain high pressure in the crackdown on cross-border telecom fraud, especially in areas where scam dens are concentrated.- Third, there's a report on the second meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran Trilateral Joint Committee held in Riyadh on November 19. The readout says: -Saudi Arabia and Iran reaffirmed their commitment to all provisions of the Beijing Agreement, and their continued efforts to consolidate good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries by adhering to the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and international law, including respecting national sovereignty, independence and security…The current escalation of regional tensions will have serious consequences for regional and global security. Against this backdrop, it is very important for senior officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran to engage in contacts, meetings, and mutual visits. The participating parties appreciated the progress made in consular services between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which enabled more than 87,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Hajj, and more than 25,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Umrah rituals with ease and security in the first ten months of 2024. They also appreciated the convening of the first meeting of the Saudi-Iranian Joint Media Committee, and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Prince Saud Al-Faisal Institute for Diplomatic Studies and the Institute of Political and International Studies of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saudi Arabia and Iran also expressed their readiness to sign a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, and the three countries look forward to expanding trilateral cooperation in economic, political and other fields.- They all called -for an immediate end to the Israeli military operations in both Palestine and Lebanon, condemn the Israeli attack and its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and call for ensuring the unimpeded flow of humanitarian and relief aid to Palestine and Lebanon. The three countries hold that the ongoing cycle of violence and escalation poses a serious threat to the security of the region and the world, including maritime security. The three countries reaffirm their support for a comprehensive political solution to the Yemeni issue in accordance with internationally recognized principles under the auspices of the United Nations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

China-Brazil Deals & Joint Statement - Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows - Liu Jianchao Meets Communist Party of Nepal Delegati...	As I opened the front page of the paper today, I felt a bit like Marty McFly. Everything on the page I covered in my newsletter yesterday. So I will keep staying ahead of the curve, and cover some developments that you can expect tomorrow. First, let's look at Xi Jinping's meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Xinhua reports (English readout): -Xi Jinping pointed out that he was very pleased to visit Brazil in this year of great historical significance, marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. Just now, President Lula held a grand welcoming ceremony with the highest courtesies for me, fully demonstrating the high importance attached to China-Brazil relations and the deep affection for the Chinese people, which deeply moved me. China and Brazil are two major developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres. Looking back over the past 50 years, China-Brazil relations have spanned mountains and seas, exploring the right path for large developing countries to engage based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, friendship, and win-win cooperation. Brazil was the first country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first Latin American country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Lula and myself, the two countries have increasingly become reliable friends with a shared destiny and a positive force for promoting peace. China-Brazil relations are now at their historical best, not only enhancing the well-being of the two peoples but also safeguarding the shared interests of the vast number of developing countries, strengthening the power and voice of the Global South, and making outstanding contributions to world peace and stability.- ，50。，，。。50，，、、。、。，，、，，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, -Lula specially arranged for the Brazilian artist to sing the famous Chinese song My Motherland to thank the Chinese side for its warm hospitality during his visit to China last year-. Xi Jinping emphasized that today, we are elevating the positioning of China-Brazil relations to the level of a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. At the same time, we are aligning BRI with Brazil's development strategy. This marks another historic moment in the development of China-Brazil relations, highlighting the global, strategic, and long-term nature of the bilateral relationship. This aligns with the general expectations of the two peoples and will provide a driving force for both sides to advance their modernization agendas. It also demonstrates the determination of China and Brazil to jointly uphold international fairness and justice and promote common global development. China is willing to work with Brazil, keeping the future of humanity in mind and focusing on the well-being of the people, to continually enrich the connotations of the new-era China-Brazil relationship, becoming ‘golden partners' that achieve mutual success, and steadily progress toward building a community with a shared future for humanity, a fairer world, and a more sustainable planet, thereby making greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress for humankind.- ，，--，，、、，，，、。，、，，--，、，. Xi then made four points: First, we must share a common destiny and should continue to consolidate strategic mutual trust. We must firmly support each other on issues involving core interests, such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and become strategic partners that trust each other and a model of solidarity, cooperation, mutual benefit, and common development among the Global South countries. We must strengthen exchanges in the fields of culture, education, and youth, and consolidate the public opinion foundation of the China-Brazil community with a shared future. Second, we must develop together and continue to deepen the linkages between our development strategies. We must seize the historical opportunity of building interlinkages between the BRI and Brazil's development strategy, deepen cooperation in key areas such as economy, trade, infrastructure, finance, science and technology, and environmental protection, and strengthen cooperation in aerospace, agricultural science and technology, and clean energy. China has placed poverty alleviation in a prominent position in state governance and supports Brazil's ‘Zero Hunger' plan. It is willing to continue to strengthen poverty reduction cooperation with Brazil so that the people of the two countries can live a better life. Third, we must share responsibilities and demonstrate the strength of China and Brazil in maintaining world peace and justice. We must practise true multilateralism, make fair remarks and take fair actions, so as to make global governance more just and equitable. China attaches great importance to Brazil's international status and influence and supports Brazil in playing a greater role on the international stage. China stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Brazil at the United Nations, BRICS and other multilateral mechanisms, support Brazil's presidency of BRICS next year, promote high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make BRICS voice louder on upholding multilateralism and improving global governance. Fourth, we must share weal and woe and make distinctive contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. As major developing countries, China and Brazil should take the lead in conducting consultations, promoting global solidarity, jointly addressing global challenges concerning the future of mankind, and strengthening cooperation in such fields as green transformation, sustainable development, climate change, and AI governance.

Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can countries find a path to universal security. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries.

It says that: -We noticed that, while promoting global cross-border data flows, countries are primarily concerned with risks related to national security, public interests, personal privacy, and intellectual property. We believe that the international community should fully respect the different policies and practices adopted by various countries and regions based on their specific conditions. It is crucial to pay heed to each party's concerns regarding data security and development and to work toward building consensus on cross-border data flow rules through consultation among countries and regions.- In this context, China has proposed: Governments should encourage electronic cross-border data transmission to meet the needs of business and social activities. This will help global e-commerce and digital trade serve as new drivers for economic growth and sustainable development. Governments should respect the regulatory differences of various countries and regions in cross-border data flows. They should support free data flows that do not violate national security, public interests, and personal privacy. Regulations on cross-border data flows should be permitted when they aim to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the premise that such regulatory measures do not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, and do not cross the limits of the goals they seek to achieve. Governments should respect security measures taken by all countries in accordance with their laws to protect non-personal data related to national security and public interests, and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of relevant non-personal data. Governments should respect measures taken by all countries to protect personal information rights and interests including individual privacy. Countries should be encouraged to provide convenient channels for cross-border transmission of personal information on the condition that such information is well protected. Countries should be encouraged to establish and improve legal and supervision frameworks on personal information protection, conduct exchanges on best practices and experiences, improve the compatibility of personal information protection mechanisms and rules, and foster mutual recognition of relevant standards, technology regulations and conformity assessment procedures. Enterprises should be encouraged to obtain personal information protection certifications to demonstrate their compliance with personal information protection standards and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of personal information. (Note: This bit on certification is important) Governments should support exploring the establishment of negative lists for managing cross-border data flow to promote efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flow. Governments should work together to create a data flow and usage environment that is open, inclusive, secure, and non-discriminatory, jointly uphold a fair and just market order, and promote the orderly and healthy development of the digital economy. Governments should enhance the transparency, predictability, and non-discriminatory nature of measures managing the cross-border flows of various types of data, as well as the interoperability of policy frameworks. Governments should actively conduct international cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows. Support should be given to developing countries and the least developed countries to enable them to effectively participate in and utilize cross-border data flows so as to promote their digital economic growth. Developed countries should be encouraged to provide capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries, especially the least developed ones, in order to bridge the digital divide and achieve fair and sustainable development. Governments should encourage the use of digital technologies to promote innovative applications in cross-border data flows. They should improve technological capabilities to ensure efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flows. They should advance international mutual recognition of evaluation standards for technical and security assurance capabilities related to cross-border data flows, and ensure effective intellectual property protection. Governments should oppose overstretching the concept of national security on data issues. They should object to making restrictive and differentiated policies on cross-border data flows targeting specific countries and enterprises without factual evidence, or implementing discriminatory restrictions, prohibitions, and other similar measures against specific countries and enterprises. Governments should prohibit illicit acquisition of data through methods such as setting up backdoors in digital products and services or exploiting vulnerabilities in digital technology infrastructure. They should collaborate to crack down on cross-border illegal activities in the data field and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and enterprises in all countries. We are ready to carry out and deepen exchanges and cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows with all parties based on the above initiative. We call on all countries and regions to respond to and endorse the above initiative through bilateral, multilateral, or regional agreements and arrangements. We welcome the support of international organizations, businesses, and civil society for this initiative.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, the paper today has reports on three sackings today.

Xi at G20: If China Can Make it, Other Developing Countries Can Too - Jaishankar-Wang Meeting Analysis - Xi Meets Macron, Scholz, Milei, Arce & Sheinb...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. Page 1: I covered Xi Jinping's G20 speech on global governance yesterday. Today, let's look at Xi's speech (full speech) at Session I of the G20 Summit in Rio. Both these are covered in the paper today. Xi said: -The Rio Summit this year has chosen the theme ‘Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet.' It places fighting hunger and poverty at the top of the agenda, and decides to establish a Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. From Hangzhou to Rio, we have been working for one and the same goal, that is, to build a just world of common development. To build such a world, we need to channel more resources to such fields as trade, investment and development cooperation, and strengthen development institutions. There should be more bridges of cooperation, and less ‘small yard, high fences', so that more and more developing countries will be better off and achieve modernization. To build such a world, we need to support developing countries in adopting sustainable production and lifestyle, properly responding to challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution, enhancing ecological conservation, and achieving harmony between man and nature. To build such a world, we need an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. We should promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, energize sustainable development with new technologies, new industries and new business forms, and support developing countries in better integrating in digital, smart and green development to bridge the North-South gap. To build such a world, we need to stay committed to multilateralism. We should uphold the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.- He added: -China's story is proof that developing countries can eliminate poverty, and that a weaker bird can start early and fly high, when there is the endurance, perseverance, and striving spirit that enables water drops to penetrate rocks over time and turns blueprints into reality. If China can make it, other developing countries can make it too. This is what China's battle against poverty says to the world.- He then termed China a member of the Global South and outlined 8 actions. Apart from the initiative on open science and the decision to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, nothing seems new in this list. First, pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On top of RMB700 billion yuan added financing windows and an additional RMB80 billion yuan injection into the Silk Road Fund, China is moving ahead with the development of the multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network, one that is led by the building of a green Silk Road and will empower a digital Silk Road. Second, implementing the Global Development Initiative. On the basis of over 1,100 development projects already in operation, we will make sure the Global South research center that is being built is fit for purpose, and the 20 billion U.S. dollars of development funds will continue to be put to good use to support developing countries and deepen practical cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, food security and the digital economy. Third, supporting development in Africa. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in September this year, I unveiled ten partnership actions on joining hands with Africa to advance modernization over the next three years and, in this connection, a commitment of RMB360 billion yuan in financial support. Fourth, supporting international cooperation on poverty reduction and food security. China has decided to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. We support the G20 in continuing to convene the Development Ministerial Meeting, and will stay a committed host of the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste. Fifth, China, alongside Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, is proposing an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science to help the Global South gain better access to global advances in science, technology and innovation. Sixth, supporting the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South and using such outcomes as the Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries and the High-Level Principles on Bioeconomy to good effect. China supports the work of the Entrepreneurship Research Center on G20 Economies based in Beijing, and supports cooperation on digital education and the digitization of museums and ancient archives. Seventh, implementing the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We are strengthening cooperation with fellow developing countries in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, denial of safe haven, and anti-corruption capacity building. Eighth, China is pursuing high-standard opening up, and unilaterally opening our doors wider to the least developed countries (LDCs). We have announced the decision to give all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. From now to 2030, China's imports from other developing countries are likely to top 8 trillion dollars. Subscribe now Next, there is a report about Xi's meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Xinhua says: -Xi once again congratulated Sheinbaum on becoming the first female president in the history of Mexico…Xi said China and Mexico share similar views and ideas on many international issues, and both countries advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation. China is ready to work with Mexico to uphold multilateralism and international fairness and justice, and inject positive energy into the development of the world economy.- The report adds: -Sheinbaum expressed her pleasure in meeting Xi, noting that she fully agrees with Xi's assessment of the relationship between the two countries. Although Mexico and China are far apart in distance, their ties are very close. Many Chinese companies operate in Mexico, including participating in the construction of major infrastructure projects in Mexico City, she said. She also expressed her gratitude for China's generous and sincere assistance during Mexico's difficult times such as the hurricane disaster, which is testament to the friendship between the two peoples. Both Mexico and China are committed to upholding multilateralism. Mexico is willing to work with China to explore potential opportunities while further expanding cooperation in various fields, added Sheinbaum.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (English report) on Xi and Emmanuel Macron having prefaced an exhibition titled ‘Tang China -- A Cosmopolitan Dynasty (7th-10th Century)'. Subscribe now Although it is not in the paper today, Xi also met with Macron at the sidelines of the G20 in Rio. The Chinese readout says: -Xi Jinping pointed out that both China and France are independent, mature and responsible major countries. The relationship between the two countries has unique strategic value and global significance…At present, the international situation is undergoing many new changes, and leading the international community to unite in addressing global challenges is a major power responsibility jointly borne by China and France. Both sides should deepen strategic communication, strengthen mutual support, and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China-France relations, contributing more to the healthy development of China-Europe relations and to world peace and stability. Xi Jinping stressed that China is willing to continue close high-level exchanges with France, continue to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the humanities fields, such as culture, education, local governance, and youth, to enhance mutual understanding between the Chinese and French people. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has opened a new round of reform and opening up in China, which will provide new opportunities for China-France cooperation and the prospects for practical cooperation between the two sides are broad. It is hoped that the two sides will make good use of mechanisms such as high-level economic and financial dialogues and the mixed economic and trade committees to tap the potential for cooperation, strengthen complementary advantages, properly resolve differences, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. ，、、，...，，。，，、，。，，、、、，。，，。、，，，，.

Xi said that -China hopes to see the conflict situation eased, does not wish to see the crisis spill over or the war escalate, and will continue to play a constructive role in its own way to promote a ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities.- ，，，、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Xi met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The Chinese readout says: At present, the profound, once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world are accelerating, and global development is at a crucial crossroads. China and Germany, as the world's second and third largest economies and influential major powers, should persist in consolidating their comprehensive strategic partnership from a long-term and strategic perspective, and continue writing the story of mutually beneficial cooperation. Xi Jinping emphasised that China's policy toward Germany maintains high stability and continuity. China is willing to work with Germany to persist in respecting each other's core interests and major concerns, persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and exchange and learn from each other. China and Germany's economic interests are highly intertwined, and China-Germany cooperation is an opportunity to jointly promote development and create the future. China views Germany as an important partner in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and will continue to provide broad market opportunities for German enterprises. Both sides should focus on digitalization, intelligence, and low-carbon development to promote cooperation quality upgrade, work together to develop third-party markets, and achieve win-win cooperation. China believes Europe is an important pole in a multipolar world, is committed to carrying out cooperation with Europe, working together to respond to challenges, and promoting the continued stable and healthy development of China-EU relations. The EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles has attracted worldwide attention. China has always insisted on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation, and hopes Germany will continue to play an important role in this.- ，，。、，，。，，，，、。，、。，。、、，，。，，，。。，. As per the Chinese readout, Scholz touched upon the -complex international situation- that persists and expressed a desire to -further develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with China; strengthen bilateral and multilateral dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of equality, candidness and mutual respect; properly resolve differences, achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and contribute to the recovery, growth and common prosperity of the world economy. It is hoped that Europe and China will resolve the issue of electric vehicles as soon as possible through dialogue and negotiation, and Germany is willing to make positive efforts in this regard.- ，、，，，。，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Xi met with Argentine President Javier Milei. The Chinese readout says: Xi said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, -both sides have adhered to mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. China's policy toward Argentina has always been focused on the entire Argentine people, and China-Argentina cooperation has likewise benefited all people. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Argentina, placing bilateral relations at an important juncture to build on the past and usher in the future. China values the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, supports Argentina in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions through reform, and is willing to work with Argentina to promote the long-term stable development of the China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership to better support the development of both countries.- ，，、、。，。10，、。，，，，。 -Xi Jinping stressed that the current world situation is undergoing profound changes. China and Argentina should continue to firmly support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns, strengthen exchanges at all levels and in all fields, promote cultural exchanges and cooperation, and make China-Argentina friendship more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The economic and trade structures of China and Argentina are highly complementary, and the prospects for cooperation are broad. Argentina is welcome to seize the important opportunities brought by China's high-level opening up to the outside world and further expand its market share in China.

Argentina highly appreciates President Xi Jinping's insightful propositions on global governance at the G20 Leaders' Summit and is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with China…- ，。。。。，。、、，，，。，。，. Xi is now in Brasilia, kicking off his state visit to Brazil. Subscribe now Page 3: There are two reports of meetings by Wang Yi. First, Wang met with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -China and Russia should work with BRICS partners to implement the outcomes of the BRICS Kazan Summit, expand and strengthen the BRICS mechanism, enhance the influence of the Global South, and play a greater role in world multipolarization. China has taken over the presidency of the SCO and is willing to work closely with Russia to promote greater development of the SCO and move it to a new level. Next year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. China and Russia should jointly organise commemorative activities, firmly defend the results of the victory of the Second World War and international fairness and justice, learn from history and open up the future.- ，，，，，。，，，。80，,，、. Lavrov reportedly said that -Russia-China relations are at an unprecedented high level.- He added: -The UN is the most important achievement of the victory of the Second World War, and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is of great significance. The international community should take this opportunity to oppose the destruction of the post-war international order and jointly maintain global peace and stability.- ，80。，，. The readout said that they discussed the war in Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula and other issues. Subscribe now Second, Wang met with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Before I detail the readouts, let me offer a brief analysis. My Brief Takeaway: As you go through both the readouts, you will notice that there is remarkable divergence in just how the Chinese side has characterised Jaishankar's position and what the MEA's readout actually says. The differences in the readouts are indicative of how far the two sides are in terms of their interests and perceptions of each other, despite the patrolling rights deal that was agreed in October and the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan. Here are four points to consider: First, the Chinese readout essentially has Jaishankar agreeing with Beijing's proposition that -specific differences-, i.e., the boundary tensions, should not define the relationship. In contrast, the Indian readout says that both ministers -recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility-. In other words, the Chinese side also appreciated the Indian position that you cannot have a stable relationship if tensions persist on the boundary. Second, the Chinese readout seems to indicate far greater common cause between India and China on global issues, while accepting that there are issues of attrition and suspicion between the two. The MEA's readout, on the other hand, explicitly says that on global issues -India and China have both differences and convergences-. In particular, the Chinese readout talks about world multipolarity; the Indian readout also calls for a multipolar Asia. Third, on specific actions, the Chinese readout calls for easing visa processes, exchanging journalists and resuming direct flights. It does not mention the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage and data sharing on trans-border rivers, which the MEA's readout mentions. Finally, the Chinese readout attributes this to Jaishankar -India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS-. The underlying message in this appears to be directed at the US. In contrast the MEA's readout says that Jaishankar told Wang -where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations.- To me, the underlying message in this is directed at China and its assertive and aggressive policies. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan not long ago and the restart of China-India relations are in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, the expectations of Global South countries and the right direction of history. The two sides should implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, handle differences properly with sincerity and integrity, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of stable and sound development at an early date. The two sides should send more positive signals and engage in actions that facilitate bilateral exchanges, enhance mutual trust and reduce suspicion, and carry out more cooperation and reduce attrition. The two sides should strive to make practical progress in such issues as resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and easing visa procedures as soon as possible. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and India. The two sides should plan commemorative activities, and encourage exchanges and visits in various fields and at different levels to enhance understanding and mutual trust.- ，，，，，。，，，，。，；，；，。、、。75，，，. -Wang said China and India, as two neighbouring major developing countries, have more common interests than differences, and they should view each other's development as an opportunity and work together to achieve common development and rejuvenation, which will help safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and contribute to global multipolarity. Both China and India adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy and multilateralism, and support the democratisation of international relations. The two countries should continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international affairs and further develop mechanisms such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.- ，，，，，，。，，，，、. The Chinese readout quotes Jaishankar as saying: -During the BRICS Summit in Kazan, leaders of both countries reached a consensus on promoting the stable development of India-China relations. It is gratifying to see that both sides are taking measures to implement the consensus of the leaders and have made positive progress. The Indian side hopes to restart the relevant dialogue mechanism as soon as possible and maintain the momentum of improvement and development of bilateral relations through strengthened communication. The consensus between India and China far outweighs the differences. Both sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, properly handle relevant issues with a more positive attitude, and not let specific differences define the relationship between the two countries. The Indian side is willing to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year as an opportunity to push forward India-China relations. Both India and China play an important role in international affairs, which also reflects the potential of India-China cooperation. India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS.- ，，。。，。，，，。75，。，。，，，、. The Indian MEA's readout of the meeting says: -The Ministers recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility. The discussions focused on the next steps in India-China relations. It was agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon. Among the steps discussed were the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage, data sharing on trans-border rivers, direct flights between India and China and media exchanges.- -On the global situation and international issues, EAM noted that India and China have both differences and convergences. We have worked constructively in the BRICS and the SCO framework. Our cooperation in the G20 has also been evident. EAM said that we are strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia. Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations. FM Wang Yi concurred with EAM that India-China relations have particular salience in world politics. He noted that our leaders had agreed in Kazan on the way forward. The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary. It talks about the Xi-Biden meeting, saying that in the past four years, -overall stability has been achieved- in ties. It says that: -President Xi Jinping expounded on strategic, directional, and guiding opinions on the development of China-US relations, proposing that the two countries should respect each other, coexist peacefully, and cooperate for win-win results. He clearly outlined China's four red lines regarding the Taiwan issue, democracy and human rights, the choice of path and system, and development rights. He suggested that both sides should jointly establish correct perceptions, effectively manage differences, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder great power responsibilities, and promote people-to-people exchanges, making the great edifice of China-US relations have not only a dome but also a foundation and pillars. To promote stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, both sides need to add bricks and tiles to this great edifice of China-US relations.- 4，，，，。、、，、、，、、、4，、、、、，，。、、，. -Strategic perception is the fundamental and overarching issue in Sino-US relations. The ‘Thucydides Trap' is not a historical destiny, and a ‘new Cold War' cannot be fought or won. Containment of China is unwise, undesirable, and will not succeed. If the two countries are partners and seek common ground while reserving differences, Sino-US relations will be able to achieve substantial development. If the other side is regarded as an opponent and vicious competition is carried out, Sino-US relations will encounter setbacks or even regress. In the interaction between these two major powers, neither side can reshape the other according to their own wishes, nor can they suppress the other based on so-called ‘position of strength', let alone deprive the other of legitimate development rights to maintain their own leading position. China and the US are two major powers, and some contradictions and differences are inevitable, but they cannot harm each other's core interests, much less engage in conflict and confrontation. The One China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques are the political foundation of bilateral relations and must be strictly observed.- 、。--，--，、，。，，。，，。，，--，。，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily -The interests of China and the United States are deeply intertwined, and the space for cooperation is infinite. In terms of economic ties, the trade volume between China and the United States exceeds $660 billion. More than 70,000 American companies in China have an annual profit of $50 billion; in terms of employment, exports to China alone support 930,000 jobs in the United States, and Chinese investment has also boosted American employment; in terms of people's livelihood, Chinese products have not only enriched the choices of American consumers, but also reduced the cost of living. McDonald's new stores in China in the past year accounted for about 60% of global presence. Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory delivered electric vehicles accounting for half of its global production capacity last year. And Starbucks has more than 1,000 stores in Shanghai alone...The story of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States fully shows that under the current situation, the common interests of China and the United States have not decreased, but rather increased. China and the United States should always focus on the well-being of the people of the two countries, continuously extend the list of cooperation, expand the pie of cooperation, and achieve win-win cooperation.- ，。，6600，7500；，93，；，，。，，1000……，，，。，，，. The next paragraph talks about global turbulence and then outlines this vision for bilateral ties. In essence, this is a call for a G2-style relationship. -China and the US should take into account the interests of the world, constantly consider the future destiny of humanity, take responsibility for world peace, provide public goods for the global community, and play a positive role in world unity. Major power competition should not be the underlying theme of the era; only unity and cooperation can overcome difficulties together. ‘Decoupling and breaking chains' is not the solution; only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to joint development. ‘Small yards with high walls' are not behaviours befitting of major powers; only openness and sharing can benefit humanity. Only by demonstrating the pattern of major powers, shouldering the responsibilities of major powers, and playing the role of major powers can we be responsible to history, to the people, and to the world, and only then can we win the world's respect.-，，，，。，。--，。--，。、、，、、，. The next bit reiterates Xi's framing of the -four unchanged- , i.e., China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. It then says: -To achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations, both sides need to uphold the already agreed-upon guiding principles, i.e., mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, maintaining communication, preventing conflict, adhering to the UN Charter, cooperating in areas of common interest, and responsibly managing competitive elements in bilateral relations. At present, China-US relations once again stand at a crossroads. The people of both countries have expectations for the stable development of China-US relations, and the international community also has expectations for the stable development of China-US relations. It is hoped that the US side will meet China halfway, continue to explore the correct way for two major powers to get along, achieve long-term peaceful coexistence between China and the US on this planet, and inject more certainty and provide positive energy for the world.- ，，、、、、《》，，。，。，。，，，、.

Ghimire has been in China for a few days. He earlier attended the Second Global South Think Tanks Dialogue. This dialogue led to the establishment of the Global South Think Tanks Alliance last week. Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report on He Lifeng attending the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. He said that -with the strong support of the central government, effective leadership of the HKSAR Government, and joint efforts from all sectors of Hong Kong society, the city has achieved new accomplishments in economic and social development, and its financial system remains vibrant.- 、，，. He added that -building, consolidating, and developing Hong Kong as an international financial center is not only essential for Hong Kong but also of great importance to the country. The central government has always positioned the development of Hong Kong as an international financial center from a strategic and overall perspective. It will continue to improve the policy system that supports the construction of Hong Kong as an international financial center and will, as always, provide full support and protection for Hong Kong's financial reform and development, as well as the maintenance of financial stability and security.- ，、、，，。，，，、、. He then talked about China's reform agenda and said: -The long-term positive trend of China's economic development has not changed and will not change. A strong country means a strong Hong Kong; a strong Hong Kong will make the country even better. It is hoped that Hong Kong will seize the historic opportunities brought by the country's reform and development, continuously deepen financial reform and innovation, expand financial openness and cooperation, actively align with national development strategies, safeguard financial security, and continue to write a brilliant chapter of ‘one country, two systems' in the new journey.- ，、。，，。，；，。，，，，，--. Subscribe now Also on the page is a Jin Sheping article, which uses two data points to make the case for economic strength. First, the fact that China's NEV production hit 10 million this year. Second, there have been a total of 100,000 China-Europe freight trains this year, with 7 trains going and 6 trains returning per week. More than 11 million standard containers of goods have been shipped with a value of more than $420 billion. Note this bit: Economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical tide. Although it is facing headwinds and setbacks, this overall trend has never changed and will not change. At 6:00 p.m. on October 11, the 3 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory. In the first three quarters of this year, the Shanghai Gigafactory has delivered 676,000 vehicles, accounting for more than half of Tesla's global deliveries in the same period, becoming the ‘capacity pillar' for Tesla. Of these 3 million vehicles, one-third were exported to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. The localization rate of parts at the Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, and Tesla has signed over 400 local first-tier suppliers, with more than 60 suppliers entering Tesla's global supply chain system. Tesla's development in China is a fruit of economic globalization and a strong proof of ‘harmony and coexistence'. Not just Tesla. In April, Mercedes-Benz announced the upgrade of its Shanghai R&amp;D center, further accelerating innovation in China; Volkswagen Group (China) announced a 2.5 billion euro investment to expand its production and innovation center in Hefei; BMW's Shenyang production base has invested nearly 100 billion yuan since 2010... China's creation of complete industrial chains, efficient market mechanisms, and healthy industrial competition ecology has attracted global capital to invest and develop business. As the economy becomes increasingly globalised, the interdependence between countries further deepens. Research and development, production, circulation, and consumption are interlinked; no country can achieve full lifecycle management of industrial and supply chains on its own. ‘I exist in you, you exist in me', the cooperation pattern becomes more solid. Unilateralism and protectionism offer no way forward, and ‘small yards with high walls' will only trap oneself. For some time, certain people in the US and the West have exaggerated the so-called ‘Chinese new energy overcapacity theory', which in essence is a ‘development anxiety theory' and a ‘zero-sum game theory', which harms others and benefits no one…Facts show that the development of China's new energy industry is a contribution and opportunity to the world. Coming from the depths of history, every Chinese understands what isolation will bring to us and the world. China is a beneficiary of economic globalisation and a firm promoter, because we understand that ‘when the world is good, China will be good; when China is good, the world will be even better'.- ，。，，，。10116，300。，67.6，，--。300，1/3、。95%，400，60。，，--。。4，—，；（），25；20101000……、、，。，。、、、，，。-、-，。、，--。，--，----，。。ATTO32023，E，H6……，。，，。，，、。，，-，；，-.

Another report on the page talks about the successful trial of large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries via trains. A related English report informs: -China Railway has conducted its first large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). On Tuesday, three trains loaded with lithium batteries departed from Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province and Guizhou Province, all of which are located in southwest China. For China, the world's largest producer of lithium batteries, this is a major step forward in the transportation of these vehicle batteries, which are listed as dangerous goods and were previously transported only by sea or road. The transport of lithium batteries is risky as they may burn or explode if jolted. ‘For the trial run, we are using a new type of container designed solely for the transport of lithium batteries. The containers are made of non-combustible materials and equipped with smoke and temperature detectors and venting devices,' said Jia Ping, deputy general manager of China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. Rail transport will facilitate the export of Chinese lithium batteries as it has a larger capacity than road transport and is faster than sea transport, Jia said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi's G20 Speech - Xi Meets Starmer & Albanese - Wang Huning on Spreading China's Voice - Song Tao Meets Wang Jin-pyng	Earlier today, Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the G20 summit in Brazil. Last year, when the G20 was held in India and Xi had skipped it, there was a fair amount of commentary in India about how Beijing was de-prioritising the G20 as a forum in favour of BRICS. I recall saying, wait till it's in Brazil; he will go. And look what we have now. Anyway, Xi said: -the G20 needs to build on its past achievements and continue to act as a force to improve global governance and move history forward. We should keep in mind that mankind lives in a community with a shared future, see each other's development as opportunities rather than challenges, and view each other as partners rather than rivals. We should observe the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and defend the international order based on international law. In light of the G20's mandate, we could build greater international consensus in the economic, financial, trade, digital and eco-environmental fields, among others, to improve global governance and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- He then made five points: First, improve global economic governance. -We should stay committed to strengthening global economic partnerships, reinforcing macro policy coordination in fiscal, financial, monetary and structural reform policies, cultivating new quality productive forces, and raising total factor productivity, in a bid to open up more possibilities for the global economy. It is important to make good use of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meetings, let them serve as a ballast for macro policy coordination, and foster an open, inclusive, and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. As main creditors, international financial institutions and commercial creditors need to take part in debt reduction and suspension for developing countries. It is also important to create a clean business environment by upholding a zero-tolerance stance against corruption, stepping up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, and denying safe haven to corrupt officials and their assets.- Second, improve global financial governance. -To increase the voice and representation of developing countries, the World Bank should carry out shareholding review and the International Monetary Fund should carry out quota share realignment in line with the agreed timeframe and roadmap. Joint efforts are needed to keep the international financial market stable and prevent negative spillover of domestic monetary policy adjustments. Developed countries should fulfill their responsibilities in this regard. It is important to enhance the systems for financial risks monitoring, early warning and handling, reinforce cooperation in such areas as digital currency and taxation, and strengthen the global financial safety net. The G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap should be implemented at a faster pace to better meet the green financing needs of developing countries.- Third, improve global trade governance. -We should place development at the center of the international economic and trade agenda, and steadily advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We should press ahead with reforming the World Trade Organization (WTO), oppose unilateralism and protectionism, restore the normal functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism as soon as possible, include the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement into the WTO legal framework, and reach early consensus on the e-commerce agreement. We should work actively to keep the WTO rules relevant, both addressing long-pending issues and exploring the formulation of new, future-oriented rules, to enhance the authority, efficacy and relevance of the multilateral trading system. It is important to avoid politicizing economic issues, avoid fragmenting the global market, and avoid taking protectionist moves in the name of green and low-carbon development.- Fourth, improve global digital governance. -We should step up international governance and cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI), to make sure that AI is for good and for all, not a game of the rich countries and the wealthy. China hosted the 2024 World AI Conference and High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance, and issued the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance. Together with other parties, China promoted the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China will hold another world AI conference in 2025 and welcomes the participation of fellow G20 members-. Fifth, improve global ecological governance. -We should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and fully and effectively implement the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for the sake of man's harmonious coexistence with nature. Developed countries should provide developing countries with the necessary funding, technology and capacity-building support…Energy transition and energy security is a major issue. We should follow the approach of ‘establishing the new before abolishing the old,' and replace traditional energy with clean energy in a stable and well-ordered way, as we expedite the green and low-carbon transition of the world economy. China stands ready to continue to deepen international cooperation with all sides on green infrastructure, green energy, green mining and green transport, and will provide support to developing countries to the best of its ability.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 19, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi's arrival in Rio for the G20 summit. On the sidelines of the summit, Xi met with (English report) British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. -Noting that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, Xi said that China and Britain, both as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major global economies, share the responsibilities of advancing their respective national development and addressing global challenges. Both countries should stick to their strategic partnership, adhere to the principles of mutual respect, open cooperation, and mutual learning, strive for mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and jointly write the next chapter of healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, he added. Xi said that while the two countries differ in history, culture, values, and social systems, they share extensive common interests. Both sides should view each other's development rationally and objectively, strengthen strategic communication, enhance political mutual trust, and ensure that China-UK relations remain stable, practical, and long-lasting. The two countries have extensive room for cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, clean energy, financial services, and healthcare, which should be continuously expanded to better benefit the people of both nations. Both sides should work to promote the political resolution of hotspot issues, strengthen global governance of artificial intelligence, and contribute to global economic growth and the shared development of all countries. ，。，，。，、、，，。，、、，，，，，、、。、、、，，。，，、. As per Xinhua, Starmer said that Britain and China share extensive common interests. He added that Britain -hopes to strengthen dialogue with China, enhance mutual understanding and carry out exchanges and cooperation in a wide range of areas, including economy and trade, technology, finance, healthcare, education, and addressing climate change, in a spirit of mutual respect, equality and candor-. Share Tracking People's Daily The UK side's readout says: Starmer told Xi that -the UK and China have a shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and the clean energy transition…They also discussed deepening the partnership bilaterally on trade and investment, health, education and other areas of mutual interest. The Prime Minister set out that our approach would be consistent, respectful and pragmatic in order to advance these shared goals…The Prime Minister said that he also wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia's war in Ukraine. He reiterated that his approach would always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner. They discussed next steps and agreed that the Chancellor should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.- Subscribe now Xi also met with (English report) Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He said -that in November last year, we had in-depth communication in Beijing on strategic, overall and directional issues concerning the long-term development of China-Australia relations. Over the past year, the two countries have maintained close communication and exchanges at all levels, actively promoted the implementation of the important consensus we reached, and made positive progress. There is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia. As long as the two sides insist on mutual respect, equality, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, China-Australia relations will surely develop well. China is willing to work with Australia to promote the construction of a more mature, stable and fruitful China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and inject more stability and certainty into the region and the world.- ，11，、、。，，，。，、、，。，、，. Xi added that this year more than 250 Australian companies participated in the CIIE. This was their -vote of confidence- in the Chinese economy. -Both sides should continue to expand the pattern of mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation. China is willing to import more high-quality Australian products and encourages Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Australia. It is hoped that Australia will provide Chinese companies with a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment. Both China and Australia are supporters and defenders of economic globalization and free trade. The two sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation, oppose protectionism, and promote the sharing of opportunities and benefits through openness to achieve common development.- 。，，、、。、，，，，. Among other things, Xinhua quotes the Australian PM as saying that -the Australian side stays committed to the one-China policy, opposes ‘decoupling', advocates promoting economic globalization, and hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in such areas as energy transition and climate change.- Subscribe now In his press briefing in Rio, Albanese said the following: -Earlier today, I also met with President Xi to talk about the progress in stabilising relations between our two countries. This is the third bilateral meeting I've had with President Xi. We have restored trade between our two countries. Impediments have been removed across a range of industries – wine, timber, coal, barley, seafood. And as a result of that, some $20 billion of trade has been resumed. That means Australian jobs. I was in Geraldton talking to the co-op that runs the lobster industry there. That's important not just for those people who work with the lobster trade, it's a driver of that town's regional economy as well. And so these things do matter. And I'm confident that the agreement which will see the lobster trade resume by the end of the year in time for the Lunar New Year in 2025, will be delivered and those negotiations between our respective departments is taking place. I've also said that dialogue is crucial. I've said, a number of times, that we'll cooperate with China where we can, we'll disagree where we must, but we'll engage in our national interests. And we've managed to improve relations without compromising any of Australia's national interests, which we have continued to pursue and will continue to pursue. This patient, calibrated and deliberate approach has made a difference and has both saved but also created many thousands of new jobs in Australia. We discussed areas that present opportunities for greater practical cooperation, such as the renewable energy transition and climate change. And I also made clear Australia's views on issues affecting regional and international peace, stability and prosperity, ranging a number of bilateral points as well, including consular matters which included Dr. Yang Jun.- He was then asked questions about the meeting. He was asked if the policies of the incoming Trump administration in the US were discussed. He said no, they weren't. But he added that -our alliance, is with the United States and that is the only context in which the US was raised, was that.- Albanese also confirmed that he will be visiting China next year for dialogue with Premier Li. In terms of the issues he raised, Albanese said -I raised the issues of human rights. I raised Taiwan. I raised cyber. I raised the supply of assets to Russia. I raised the ICBM missile test that I previously raised as well with the Chinese Premier. So, we raised issues that matter to us, to Australia.- Another interaction is this: JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said that Taiwan was one of the issues that was discussed at the meeting. Chinese state media suggested that the Australian delegation said it wasn't in support of decoupling. Are you able to elaborate a bit further on Taiwan discussions? PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not about Taiwan, that's about the economy. We support the bipartisan support that is there for One China Policy. We also support the status quo. That is no unilateral action, and that's been a consistent bipartisan position for a long period of time. We support peace in the Taiwan Strait. Decoupling refers to the idea that you would decouple your economies. That the trade sanctions, those issues, that is what that's referring to. And our economic relationship with China is important because that is where a whole lot of, for example, our iron ore and coal goes to China and creates steel and construction that's the relationship which is there. Also worth noting is Albanese's characterisation of the significance of the trade relationship with China, which he said brings -substantial benefit for Australians and for Australian jobs and Australian businesses…- He added: -one in four Australian jobs as export dependent, and one in four of our export dollars comes from China.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Li Qiang's comments (English report) when he visited the China Construction Technology Exhibition in Beijing. The report says that Li said that -China's housing situation is shifting from addressing ‘whether there is housing' to focusing on ‘how good the housing is'; guided by the goal of enhancing residents' quality of life and sense of happiness, housing development should take into account functionality, quality, and experience, addressing the diverse needs of people with different living habits, age groups, and economic capacities, especially new demands such as elder-friendly and child-friendly housing. Efforts should be tailored to local conditions to promote the construction of quality housing. This includes setting higher standards and leveraging technology to build good new houses, as well as scientifically renovating old houses to transform them into quality housing.- ，----，，、、，、、、，，、，. He also -called for efforts to advance scientific and technological innovation, and improve design, construction and maintenance levels, with the aim of promoting the high-quality development of the real estate and construction industries. Li noted that urban renewal is an important task for ongoing urban construction. He said that combining the improvement of people's livelihoods with the expansion of domestic demand is necessary, as is strengthening efforts to renovate old urban residential compounds, urban villages and dilapidated houses. Li also stressed the importance of protecting and passing on historical and cultural heritage in the urban renewal process, as part of efforts to build harmonious cities and ensure residents can live happily.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's remarks at the China Overseas Friendship Association executive directors' meeting in Beijing. Wang said that -to do a good job with overseas friendship work with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan in the new era, we must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, adhere to great unity and great solidarity, adhere to holding high the banner of patriotism, adhere to playing the role of Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas united front work in winning hearts and minds, form a vivid situation wherein all children of China think and act in unison, and pool hearts, consensus, wisdom, and strength to broadly rally support for advancing Chinese modernization.- ，，，，，，、，、、、. -Wang Huning said that over the past 75 years since the founding of the PRC, the great motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. Entering the new era, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the cause of the Party and the country has achieved historic achievements and undergone historic changes; a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way has been built, achieving the first centennial goal. We have also embarked on a new journey of building a comprehensively modern socialist country. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation now holds an unprecedentedly bright future. The great achievements of the motherland's development are the result of the full support and dedication of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese. In this great era, with the strong backing of the motherland, the vast number of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese have great potential to serve the motherland and realise their dreams.- ，75，。，，、，，，，。，、，、. Wang added that the China Overseas Friendship Association is an important platform for gathering patriotic people from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese, an important bridge for strengthening the unity of Chinese people at home and abroad, and an important force dedicated to the reunification of the motherland and national rejuvenation.- He called on its directors to -better shoulder their responsibilities in promoting Chinese-style modernization, gather the wisdom and strength of Chinese people at home and abroad to promote reform and development, and share the great glory of the motherland's prosperity.- ，，，，。，、，. -We should make better contributions to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, fully and accurately implement the ‘one country, two systems' policy and the Basic Law, develop and strengthen patriotic forces and those that love Hong Kong and Macao, and support the two regions' deeper integration into the country's overall national development. We should better unite our hearts and minds to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland, adhere to the one-China principle and the ‘1992 Consensus', do more to promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, cross-strait integration and development in various fields, and the spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities and external interference.

Xi Pitches for 'Open & Interconnected' Asia-Pacific - Biden-Xi Meeting Breakdown - Xi's Bilaterals in Lima - China Taiping's Party Committee on Financ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 18, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's speech at the APEC Leaders Summit. First, let's look at the key points from Xi's speech (English text) at the summit. First, we need to build an open and interconnected paradigm for Asia-Pacific cooperation. We should stay committed to multilateralism and an open economy, firmly uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, fully reactivate APEC's role as an incubator of global economic and trade rules, and advance regional economic integration and connectivity. We should tear down the walls impeding the flow of trade, investment, technology and services, uphold stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, and promote economic circulation in the region and the world. A Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) is an ambitious vision for regional economic integration, and is critical for long-term development and prosperity of our region. Ten years ago, a historic decision to kick off the FTAAP process was taken at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing. Today, we will adopt a new document to guide this process. I believe that this will give new impetus to our efforts toward an open Asia-Pacific economy. On China's approach to FTAs, he added: -We continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) against high standards. We are also working actively to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). We have just signed a protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement with Peru, and have substantially concluded negotiations with ASEAN to upgrade to free trade area 3.0. Together with the relevant parties, we will seek to discuss trade agreements in digital and green areas, and steadily expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.- Second, we need to make green innovation a catalyst for the Asia-Pacific. We need to firmly seize the opportunities presented by the new round of sci-tech revolution and industrial transformation, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information, life and health, and other frontier areas. We need to foster an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory ecosystem for innovation, and promote a leapfrog development of productive forces across our region. To build a clean and beautiful Asia-Pacific, we should prioritize ecological protection, promote resources conservation and their efficient use as well as green and low-carbon development, and engineer an all-round green transition in economic and social development. We need to push forward coordinated digital and green transformation and development to create new momentum and new drivers for Asia-Pacific development. Then he talked about China's initiatives: -China will launch a Global Cross-Border Data Flow Cooperation Initiative, and seek deeper cooperation with other parties to promote efficient, convenient and secure cross-border data flows. China has put forward initiatives in the APEC framework concerning, among others, the application of digital bill of lading, capacity building on green supply chains, exchanges and dialogue on approaches to AI, and the digitalization of food supply chains, with a view to contributing to high-quality development of the Asia-Pacific.- Third, Xi talked about the need to support -developing economies and disadvantaged groups, and work together to grow the pie and distribute it equitably to allow more economies and people to benefit from development…China will advance initiatives through the APEC platform on increasing residents' income and promoting the industrial cluster development of small and medium-sized enterprises, for the purpose of bringing about universally beneficial and inclusive development of Asia-Pacific economies.- Subscribe now Also, earlier Xi spoke at the APEC CEOs summit. Here's an interesting excerpt from his remarks: -…the world is in a new period of turbulence and transformation. Unbridled unilateralism and protectionism and an increasingly fragmented world economy threaten to reverse the trend toward economic globalization. The grave challenge for us is like sailing up a river -- we either forge ahead or drift downstream. Where will the Asia-Pacific economy be going? It is a decision we must make. Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail. New technological revolution and industrial transformation are getting more profound, and the world is moving faster to embrace a digital, green and smart economy. All this is building up powerful energy for further expedition of economic globalization down the road. We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- Another excerpt says: -APEC was born on the eve of the end of the Cold War when a new round of economic globalization was gradually emerging, and has since taken it as its mission to promote economic globalization. It has contributed immensely to boosting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific, economic mutual benefit between member economies, and the interests and well-being of the people in our region. Asia-Pacific economies have maintained robust growth and created the remarkable Asia-Pacific miracle. The success of the Asia-Pacific is due to our firm commitment to peace and stability in the region, to our continuous practices of true multilateralism and open regionalism, and to our deep faith in the trend toward economic globalization as well as mutual benefit and mutual success. The Asia-Pacific should remain the locomotive of economic globalization in the future. We should stay on the right course and seek to break new ground at the same time. While further burnishing the Asia-Pacific hallmark of openness and inclusiveness, we should make new brand-building efforts to foster a green and digital Asia-Pacific, build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, and usher in another 30 golden years of development for our region.- Share Tracking People's Daily Let's now look at Xi's bilateral meetings. Today's paper covers the meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden. The Chinese readout says that: Xi said that -over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but the two sides have also been engaged in dialogue and cooperation. The relationship has remained stable on the whole. Under the stewardship of the two Presidents, the two teams have worked out through consultations a number of guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents have jointly brought China-U.S. dialogue and cooperation back on track. More than 20 communication mechanisms have been restarted or established, and positive achievements have been made in such areas as diplomacy, security, economy, trade, fiscal affairs, finance, military, counternarcotics, law enforcement, agriculture, climate change, and people-to-people exchange. President Xi underscored that it is worthwhile to review the experiences of the past four years and draw inspirations from them. He listed the following: First, it is important to have a correct strategic perception. The Thucydides's Trap is not a historical inevitability. A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail. Second, it is important to match words with actions. A man cannot establish himself without credibility. China has always honored its words. If the U.S. side always says one thing but does another, it will be detrimental to its own image, and undermine trust between China and the United States. Third, it is important to treat each other as equals. As two major countries, neither China nor the United States should seek to remodel the other according to one's own will, suppress the other from the so-called ‘position of strength', or deprive the other of the legitimate right to development so as to maintain its leading status. Fourth, it is important not to challenge red lines and paramount principles. Contradictions and differences between two major countries like China and the United States are unavoidable. But one side should not undermine the core interests of the other, let alone seek conflict or confrontation. The one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. They must be observed. The Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China's path and system, and China's development right are four red lines for China. They must not be challenged. These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations. Fifth, it is important to conduct more dialogue and cooperation. Under the current circumstances, common interests between China and the United States are expanding rather than shrinking. Their cooperation is crucial not only for the economy, trade, agriculture, counternarcotics, law enforcement and public health, but also for handling global challenges of climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as addressing international hotspot issues. The two sides should expand the list of cooperation and make a bigger pie of cooperation to achieve a win-win result. Sixth, it is important to respond to the expectations of the people. China-U.S. relations should always advance the well-being of the two peoples and bring them closer together. To facilitate personnel and cultural exchange, the two sides need to build bridges and roads, remove distractions and obstacles, and refrain from making any moves that have a chilling effect. Seventh, it is important to step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. China and the United States should always keep in mind humanity's future and their responsibilities for world peace, provide public good for the world, and act in a way conducive to global unity, including carrying out constructive interactions, refraining from mutual attrition, and not coercing other countries into taking sides.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xi added: -When the two countries treat each other as partner and seek common ground while shelving differences, their relationship will make considerable progress. But if they regard each other as rival and pursue vicious competition, they will roil the relationship or even set it back…Neither decoupling nor supply-chain disruption is the solution; common development can only be achieved through mutually beneficial cooperation. ‘Small yard, high fences' is not what a major country should do; only openness and sharing can advance the well-being of humanity. A stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. China and the United States should keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet, and inject more certainty and positive energy into the world.- Some other key points: -Xi stressed that cross-Strait peace and stability and ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities are irreconcilable as water and fire. If the U.S side cares about maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, it is crucial that it sees clearly the true nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities in seeking ‘Taiwan independence', handles the Taiwan question with extra prudence, unequivocally opposes ‘Taiwan independence', and supports China's peaceful reunification.- -The Chinese people's right to development is not to be deprived of or ignored. While all countries need to safeguard their national security, they should not overstretch the national security concept, still less use it as a pretext for malicious moves to constrain and contain other countries.- -China firmly upholds its territory, sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. Dialogue and consultation between states concerned is always the best way to manage differences in the South China Sea. The United States should not get involved in bilateral disputes over the relevant islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao, nor should it aid or abet the impulsion to make provocations.- The report adds that -the two Presidents reiterated the seven-point common understandings on the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations, namely treating each other with respect, finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the United Nations Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship. The two sides are ready to uphold these principles, continue to stabilize China-U.S. relations, and ensure a smooth transition of the relationship.- Also: -The two Presidents believed that the two sides have had candid and constructive dialogue on AI. The two sides co-sponsored each other's resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly on AI. They affirmed the need to enhance international cooperation and promote AI for good and for all. The two Presidents stressed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.- Subscribe now The US readout said that: Biden -welcomed efforts to maintain open channels of communication with the PRC to manage competition responsibly and prevent it from veering into conflict or confrontation…On counternarcotics, both sides affirmed the importance of continued coordinated law enforcement actions, information exchanges to identify new and emerging drug trends, and regulatory actions. President Biden welcomed the PRC's scheduling of 55 dangerous synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals, closure of online platforms and companies that supply precursor chemicals, and arrests connected to the illicit chemical industry, and he called for additional steps in the period ahead. Both sides welcomed the resumption over the last year of high-level military-to-military communications, the U.S.-China Defense Policy Coordination Talks, U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings, and engagements between theater commanders. Both leaders affirmed the need to continue these channels of communication.- -The two leaders affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons. The two leaders also stressed the need to consider carefully the potential risks and develop AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner…- -President Biden condemned the deployment of thousands of DPRK troops to Russia, a dangerous expansion of Russia's unlawful war against Ukraine with serious consequences for both European and Indo-Pacific peace and security. He expressed deep concern over the PRC's continued support for Russia's defense industrial base. President Biden emphasized the United States' commitment to upholding international law and freedom of navigation, overflight, and peace and stability in the South China Sea and East China Sea. On Taiwan, President Biden underscored that the United States' one China policy remains unchanged, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. He reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He called for an end to destabilizing PRC military activity around Taiwan.- -President Biden raised concerns about the PRC's unfair trade policies and emphasized that the United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine the national security of the United States or its partners, without unduly limiting trade and investment. The President noted the importance of human rights and the responsibility of all nations to respect their human rights commitments. He emphasized that it remains a priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are unjustly detained or subject to exit bans in China. The President raised deep concerns about ongoing PRC cyberattacks targeting civilian critical infrastructure and threatening the safety and security of Americans.- Subscribe now Subsequently, the Chinese foreign ministry issued an explanatory statement. It reiterated the key points made in the readout. Some messages for the incoming administration are as follows: -in his interactions with President Biden, President Xi fully shared his views on how the two sides should approach bilateral relations, which provide strategic guidance and are important for the direction of this relationship.- -President Xi vividly compared the relationship between China and the U.S. to a mansion. He proposed in 2021 during the virtual meeting with President Biden that the two countries need to follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, which is the dome of the mansion. During the 2022 Bali meeting, he underscored China's four red lines on the Taiwan question, path and system, democracy and human rights, and right to development, which is the foundation of the mansion. During the meeting in San Francisco in 2023, he stated that China and the U.S. should jointly develop a right perception, manage disagreements effectively, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder responsibilities as major countries and promote people-to-people exchanges, which are the five pillars of the mansion, the spokesperson said. In Lima, President Xi insightfully listed seven experiences and inspirations that the two countries should draw from the course of their relations, namely, to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. He stressed that the two sides should continue to add building blocks to the mansion, and expressed readiness to make joint effort with President Biden and his successor towards this end, the spokesperson said.- -The spokesperson noted that President Xi in particular stressed that China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged.- Subscribe now Along with this, let's look at Page 3, where we have a report on the US-China Political Dialogue, which was held in Shenzhen. The report says that Liu Jianchao spoke at the event. More than 50 participants attended, including representatives from Chinese ministries and commissions, local governments, universities, think tanks, as well as strategic and business figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. -The two sides agreed that a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship serves the common interests of both countries and is also the common expectation of the international community. It is also their common belief that China and the United States should maintain contact and communication, properly manage differences, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and shoulder their responsibilities as major countries in promoting world peace and development. They also expressed the belief that with multi-dimensional and multi-faceted characteristics, the China-U.S. relationship faces many uncertainties, but at the same time has strong resilience.- Share Tracking People's Daily Now let's look at other bilateral engagements that Xi had. These were covered in Sunday's paper. First, the Chinese readout (English report) of Xi's meeting with Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba says: -Xi Jinping stressed that the current international and regional situations are facing changes and turbulence, and China-Japan relations are at a critical period of improvement and development. China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world. The relationship between the two countries has great significance beyond bilateral relations.

Wang expressed the hope that Canada will work with China to meet each other halfway, view China's development objectively and rationally, and do more things that are conducive to the development of bilateral relations and the enhancement of mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples, so as to promote cooperation and reduce differences between the two countries.

Canada should earnestly abide by the World Trade Organization rules and lift discriminatory restrictions on Chinese products. Wang stressed that the Taiwan question concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the one-China principle is the universal consensus of the international community and an important part of the post-World War II international order, which can not be challenged.

Dear Elon, Let's Talk Cooperation	Hi folks, Doing an extra edition today, detailing one rather interesting article in the paper today. This one is bylined Hua Ping (). It talks about the Tesla Effect as part of China's NEV sector. The article's purpose is to praise Tesla's impact on China's NEV sector and make the case for open economic cooperation between China and the US. The argument is that China's opening benefited Tesla; Tesla's factory and presence in the Chinese market benefited the Chinese NEV sector as a whole; and the consequent expansion of China's NEV sector has benefited the global economy and green transition. Ergo, Dear Elon, your company is awesome; please let President-elect Donald Trump know that the US and China must focus on win-win and multi-win collaboration. -The article argues that after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector were fully lifted, demonstrating China's confidence in steadily expanding institutional opening-up.- ，，。 It adds: -In April 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping announced, ‘we must quickly relax foreign ownership restrictions, especially foreign investment restrictions, in the automotive industry'. Three months later, Tesla announced the construction of a factory in Shanghai, with a total investment of 50 billion yuan and planned annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. In January 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory broke ground, and in December of the same year, the first complete vehicle rolled off the production line. As the first wholly foreign-owned new energy vehicle project, Tesla's ‘complete vehicle manufacturing', with its ‘Tesla speed' of starting construction, completing construction, and starting production all in the same year, provided Tesla with broad development space, and also brought a ‘catfish effect', compelling Chinese automakers to accelerate innovation. China's new energy vehicle production ‘exceeding 10 million annually' has one important reason: facing fierce competition in an open environment and facing Tesla's ‘catfish effect', Chinese auto companies dared to confront challenges directly and actively adapted and sought change. Developing real capabilities through open competition, today's China has become the world's most active industrial center for new energy vehicle technological innovation. In 2023, China's automobile exports jumped to first place globally, among which new energy vehicle exports exceeded 1.2 million units, increasing by 77.6% year-on-year.- 20184，，--。3，，500，50。20191，，12。--，、、--，，--，. --，，，--，、。，。2023，，120，77.6%。 Share The article then makes the following points: Starting from November 1, the new version of the negative list for foreign investment access will be implemented. The number of restrictive measures will be reduced from 31 to 29. This means that China has the firm determination to promote a higher level of opening up, and is brave enough to enhance its openness in expanding international cooperation and win new advantages in international competition. 111，，3129。，，。 China's NEV sector's growth is a product of -integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation.- And they have -achieved a strong rise, transitioning from running alongside others to leading the way in terms of production and sales, core technologies, and levels of intelligence.- ，--。，、、. China's NEVs hitting the 10 million production volume is a -‘green milestone' for the global new energy industry.- Green and low-carbon development is a universal trend, which cannot be blocked by ‘small yards and high walls'. In the first three quarters of this year, China exported a total of 928,000 NEVs, a year-on-year increase of 12.5%. Faced with ‘additional tariffs' and other big sticks, global consumers have used their actions to express their love for quality products and their pursuit of green and low-carbon concepts.- 、，--。，92.8，12.5%。--，、. Leave a comment It then says: -Cooperation and mutual benefit are the right path and broad way, while isolation and exclusivity are dead ends. Only through cooperative win-win can things be accomplished, be done well, and be done on a grand scale. Leveraging advantages in technology and brand, and backed by China's super-large-scale consumer market, Tesla's substantial sales growth has driven rapid development of upstream and downstream industry and supply chains. Today, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory has achieved a localization rate of parts exceeding 95%, and more than 60 suppliers have entered Tesla's global supply chain system. Relying on China's perfect supply chain system and first-class intelligent manufacturing capabilities, Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory has an average of one vehicle rolling off the assembly line every 30 seconds. In 2023, the output of Tesla's Chinese factory accounts for more than half of its global production capacity, of which 36% caters to the export market. Tesla's success in the Chinese market is a process of mutual and multi-win collaboration, aligning with the global division of labour in industrial and supply chains in the era of economic globalisation. It exemplifies the philosophy of cooperative win-win outcomes and harmonious coexistence.- Share Tracking People's Daily -Today, more and more multinational car companies are utilising the advantages of China's market, technology, and policy openness to achieve the transformation of ‘in China, for the world'. In Hungary, Spain, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil ... Chinese new energy vehicle companies are establishing overseas factories to promote green cooperation and facilitate the green, low-carbon transition in more countries and regions. On the evening of November 14, the Peruvian Chancay Port, a key BRI project jointly built by China and Peru, opened. As South America's first intelligent green port, its operation will create over 8,000 direct jobs annually for Peru, generate $4.5 billion in revenue, and mark the emergence of the new Asia-Latin America land-sea corridor in the new era. ‘From Chancay to Shanghai', from win-win to multi-win. Human society is closely linked, and the greatest consensus on win-win and multi-win cooperation is the future.- ，。、、。、，，，。95%，60。，30。2023，，36%。，、，，、。，、，-，-。，，，，……，。1114，--。，8000，45，。--，。、，、. -Chinese-style modernization is modernization on the path of peaceful development. Based on the concept of win-win cooperation, we continue to provide new opportunities for world development with new achievements in Chinese-style modernization, and are willing to work with all parties to promote the realization of world modernization of peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity. Great opening up brings great development, and high-level opening up promotes high-quality development. In opening up, we have not only acquired real skills, but also greatly enhanced our confidence in development. Having faced countless risks and challenges, by steadfastly expanding openness and focusing on managing our own affairs well, we have ultimately turned dangers into safety and crises into opportunities. Using openness to drive reform and promote development, today's China is more resilient and steadfast than ever. By working together globally and embracing harmonious coexistence, and with an even more open and inclusive mindset, the world will surely reach its next ‘green milestone' more quickly.- 。，，、、。，。，，。，，，、。，，，。、，，--。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

China-Peru Joint Statement - Celebrating NEV Output Landmark - Funding Basic Research - Yin Hejun Outlines Sci-Tech Tasks - Philippines Sends Supplies...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, November 15, 2024. Page 1: Let's start by covering Xi Jinping's visit to Peru. The paper is lagging behind on developments. Today, it has carried Xi's article published in Peruvian media (English report) outlet El Peruano. Xi called Peru a -‘neighbor' of China across the Pacific Ocean-. He wrote: -Peruvian thinker José Carlos Mariátegui once said, ‘Spiritually and materially, China is closer to us than Europe. The psychology of our people is more Asian than Western.' This is the ‘code of civilization' that explains the inseparable bond between immigrants of Chinese origin and the local people, forged through seamless integration and familial ties over the past 175 years.- -Peru is one of the first Latin American countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For over 50 years, our bilateral relations have been progressing steadily. Especially since the elevation of our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013, our ties have grown stronger and our practical cooperation fruitful, bringing tangible benefits to our peoples. In fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, China sent a medical expert team to Peru. We also provided vaccines and other medical supplies to the best of our ability. We have proven through concrete actions that China is a trustworthy friend that Peru can rely on in crucial moments. Peru is the first Latin American country to sign a package FTA with China. It is also among the first in Latin America to participate in cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. China has been Peru's largest trading partner and largest export market for 10 consecutive years. Last year, Peru's exports to China accounted for 36 percent of its total exports. Chinese businesses have an investment stock of about US$ 30 billion in Peru. The Las Bambas copper mine, a project with investment from Chinese enterprises, contributes to about 1 percent of Peru's GDP, creating tens of thousands of job opportunities. The Saúl Garrido Rosillo Hospital in Tumbes, a project undertaken by a Chinese enterprise, will serve over 100,000 local residents. The water project in the three districts of Lima will enable more than 400,000 people to access clean water and sanitation services.- The article talks about the inauguration ceremony of Chancay Port, which Xi has already participated in along with the Peruvian president Dina Boluarte. In the article, Xi wrote that: -This is not only an important project under Belt and Road cooperation, but also the first smart port in South America. The first phase of the project, when completed, will reduce the sea shipping time from Peru to China to 23 days, thus cutting logistics costs by at least 20 percent. It is expected to generate US$ 4.5 billion in yearly revenues for Peru and create over 8,000 direct jobs. The completion of Chancay Port will enable Peru to put in place a multi-dimensional, diverse and efficient network of connectivity spanning from coast to inland, from Peru to Latin America and further on to the Caribbean. It will also help build an Inca Trail of the New Era with Chancay Port as its starting point, thus boosting the overall development and integration of the region. The port's development plan also includes establishing animal rescue services to fulfill its social responsibility for the rescue and protection of penguins, seals, and birds and to improve the environment of wetlands, beaches, and habitats. It is thus very important that we work together to ensure the success of Chancay Port from construction through operation, so that the route from Chancay to Shanghai will lead China, Peru and Latin America to common development and prosperity.- Xi also promised that -China is also ready to launch in Peru more ‘small and beautiful' livelihood cooperation projects, open more Luban Workshops and centers for Chinese language learning, and strengthen cooperation on vocational education. We will encourage Chinese companies to create more jobs and fulfill their social responsibilities in Peru, making our paisano friendship more tangible and beneficial.- He added: -We should take more measures to facilitate personnel exchanges to garner greater public support for our relations. We should enhance cooperation under the framework of the Ancient Civilizations Forum. We should explore the establishment of a global network for dialogue and cooperation among civilizations, and support their exchanges and mutual learning.- And said: -China is ready to join Peru in embracing a broader vision and grasping the underlying trends of our times from a long historical perspective to champion true multilateralism, promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and build together a community with a shared future for mankind.- Subscribe now Xi has already held talks with the Peruvian president. The detailed readout is awaited. But the joint statement following the talks is out. Key points: Both sides are satisfied with the fruitful results of the talks, which will deepen bilateral cooperation in strategic areas such as infrastructure, energy, and mining. Both sides emphasize that the ‘Joint Action Plan 2024-2029' has great significance for promoting the development of bilateral relations. Both sides commit to taking concrete actions to implement this plan. ，、。，《20242029》。. Both sides emphasized that China's development brings new cooperation opportunities for developing countries, including Peru. The Chinese side reiterated its support for Peru to follow an economic and social development path that suits its national conditions, and wished Peru success in achieving its related goals.75，。，。，. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and core interests of all countries. Peru reiterated its firm adherence to the one-China principle. 《》，、。. Both sides welcome the signing of the upgraded protocol of the China-Peru Free Trade Agreement during this visit. Both sides are willing to continue to promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen customs inspection and quarantine cooperation, and increase trade in high value-added products. 。，，. Both sides emphasized the importance of bilateral mechanisms such as the China-Peru Strategic Dialogue on Economic Cooperation. The two sides held the fourth strategic dialogue on economic cooperation in October 2024, conducted effective dialogues in the field of investment, and exchanged experiences and practices on issues such as investment standardization and facilitation. 。202410，，、. The document talks about cooperation in large-scale infrastructure projects, and areas like circular economy, sustainable agriculture, industrial and supply chains, digital economy investment, and green development. Both sides welcomed Chinese airlines to establish air links between China and Peru through code sharing to cultivate the market for the opening of direct flights between the two countries. ，. — Just a note on this. Xi stopped over in Gran Canaria on his way to Peru. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in digital economy, scientific and technological innovation, digital transformation, talent exchange, technology transfer, and digital security, promoting the development of emerging technologies like AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, data analytics, nanotechnology, and telemedicine. 、、、、、，、、、、、、. The two sides -stressed that it is of great significance to strengthen cooperation in AI capacity building and enhance the digital competitiveness of all people, especially the vulnerable groups. During the life cycle of AI systems, special attention should be paid to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, human dignity, safeguarding personal privacy and data, and promoting diversity and inclusiveness.- ，、。，、、、，，. The document then talks about strengthening cultural, educational and tourism exchanges. China also committed to doing -small but beautiful cooperation projects in the field of people's livelihood- and -provide economic and technical assistance to Peru within its capacity.- Both sides are willing to strengthen fishery cooperation, promote sustainable development of fisheries, cooperate to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and agree to strengthen communication and exchanges between the law enforcement agencies of both sides. ，，、、，. The next bits talk about their -commitment to multilateralism, safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law…-; support for -the open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core- and decision to -jointly safeguard multilateralism and oppose protectionism-; and -willingness to continue to promote the construction of high-quality cooperation mechanisms in key areas such as economy, trade, investment, minerals, infrastructure, industry, finance, industry, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, green development, blue economy, new infrastructure construction, renewable energy, digital economy and e-commerce.- This is under BRI. Peru welcomes China's willingness to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and reiterates that this agreement has expanded and enriched trade exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region. 《》，. Peru positively evaluates the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by China. And it reaffirmed support for GDI. Interestingly, there is no mention of GSI or the Global AI Governance Initiative by China. Anyway, -China appreciated Peru's joining the ‘Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative' and invited Peru to join the Global Development Promotion Center Network.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a Ren Ping article discussing that as of November 14, China's new energy vehicles output exceeded 10 million for the first time. The article says that -this is an important node for China to move from a large automobile country to a powerful automobile country, marking a new stage of high-quality development for China's new energy vehicle industry.- 1114，1000。，. The report adds that: Looking back. In 2012, the annual output was 13,000 vehicles. In 2018, the annual output reached 1 million. In 2024, the annual output is expected to reach 12 million vehicles. Looking at the world.

The article adds that: -the reason why the new energy vehicle industry has grown from small to large and from weak to strong is that technological innovation is the key variable. After the ‘Qilin' battery and ‘Shenxing' battery, CATL recently released the ‘Xiaoyao' super range-extended hybrid battery. This is the world's first range-extended hybrid battery with a pure electric range of over 400 km, featuring 4C ultra-fast charging capability. In recent years, China has made major breakthroughs in core technology paths such as plug-in hybrid, pure electric, and hydrogen fuel, and has a leading advantage in the three major technical fields of new energy vehicles, such as batteries, motors, and electronic controls. By driving industrial innovation with technological innovation and strategically arranging the industrial chain around the development of new-quality productive forces, China has significantly enhanced the resilience and security level of the supply and industrial chains. Over 1000 intelligent devices, over 3000 robots working intelligently in coordination, 100% automation of key processes ... Using intelligent production, Chongqing SERES super factory rolls off two new energy vehicles per minute. Behind China's transition from ‘Made in China' to ‘Intelligently Made in China' is the ‘qualitative change' brought by technological innovation. As of now, China has established 421 national-level intelligent manufacturing demonstration factories and built tens of thousands of provincial-level digital workshops and intelligent factories.- 、，。、，--。400，4C。，、、，、、。，，。1000，3000，100%……，。，--。，421，. The article adds: In order to promote Chinese-style modernization, technological innovation is the only way. The 2024 Global Innovation Index Report shows that China's global innovation ranking has jumped to 11th place, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in innovation in the past 10 years. In the first three quarters of this year, investment in high-tech industries increased by 10.0% year-on-year, 6.6 percentage points higher than total investment, maintaining double-digit growth for 7 consecutive months. The added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.1%, 3.3 percentage points faster than all industries above designated size. We have sufficient strength and great potential to develop new quality productive forces by using disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, and new momentum. We will continue to do a good job in innovation, promote the accelerated integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation, and achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. The scientific and technological support for Chinese-style modernization will be stronger. ，。《2024》，，10。，10.0%，6.6，7。9.1%，3.3。、、，，、。，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the article says: -Developing new energy vehicles is a strategic choice to conform to the trend of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation and promote green and low-carbon development. Since the new era, with the new development concept as a strategic guide and the goal of meeting the diverse needs of the people through green and low-carbon smart products, new energy vehicles have strongly driven the real economy toward a path of green and low-carbon development. In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, new-quality productive forces and a broad range of consumers are ‘heading toward each other' — a 2022 market survey showed that users under 40 years old accounted for as much as 84% of new energy vehicle users in China, with people under 30 making up nearly half. A survey in the second quarter of this year showed that 53.6% of Chinese consumers chose new energy vehicles, noticeably higher than the 36.2% who preferred fuel-powered vehicles … In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, we are seizing the historical opportunity of electrification, intelligence and green transformation, taking the lead in switching to a new track, and establishing new advantages in international competition. In the first three quarters of this year, China's cumulative exports of new energy vehicles reached 928,000, an increase of 12.5% ​​year-on-year. This has not only met the needs of global consumers for high-quality products and services, but has also led the global transportation energy transformation and reform…Today, China's high-quality production capacity of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, etc., has provided important support for the world's green development.

Share In contrast, reporting from the US indicates that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation. Reuters' report adds that: -ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla - by far the nation's biggest EV maker - have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ‘devastating' to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors…Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said…Trump campaigned on ending Biden's ‘EV mandate', without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden's clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump could use the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans plan to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions.- Another report, meanwhile, quotes CATL's Robin Zeng saying that the company would be open to invest in a plant in the US if Trump opens the door to Chinese investment in the electric-vehicle supply chain. The report adds: -Trump wants to prevent Chinese auto imports but has said he remains open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the United States. Trump told Reuters in an August interview: ‘We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers.' Such comments have kept Zeng interested in a US expansion for CATL. ‘I do hope that in the future they are open to investments,' he said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang signing a decree of the State Council, unveiling a set of revised regulations on the use of the national natural science fund. This will come into effect on January 1, 2025. The Regulations have 7 chapters and 45 articles.

The CCG questioned and confirmed the Philippine ship and supervised the entire process. It is hoped that the Philippines will honour its commitment, move in the same direction as China, and jointly manage the maritime situation.

Share Tracking People's Daily The MoFA readout has some additional context. Wang Yi emphasized that the leadership of the heads of state is the greatest political advantage and fundamental guarantee for the high-quality development of China-Russia relations. The China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism must take the implementation of the consensus between the two heads of state as its fundamental guideline, strengthening coordination on strategic and overarching issues that concern the security and development interests of both sides, continuously enhancing the level of strategic mutual trust, and enriching the substance of strategic cooperation. China-Russia relations possess an inevitable historical logic and strong internal driving force. The more complex the international situation and the more external challenges arise, the more both sides should firmly unite and cooperate to safeguard their common interests.

Instead of this, I want to point to the Xinhua Institute's report that was released during this forum. It is titled: -New Model for Human Advancement and Its Global Significance-. If there is any doubt that Beijing sees value in promoting its governance model, let me share the following for you to consider. The report talks about how China has created a -distinct path to modernization- under the CPC -and thereby created a new model for human advancement, which provides effective solutions to the problems facing the entire humanity-. It adds that -the emergence of the new model for human advancement has brought the Chinese civilization back to the frontier of human advancement.- -The emergence of the new model for human advancement has exerted enormous influence upon the whole world. It busted the myth that ‘modernization is Westernization', and created an effective path toward modernization for almost one fifth of the world population, thus offering a brand-new option for large numbers of developing countries seeking modernization.The new model for human advancement is a huge contribution that China has made to innovating both the theory and practice of the world's modernization efforts, as it contributes the Chinese wisdom to tackling global challenges, and points out the right way to further progress of human advancement. Highly inclusive, this new model for human advancement sticks to allowing cultural exchanges to transcend estrangement, mutual learning to transcend clashes, and coexistence to transcend feelings of superiority.This new form, constantly enriched and developed as it fuels the construction of a better world, will play a huge role in making the garden of the world civilizations more colorful and vibrant.- Later, the report discusses the constituents of the Chinese model. One of the aspects discussed is -Political Integrity-. This consists of the -Leadership Core of the CPC-, -Whole-Process People's Democracy-, and -Law-Based Governance on All Fronts-. The final chapter of the report seeks to draw lessons from the Chinese model for others. It says: -By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development. By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development.- It adds: -Western style modernization has never adequately tackled numerous human development challenges, and has instead exacerbated crises in some developing countries. The unique worldviews, values, and views on history, civilization, democracy, and ecology, and their remarkable application in Chinese modernization, have made vital innovative contributions to the theory and practice of global modernization. They also demonstrate to the world that the path to modernization is not unique to any one country, and human civilization still moves on and history's final chapter remains unwritten.- Then we get select points pitching the Chinese model: The new model for human advancement deriving from Chinese modernization reflects a disparate worldview that emphasizes the pursuit of common prosperity for all rather than zero-sum games. China holds the conviction that the development of all nations is closely intertwined, and humanity is a global community of shared future where all people rise and fall together. Only through concerted efforts, solidarity, and cooperation among all nations can humanity secure a brighter future. The new model for human advancement originating from Chinese modernization showcases distinctive values that prioritize the well-being of people over the accumulation of capital. In terms of value orientation, Chinese modernization, which conforms to the people-centered principle, is fundamentally different fromWestern-style modernization, which, on the contrary, worships capital. Chinese modernization insists on development for the people, by the people and to the benefit of the people. The new model for human advancement resulting from Chinese modernization embodies a unique historical perspective highlighting a broad view of history rather than the shallow-minded narrative of the ‘end of history'. China argues that the progression of human society is driven by fundamental social contradictions, and it is the universal laws governing the movement of these contradictions that shape the basic trajectory of humanity's historical development. In pursuing modernization, China emphasizes the importance of summarizing historical experiences, understanding historical laws, and initiating historical progress. By analyzing evolutionary mechanisms and exploring major historical patterns through the lens of historical context, current trends, and global dynamics, and proposing corresponding strategies, China has constantly sustained the vigor and vitality of Marxism, and showcased the profound historical depth of its civilization traversing over five millennia. The new model for human advancement emanating from Chinese modernization offers a different perspective on civilization that stresses exchanges and mutual learning rather than conflict and estrangement. The new model for human advancement stemming from Chinese modernization underlines whole-process people's democracy which stands out as a distinct concept compared to mere formal democracy. China claims that democracy is a treasure shared by all humankind rather than a patent of a few countries; whether a country is democratic or not is determined solely by its citizens; democracy is not an ornament or a façade, and the criterion for evaluating democracy should not solely center on its form, but rather on whether it truly allows its people to govern their own affairs and whether it can be employed to address people's concerns. People are entitled to the right to elect and vote, and moreover, to extensive participation; they can express their will freely and see it effectively fulfilled; better still, they can also do their part in promoting national development and share in its gains. Whole-process people's democracy embodies the will and voices of the people in every facet of national political and social life, transcending the formal democratic model of the West solely obsessed with ‘votes' and showcasing the edges of socialist democracy in governance efficiency. The new model for human advancement forged by Chinese modernization encompasses a distinct ecological outlook that advocates for creating a community of all life on Earth. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the report says: -China does not follow the old path of some countries in achieving modernization through war, colonization and plunder. On the contrary, it holds high the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, seeking its own progress while resolutely safeguarding world peace and development. China's successful advancement towards modernization can be attributed to its adherence to the overall leadership of the CPC in propelling Chinese modernization, its commitment to people-centered development philosophy, its perseverance in pursuing an independent path, its effective employment of reform and opening-up, its insistence on innovation-driven development, and its systematic approach to support progress. These remarkable experiences and practices have set a good example for the vast array of developing countries to pursue modernization on their own, offered fresh options for nations who want to accelerate development while preserving their independence, and provided Chinese solutions for humankind's exploration of a better social system.- After this, the report talks about GDI, GSI and GCI. Some useful data points: Since the GDI's introduction, China has established over 30 cooperative platforms and initiated more than 1,100 projects in eight key areas including poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, and digital-age connectivity, which cover all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda. So far, China has invested and mobilized a range of development funds totaling nearly USD 20 billion and launched more than 600 projects from the GDI project database. Currently, the GSI has won support and applause from over 100 countries and international organizations as it represents China's solution to address global peace deficit and security challenges… Share Tracking People's Daily Page 4: There is a brief report on a seminar held in Shanghai to study Xi's thoughts on urban governance work. Propaganda chief Li Shulei and Shanghai Secretary Chen Jining spoke at this meeting. Page 9: There's an article by the National Defense University's Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center. My Note: This is an important article to read for people around the world, particularly those in India, who seem to assume that the logic of economic engagement with China can rest simply on the basis of economic principles. National security thinking is deeply embedded in Beijing's approach, and I would argue that it is understandable for Beijing to have these national security concerns. However, you should ignore this reality at your own peril. This does not mean that one must decouple or that decoupling is inevitable. In fact, decoupling is impractical and will have adverse economic and strategic consequences. But one needs to appreciate that security will have to be a key component of economic decisionmaking. Conceptually, this is self-evident now. The debate, therefore, needs to move away from this argument to focussing on modalities for estimating risk and vulnerability, sectoral and sub-sectoral actions, and putting in place processes that ensure that security concerns do not result in opacity and unpredictability in policymaking, which will adversely affect businesses. Share Tracking People's Daily Anyway, back to the article. The article begins by telling us that the Third Plenum Decision held that -national security provides a pivotal foundation for ensuring steady and sustained progress in Chinese modernization-. -This important conclusion profoundly demonstrates the foresight of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in coordinating development and security, and provides scientific guidance to build a solid security guarantee for China's modernization-. The article says: Proactively addressing various risks and challenges serves the intrinsic requirement to support the undertaking of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. Using Chinese-style modernization to comprehensively advance the building of a strong nation and the great cause of national rejuvenation is not going to be a smooth, obstacle-free path but rather a long expedition that requires continuously breaking through barriers and seizing strategic positions. At present, China's development has entered a period where various risks and challenges are accumulating and even manifesting at once. The risks and tests faced on the path forward will only become more complex, and may even encounter unimaginable stormy seas. For an undertaking as immensely challenging yet magnificent as Chinese-style modernization, one cannot expect everything to go smoothly. It is essential to deeply understand that security has become a regular and crucial variable in China's economic and social development. While developing, we must solidly lay the security foundation and repeatedly strengthen the security base. Only by comprehensively strengthening the national security barrier, firmly grasping the strategic initiative in maintaining national security, and striving to either prevent major risks from appearing or being able to withstand and get through them when they do appear, can we truly achieve higher quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable and safer development, and ensure that a series of major development strategic goals of the Party and the country will be achieved as scheduled. ，、。、，，。，，，。，，，、。，，、，、、、、，. The next paragraph pats China on the back for achieving the -two miracles-. It then cautions: -Without national security, development miracles can only be ‘castles in the air', the dream of a good life can only be illusory, and already-achieved results could be destroyed in an instant. Therefore, to write a new chapter of the ‘two miracles' and effectively meet the people's growing need for a better life, it is essential to ensure that national security is guaranteed, continually resolving the risks and challenges along the path forward.- ，，--，--，。，--、，，. The steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization is inseparable from a peaceful international environment and a good neighbouring environment. At present, the profound once-in-a-century changes are accelerating in their evolution, traditional security and non-traditional security issues are complexly intertwined, the interconnected nature, transnational nature, and diversity of security issues are becoming more prominent, and the backflow effect, confluence effect, superposition effect, linkage effect, amplification effect, and inducement effect of various risks are becoming more pronounced. Only by upholding national sovereignty, security, and development interests with core national interests as the bottom line and leading the reform of the global governance system based on the principles of fairness and justice, both promoting our own development through maintaining world peace and contributing to world peace through our own development, resolutely opposing all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and firmly rejecting all practices that sacrifice other countries' security to gain absolute security for oneself, can we promote the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. In doing so, we can integrate safeguarding national security and promoting international security, making Chinese-style modernization progress more steadily and soundly. 、、，。、，。，。，，，、、，、、、、、。、、，，，，，，，，. The second section reiterates that as per the third plenum outcome national security is -a pivotal foundation for the steady and sustained development of Chinese-style modernization.- It adds: -This major conclusion examines national security from the perspective of the central tasks of the Party and the country in the new era and new journey, so that the theory and practice of national security are closely centered on Chinese-style modernization, and more theoretical innovations related to Chinese-style modernization will emerge in the field of national security.- ，，. It adds that -the issue of national security has a distinct political nature.- -Linking national security with central tasks for positioning and deployment fully demonstrates the political considerations of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, endows national security with a deeper political foundation, and enables us to implement the overall national security concept from a higher political position.- ，，，。 A country's development and security are like two wings of one body, two wheels of one drive. They complement each other and cannot be neglected. They coexist and share a common fate. Security without the support of development is unlikely to endure, and development without the safeguard of security cannot be sustainable. The ‘Decision' of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee regards national security as an important foundation for the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization, enriching the contemporary connotation of the dialectics of coordinating development and security. On the new journey, whether it is promoting high-quality development or creating high-level security, it must be viewed and planned in the overall situation of Chinese-style modernization. Only in this way can we promote high-level security with high-quality development and ensure high-quality development with high-level security, and achieve mutual support and promotion between high-quality development and high-level security, truly building a position of permanent security and achieving the enterprise of long-term governance.- ，、，、，、。，；，。《》，。，，。，、，、，、. The third and final section talks about practical implications. It calls for the -modernization of the national security system and capacity-. It adds: In practice, we must effectively use systematic thinking to observe security situations, analyze security issues, plan security countermeasures; be good at observing big trends, planning big matters, strengthen forward-looking thinking, overall planning, strategic layout, and comprehensive advancement; promote the connection, coordination and unified advancement of national security work in all fields and aspects. For example, we must emphasize coordinating external security and internal security, territorial security and citizen security, traditional security and non-traditional security, self security and common security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, and effectively prevent various types of risk transmission and superposition. At the same time, we must take scientific coordination as an important principle and basic method of national security work, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, emphasize the synergy between national security work and various economic and social development work, achieve planning together and deploying together, and integrate national security into all aspects and links of the overall work of the Party and the country.- ，、、，、，、、、，、。，、、、，，、。，，，，、，.
