CCDI Plenary Communiqué Outlines Tougher Action Plans in Anti-Corruption Struggle - Boosting Support for 'Two New' Policies in 2025	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 9, 2025. Page 1: Let's begin with the full communique after the CCDI plenary session. 131 CCDI members and 247 observers attended the plenary session. The first substantive paragraph outlines what was done during the plenary. It begins by saying that the -session thoroughly studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.- The next bit says: The plenary session earnestly studied and deeply understood the important speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It unanimously held that the speech fully affirmed the new progress and achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance over the past year, grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle from the strategic height of realizing the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and new journey, and deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, unequivocally clarified erroneous understandings and cleared ideological fog with a clear-cut stance, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battles against corruption, made strategic plans to provide strong guarantees for advancing Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance, and placed high expectations on discipline inspection and supervision cadres. 、。，，，，，、，、、，，.

A sense of reverence must always be maintained, efforts must be intensified to strengthen the standardization, legalisation, and professionalization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and truly achieve loyalty, cleanliness and responsibility, and dare to struggle and be good at struggle. 、、、，、、，、、。，，、，、，--，，，、、，。，，、. The long paragraph below gives a recap of the work from 2024. The plenary session pointed out that in 2024, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Party adhered to leading the great social revolution through self-revolution, united and guided the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups to focus their efforts and overcome challenges and took new and solid strides in advancing Chinese-style modernisation. The CCDI, NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly supported the Two Establishments and resolutely implemented the Two Safeguards'; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the country, they continued to deepen political supervision, rectify work styles, discipline and the fight against corruption; promoted the improvement of the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party system, improved the supervision system of the Party and the country, consolidated and expanded the results of thematic education and education rectification, and ensured that the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey achieved new results. The CCDI Standing Committee made the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution, the central theme and focus throughout the year, leading the whole system to deeply study and understand the Party's innovative theories, and firmly follow the correct direction of discipline inspection and supervision work. The mechanism for making political oversight more specific, precise, and normalised were improved, with political supervision being focussed around the major decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee to ensure the effective implementation of the Party Central Committee's policies and plans. In the study and education of Party discipline, efforts are made to excel as the ‘first phalanx', thoroughly studying and comprehending General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses on comprehensively strengthening the Party's disciplinary construction. Focusing closely on the ‘Six Disciplines', each was studied item by item and discussed in depth, guiding the entire system to learn more profoundly, become familiar with and effectively apply the knowledge, and promote the entire Party to study, understand, respect, and abide by discipline. We continued to severely curb hedonism and extravagance, severely rectified formalism and bureaucratism, and ensured the implementation of the eight-point central regulation in an in-depth and practical manner through effective and long-term governance. The anti-corruption struggle was pushed forward in depth, with intensified efforts in key sectors such as finance, state-owned enterprises, energy, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, sports, infrastructure projects, and bidding processes; corruption involving collusion between officials and businesses were severely investigated and dealt with; new and hidden forms of corruption were thoroughly investigated and deal with; efforts to investigate both bribe-taking and bribe giving were strengthened, and reforms based on cases were deepened to eliminate the soil and conditions that breed corruption. Focused rectification was carried out on misconduct and corruption directly affecting the people, with extraordinary measures being taken to punish ‘fly and ant' corruption, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the people and consolidating the Party's governance foundation. Political inspections were deepened, with routine inspections conducted for 68 departments and units, the first-ever coordinated inspections in the financial sector, and higher-level inspections conducted in prefecture-level cities. Immediate investigations and corrections were carried out during inspections, further highlighting the comprehensive supervisory role of inspections. The discipline inspection and supervision system and legal framework were further improved. The CCDI cooperated with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to amend the Supervision Law, comprehensively advanced the construction of a digital discipline inspection and supervision system, and promoted the better transformation of institutional advantages into the effectiveness of rectifying misconduct and combating corruption. While affirming the achievements, the plenary session conducted a realistic analysis of existing problems in discipline inspection and supervision work and in the building of the cadre team, calling for great attention and practical solutions to address these issues. ，2024，，、，。，--、--，，、，、，，。，，。、、，，。--，，--、，、，。、，、，。，、、、、、、，，，，，。，--，，。，68，、，、，。，，，。，，、. The plenary session emphasized that comprehensively promoting the development of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization has placed new and higher requirements for the fight against corruption. The discipline inspection and supervision organs should: truly unify their thoughts and actions with the accurate judgment of the situation and the scientific deployment of tasks by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core deeply grasp the historic achievements made in the fight against corruption in the new era, and firmly believe in winning the tough battle against corruption; deeply grasp the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, which is still severe and complex, and firmly maintain the determination to win the protracted battle against corruption; deeply grasp the policy and strategy of promoting the principle of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, and firmly maintain the strong determination to win the overall battle against corruption. ，、，。、，，；，；、、，. The plenary session proposed that 2025 is the final year of implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan. To do a good job this year, it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on Party building and the Party's self-revolution, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, strengthen the four consciousnesses, enhance the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, promote the implementation of the political responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, promote the improvement of the system of comprehensive and strict Party governance, deepen the rectification of work style, discipline and anti-corruption struggle, and continuously promote the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey, thereby providing strong guarantees for promoting Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance. ，2025--。，，、，、，--，--、--、--，，，，，，. After this, the communique makes 8 points for work going forward: First, strengthen political supervision around the major arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and strive to promote further comprehensive deepening of reform and steady progress in China-style modernization.

First, there's a report on Wang meeting with President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso and Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Gakosso. Xinhua's report on th Wang-Denis Sassou Nguesso meeting says: -Noting that Sassou is a renowned African politician and one of the African leaders who have visited China the most and met with Xi the most, Wang said the deep friendship between the two leaders serves as a vital political guarantee for China-Congo and China-Africa relations. The Chinese foreign minister's tradition of starting the year with a visit to Africa is a testament to China's unwavering solidarity with African nations, Wang said. Calling the Republic of the Congo a staunch friend and important partner of China, Wang praised the country's vibrant development under Sassou's leadership. China will remain the country's most reliable friend and partner during its development and revitalization journey, he said. The Republic of the Congo's role as the FOCAC's co-chair reflects Africa's confidence in the country, Wang said. As the best platform for deepening China-Africa cooperation and achieving common development, the FOCAC has been leading global cooperation with Africa, Wang said, noting that China is willing to work closely with the Republic of the Congo to comprehensively implement the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, support Africa's development and jointly pursue modernization. These efforts will also enhance the Republic of the Congo's development and elevate its global standing, he added.- The report on Wang's meeting with Jean-Claude Gakosso says that the two sides pledged to implement the outcomes of FOCAC. Wang -said that it has long been a tradition for China's foreign minister to make Africa the destination of the first overseas trip each year. The longstanding tradition, which underscores China's enduring solidarity and cooperation with Africa, is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy and a firm strategic choice. He added that regardless of changes in the international landscape, China will remain committed to deepening its relations and cooperation with Africa. Describing the Republic of the Congo as a steadfast friend of China, Wang said that the two countries have shared an unbreakable bond for more than 60 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, which is characterized by consistent mutual understanding and support through challenges… As co-chair of the FOCAC, the Republic of the Congo reflects the high-level partnership between the two nations and embodies the aspirations of the African continent, Wang said, expressing his confidence in the Republic of the Congo's active fulfillment of its responsibilities as chair, contributing to the implementation of the FOCAC Beijing Summit's outcomes and advancing China-Africa cooperation.

Wang also reaffirmed China's commitment to working with African nations toward building an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- As per Xinhua, -Gakosso emphasized that the two nations have forged a unique and enduring bond, making their relationship a model for international relations. He attributed this success to their shared dedication to safeguarding global peace, upholding international justice, and pursuing common development…Gakosso reaffirmed the Republic of the Congo's unwavering support for the one-China principle and China's efforts to achieve national reunification, stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. He also voiced support for the Belt and Road Initiative and China's three global initiatives, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and expects to learn from China's governance experience.- Second, Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno on Wednesday. Mahamat reportedly said that -Xi is a visionary leader, steering China toward remarkable economic achievements and a pivotal role on the global stage…China's cooperation with Africa has always been based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, yielding fruitful results, he said. He also expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Africa's development, particularly Chad's progress. China is Chad's important strategic partner and a reliable friend, with their bilateral relations serving as a model of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Mahamat said. Chad firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and achieve national unity while opposing interference in its internal affairs, he stressed. China is committed to upholding global fairness and justice, playing a constructive role in addressing key international issues, the Chadian president said, noting that Chad is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to uphold shared positions and protect common interests.- Xinhua adds: -China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal, Wang said, noting that China opposes all forms of hegemony, bullying, and unilateralism.

Tibet Quake - Elderly Care Services Guideline - Tasks to Build a Unified National Market - Guideline for Government Investment Funds - Japanese Politi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 8, 2025. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping's instructions following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Shigatse in Tibet yesterday. Xi -ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties.- Xinhua adds that he called for -utmost efforts to carry out search and rescue and provide medical treatment for the injured. He also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath effectively. It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate disaster relief supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all-. In addition, Li Qiang issued instructions. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing is leading officials in Tibet, it seems. The Office of the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched the national earthquake level 3 emergency response. Of course, the story says nothing about the impact of the earthquake or casualties. As per reports, the death toll is at around 126. If you are interested in the official details of the emergency response, there's a report that provides those. Next, there's a commentary drawing from Xi's speech at the CCDI plenary. Some key excerpts: -Over the past year, ‘tigers' have been targeted without exception, while ‘flies' and ‘ants' (minor corrupt officials) have also been punished, with more than 700,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption among the masses being investigated and dealt with. Since the new era, the Party, military, and public have experienced unprecedented cohesion and unity; one important reason is that our Party has always punished corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude. ，--，--，70。，，. And then we have a new slogan: -In his important speech, General Secretary Xi Jinping made encapsulated the Party's achievements as the ‘two historical initiatives' (): we secured the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change colour, or change flavour, and won the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation-. --：-、、，、.- The article reiterates that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains severe and complex, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption is still arduous. The key point is to -dispel the ideological fog- so that one can -further build consensus and enhance the awareness of action.- ，，。，，。，。，，、。 The next bit says that -corruption and power often go hand in hand, which makes the fight against corruption a long-term historical process. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption exist, the fight against corruption will remain ongoing … deeply analyzing the corrupt elements investigated and dealt with since the 20th Party Congress shows that the vast majority of their disciplinary violations and illegal behaviors continued from before the 18th Party Congress and till after the 20th Party Congress, indicating both new and residual corruption. With new anti-corruption technologies, tools, and methods, corrupt officials are finding it increasingly difficult to hide. Corruption undermines fairness and justice, disrupts the business environment, and disturbs economic order. Only by resolutely removing this malignant tumor can we enable cadres to work cleanly and boldly and allow various economic actors to innovate and develop with confidence. ，，。，。，，，。、、，。、、。，、，. The next paragraph discusses what Xi means when he says that combating corruption requires adopting a historical perspective. -It means learning lessons from history, grasping the core values from the Party's century-long struggle, and understanding that to remain true to its original mission, the Party must eliminate corruption—the greatest threat. From a strategic perspective, we are in the critical period of China's modernisation construction, with the domestic and international environments undergoing profound and extensive changes, only by unswervingly combating corruption and ensuring the Party health, advanced nature, and purity can we steadily and successfully follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and remain invincible amid the profound changes unseen in a century. For Party members and cadres, when faced with temptations and enticements, they must reflect on the Party's revolutionary ideals, think about the countless revolutionary ancestors who have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, the weight of the Party and people in their hearts, think about the weight of the party and the people in their hearts, think about the consequences and harm of corruption, and think about the different fates of Marxist parties around the world. Only by rectifying their ideological roots and clearing the muddied waters, they can truly stay steady, maintain their integrity, and always uphold the political character of a Communist Party member.- ：-，、，。-？，，，。，，，，、，，。，、，，、，，，。、，、，.

As per the document, the main goals are: by 2029, the elderly care service network will be basically established, service capabilities and levels will be significantly enhanced, significant progress will be made in expanding capacity, improving quality and increasing efficiency, and the supply of basic elderly care services will be continuously optimized; by 2035, the elderly care service network will be more complete, service supply and demand will be more coordinated and adapted, all elderly people will enjoy basic elderly care services, and an elderly care service system suitable for my country's national conditions will be mature and established. ：2029，，，，；2035，，，，. I am not detailing the full document, but Xinhua reports: -According to the guidelines, basic elderly care services consist of material assistance, nursing, and caregiving services, among others. They are provided directly by the government or by parties supported by the government. The guidelines noted that the system should follow the principles of meeting essential needs and be universally accessible. In the meantime, the system should also allow families with financial difficulties to be supported in elderly care and ensure all institutional resources regarding elderly care are optimized and integrated. The guidelines listed five key aspects where more work should be done. They include forming and implementing a list of elderly care services, establishing an active response mechanism for providing accurate services, enhancing the mechanism that ensures sound elderly care services, improving service capacity, and making such services more accessible.- China Daily's report says: -The government will pay more attention to the nursing and care work of elderly people living in countryside or rural areas, especially those at older elderly, those who lost their self-care ability or with disabilities. Supervision over elderly care service companies or nursing houses will be further tightened, to make sure these companies and nursing house operators have proper fee-charging and caring behaviors. According to the guidelines, the government will encourage foreign companies to invest in the domestic pension industries by giving them some preferential treatment. The government also encourages companies to develop and promote products for the elderly and enrich their services to the elderly, aiming for a prosperous silver economy. The government will cultivate more talent for the elderly care industry by optimizing the nursing workers' evaluation system and setting up pioneer training programs for nursing workers at designated vocational schools, according to the guidelines. Also, the nation will channel resources and investment into technological programs on elderly care services such as humanoid robots and artificial intelligence. The State-level elderly care service information platform will be optimized to better balance the market's supplies and the elderly's needs.- This bit might be useful for businesses: -Actively cultivate specialized service organizations, and encourage communities, domestic service providers, Internet platform enterprises, and others to offer diverse door-to-door services such as meal assistance, bathing assistance, cleaning assistance, mobility assistance, medical assistance, and emergency assistance for the elderly, to better meet the needs of home-based care services. Accelerate the construction of elderly-friendly housing, promote home modifications for aging, support the installation of elevators in old residential communities, and strengthen the construction of barrier-free environments.- ，、、、、、、，。，，，. -Encourage social forces to newly build or renovate and expand elderly care service facilities, support expanding high-quality institutional elderly care service supply through methods such as public construction and private operation. Fully utilize elderly care institutions' roles in technical innovation demonstration, service skills training, equipment promotion and application, promote professional services extending to homes and communities.- ，。、、，. Take the development of rural elderly care services as an important part of implementing the rural revitalization strategy, and include rural elderly care service facilities in the land space planning or village planning at the township level. ，. Guide urban elderly care service institutions to operate rural elderly care service facilities and promote the balanced development of urban and rural elderly care services. ，. Encourage state-owned enterprises and public institutions to revitalize idle assets to carry out elderly care services. For those implementing entrusted operations, the lease term shall be determined based on the principle of stable operational expectations; if the operator makes significant investments, the lease term may be appropriately extended. 、，，；，. Encourage foreign investment in the domestic elderly care service industry and grant it national treatment. Vigorously develop the silver economy, strengthen the research, development, and promotion of products for the elderly, enrich elderly care service scenarios, and unlock the consumption potential of elderly care. Develop the residential tourism elderly care market, adapt to local conditions to develop new formats such as wellness-oriented residential tourism, and promote the construction of residential tourism elderly care destinations. 。，，，。，，. Another point later worth noting, since it can be part of the common prosperity agenda: -Encourage supporting the provision of elderly care services through the establishment of charitable trusts and social donations.- 、.

The report says that the guidelines put forward 25 measures across 7 areas. It calls for the -operation of government investment funds in accordance with the principles of marketisation, rule of law, and specialisation, developing patient capital, and focusing on achieving practical results. Reasonably coordinate the layout of funds to prevent homogeneous competition and the crowding-out effect on social capital. Improve the responsibility mechanism with aligned rights and obligations and compatible incentives and constraints, to promote the formation of a high-quality development pattern for government investment funds with moderate scale, reasonable layout, standardised operation, scientific efficiency, and controllable risks.- 《》，，、，，、、，，。，。、，、、、、. The article then makes seven points: First, identify the correct positioning to better serve the overall development of the country. Focus on major strategies, key areas, and weak links where the market cannot fully play its role, attract and drive more social capital, support the construction of a modern industrial system, and accelerate the cultivation of new productive forces. Leverage the role of funds as long-term and patient capital for cross-cycle and counter-cyclical adjustments. Second, improve the tiered and categorized management mechanism. Specify tiered management requirements for fund establishment, refine differentiated management mechanisms for different types of funds, and standardize budget management for various government investments. Third, strengthen coordination and optimize fund allocation. Achieve synergy between national-level and local-level funds, with provincial governments enhancing the overall management of funds within their regions. Fourth, improve the level of professional and market-oriented fund operations. Standardize fund operation management, optimize fund investment methods, and fully utilize the role of fund managers. Enhance fund performance management, establish and improve an error-tolerance mechanism, and optimize a full-chain and life-cycle assessment system that avoids relying on a single project or a single year's profit and loss as the basis for assessment, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure. Optimize the fund development environment, emphasize positive incentive policies, and boost market investment confidence. Fifth, optimize the exit mechanism to promote a virtuous investment cycle. Broaden fund exit channels, encourage the development of private equity secondary market funds, mergers and acquisitions funds, etc., improve the multi-level capital market system, and explore ways to simplify the project exit process. Sixth, strengthen internal control construction to prevent and resolve risks. Improve the risk prevention and control system and enforce financial discipline. Seventh, strengthen organizational guarantees. Adhere to and strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen departmental coordination, and standardize regulatory behavior. ，。、，，，。、。。，，。，。，。。，，。，，、，，、。，，。，。，、，，。，。，。。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is an article about the NDRC issuing a guideline building a unified national market. The report covers the NDRC's press conference on the guideline. Some data from Xinhua English: -Key measures outlined in the guideline include unifying the underlying institutions and rules of the market, improving the high-standard market infrastructure connectivity, building a unified market for factors and resources, advancing the high-standard integration of goods and services markets, enhancing fair and unified regulation, and curbing unfair market competition and improper intervention.- It adds: -Liu Rihong, an official from the Research Office of the State Council, noted that the relatively weak domestic demand, especially in consumption, is a vital bottleneck for economic circulation. Liu emphasized that building a unified national market is essential to unleashing domestic demand potential, facilitating the efficient flow of goods and factors, improving resource allocation, and fully harnessing the market's industrial and demand advantages. The guideline aims to tackle these challenges by drawing firm -red lines- to eliminate local protectionism, regional barriers, and unfair practices in market access, bidding and government procurement, NDRC official Wang Shancheng told a press conference on Tuesday. Local authorities are prohibited from using administrative or penal measures to intervene in economic disputes or infringe on business rights illegally, the guideline said, adding that unlawful cross-jurisdictional law enforcement or administration are also banned. It stated that the cross-regional flow of goods and factors must not be restricted, and bidding and government procurement should avoid limiting or designating specific patents, trademarks, brands, parts, origins or suppliers. The document also calls for establishing a unified national social security public service platform, allowing people to access social security in the locality where they work even if they do not hold local residency. Wang said work is underway to revise and publish a new negative list for market access to further optimize market access management.- The PD report says that Wang also told reporters that the Guidelines put forward specific requirements and goals from three perspectives: required to do, prohibited from doing and encouraged to do. Under required to do, Wang placed the following: Breaking bottlenecks in regional transportation infrastructure, including highways and waterways Unification of data collection standards, formats and fields between different regulatory departments so as to address the problem of inconsistent regulatory standards in various regions Addressing inconsistencies in government service standards Under prohibited from doing, Wang talked about the -red lines- that I have mentioned above. In the context of encouraged actions, Wang said: -Different regions have different resource endowments. Regions with good basic conditions and high marketization can benchmark higher standards to accelerate the construction of unified markets in their regions and across regions… Wang said that the guidelines ‘encourage qualified regions to carry out regional market integration, promoting the strengthening of communication and coordination of systems, rules and major policies in key areas, and increasing the exploration of cost sharing and benefit sharing in regional cooperation'.- -，、。-，《》-，，-. For future work, Wang said: We will revise and issue the Negative List for Market Access (2025 Edition), further reduce the items on the list, and optimise market access management. We will improve the management system for business entity registration and improve the efficiency of enterprise relocation services. We will build a unified urban and rural construction land market, improve the basic system to promote the standardised development of the capital market, accelerate the formation of a unified and interconnected national technology trading network, cultivate a national integrated data market, and accelerate the construction of a unified national power market system. We will further promote the mutual recognition of medical examination and inspection results, returns and exchanges in different places and stores, withdrawals from housing provident funds in different places, and settlements of medical insurance accounts in different places. We will continuously improve the high-standard connectivity of market facilities. This entails improving the comprehensive three-dimensional transportation network. Going forward. new Implementation Measures for the Fair Competition Review Regulations shall be issued to further refine the review standards, consolidate the review responsibilities, and maintain a unified fair competition system. Clean up and abolish various regulations and practices that hinder the national unified market and fair competition. Break down market access barriers that business entities strongly reflect on and that the masses closely follow. Advance special rectification in areas such as bidding and tendering, enterprise relocation. Improve the long-term mechanism for transferring, investigating and rectifying clues to problems that violate the unified large market, and report typical cases in due time. The Ministry of Commerce will focus on improving foreign investment market access, optimising the business environment, connecting with international high-standard economic and trade rules, and accelerating the integration of domestic and foreign trade. ，。。《（2025）》，，。，。，。，，、，，。、、、。，。-、、、、。，，。-。----，。，，。-2024，《》，，7299。-，《》，，，。。、。、。，。、。，--、--、、，-，。- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: A couple of reports to note.

Xi's Anti-Corruption Warning at CCDI Plenary - Qu Qingshan on Zunyi Conference Anniversary & the Importance of Xi as Core - National Data Infrastructu...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, January 7, 2025. The lead story covers Xi Jinping's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI of the CPC on Monday. Xi -emphasized that since the new era, the intensity of advancing comprehensive and strict Party governance and the fight against corruption has been unprecedented, with results being obvious to all. It is necessary to always maintain tenacious perseverance that the fight against corruption is always ongoing, maintain strategic determination and sustain a high-pressure stance, move forward without pausing for a single step or retreating even half a step. Efforts must be made to integrate the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, resolutely winning this tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption.- ，，，。，，、，、、，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that in 2024, the Central Committee of the Party adhered to leading the social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, consistently advancing the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and achieving new progress and results. The entire Party has gained a clearer understanding and stronger determination regarding the major issue of self-revolution. Solid efforts have been made in carrying out the Party discipline education campaign, with all Party members' awareness of abiding by rules and discipline having been significantly enhanced; the fight against corruption has been intensified, eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption; deeply carried out concentrated rectification of unhealthy trends and corruption problems around the masses, addressing a large batch of prominent problems strongly reflected by the masses; the governance of the Party through systems and regulations has been further advanced, improving the Party's ability to lead the fight against corruption and promote comprehensive and strict governance. ，2024，，，。、；，；，；，；、，、. Xi Jinping emphasized that corruption is the greatest threat facing our Party, and the anti-corruption campaign is the most thorough form of self-revolution. In the new era, facing prominent problems in Party conduct, clean governance construction and anti-corruption struggle within the Party, we have adhered to the principles of resolutely opposing corruption wherever it exists and punishing corruption wherever it arises, continuously purifying the cadre ranks, safeguarding the Party's image, consolidating the red country, securing the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change color, or change flavor, and winning the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. ，，。，，、，，，，、、，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains grim and complex. The existing corruption has not yet been eliminated, new cases continue to occur, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption remains arduous and heavy. Understanding the fight against corruption requires adopting a historical perspective and a strategic vision, focusing on achieving the Party's mission and tasks. The fight against corruption must remain unswerving; any hesitation and wavering, laxity and softness, or abandoning midway would constitute subversive mistakes. It is necessary to resolutely clarify various misconceptions, dispel ideological confusion, and further strengthen the determination and confidence in the fight against corruption. ，。，，。，、，。，、，。，，. He then called for maintaining the -spirit of reform and strict standards- for Party governance in the new era, and -ensure the implementation of the arrangements of the 20th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, ensure that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and promote the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to promote the specificity, precision and normalization of political supervision. Maintaining a high degree of alignment/consistency with the Party Central Committee must be reflected in both words and actions. In terms of ideology, it is necessary to unremittingly strengthen the Party's innovative theoretical armament, accurately grasp the Party Central Committee's goals, positioning and deployment requirements for reform and development in this region, department and domain, ensuring unity in thought and consistency in direction. Politically, it is necessary to adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strictly enforce political discipline and political rules, and absolutely forbid engaging in the ‘seven types of conduct' to ensure consistency between words and actions, with orders being followed and prohibitions strictly observed. In terms of actions, it is necessary to adhere to making the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee the focus of political supervision, and work together to drive reform breakthroughs and promote high-quality development. ，、、。。，，，、。，，，--，、。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that strengthening the Party's discipline construction is a regular task and that it is necessary to guide Party members and cadres to transform external discipline into self-discipline, internalising it as daily and unconscious standards of behavior. A regularised and long-term discipline education mechanism should be established, ensuring that discipline education runs through the entire growth cycle of cadres and is integrated into the whole process of organizational management. Strictly enforce the Party's discipline, accurately apply the ‘four forms', adhere to seeking truth from facts, neither being unjust or indulgent, identify and address problems early when they are nascent, prevent minor issues from growing, and unify strict management and supervision with encouragement of responsibility, enabling cadres to innovate reforms and pursue achievements while complying with regulations and discipline. ，，、，。，、。，--，、，、，，、。 Xi Jinping pointed out that we must deeply promote the simultaneous investigation and treatment of both formalism and corruption. Always adhere to zero tolerance, treat the eight-point central regulations as iron rules and hard limits, seriously investigate and punish the ‘four winds' problems that defy discipline and undergo hidden mutations, supervise Party members and cadres to resolutely oppose privileged thinking and phenomena, and firmly establish correct views of power, performance, and career. Always maintain high-pressure posture against corruption, focus on grasping and investigating key problems, key areas, and key targets, deepen the simultaneous investigation of both taking and giving bribes, and resolutely eliminate systemic corruption risks and hidden dangers. Enhance the effectiveness of using cases to promote reform and governance, promote the improvement of the constraints and supervision mechanisms for the allocation and operation of power, and enrich effective methods for preventing and controlling new types of corruption and hidden corruption. Adhere to the integration of rectifying conduct, enforcing discipline, and fighting corruption, use ‘joint investigation' to severely punish intertwined problems of unhealthy work styles and corruption, use ‘joint treatment' to eliminate common roots of unhealthy work styles and corruption.- ，。，、，、--，、，、、。，、、、，，。，，。，--，--. Xi Jinping emphasized it is necessary to strengthen the primary responsibility and supervisory responsibility for comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline. The Party committee must take the initiative to grasp and manage, the discipline inspection commission must carry out its specialized supervisory duties well, focus on its main responsibilities, and perform its primary tasks. All responsible entities must know their responsibilities, take responsibility, and fulfill their duties. It is necessary to optimize the responsibility implementation and evaluation mechanisms, and precisely and scientifically hold accountable those who fail in their duties and responsibilities. ，。、，，、，、、。，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to continue to promote the extension of comprehensive and strict Party governance to the grassroots level. Party committees at all levels, especially municipal and county Party committees, should take the rectification of unhealthy practices and corruption around the masses as an important and routine task, making it tangible and perceptible to the people. We must deepen the reform of the grassroots supervision system and mechanism, combine discipline inspection and supervision with grassroots inspections, and coordinate supervision from all aspects. Implement a long-term mechanism to reduce the burden on the grassroots by rectifying formalism, allowing grassroots cadres to have more energy to focus on implementation. ，。，。，、。，. Xi Jinping emphasized that the disciplinary inspection and supervision organs are an important force in advancing the Party's self-revolution, and that the Party and the people have full trust and high expectations for this team. We must deepen the reform of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system, adhere to combining authorization and control of power, and put power in the cage of institutional regulations. We must focus on strengthening the standardization, legalization and regularization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and continuously improve the ability to rectify conduct, ensure discipline and fight corruption. We must consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education campaign and education rectification, adhere to ‘those who forge iron must themselves be strong', strengthen strict management and supervision, build an iron army of disciplinary inspection and supervision that is loyal, clean, responsible, and dares to struggle and is good at struggle. ，，、。，，。，。，，，、. In his remarks, Li Xi said that Xi's speech -with a lofty historical perspective, deeply grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle, deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption, and made strategic arrangements for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party.- The speech was -far-sighted, profound, confronted problems directly, and was striking in clarity/would arouse even the apathetic-. -It has provided important guidance for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party and the fight against corruption.- He added: It is necessary to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, strengthen confidence, dare to struggle, conscientiously perform the political responsibility of comprehensive and strictly Party governance, and promote the integration of the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, and unswervingly advance the anti-corruption struggle in depth. ，，，，，、、，。、、、，。，--，--、--、--，、，，、、，.

Xinhua's report on Zhao's meeting with him says: -Noting that deepening China-Peru friendly cooperation is the common expectation of the two peoples, Zhao said that the legislative bodies of the two countries should contribute to promoting the steady and long-term development of bilateral relations. The NPC of China is willing to work with the Congress of Peru to strengthen exchanges between high-level officials, special committees, bilateral friendship groups and more, deepen mutual learning on governance experience, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and support each other in pursuing development paths suited to their respective national conditions, he said. Chancay port in Peru, a landmark China-Peru cooperation project, will help promote the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road between China and Peru as well as China and Latin America, Zhao said, adding that it is hoped that the Congress of Peru will continue to support the construction of the port. ‘China and Peru have carried out fruitful cooperation in fields such as energy, mining, infrastructure construction and communications, and are actively exploring ways to expand cooperation on digital economy, green development and artificial intelligence. It is hoped that the legislatures of the two countries will jointly create a sound legal environment for China-Peru practical cooperation,' Zhao said.- The report on Wang's meeting with him says: Wang -said China is willing to make joint efforts with Peru to push for more achievements in China-Peru relations and bring more benefits to the two peoples, and the CPPCC is ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Peru to make contributions to promoting the joint advance of the two countries on the road of national modernization.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the new guidelines for the construction of national data infrastructure.

Xinhua reports: -Indonesia, as a major developing country and an important force in the Global South, highly recognizes the BRICS spirit and has taken an active part in ‘BRICS Plus' cooperation. The spokesperson said Indonesia's official entry into BRICS serves the common interests of BRICS countries and the Global South, adding that ‘we believe that Indonesia will make active contribution to the development of BRICS.' The spokesperson said BRICS is a main platform for promoting solidarity and cooperation of the Global South and a major force driving the reform of the global governance system, and BRICS countries are always committed to multilateralism, fairness and justice, and common development.

China stands ready to work with Indonesia and other BRICS members to jointly build a more comprehensive, close, practical and inclusive partnership, advance the high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make greater contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind, the spokesperson added.- Second, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba on Monday. Xinhua reports: -Despite the geographical distance, the bond between China and Africa has remained strong, Wang said. The China-Africa relationship has withstood the test of changing global circumstances and is showing new promising prospects, he said, stressing that China remains a trustworthy partner for Africa, consistently prioritizing Africa in its overall diplomatic strategy. For 35 years, Chinese foreign ministers have made Africa the destination of their first overseas visit of each year, a tradition that reflects China's unwavering commitment, Wang said, adding that this tradition will continue because strengthening China-Africa cooperation is more crucial than ever for the world, and their joint development symbolizes the rise of the Global South and the growing influence of justice. Namibia, an important member of the African family, is also a comprehensive strategic cooperation partner of China, he noted. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed 10 partnership action plans to jointly advance modernization and announced that the overall characterization of China-Africa relations was elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. This has charted the course for the future development of China-Africa relations, Wang said, noting that China is ready to work with Namibia to implement the 10 partnership action plans, helping Namibia accelerate its modernization process. Acknowledging Namibia's unique resources and vast development potential, Wang said that the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Party of Namibia has adopted a people-centered governance philosophy and guided the country along a development path suited to its national conditions. China is willing to strengthen exchanges on governance with Namibia and deepen cooperation in various fields to achieve common development, Wang said.- Apart from reportedly supporting the -one-China principle-, Mbumba also said that -Namibia supports the three global initiatives proposed by Xi, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and looks forward to continued mutual support and collaboration with China in international and regional affairs to safeguard shared interests.- Wang also met with President-elect Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah.

Page 10: It's no coincidence that Qu Qingshan's piece commemorating the 90th anniversary of the Zunyi Conference is published today as the CCDI plenary continues in Beijing. Qu reminds us that the conference was a -vital turning point ()- in the Party's history and process. Qu writes that the CCP's history during the New Democratic Revolution period lasted for 28 years. This period can be divided into two halves of 14 years each, with the Zunyi Conference lying in the middle. In the first 14 years, our Party made one right-leaning mistake and three ‘left-leaning' mistakes, leading to two major setbacks in the Chinese revolution: one being the failure of the Great Revolution and the other being the failure of the fifth counter-'encirclement and suppression' campaign in the Central Revolutionary Base, forcing the Red Army to undertake a strategic retreat. In the latter 14 years, starting from the Zunyi Conference, our Party rose again, united and led the people to overcome one difficulty after another and triumph over one challenge after another. First, it achieved victory in the Long March, survived the most difficult period, and pioneered a new phase of the Chinese revolution. Subsequently, it successively achieved victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, overthrew the ‘three mountains' of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic-capitalism, and finally established the People's Republic of China, achieving national independence and people's liberation, inaugurating a new era in Chinese historical development. 28，28，1414。14，、--，，，--，；14，，，、，，，，、，、、，，、，.

Regarding this, the ‘Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century' adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party made a profound summary: The Zunyi Conference ensured that -Comrade Mao Zedong was confirmed as the de facto leader of the Central Committee and the Red Army. The meeting laid the groundwork for establishing the leading position within the Central Committee of the correct Marxist line chiefly represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as for the formation of the first generation of the central collective leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. The meeting opened a new stage in which the Party would act on its own initiative to address practical problems concerning the Chinese revolution, and saved the Party, the Red Army, and the Chinese revolution at a moment of greatest peril.- ，？？，《》，：-，，，-. And then he writes this: -The history of the Party shows that the issue of having a core is of paramount importance. The core is the banner, the core is the direction, and the core is the strength. Marxism tells us that the core arises from practice, the core represents the people, the core guides the way forward, and the core is the choice of history and the people.- ，，，，。，，，，. -The development of history has its inherent logic and essential laws. The materialist conception of history holds that the masses create history. Great figures embody the will of the people and are faithful representatives of the fundamental interests of the masses. Great figures do not appear out of thin air, but are produced in practice and are the product of history and the times. It is no accident that Comrade Mao Zedong became the core of the first generation of the central leadership of our Party. During the Great Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted a profound analysis of the structure of Chinese society and the class situation and engaged in deep thought on issues such as the nature, targets, tasks, and driving forces of the Chinese revolution. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he thoroughly summarized the experiences and lessons of the revolutionary struggle, proposing the idea that ‘political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'; organized and launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the border regions of Hunan and Jiangxi and led the uprising forces to Jinggangshan, where he directed the establishment of China's first rural revolutionary base. This laid the foundation for the correct revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. He emphasized that the ‘textbooks' of Marxism must be studied, but must be combined with China's actual conditions. He proposed, ‘what is the true iron bastion? It is the masses, it is the millions of masses who sincerely support the revolution.' Comrade Mao Zedong's profound analytical power of China's revolutionary situation, deep insight into historical development trends, and scientific judgment of the direction of the era's progress have been tested by practice and verified by history. 。，。，。，，。，。，，、、。，，--，，，，、。，-‘'，。-，-？，。-、、，. And then Qu writes: -The materialist view of history also holds that every person has a certain role in the development of history, but the nature and magnitude of their role differ. Great figures usually stand higher and see farther than ordinary people, are able to concentrate collective wisdom, listen to the voice of the people, conform to the trends of the times, grasp the laws of history, propose and solve major historical tasks, and guide the direction of historical progress. Therefore, their role is unique and special, and they can play an accelerating and promoting role in the development of history.- ，，、。、，，，，，，，、，. The examples he gives for this are the success of Mao's strategies through the first to third anti-encirclement and suppression campaigns in the Central Revolutionary Base Area. He argues that Zhou Enlai and Zhu De sustained Mao's tactics during the fourth campaign too, and achieved victory. But Li De or Otto Braun and others deviated from these during the fifth campaign and thus suffered defeat. Consequently, -due to the erroneous leadership of ‘left' dogmatism- several revolutionary bases were lost. The lessons from the failure of the fifth counter-encirclement and suppression campaign were painfully profound! At the critical juncture and key moment of historical transition, the Party chose Mao Zedong, the Red Army chose Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution chose Mao Zedong, and history and the people chose Mao Zedong. This chapter of history concerning the Party and the Red Army must not be forgotten but should be remembered forever! --！，，，，。，，! He then talks about 2012, with the 18th Party Congress being historic, and marking a new historical orientation for the Party. In other words, -after long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era.- -Since the beginning of the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with a great spirit of historical initiative, immense political courage, and a strong sense of responsibility, coordinated the domestic and international situations, implemented the Party's basic theories, line, and strategies, and taken charge of the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, adhered to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, issued a series of major policies, launched a series of major initiatives, advanced a series of major works, overcome a series of major risks and challenges, solved many tough problems that were long on the agenda but never resolved and accomplished many things that were wanted but never got done, and promoted historic achievements and historic shifts in the cause of the Party and the country.- 2012。，。。：，。，，、、，，、、，、、、，，，，，，，，、. -In the practice of governing the country, General Secretary Xi Jinping, with the magnificent spirit, foresight, and grand strategy of a Marxist statesman, thinker, and strategist, has calmly handled various complex situations, effectively responded to various domestic and foreign risks and challenges, fully demonstrated outstanding political wisdom, strong strategic determination, intense mission responsibility, deep feelings for the people, and superior leadership skills, winning the heartfelt support of the entire Party, military, and people of all ethnic groups, receiving high praise from the international community, becoming the widely supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people's leader, and commander-in-chief of the military.- ，、、、、，，，、、、、，，，、、、. He then quotes the third history resolution again, saying: -The Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and defined the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This reflects the common will of the Party, the armed forces, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and is of decisive significance for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and for driving forward the historic process of national rejuvenation.- He also doubles down on the Two Establishments as the -greatest certainty, confidence and guarantee for the Party and the people to deal with all uncertainties.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xinhua Commentary on Biden Blocking Nippon Steel Deal - Sun Zhuangzhi on 'Window of Opportunity' for Ukraine Deal - Shen Yi: BRICS Expansion Allows Gl...	The People's Daily today was rather uninteresting. The front page had a feature previewing the CCDI plenary session, which begins today. I am going to wait for reporting from the session to get something substantive to cover. In the meantime, I thought I'd highlight three interesting pieces that I read in Chinese media today. First, there's a Xinhua commentary on the Biden administration's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel. It argues that the move is another example of the US -putting political considerations above economic logic and generalising the concept of ‘national security' to practice protectionism.- ，、--. The commentary says: -Tetsuo Kotani, a professor at Meikai University in Japan, argues that the US government's claim of security risks is merely a pretext. Hidetoshi Tashiro, chief economist at Infinity LLC., says that the essence of this acquisition is an ‘economic action' by Nippon Steel aimed at maximizing profits, while the US obstruction is entirely driven by ‘political considerations'. ‘From a historical perspective, this is yet another instance of the US implementing trade protectionist measures to suppress Japan'. In recent years, the US has been obsessed with wielding the ‘tariff stick', continuously escalating unilateral sanctions, pursuing a ‘small yard, high fence' approach and ‘decoupling and breaking chains'. From the slogan of ‘America First' to the signing and implementation of the ‘Inflation Reduction Act' and ‘CHIPS and Science Act', to the unlimited expansion of the concept of ‘national security' ... the US has infused protectionism into an increasing number of industries.- ，。，--，--。-，。-，--，，----。--《》《》，--……. -Any enterprise or country that threatens America's hegemonic position can become a target of the US hunt, and even allies are not immune. The US signed the Plaza Accord with Japan using coercion. This dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economic vitality and led Japan to experience the ‘lost 30 years'; it adopted ‘long-arm jurisdiction' and other means to ‘dismember' the French manufacturing firm Alstom, which eventually led to its main power business being acquired by its American competitor General Electric; it imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products from the European Union and other countries and regions; it restricted the free trade of ASML, a Dutch lithography giant, and included more foreign companies in the export control ‘Entity List' ... such unilateral and protectionist measures disrupt the normal operation of global industrial and supply chains, seriously infringe upon enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, destroy the fairness and stability of international economic and trade cooperation, and show none of the free market spirit of openness, inclusiveness, and cooperation that the US preaches to other countries.- ，，。--，，--；----，；；，--……，，，，、、. The commentary adds that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the WTO. It says that the US -has become the biggest ‘violator' of WTO rules, with -two-thirds of the WTO's violations caused by the US.- -As a consequence, the US has simply refused to implement the WTO's rulings, paralysing the WTO's Appellate Body. The US approach to international law and international rules is ‘use if it suits, abandon if it doesn't suit', ‘liberalism when prospering and protectionism when facing adversity'; the essence is to seek its own selfish interests. 。、，--：。，，--。-、--，-，. The commentary then says that US Steel's failings are due to -over-protectionism-. It adds: -The decline of the US steel industry from prosperity is deeply connected to the US economy's development path of ‘moving away from the real towards the virtual', while the long-term trade protection policies implemented to cope with overseas competition have led to persistently high domestic steel prices in the US, no improvement in steel mills' profitability, and caused downstream industries like automobiles and construction to pay a heavy price in global competition. Bloomberg reported last year that in the past decade, US protectionist measures related to the steel industry have not prevented the loss of manufacturing jobs, and have rather increased costs in other areas of the US economy, reducing industry competitiveness.- ，。10，，，？，。--，，，，、。，，，，. (Note: The emphasis on real to virtual is as much a comment about the US economy as it is a message domestically. One of the primary concerns articulated by Xi Jinping has been about the flow of capital in China to what he calls the virtual and speculative economy.) Towards the end, the article quotes from Nippon Steel and US Steel's joint statement, saying that the Biden administration's decision -sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.- Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Second, Sun Zhuangzhi, Director of the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, discussed the prospect of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Sun argued there may be a -window of opportunity- to achieve a ceasefire or end the conflict in 2025. He believes -that the goals of both sides have changed. In the past, the goal was to win at all costs, but now it is about not losing, and both sides feel enormous pressure.- Sun argues that the reasons for the change in goals are: First, the immense consumption on the battlefield, with human and material resources being stretched to their limits. For Russia, it is difficult to maintain this wartime economy for an extended period of time. For Ukraine, the continuous large fiscal deficits and the need for more Western aid are pressing issues. If US aid were to stop, it would be a huge problem for Ukraine. Second, there is tremendous political pressure. Both sides realise that fully defeating the other is difficult, but neither can afford to retreat. For the leaders of both countries, compromise would mean total failure, so there is no room for concession. Third, there are huge escalation costs. Both sides understand that escalating the conflict would mean paying an even higher price. So on the one hand, both sides are continuing to test each other's bottom line, and on the other, they have reservations. 3，，，，，。，，，、。，。，，。，。。，。，，。。，。，. Sun adds that for both sides things are already rather bad and it shouldn't get any worse than this. From this perspective, there may be a ‘window of opportunity' to resolve the conflict or achieve a ceasefire; both sides realize that it is actually very difficult to ultimately defeat the other side. ，，，。，--，. -Sun believes that this year, there is a possibility of high-level talks between Russia and the US. Trump will actively strive for this, and Putin has also said he is ready and can meet with Trump anytime, as long as the conditions are appropriate. In addition to Russia-US talks, Russia-EU dialogue is also possible, and Ukraine might even be invited to participate. However, he also pointed out that dialogue does not equate to peace talks. It is difficult for Russia and Ukraine to negotiate face to face and come up with a solution to the conflict. Currently, both sides claim they are open to talks, but the conditions they propose are far apart.- ，。，，，，。，，。，。，。，.

In the first episode, I speak to former Indian National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon about the churn in the world order. You can also access the podcast via my Substack, on Apple Podcasts via Substack or Spotify below. Third, in an article dated January 1, 2025, in the Global Times, Director of the Centre for BRICS Studies at Fudan University, Shen Yi, discussed the evolution of the BRICS with new partners joining. He writes that on January 1, 2025, nine countries, including Belarus, Bolivia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Cuba, Uganda, Malaysia and Uzbekistan, officially became BRICS partner countries. Shen adds: This is -another successful strategic practice of the ‘BRICS+' mechanism proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS Xiamen Summit in 2017. Nine countries from the Global South becoming BRICS partner countries not only reflects the trend of the global economic centre of gravity shifting towards the Global South but also provides an important perspective for understanding the deep driving forces of restructuring of power in the international system.- ...2017-+-。9--，--，. -The concept of BRICS cooperation partners transcends the traditional economic cooperation framework. As representatives of emerging economies and developing countries, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has carried the call for establishing a more equitable international order since its inception, and countries joining this mechanism are regarded as important partners sharing this vision. Partnership not only implies collaboration in economic and financial fields but also includes joint efforts in global governance reform, technological innovation, and social development. The addition of new members enhances BRICS' geopolitical and economic representation, injecting new momentum into the formation of a multipolar world.- 。，，。，、。，，. -The backdrop of BRICS' expansion is the pursuit and desire of the ‘Global South' for a more fair and reasonable international order in the new era. In the past decades, after the end of the Cold War, although the first round of globalisation led by Western countries, stressing on the so-called ‘common values' and ‘rules', did promote economic development, it also made all parties generally realise the intensification of global inequality, as well as Western countries' increasingly apparent lack of sustainable and effective leadership capability. There is a large amount of evidence proving that the international economic system dominated by Western countries is structurally unfair to the Global South countries, including but not limited to insufficient representation of developing countries in decision-making in organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which objectively puts Global South countries at a long-term disadvantage.- ，--。，，、----，，。，--，（IMF），--. At the same time, the world is increasingly feeling the negative impacts and shocks that can come from the abuse of hegemony by dominant Western countries, especially the structural hegemonic power with dollar hegemony at the core. In sharp contrast, the achievements made by the BRICS countries in their own development and collaborative development, their adherence to and promotion of the multi-polarization of the international system, and the development needs and preferences for participating in international mechanisms faced by Global South countries including BRICS countries. As a result, joining the BRICS mechanism in a flexible and adaptable manner has naturally become a widely recognised and increasingly accepted pragmatic model for global cooperation. ，，。，，，--，。，，、、. -From a practical perspective, against the backdrop of continuously rising traditional geopolitical risks, becoming a BRICS partner country provides Global South countries with a more inclusive, flexible and resilient set of diversified choices. Joining the ‘Greater BRICS' as partner countries not only provides opportunities for economic cooperation, but also creates conditions for developing countries to voice opinions and participate in global governance reform. Through the BRICS platform, the Global South' can break free from the so-called pressure to ‘choose sides' within the traditional geopolitical framework and pursue greater autonomy in a multipolar world.- ，，--、。--，，。，----，. -At the level of development philosophy and pathways, BRICS emphasizes inclusive development, which aligns closely with the development aspirations of many Global South countries. It is reasonable to believe that the inclusion of new members will help BRICS' pragmatic cooperation continuously improve global representation, garnering more support and recognition. At the same time, the addition of new members has infused vitality and diversity into the BRICS cooperation mechanism. This expansion has enhanced BRICS' global influence, significantly strengthening its voice in international affairs. The BRICS mechanism is no longer confined to traditional economic cooperation but is gradually expanding into areas such as international security, technological innovation, and cultural exchange. The nine new partner countries, with their wide geographic distribution and diverse historical and cultural backgrounds, on the one hand, help enhance the global representation of BRICS; on the other hand, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has not adopted Western-style ideological confrontations or bloc divisions. Its advocacy for a multilateral cooperation model avoids zero-sum games between major powers, offering a more inclusive paradigm for international relations. This openness and flexibility encourage more countries to join the BRICS family, collectively advancing reforms in global governance.- ，，--。，，，。，。，。，、。9，，；，。，。，。 Shen then adds: The impact of the BRICS expansion on the international system can be analysed from three aspects. First, it has injected new impetus into international multilateral cooperation. Against the backdrop of an increasingly dysfunctional multilateral system dominated by the West, the BRICS mechanism provides an alternative to bridge the global governance deficit. By promoting multipolar development, the BRICS countries have provided certain possibilities for reshaping the international order. Second, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has initiated internal discussions on healthier operational models and mechanisms for the global financial system beyond the US dollar system. The addition of new members not only enhances the stability of the BRICS currency basket but also supports the advancement of related initiatives. Although this process remains in its early stages, its potential systemic impact cannot be ignored. Finally, the expansion of the BRICS has enhanced the representativeness and fairness of global governance. As a collective action of developing countries and emerging economies, the BRICS mechanism has broken the monopoly of Western countries in rule-making in traditional international institutions and brought a more balanced perspective to global governance. The expansion of the BRICS countries marks the deepening of cooperation among the ‘Global South' countries and the acceleration of the global multi-polarisation process. In the face of various challenges in the current international system, the BRICS mechanism provides a potential cooperation platform. By promoting inclusive development, advocating multilateralism and reforming the global governance system, the BRICS countries and their partners have made important contributions to shaping a more equitable international order. Although this process is constrained by many complex factors, its prospects undoubtedly bring hope for building a multipolar world. 。，。，。，。，，。，。，。，。，，。--。，。、，。，.

US Companies on Export Control & Unreliable Entities Lists - New Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future - 58 Tigers Taken Down in 2024 - ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, January 3, 2025. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan sending a New Year card in return to representatives of middle school teachers and students in the US State of Washington. Xinhua reports: -In the card, Xi and Peng said the year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. During the Second World War, China and the United States fought together for peace and justice, and the friendship between the two peoples stood the test of blood and fire and is growing ever stronger, they said. The couple expressed their hope that the youth of China and the United States will continue to participate in China's initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study programs in a five-year span, strengthen exchanges and interactions, enhance mutual understanding, carry forward traditional friendship, and contribute to the development of China-U.S. relations and world peace.- China's Ministry of Commerce didn't get that friendship memo. Although it is not in the paper today, in a first-ever development, Beijing on Thursday put 28 American companies on its export control list. This was done in order to -safeguard national security and interests and fulfil international obligations, including non-proliferation commitments.- As a consequence, -it is prohibited to export dual-use items to the 28 US entities; related export activities currently underway should be stopped immediately. Also, -in exceptional cases where export is deemed necessary, the exporter must apply for approval.- The 28 entities are: 1. General Dynamics 2. L3 L3 Harris Technologies） 3.

In addition, the Ministry placed 10 American companies on its unreliable entities list for selling arms to Taiwan. Xinhua reports that these companies: Will be prohibited from engaging in China-related import or export activities Will be barred from making new investments in China Senior executives of these companies will be banned from entering China The work permits and visitor or residency status of senior executives of these companies will be revoked, and any related applications they submit will not be approved. The report adds: -The MOC stated that these companies have engaged in arms sales to the Taiwan region and conducted so-called cooperation on military technologies in recent years, despite China's strong opposition. Their actions severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, severely violated the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and severely undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, the ministry said, adding that the companies will be legally held accountable. Noting that China's unreliable entity provisions only target a few foreign entities that undermine China's national security, the ministry said the Chinese government will always welcome foreign companies to invest and expand their businesses in China, and is committed to providing a stable, fair and predictable business environment for law-abiding companies operating in China.- The 10 companies that have been added to the list are: Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Lockheed Martin Missile Systems Integration Laboratory Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories Lockheed Martin Ventures Javelin Joint Venture Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems General Dynamics Information Technology General Dynamics Mission Systems Share Tracking People's Daily Back to news about Xi. The Chinese president exchanged messages of congratulations with Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on the 45th anniversary of bilateral ties. Xinhua reports: Xi said that -In recent years, the political mutual trust between the two sides has been strengthened, practical cooperation in various fields has delivered fruitful results, and the China-Ecuador friendship has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people…Notably the China-Ecuador Free Trade Agreement, which has been successfully signed and entered into force, has given a strong boost to upgrading economic and trade cooperation and injected fresh impetus into the development of bilateral relations, the Chinese president said. ‘I attach great importance to the growth of China-Ecuador relations and stand ready to work with President Noboa to take the 45th anniversary as a new starting point to renew the traditional China-Ecuador friendship and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields so as to lift China-Ecuador relations to a higher level,' Xi said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's visit to Jinan in Shandong Province. Li said that -entering the new year, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference, with a sense of responsibility and urgency that time waits for no one, seize every moment, promote early implementation of policies, quick advancement of projects, ensure tangible outcomes of measures, and strive to achieve a good start to this year's economic development.- ，，，，、，、、，. Xinhua English summarises the rest well. Visiting a home appliance store, Li said that -the government's consumer goods trade-in scheme is of great significance to meet the needs of people for high-quality life, unlock consumption potential, promote industry upgrades and facilitate economic circulation. China will continue to implement this initiative with greater support, Li said, adding that procedures will be optimized to facilitate consumer spending.- He also visited a charging and battery-swapping station. Li -encouraged exploratory and innovative efforts in developing charging and battery-swapping services and related areas. Measures should be taken to deepen reform of the energy management system, transform the energy sector and foster new drivers of growth,- he added. Li then visited a sports stadium and a water management project. He said that -stadiums and modern water networks are not only significant infrastructure projects, but also important for public welfare, and called for efforts to strengthen supply of resources such as funds and land. Concerning urban renewal, it is important to stress the planning and layout of drainage networks and maintain strict oversight throughout the entire construction process to ensure that the project quality is able to stand the test of time, Li added. Efforts should be made to attract more private investment to participate in the construction of infrastructure and public services, he said.- Finally, there's a long, long article reviewing the development of work related to propaganda, ideology and culture in 2024. I am not detailing this. But the most significant development of course was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Culture in particular, which was formally established in October 2023. Patriotism is also a key trait that is highlighted in the article. Subscribe now Page 2: Wang Yi spoke at the opening ceremony of the new Research Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind in Beijing. This has been established by the China Foreign Affairs University. Wang said: -Building a community with a shared future for mankind is a significant original concept proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It is the core idea of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and represents China's answer to the era's question of ‘What kind of world to build and how to build it?' It holds valuable theoretical significance, major contemporary relevance, and profound global influence.- ，，，，-、-，、. -Wang Yi said that the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind highlights the original mission of the CPC. General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that the CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and strives for the cause of human progress. Building a community with a shared future for mankind reflects our Party's innate internationalist sentiment, organically combines the fundamental interests of the Chinese people with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, and closely links the future and destiny of China with the future and destiny of the world; transcends the differences in social systems and ideologies, and transcends the differences in history, culture, and development stages, and establishes a banner and direction for China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on the new journey.- ，。，，。，，，、，、，、. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind promotes the fine traditions of Chinese culture. This major initiative is a vivid practice of the ‘two integrations' and an innovative achievement of the sinicization of Marxism. It embodies the Chinese nation's worldview of ‘Great Unity' , the value of ‘harmony is the most precious' , and the perspective of righteousness/morality and interests that ‘puts righteousness first' . It demonstrates the peaceful, inclusive and innovative nature of Chinese civilization. It is the promotion and sublimation of China's excellent traditional culture under new historical conditions. It will surely unleash the timeless appeal and inspiration of Chinese culture, and will surely promote Chinese civilization to make new contributions to the progress of human civilization. 。--，，--、--、--，、，，，. -The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind demonstrates the profound power of scientific theory. Since its proposal in 2013, this concept has evolved into a broad and complete structure, with the construction of ‘five worlds' (these are: building a world of lasting peace, building a world of universal security, building a world of common prosperity, building an open and inclusive world, and building a clean and beautiful world) as its goal, global governance through consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits as its implementation path, the practice of universal human values as its guiding principle, the building of a new type of international relations as its foundational support, the ‘three major global initiatives' as its strategic guidance, and high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road' as its practical platform It enriches and develops Marxist theories of international relations, transcends traditional theories of international relations, and illuminates the path forward for global governance.- 。2013，、，--，，，，--，--，，，. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind clarifies China's proposition amid the once-in-a-century changes that are unfolding. Facing changes of the times and historical questions, building a community of shared future for mankind clearly advocates the spirit of ‘working together for this one and only planet Earth', an open and inclusive mindset, and a vision of win-win cooperation. It proposes transcending conflict and confrontation through peaceful development, replacing absolute security with common security, discarding zero-sum games for mutual benefit and win-win results, preventing clashes between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning, and protecting the homeland of Earth through green development, promoting state-to-state relations from peaceful coexistence toward shared destiny, injecting strong momentum into promoting world peace and development cause.- 。、，--、、，，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report informs of a symposium being held to study and implement a compilation of excerpts from discourses on the natural resources work by Xi Jinping. He Lifeng attended and spoke at this event. Xinhua English summarises the report well: -Xi's important discourses provide a fundamental guidance for natural resources work in the new era, He noted, adding that upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership over natural resources work is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in this regard. He also stressed adhering to the people-centered development philosophy, serving the modernization featuring harmonious coexistence between man and nature, and improving development of China's geographical space while doing the natural resources work. Efforts should also be made to effectively translate learning outcomes into practical work results, he added.- Finally, a report informs that Li Dianxun has been appointed as acting Governor of Hubei.

Although it's not in the paper, there's also this separate Xinhua article discussing the continuation of Xi's anti-corruption campaign. It says that in 2024, the number of cadres under central management ( or so-called ‘tigers') who have been -publicly announced as fallen- by the CCDI reached 58. The last to fall in the year was Zhou Jiabin, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress, and Secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee, on December 28, 2024. The piece reiterates that the fight against corruption -has no endpoint, only a constant process.- It adds that it is necessary to -persevere in purifying the political environment.- -In the past year, the CCDI, the NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels have continuously consolidated and built upon the overwhelming victory in the anti-corruption struggle, promoted the normalization and long-term effectiveness of preventing and combating corruption, and further improved the effectiveness of combating corruption.- ，，，。，，、，. The piece also talks about maintaining -no forbidden areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance- when it comes to corruption. Then we get some data, before there is discussion on new approaches to tackle corruption and the focus on hidden corruption. Following the launch of the rectification campaign in April 2024, a total of 566,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption were investigated and dealt with nationwide. A total of 433,000 people were punished, and 14,000 people were transferred to the procuratorate. From January to November 2024, the ‘Skynet' operation repatriated a total of 1,306 fugitives. These included 120 Party members and state employees and 46 individuals against whom red notices had been issued.

Xinhua informs: -The national average reading in 2024 stood at 10.9 degrees Celsius, 1.01 degrees Celsius above the annual average, breaking the previous record set in 2023, which was 10.71 degrees Celsius. A total of 19 provincial-level regions logged record-high temperatures last year -- including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi. Average precipitation across the country reached 697.7 mm in 2024, 9 percent more than the annual average- Outside of the People's Daily, I found this article by Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute, China Institute of International Studies, making the pitch for a Pan-Asian Railway Network, rather interesting. It points to continued Chinese interest in pursuing railway connectivity projects abroad. Xiang also makes the case that this is not simply about economic efficiency but also a strategic requirement. The article begins by discussing the history of this idea, dating it back to the 1960s. Back then, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) had proposed a plan for constructing a freight railway network spanning the Eurasian continent, known as the Trans-Asian Railway project. Fast forward to April 2010, when representatives from 18 Asian countries signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Trans-Asian Railway Network in Busan, proposing the construction of a Trans-Asian Railway network spanning 81,000 kilometers. 60，、，（ESCAP），。，。，，19999，，。20104，18《》，8.1。，. Apart from making the economic argument for such a network, Xiang writes that for Asian countries -collaborating on the construction and operation of cross-border railways can strengthen economic interests and cultural ties, while fostering mutual understanding and trust, reducing conflicts, and maintaining regional peace and stability.- ，，，，，. He then discusses the challenges, writing that indeed, advancing such a grand project -not only requires gathering the political will and cooperative consensus of various countries, but also overcoming difficult and complex practical problems.- -The planning of the Pan-Asian Railway Network will first have to deal with the complexity and diversity of countries in the region, which have differences in terms of development levels and interests, making coordination costs high and difficulties great in aspects like route planning, construction standards, and operational management. Additionally, railway construction requires enormous investment, has long construction periods, and slow capital recovery. For cross-border railways, different countries will also have disputes surrounding benefit distribution and operational models, affecting cooperation enthusiasm and smooth project implementation. At the same time, engineering and technical problems cannot be ignored. Eurasian countries' railways have multiple track gauges; if cross-border connectivity is only based on the existing different track gauges, it will inevitably significantly constrain transportation efficiency. Whether ‘trains running on the same track gauge' can be achieved is a significant test of the quality of the Pan-Asian Railway Network. And to lay new electrified tracks, Asia's terrain is complex, some railway sections need to traverse mountains, deserts, rivers, tropical rainforests and other challenging sections, construction difficulty is high, engineering technical requirements are high, this will not only increase construction costs, but also involve many thorny environmental and socio-cultural issues. ，，，。，、，、、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，。--，。，，、、、，，，，. But Xiang sounds optimistic, citing China's high-speed rail network development as an example that has -demonstrative and radiative effect, encouraging neighbouring countries to accelerate their railway construction plans.- He adds: -Through BRI's framework for interconnectivity cooperation, China and its neighbours have launched numerous benchmark projects for the Pan-Asian Railway Network. In addition to the operational China-Laos Railway and Jakarta-Bandung HSR, there are over a dozen cross-border railway projects under construction or planning. A groundbreaking development is the China-Europe Railway Express, which, since its launch in 2016, has exceeded 100,000 cumulative trips, connecting 227 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries. ，4.6，，--，--，。，。--，。，。，201610，25227、11100. He adds: -As an ‘infrastructure fanatic' , China's experience and technology can help the Pan-Asian Railway Network ‘dream come true'. The China-Laos Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung HSR have activated the ‘high-speed rail dream' of ASEAN countries. The three lines of the Pan-Asian Railway Network in Southeast Asia, namely the East Line, the Central Line and the West Line, have all made progress to varying degrees. China and ASEAN are deeply integrating the Pan-Asian Railway Network planning with development plans such as the ‘ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan 2025', jointly formulating detailed construction plans and timetables, and solidly promoting pragmatic cooperation, committed to complete the strategic jigsaw puzzle of land and sea connectivity among ASEAN countries as soon as possible, and laying a solid foundation for the development of the ASEAN Community. --，--。--。、、，。《2025》，，，，. Currently, with the rise of trade protectionism and anti-globalization trends, major power competition, and geopolitical tensions, Asia-Pacific regional cooperation is facing bottlenecks and constraints. The more this is the case, the more urgent it becomes for regional countries to build consensus around connectivity, and the construction of the Pan-Asian Railway Network is also most timely. Under the new circumstances, the construction of the Pan-Asia Railway will help break down trade barriers, provide an efficient and low-cost cross-border transportation channel for the Asia-Pacific region, inject new impetus into economic and trade exchanges within the region, and help integrate resources in the Asia-Pacific region, promote the process of regional economic integration, and enhance the overall competitiveness of the regional economy. For countries prioritizing security and development, cross-border railway cooperation can strengthen strategic collaboration, increase political trust, reinforce a sense of shared destiny, hedge against geopolitical risks and challenges, and can also reduce dependence on maritime energy transportation through opening up land energy channels, thereby better ensuring their energy security, enhancing regional strategic stability, and improving the collective ability to respond to complex challenges.- ，、，。，，。，、，，，，。，，，，，，，，，.

Previewing CCDI Plenary - How Xi Has Led Reform - China's Flexible Retirement System - Commemorating Shen Junru's Life to Support for Xi - Wang Shida ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 2, 2025. Page 1: There's a long, long Xinhua article on how Xi Jinping led China in 2024 to take new and solid steps towards modernisation. It says that in 2024, Xi visited -more than 10 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the Macao Special Administrative Region, made four visits abroad, presided over a series of important meetings, attended a series of major events, delivered a series of important speeches, and put forth a series of important instructions, which promoted new achievements in the theory and practice of governing the country.- I am not going to detail the full article. Rather, let me just point to some key extracts: The piece says that -this is an era of great changes, and even more so an era of great possibilities.- ，。 Xi Jinping -personally served as the head of the drafting group for the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Congress, throughout the process laying out plans, organizing research, carefully guiding, and taking the pulse/setting the direction.- 2023，2024，7。，、、、. The article specifically references this speech that Xi delivered towards the end of October on the subject of reform. In it, Xi outlined the approach to properly handle four key relationships. In it, Xi had also called on leading cadres to -strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge; we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development.- The article reiterates that -high-quality development- remains the Party's -primary task.- The article touches upon policy shifts since the September 26, 2024, Politburo meeting, praising Xi for demonstrating -great foresight- and -extraordinary wisdom and ability in steering China's economy.- 、，、，、，. What are new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping provided a profound explanation: ‘Its characteristic is innovation, its key lies in high quality, and its essence is advanced productivity. How to develop new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward clear requirements: ‘Cannot rush in hastily, surge up in a rush all together and disperse in a rush together, must adapt measures to local conditions, each having their own strengths'.- ？：-，，。-？：-、、，，.- The piece then discusses China's achievements in technology and innovation, progress in regional coordinated development, and coordinating development and security. The last of these includes -preventing and resolving financial risks, especially systemic risks-, -development of new energy and national energy security- and -food security.- The third section of the article deals with employment, rural revitalisation, urban-rural integrated development, and the work done to -narrow the urban-rural gap, regional gap, and income gap, and promote the common prosperity of all people-. Two bits to note in the foreign policy section. -China's poverty alleviation process shows that with the tenacity, perseverance and a fighting spirit of ‘dripping water wears away a stone and following a blueprint to the end', the poverty problem in developing countries can be solved, and weak birds can fly first and fly high. If China can succeed, other developing countries can also succeed. This is the global significance of China's successful victory in the battle against poverty.- -，、、，，、。，。.- Also: -‘We admire the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and are willing to learn from the experience of the Communist Party of China.' ‘We will continue to deepen cooperation with China and actively participate in the process of Chinese-style modernization.' ‘President Xi Jinping seeks the well-being of the people, maintains social fairness and justice, advocates peace rather than war, cooperation rather than confrontation, and creation rather than destruction, and has set an example for the world' ... This is the echo of the times of Chinese-style modernization, and this is the global significance of the new form of human civilization created by China today.- -，--，--，，、、，-……，. Subscribe now Next, there's a piece that previews the upcoming CCDI plenary session. It says that: In 2024, the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission along with discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to making the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and directives, and the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the top priority of political supervision, focusing on key tasks such as the implementation of a package of incremental policy deployments, keeping watch on important deployments such as high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, strengthening supervision and inspection, ensuring proper implementation, and resolutely preventing disobedience of orders and violations of prohibitions. 2024，，，，，，、. Then we get some data: In terms of inadequate supervision and abuse of power in the field of ecological and environmental protection, -from January to November 2024, more than 24,000 related issues were investigated and dealt with, and more than 34,000 people were criticized, educated and dealt with, of which more than 19,000 were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- ，、。2024111，2.4，3.4，1.9. The CCDI and NSC made -special arrangements to strictly investigate corruption in the field of grain purchase and sales.- -From January to November 2024, discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels across the country investigated and dealt with more than 14,000 related issues, criticized and educated more than 21,000 people, of which more than 13,000 people were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- 2024111，1.4，2.1，1.3. The piece talks about how supervision is following the agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, with -discipline inspection and supervision organs actively performing political supervision duties to clear obstacles and further the development of new quality productive forces.- --。，. How does it do this? Here's an example: -Shanghai's Shibei Hi-Tech Service Industry Park has gathered a batch of technological innovation enterprises. Shanghai Jing'an District's Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, through visits, learned that small and micro enterprises face problems of having few tangible assets and difficulty in financing. They actively promoted functional departments and financial enterprises to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, provided enterprises with personalized financing loan solutions, while also supervising the park to accelerate the systematic construction of intellectual property operation and maintenance services. As of now, nearly 20 enterprises have received intellectual property pledge financing services, and their funding problems have been effectively solved.- 。、，、，，。，20，. (Note: I don't think that this is the norm for the CCDI and NSC to facilitate financing solutions for enterprises. It also is an example of significant political and Party interference in financing decisions. But then the piece also talks about the CCDI engaged in supervision with regard to cultural relics protection.) Towards the end, the article says: Inspection tours are a strategic institutional arrangement for strict and comprehensive Party governance. In 2024, according to the Party Central Committee's deployment, the Central Inspection Work Leading Group organized two rounds of inspections, inspecting 68 units in total. As of now, the completion rate of the 20th Central Committee's full-coverage inspection task is nearly 50%. The Central Inspection Groups put the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important instructions and directives in the primary position, closely monitored power and responsibility to strengthen political supervision, deeply understood the inspected Party organizations' situations regarding fulfilling functional responsibilities, implementation of major reform deployments, preventing and resolving major risks, deepening strict and comprehensive Party governance, strengthening leadership teams and cadre talent team building, and carefully finding political deviations. 。2024，，，68。，50%。，，、、、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (GT's English report) informing that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Central Organization Department, the Ministry of Finance and other three departments issued the ‘Interim Measures for the Implementation of a Flexible Retirement System' on January 1, 2025. It says that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, the statutory retirement age for men will be gradually raised from 60 to 63 in the course of 15 years, while that for women cadres will be raised from 55 to 58, and that for women blue-collar workers will be raised from 50 to 55.- The document adds that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, employees who have reached the minimum years of contribution required by the state to receive a basic pension on a monthly basis may voluntarily choose flexible early retirement. The maximum early retirement period is up to three years before the statutory retirement age, and the retirement age cannot be lower than the original statutory retirement ages of 50 years for women blue-collar workers, 55 years for women cadres, and 60 years for men. When employees reach the statutory retirement age, the employer can flexibly delay retirement by reaching an agreement with the employee, with the delay time no longer than 3 years from the statutory retirement age.- 《》，202511，，，3，50、5560。，，，3. Page 3: There's a brief report informing that the China-Maldives FTA has taken effect from January 1, 2025. Also on the page, there's a report based on comments by MoFA's Mao Ning on China's focus on the Global South. I guess this is signalling for the year ahead. Mao said: -As Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out, the collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. In the past year, greater BRICS cooperation made a good start, the new model of ‘SCO plus' came into shape, and the African Union took part in the G20 Summit for the first time. Global South countries have joined hands to take part in multilateral cooperation more actively and extensively, bringing new impetus for the transformation of economic globalization, and adding new dynamism to global governance. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations. China will continue to practice true multilateralism, firmly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and bring the Global South together in solidarity for greater strength, so as to leave the mark of the Global South on the progress of humanity.- Leave a comment Page 6: There's a long piece marking the 150th birth anniversary of Shen Junru, who among other things was the chairman of the China Democratic League. One key excerpt from the article, given that history is never about history, but rather about the present. -We commemorate Mr. Shen Junru in order to learn from his spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, being selfless and fearless, and having the courage to struggle; to learn from his admirable qualities of advocating democracy, pursuing the rule of law, seeking truth, and striving for progress; more importantly, it is to learn from his steadfast political conviction of close cooperation and solidarity with the Communist Party of China and sharing weal and woe. Throughout the long revolutionary struggle, he forged deep friendships with CPC leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, becoming a trustworthy and candid friend of the Party. In his later years, Mr. Shen Junru held even deeper affection for the CPC. During the 1962 National Day celebration, Mao Zedong inquired about his health on the Tiananmen Rostrum and personally supported him as they descended the elevator after the event. Upon returning home, he emotionally declared, ‘We must always listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party of China.' This was not only Mr. Shen's earnest exhortation to the younger generations but also a vivid embodiment of the Democratic League's close alignment and resolute support for the CPC. Today, in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, members of democratic parties should take Mr. Shen Junru and other predecessors as role models, inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of multi-party cooperation, unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th CPC Central Committee, deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', strengthen the ‘Four Consciousnesses' and ‘Four Confidences', and achieve the ‘Two Safeguards', remain unwavering in thinking together, standing together, and working together with the CPC, upholding, developing, and perfecting China's new political party system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、、，、、、，、。，、，。。1962，，，：-，。-，、。，，，，，、，--，--、--、--，、、，、、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily On December 26, 2024, there was a piece by Wang Shida from China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Global Times in Chinese, arguing that while the world marks the 20th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, even today countries are realising that they need to -work together to overcome difficulties, as the region faces many new challenges requiring urgent attention.- Wang writes: -On one hand, the risk of bloc confrontation in the Indian Ocean region is intensifying. The Indian Ocean region is vast and densely populated, encompassing about 20% of the world's water bodies, a quarter of its landmass, and three-quarters of its oil, iron, and tin reserves. More importantly, the region is crucial for ensuring the safety and stability of global shipping lanes and trade routes, carrying over one-third of the world's bulk cargo and two-thirds of its oil shipments. International chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab el-Mandeb are located in the region, underscoring its significance in both economic and geopolitical terms. It is precisely because of the political and economic importance of the region that some countries have increased their involvement or interference in the Indian Ocean in recent years. The United States has been particularly active, pushing its ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy' to unite and integrate so-called ‘Indo-Pacific' allies and partners in an attempt to strengthen the containment of China. Currently, 3 of the US Unified Combat Commands are related to the Indian Ocean region, US military frequently conducts various joint exercises with regional countries, and has become the largest weapons supplier to the Indian Ocean region. Additionally, the US is leveraging mechanisms such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to bolster its influence and presence. Obviously, such actions amount to forming cliques in the Indian Ocean region, binding regional countries to America's war chariot, with growing risks of regional countries being ‘forced into camp confrontation'.- ，。、，20%、1/43/4、。，，1/3、2/3，、，。，。，--，--。，3，，。--、--。，，，--. On the other hand, the Indian Ocean region today is in urgent need of achieving sustainable development. At present, countries in the region are having to shoulder the heavy responsibility of developing the national economies and improving people's well-being, while at the same time facing several new and old challenges, such as environmental and climate change. Over the past few decades, climate change has caused countries in the region to experience increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations reported in 2021 that since the 1950s, the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than any other waters, which will lead to decreased fishing yields across the entire ocean, harming countries that are highly dependent on fisheries and lack the ability to adapt to climate shocks. In addition, by 2030, the population density of the Indian Ocean coastal areas is expected to reach the highest level in the world, with 340 million people living in potentially dangerous coastal areas. Obviously, avoiding risks of camp confrontation, opposing external power interference, or achieving regional stability and sustainable growth, including resolving lingering sovereignty disputes left behind from the decolonisation period, cannot be accomplished by any single country alone. It requires joint efforts from all Indian Ocean countries and regions as well as external () ‘positive energy countries'.- ，。，、，，。，、。2021，2050，，，。，2030，，3.4。，、，，，，--. -Although the US and other countries have been exaggerating the ‘China threat' and intensifying the containment and suppression of China under the framework of the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy', China has always developed relations with the countries in the Indian Ocean region with an attitude of equal cooperation and mutual benefit and win-win. In recent years, China's trade cooperation with the region has developed well, with increasing trade scale and growing mutual trade dependence. Currently, China is the largest import partner for over 20 countries in the Indian Ocean region, and the largest export partner for 13 countries in the region, with many regional countries joining high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. At the same time, China actively participates in multilateral cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and has hosted three China-Indian Ocean Regional Development Cooperation Forums. When the Indian Ocean tsunami occurred 20 years ago, China was a firm supporter of ‘working together to rebuild a beautiful home'. Looking to the future, China and the Indian Ocean region have broad cooperation space and huge development potential, with prospects to further advance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with regional countries, working together to achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the region.- ----、，、。，，，。，20，13，--。，，—。20，-，-。，，，，、.

Xi's New Year's Message & Warning - Putin-Xi Exchange Greetings - New Party Chiefs for Henan, Hubei, Guangxi & Qinghai	Wish all of you a very Happy New Year. Here's to another year of China-watching and analysis! If you work in a domain that requires you to conduct open-source China analysis, do please consider applying for my Watching China course. The course begins on February 1, 2025. Students and Takshashila alumni are eligible for discounts. Click here or on the image below for all the details. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 1, 2025. The front page today is dominated by Xi Jinping. The lead story is based on Xi's annual new year message. The speech (English text) essentially was a positive recap of 2024. He said: -We have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China's economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark. Grain output has surpassed 700 million tons, and China's bowls are now filled with more Chinese grain. Coordinated development across regions has gained stronger momentum, and mutually reinforcing advances have been made in both new urbanization and rural revitalization. Green and low-carbon development has been further enhanced. Indeed, a more beautiful China is unfolding before us. We have fostered new quality productive forces in light of actual conditions. New business sectors, forms and models have kept emerging. For the first time, China has produced more than 10 million new energy vehicles in a year. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields. Also for the first time, the Chang'e-6 lunar probe collected samples from the far side of the moon. The Mengxiang drilling vessel explored the mystery of the deep ocean. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link now connects the two cities across the sea. The Antarctic Qinling Station is now in operation on the frozen continent. All this epitomizes the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.- For 2025, he said: -In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan. We will implement more proactive and effective policies, pursue high-quality development as a top priority, promote greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and maintain sound momentum in economic and social development. The Chinese economy now faces some new conditions, including challenges of uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones. But we can prevail with our hard work. As always, we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident. Of all the jobs in front of us, the most important is to ensure a happy life for our people. Every family hopes that their children can have a good education, their seniors can enjoy good elderly services, and their youngsters can have more and better opportunities. These simple wishes are our people's aspirations for a better life. We should work together to steadily improve social undertakings and governance, build a harmonious and inclusive atmosphere, and settle real issues, big or small, for our people. We must bring more smiles to our people and greater warmth to their hearts. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, I visited the city again, and I was gratified to see the new progress and changes there. We will unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family. No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times. As changes unseen in a century accelerate across the world, it is important to rise above estrangement and conflict with a broad vision, and care for the future of humanity with great passion. China will work with all countries to promote friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual learning among different cultures, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We must jointly create a better future for the world.- Another report on the page covers Xi's meeting with representatives of retired officials and groups who received awards for their outstanding work. Li Ganjie spoke at this meeting. He called on everyone to -thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses and instructions on the work of veteran cadres; deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', resolutely implement the ‘Two Safeguards', and do a good job in the work of veteran cadres in the new era and new journey with high standards and high quality.- ，，--，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on Xi's remarks at the tea party arranged by the CPPCC on Tuesday morning. The full text of this speech is published on Page 2. Xi said: 2024 was a critical year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Over the past year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, we have responded calmly and adopted comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development. Chinese-style modernization has taken new and solid steps forward. 2024--。，，、，，. Xi added that -the development process over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements are encouraging. The economic operation is generally stable, progressing with stability, high-quality development is advancing solidly, scientific and technological innovation has made important progress, new quality productive forces are developing steadily, and it is expected that the annual GDP growth will be around 5%, with grain production exceeding 1.4 trillion jin for the first time.Reform and opening up continues to deepen, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee was successfully held, making arrangements for further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. Risks in key areas have been resolved in an orderly and effective manner, people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and employment and prices have remained stable. The 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the National People's Congress, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland were solemnly celebrated, and the construction of democracy and the rule of law, the practice of ‘one country, two systems' and the great cause of national reunification have made steady progress.

Xinhua reports: -Xi said that 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of China-Russia diplomatic relations, a new significant milestone in the bilateral relationship. In the extraordinary journey over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have grown more mature and stable, he said. In face of the accelerated transformation unseen in a century and a volatile international landscape, China and Russia always move forward hand in hand along the right path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party, Xi said. Over the past year, the two heads of state held three meetings in Beijing, Astana, and Kazan, and maintained communication through phone calls, exchanges of letters, and other means, Xi said, adding that they had candid exchanges of views and reached broad consensus on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of common concern. The political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have been advancing toward higher levels under the strategic guidance of the two leaders, he added. Practical cooperation in various fields has yielded tangible outcomes, such as the completion of the China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline, and the successful launch of the China-Russia Years of Culture has fostered a closer bond connecting the two peoples through generations, Xi said. China and Russia also support each other as chairs of the BRICS mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), contributing significantly to solidarity and cooperation among the Global South, he added.- -Noting that 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, Xi said that no matter how the international landscape evolves, China remains committed to deepening comprehensive reforms, advancing Chinese modernization, and promoting global peace and development. Xi also expressed confidence that China-Russia cooperation in various fields would continue to create new opportunities for growth. The Chinese president voiced readiness to maintain close exchanges with Putin and keep China-Russia cooperation on the right course so as to continue consolidating and deepening China-Russia ties featuring permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation, injecting strong momentum into the development and modernization of the two countries, and contributing to the well-being of the two peoples and safeguarding international fairness and justice.- Share Tracking People's Daily As per Xinhua, Putin said that -looking ahead to 2025, Putin said that he stands ready to maintain close communication with Xi to jointly promote the development of bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, and further strengthen coordination and cooperation on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, BRICS, the SCO and the G20. Such efforts, he noted, will not only fully serve the interests of the two peoples but also contribute to international and regional security and stability.- Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also exchanged greetings. First, there's a report on the appointment of new Party Secretaries for Qinghai, Hubei, Henan and Guangxi. Wang Zhonglin has been appointed the Party chief of Hubei, replacing Wang Menghui. Wu Xiaojun has been appointed the Party chief of Qinghai, replacing Chen Gang. Liu Ning has been appointed the Party chief of Henan, replacing Lou Yangsheng. Chen Gang has been appointed as Party chief of Guangxi. Second, Qiushi's January 2025 edition's lead essay is a speech that was delivered by Xi on February 7, 2023, at the Central Party School. The session was attended by newly-elected members and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee, as well as principal officials at the provincial and ministerial levels. Sinocism today carried a working translation of the full article. My coverage of the reportage around the speech back then is available here.

Xi's anti-Corruption Warning at Politburo's Democratic Life Meeting	Since 2015, the Politburo has been holding annual democratic life meetings at the end of the year. These meetings entail discussions on ideological and disciplinary issues, with senior Party members offering self-criticisms before Xi. Today's People's Daily's front page covers the report on this year's democratic life meeting. Xi's remarks about the need to prioritise -political cultivation,- for Politburo members to persist with lifelong learning, the seemingly endless nature of the anti-corruption campaign and the call for them to strengthen education of family members and surrounding staff are striking. It is quite a chilling message that is being sent to the Party elite about the sword that hangs above them. The report says that: From December 26 to 27, the Politburo held its annual democratic life meeting, deeply studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The meeting focussed on consolidating and deepening the results of the Party discipline education campaign and comprehensively exerting the restraint and guarantee incentive role of party discipline education. It also focussed on taking the study and implementation of disciplinary regulations and implementation of the eight-point central regulations as important content for inspection. It also combined ideological understanding with actual work performance to conduct self-examination and Party spirit analysis, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. 122627，，、，、，、，. Xi Jinping presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. But before detailing Xi's remarks, the report says: Before the meeting, relevant departments made careful preparations. Politburo comrades had heart-to-heart talks with relevant responsible comrades, listened to opinions and suggestions, and wrote speech outlines. The meeting first heard reports on the Politburo's implementation of the 8-point central regulation and on the work of reducing grassroots burden by rectifying formalism through the year. Politburo comrades spoke one by one, focusing on the meeting's theme, conducting thorough self-examination in light of the ‘Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Chinese Communist Party', ‘Several Regulations of the CCP Central Politburo on Strengthening and Maintaining the Central Party's Centralised Unified Leadership', and ‘Detailed Rules for the CPC Central Politburo's Implementation of the Central Eight-Point Regulations', seriously identifying problems, deeply analysing, being frank and open-minded, meeting with candour and sincerity, in a serious yet lively atmosphere, achieving the expected results. ，。，，。，20242024。，，《》、《》、《》，、，、，，. The report says that the speeches by Politburo members made five points: First, more firmly safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralised and unified leadership; Second, more firmly pursuing the value of serving and benefiting the people; Third, more firmly implementing the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee; Fourth, more firmly taking the lead in learning, knowing, understanding, and observing discipline; and Fifth, more firmly fulfilling the political responsibility of strict Party governance. ，5。；、；；；. The meeting stressed that since the beginning of this year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, the Party Central Committee has united and led the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country to calmly respond and adopt comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development, ensuring that Chinese-style modernisation advances through new and solid steps. People's livelihood security has been solid and effective, the overall social situation remains stable, new achievements have been made in promoting the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law, major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has created new situations, and comprehensive and strict governance of the Party has been deepened. These achievements are hard-won. ，，，，、，，。，，，，。. Politburo comrades unanimously believe that the centralised unified leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well, ensuring that the ship of Chinese-style modernisation breaks waves and maintains steady progress. The whole Party must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the two safeguards', and unswervingly implement the principles, policies and work arrangements of the Party Central Committee. Next year is the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan; it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, promote sustained economic recovery and improvement, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, unswervingly comprehensively and strictly govern the Party, and complete the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start of the 15th Five-Year Plan. ，，、。--，--、--、--，。--，，、，，，，，，，，，，，--，--. Following this, the report details Xi's remarks, who began commenting on the self-examination speech by each Politburo member, offering -specific requirements for each, and delivering a summary.- He then said that -this democratic life meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee was very effective, achieving the purpose of exchanging ideas, examining problems, and clarifying directions, which is conducive to the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee to enhance unity, improve work, and fulfil its mission.- 、，。，，、、，、、. Xi Jinping emphasised that this Party discipline study and education campaign had effectively solved some problems of Party members and cadres being indifferent, not understanding, and not mastering Party rules and discipline, promoted Party organizations and leadership groups at all levels to strictly manage Party discipline building, promoted the broad masses of Party members and cadres to consciously become loyal, clean, and responsible, achieving obvious results. The awareness of discipline and rules and the consciousness of integrity and self-discipline among the broad masses of Party members and cadres has been effectively enhanced, the endogenous motivation for taking responsibility and doing practical work has been further stimulated, the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere have been further strengthened, and the effectiveness of rectifying formalism to reduce grassroots burden has been further demonstrated. ，、、、，，、，。、、，、，、、，. Xi Jinping noted that cultivating a strong Party spirit will naturally lead to more conscious observance of Party discipline and rules. Leading cadres must treat cultivating Party spirit and enhancing ideological consciousness as lifelong pursuits, living to old age, learning to old age, cultivating to old age. Political cultivation should be the top when it comes to Party spirit cultivation, and Party spirit should be nourished through the Party's innovative theories, and take learning, observing, and implementing Party constitution, Party rules, and Party discipline as important content of Party spirit cultivation. Politburo comrades must adhere to strictly requiring themselves to measure up to the standards of Marxist politicians, take the lead in studying the Party's innovative theory, take the lead in implementing democratic centralism, take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, take the lead in strictly observing Party discipline and rules, take the lead in promoting the Party's fine traditions and work style, truly achieving ideological beliefs as firm as rock, absolute loyalty to the Party, and selfless dedication to the cause of the Party and people. ，、，。、，、、。，，。，，，，，，，，. Xi Jinping emphasised that Party discipline has both an educational and restraining function, as well as a guarantee and incentivising role. Party discipline and doing practical work are internally unified. Discipline not only clarifies the bottom line and boundaries that cannot be touched, but also provides a code of conduct for Party members and cadres to do things cleanly and boldly. If you abide by the rules and disciplines, you will have full freedom and broad space to do things and be entrepreneurial. Politburo comrades should set benchmarks and set examples. They should not only become models of abiding by discipline and rules and doing practical work, but also establishing clear orientation, supporting and encouraging those who dare to take responsibility, fostering a dynamic atmosphere of striving forward with determination and competing for progress. ，，。。，、、。，。、，、，，，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that Party discipline draws bottom lines and sets forbidden zones for correctly exercising power and preventing the abuse of power for personal gain, serving as a safety guardrail for Party members and cadres to maintain integrity and honesty. Revering discipline and observing discipline enables one to resist corrosion and be immune to all poisons. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption still exist, the anti-corruption struggle will always be ongoing. We must remain extremely clear-headed and resolute in the fight against corruption, and never slacken or hesitate. Politburo comrades shoulder heavy responsibilities and must be more strict with themselves and be extremely cautious with the power they command. It is necessary to focus on strengthening the Party work style and clean governance construction in the areas under one's supervision or regions under one's leadership, resolutely fight against various unhealthy trends and corruption phenomena, and strengthen the education and management of family members and surrounding staff. ，、、，、。、，、。，。、，，。，，。，，. Xi Jinping stressed that strictly enforcing and maintaining Party discipline is the common responsibility of the whole Party. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must assume the main responsibility, Party organisation secretaries must perform the duties of the first responsible person, and other members of the leading group must perform ‘one post, two responsibilities,' with each level leading the next, and ensure that the Party's discipline construction continuously achieves new results. Politburo comrades must earnestly shoulder the political responsibility for the Party's discipline construction, understand discipline construction situations in their supervising fields or governing localities in a timely and comprehensive manner, dare to manage and address problems within their scope of responsibilities with strict governance They have no choice but to be the leaders, executors, and dutifully serve as leaders, implementers, and promoters of strengthening Party discipline construction. ，，。（），，--，，。，，、，、、. Xi Jinping finally emphasised that next year's reform, development, and stability tasks are very heavy, leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots and masses, strengthen investigation and research, figure out the urgent difficulties and anxieties of the people, figure out prominent problems urgently needing solution at the grassroots level, and study to solve them in a targeted manner. ，，、，，，，.

Ideology Matters: My Review of Kevin Rudd's 'On Xi Jinping'	Welcome to Books and Ideas, a space dedicated to exploring thought-provoking concepts and writing. This section is designed as a platform for deeper dives into ideas that I encounter and engage with, whether they are China-specific or have broader significance. This section is also a personal challenge and commitment. By curating and sharing my perspectives on books from various genres, I aim to push myself toward a more disciplined and diverse reading habit. Perhaps, it's also a firewall against being numbed by the constant engagement with Chinese official discourse. My immediate goal is to read and review two books a month. Over the years, I have found that writing detailed reviews allows me to retain the key insights. They also become useful when I'd want to refer to some specific aspects of the argument that someone has made in the past. Finally, I would also like this is to become a collaborative space for conversations and ideas. So I welcome engagement, and if there is a book that you would like to recommend, please feel free to do so. Cheers, Manoj Kewalramani Over the past decade, policymakers, scholars, and analysts have been grappling with a particularly difficult puzzle amid China's emergence as a global power. Could the trajectory of China's rise have unfolded differently? Were there alternate pathways that Xi Jinping could have taken to ensure that the country kept growing economically and accumulating international influence, while maintaining the Communist Party's unrivalled control over political power and the military instrument? Furthermore, could such a path have minimised or even avoided the intensifying strategic competition with the United States—a competition that is likely to shape the future of the world order? Addressing these questions require deep consideration of individual and systemic motivations, impulses and constraints. Are the sweeping changes in policies—from the centralisation of power, intensified Party-state intervention in the economy and society, and assertive foreign and security policies—the product of Xi's ambition and ideological convictions? Or have they been a rational political response by a Leninist Party-state system to internal and external circumstances? This further leads to a deeper theoretical consideration: in a Leninist Party-state system, can one meaningfully distinguish between the leader and the structural logic of survival of the system? In other words, is Xi Jinping's emergence as a dominant and transformative figure a product of his peculiarities or an inherent design flaw of the Marxist-Leninist Party-state system? In his new book, On Xi Jinping How Xi's Marxist Nationalism is Shaping China and the World, Kevin Rudd essentially contends that it is the man that matters today. Rudd's argument is that China under Xi has witnessed the -unalloyed rebirth- of the -ideological man.- Xi, as per Rudd, is a -convicted Marxist-Leninist-, who is driving China's politics and policy towards what he envisions is the goal of national rejuvenation. Understanding his ideological positions and prescriptions for China are, therefore, essential. Or as Rudd, rather helpfully summarises: -Xi's ideological worldview offers us a unifying ‘red thread', providing a useful, albeit incomplete, illumination of the unfolding contours of Xi's plans for China and the world.- Essentially, he argues that in China today, ideology is -a real barometer of much deeper change.- That it -represents a new and significant driving force, which we ignore at our peril.- -Understanding Xi's ideational world a useful guide to understanding the ‘real world' of politics and public policy- within Zhongnanhai. Another reason why understanding ideological shift matters is because in the Chinese system, ideological messaging -sets the parameters within which a more granular, internal political and policy discourse can proceed.- The ideological framework that Rudd ascribes to Xi is one of ‘Marxist-Leninist Nationalism'. He argues that in his approach, Xi has moved China to a Marxist and Leninist left along with a Nationalistic right. In particular, he describes Xi Jinping Thought as follows: -It does not offer an alternative epistemology or methodology to that of classical Marxism-Leninism as interpreted through Mao Zedong's principal works on historical and dialectical materialism, contradiction, and practice. Indeed, Xi explicitly affirms these previous approaches but is critical of the party for not having rigorously applied classical Marxist methodologies to the contradictions confronting it under his immediate predecessors. As noted previously, where XJPT does differ significantly from the past is in its periodization of recent Chinese history, its redefinition of the party's principal contradiction, and its articulation of the party's more detailed policy challenges arising in this new era. Beyond these three major changes, however, XJPT does not offer the party a new, free-standing ideological system. Rather, XJPT is highly elastic, building on the ideological inheritance of Mao and Deng, albeit with a decidedly stronger preference for the methodological approach and many of the conceptual conclusions of the former. And, as with Mao Zedong Thought, XJPT can be moulded to meet the party's future political needs by legitimizing actions that Xi may need to take in response to as-yet-unknown policy pressures in the years that lie ahead.- At this point, it is useful to unpack some of the key concepts that help one understand the argument. The author does in the early chapters: Ideology: Rudd defines it as -a systematic body of ideas that provides an organization with a defined unity of purpose, giving rise to a program of action, irrespective of whether those actions arise as a direct or indirect consequence of that body of ideas.- Worldview: When exploring the concept of worldview, Rudd engages in a discussion on the distinction between pure and practical ideology. This is because -a world view may give the individual a certain outlook, but it does not indicate to him how he should act. Therefore, he distinguishes pure ideology from practical ideology. -Pure ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual a unified and conscious world view; practical ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual rational instruments for action…of practical ideology have no legitimation. But without practical ideology, an organization cannot transform its Weltanschauung into consistent action.- In his analysis, Rudd eventually brings these two concepts together: -China's ideological worldview should therefore be defined as the CCP's analytical methodology for understanding the world both at home and abroad and its conclusions about the changing nature of the world they face, including the range of strategic threats and opportunities they identify as a result of this analysis. It also includes their view on how the Chinese party and state should respond to these changing circumstances through political and policy action.- Let's now turn to some of the other concepts from the book. The Leninist Party: Rudd defines a Leninist party -as a political organization that applies the disciplines of historical and dialectical materialism, the theory of contradiction, and the targeting of political struggle, on the one hand, to the praxis of current, real-world circumstances, on the other. It therefore analyses where contradictions exist, whether they are major or minor, whether they are violent or non-violent, and what form of struggle is required in order to achieve resolution and progress. The Leninist party is also responsible for maintaining both ideological and organizational discipline within the party so that revolution at home and abroad can be achieved without internal political dissolution, or through deviation from the agreed ideological line. These form the core tenets of Chinese Leninism.- Left &amp; Right in CCP Context: This is an important explanation. -In CCP history, ‘left' and ‘right' as political labels have been shaped around several recurring, core issues within the party's debates over more than a century. Principal among these are: the scope of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the dangers of bourgeois liberalism and democracy; the primacy and permanency of class struggle; the centrality of the relations of production over the factors of production; the importance of equality and inequality; deep questions of the periodization of party history, including the primary stage of socialism; the socialist law of value; the socialist market economy; the relative roles of the party, the government, and the state; and the legitimacy of supporting world-wide revolution beyond China's borders. In other words, the ideological epithets of ‘left' and ‘right' are therefore not simply hollow phrases designed for prosecutorial purposes and devoid of substantive meaning. Indeed, throughout party history, they have been both tools of intra-party politics as well as means of expressing real-world ideational, political, and policy divergence.- The Leninist Left in his view, encompasses -reasserting the leader's power over the party's collective leadership, redeploying a Mao-like party rectification movement to restore party discipline, and reinforcing the dominant role of the party over the professional technocratic machinery of the Chinese state.- The Marxist Left: Rudd also identifies 7 essential feature of Chinese Marxism. Key among these is that Chinese Marxism is fundamentally -materialist rather than idealist,- and that its -machinery of change- -is dialectical materialism, based on the concept of the unity of opposites, the inter-permeation of phenomena, and the theory of contradiction.- He defines the shift to Marxist Left essentially in the context of the economy. Rudd argues that Xi has done so by -asserting the primacy of state planning over market forces, the state-owned enterprise sector over private firms, and greater income equality over rampant inequality.- Nationalistic Right: This refers to the changes in Chinese foreign and security policy. This, he argues, is reflected in increasing, top-down, nationalist campaigns about Chinese civilisational centrality, an enhanced grievance culture about the West's past occupation and continued containment of China, the prospect now for the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation', articulated by a new ‘wolf warrior' diplomacy legitimizing a more assertive and aggressive posture towards the world, all harnessed by a new, ideological assertion that China's time has now come with ‘the rise of the East, and the decline of the West'.- Importantly, Rudd contends that -Xi's nationalism is sui generis—it differs significantly from the forms of defensive nationalism often found in the Deng-Jiang-Hu era, but neither is it a simple reprise of Mao-type revolutionary nationalism. Although the nationalist component of Xi's overall ideological worldview is clearly driven by a number of revisionist ambitions from ‘the right', there is also evidence of a number of residual Marxist-Leninist concepts. These are further reinforced by certain classical Chinese ideations of the ‘Middle Kingdom', all combined in an eclectic vision of a form of future Chinese-led international order. In other words, Chinese nationalism under Xi is emerging as a composite of three inter-connected traditions. It evidences: a nationalist-revisionist core; a Marxist, historically determinist rationale concerning the inevitable collapse of the international capitalist order led by the United States; while also wrapping itself in the classical garmentry of universal Confucian values, Tianxia, and other forms of more ancient Sino-centrism.- Next, I'd like to highlight two key arguments from the book, which I found deeply thought-provoking. One of the most intriguing arguments in the book deals with changes in China's economic policy under Xi. Rudd argues that Xi believes that -the analytical paradigm of dialectical (and historical) materialism was important for China's ‘strategic thinking' across the board.- In other words, it is an essential tool to analyse and respond to the changes in China's internal and external environments. In discussing China's shifting policies, Rudd explains that it is not his view that Marxist-Leninist ideology or the instrument of dialectical materialism did not matter during the Deng-Jiang-Hu era. He says that it mattered -in terms of the party's ongoing claims to national political legitimacy in the eyes of its membership and the people- and -it mattered as a central medium for both internal party discourse and as a guide to substantive policy action by the Chinese state.- The key difference, however, was that Deng, Jiang, and Hu -remained ideologically disciplined in their respective levels of policy activism- for a variety of reasons. This is not the case with Xi, who is the first leader since Mao -to deliver speeches explicitly dedicated to Marxist analytical methodology.- Xi's policy activism is primary due to his assessment of the changes in China's domestic and external contradictions. In addition, something about the 2015-16 stock market crash also seemed to leave a deep impact on Xi. From the perspective of the economy, Rudd explains that the change in the understanding of China's principal contradiction at the 19th Party Congress in 2017 was incredibly important. He argues that Xi seems to have assessed that although China continues to remain in the primary stage of socialism, the progress made since the era of Reform and Opening up has brought it to towards latter phase of this stage. Discussing the concept of periodising development into different stages of socialism, Rudd explains: -The underlying ideological logic of this official periodization of China's development trajectory is that it determined the level of class inequality to be tolerated at each stage in order to raise the people's overall living standards. But, in Xi's logic, the ideological purpose of generating greater wealth was not to permit higher levels of inequality forever; it was to accelerate the overall economic development process towards higher levels of socialism. In the primary stage of socialism, higher levels of class inequality have been permitted in order to generate more rapid economic growth. However, as the party moved towards more advanced levels of socialism, that inequality must be moderated before being eliminated altogether under communism.- This requires purposeful action to correct the imbalances that decades of pro-market policies had generated. Xi's answer to this challenge is the New Development Concept, which Rudd says -represents his overarching ideological alternative to Deng's concept of ‘reform and opening'.- He adds: -It is designed for the ‘new era' that had been heralded by the ‘higher phase' of the primary stage of socialism that Xi believed China had now reached, as the country proceeded along its pre-ordained path—one that had been determined long ago by the ineluctable forces of historical materialism.- Interestingly, examining Xi's speeches, Rudd concludes that Xi seems to be suggesting that the -mid-century goal (2049 goal of modernisation) as the official benchmark for formally ending the primary stage of socialism-. It is within this context that Rudd also characterises Xi's drive for common prosperity, which the Chinese leader has classified as an essential aspect of Chinese-style modernisation. A direct consequence of this assessment is intensified intervention in the markets and the need to constrain and direct the growth of the private sector and wealth creation. Rudd is rather clear-eyed in his assessment of Xi's global ambitions. Examining Xi's speeches, he concludes that the Chinese leader views foreign policy and the shape of the international order within the context of his broader goal of national rejuvenation. In this context, he views competition with the US as an inevitable contest between national systems. He also appears to believe that in this regard, China's Party-state system enjoys superiority. This not only has implications for domestic policy and bilateral relationships with other countries but also for the future of the world order. Rudd argues: -Xi Jinping is signalling loudly and clearly through his expanding nationalist narrative that the time has come to take active measures to change the international status quo in a direction that is more compatible with Chinese national interests, values, and power. This includes consciously and actively reshaping the international rules-based order. It also means resolving outstanding challenges to China's perception of its territorial integrity.- He further writes that in Xi's view, going forward, -China's growing national power would be the fulcrum of the emerging international system; it would not be an international structure still underpinned by historical American power—or by some loose, power-sharing arrangement with others.- Rudd argues that Xi's vision for the world order is that -China should lead the building of this order, and that it should draw on its own reservoir of national wisdom in doing so.- This vision for order is encapsulated in the concept of the community of common destiny for mankind. -These propositions-, Rudd writes, -represent a major departure from Deng's underlying argument that Beijing should work within the framework and structures of the existing international order as a continued precondition for maximizing China's national economic development.- From Rudd's perspective, this is a product of a sense of new nationalism but also the outcome of Xi's assessment of the state of the world through the methodology of dialectical and historical materialism. He adds: -the central ideological construct of ‘struggle' unifies both Xi's domestic and international missions. Xi also refers to Marxist understandings of the ‘underlying trends' that warrant this new exercise in international institutional reform or ‘struggle', as an old, American-led order passes away and a new Chinese-led order comes into being.- On Xi Jinping is a truly compelling read. Rudd has waded through vast amounts of Xi Jinping's writings, official discourse and scholarly work distilling important insights for analysts and policymakers around the world. Indeed, we are in an era where tracking ideological discourse is critical to understand the long-term, strategic policy trends. However, ideological clarity from Xi Jinping does not necessarily imply rigidity in policymaking. In fact, at different points in the book, Rudd argues that Xi himself does not view Marxism as a rigid, dogmatic ideology. Furthermore, towards the latter part of the book, Rudd delves into Xi's discourse on strategy and tactics. Xi has argued that -strategy and tactics are powerful weapons for our party to lead the people to transform the world, change practice, and promote historical development. The correct application of strategy and tactics is the secret of our party's success in creating a glorious history…To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must pass on, apply, and develop this successful secret well.- The secret essentially implies persisting with strategic objectives while maintaining tactical flexibility because the -environmental conditions for implementing the strategy change at any time-. Of course, this proposition does not take into account the elephant in the room, i.e., there can always be a moment when tactical changes acquire critical mass thereby having a strategic effect. Anyway, while I am not going to detail it, Rudd's eventual prognosis for China and the world is not terribly optimistic. He believes that Xi is set to hold the reigns of power for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will continue to yield tumult and turbulence at home and abroad. Beyond this, as an analyst studying Chinese politics and policy-making and as someone who reads an unhealthy amount of official discourse, there are five practical lessons that I would like to draw from the book. First, while official language and discourse is often dull, repetitive and exhausting, it is important to go slow and take your time with it. Often the difference lies small changes in language or the use of certain adjectives and adverbs. These can be significant. Analysts tend to be most acutely aware of these changes when examining language related to monetary or fiscal policy, but even on ideological issues, it is important to not glaze over such changes. Second, ideological framing of policy shifts might take place after the fact but that does not render ideological discourse meaningless. It is still critical to continue deciphering the ideological casting of real-world policy changes because it sets the parameters for and can circumscribe the scope of action. More importantly, it sets the terms of debate for the future. This is because demonstrating ideological continuity even when breaking from the past is critical to the party's legitimacy. Therefore, understanding the codes of communication within the Marxist-Leninist system is critical for any analyst of China. Third, when engaging with the system's codes of communication, it is important to unpack how certain terms are understood within the Marxist ideological worldview. For instance, what does Xi mean when uses terms like modernisation, democratisation or common prosperity? What are the constituents of national rejuvenation, and what is its linkage with an emerging trend of global interventionism by China? This underscores the importance of work like The Decoding China Dictionary that the good folks at MERICS have put together. Fourth, analysing the use of banner terms is important. I have often been guilty of underplaying some of this in my assessments. For instance, I have seldom put as much stock in counting the number of references to terms like security or development in key speeches. But, after reading Rudd's book, I think it is worthwhile to take this into account far more than I have, particularly through the use of historical comparisons. In other words, changes in the number of times a concept is mentioned by Xi in comparison to his predecessors is useful. Likewise, increased references to a certain concept in speeches at recurring forums or changing prioritisation of tasks compared to the past can be useful markers of shifting objectives. It doesn't tell the whole story, but it is an important data point. Finally, everything has a purpose, and timing matters. This is perhaps one of the most significant analytical tools that I draw from Rudd's work. Editorial decisions taken by the Chinese media and theory ecosystem are not ad hoc, driven by market demands or conventional metrics of newsworthiness of a development. These are purposeful choices to communicate primarily to a domestic and, more narrowly, a party audience. It is, therefore, important to understand the timing and context within which a certain speech delivered or made public through Qiushi months or even years after it was delivered. Understanding the thought-process behind such communication and how it intervenes in or shapes ongoing debate on an issue is essential. One must also view this from the perspective of different stakeholders, i.e., officials, bureaucracies, cadres and private sector actors.

Analysis of India-China SRs Meeting	Hello everyone, Xi Jinping's in Macao marking the 25th anniversary of the region's return to China. Today's paper is essentially full of the coverage of that trip. If you are interested, Xi's speech at the dinner last night is available via Xinhua English. Alas, I am unable to do the full newsletter owing to personal commitments. And I am going to take a break till the end of the year, unless something really significant develops. For the moment, I am leaving you with a brief discussion I had last night with StratNews Global on the meeting between the Indian and Chinese special representatives on the boundary issue in Beijing. Hope this is useful for those watching India-China ties. Wish you all a very happy holiday season! Manoj Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

New Survey on India-China Relations - Xi Visits Sanya - Wang Yi on China's Global Outlook in 2025 - Li Qiang on Plan to Ease Law-enforcement Challenge...	Hi folks, In today's People's Daily, there is a brief report confirming that India and China will be holding a meeting of the Special Representative on the India-China boundary question in Beijing today. This is a key outcome from the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October. So I guess this is an opportune moment to share that last night, the Takshashila Institution released a new public opinion survey report on India-China ties. And not surprisingly, the report found that over half of Indians believe that the boundary issue is the biggest stressor between India and China. The report also has some rather counter-intuitive findings on issues related to trade, investment and skilled talent. But let me leave you with this bit, which I thought was rather interesting and perhaps said more about Indians' positive assessment of the system of multi-party democracy Cheers, Manoj Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 18, 2024.

Accelerate the implementation of the core policies of the Hainan Free Trade Port, carefully make all preparations, and ensure the smooth and orderly operation of customs clearance. ，。，。、、、、，，，、、。，--。，、。，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out the need to continuously enhance the civility of residents and the level of social civilization. Persistently use the Party's innovative theories to unite minds and forge souls, cultivate and promote socialist core values, extensively carry out mass activities for spiritual civilization building, and strive to achieve simultaneous improvements in material and spiritual civilization.

Improve the public cultural service system in urban and rural areas, enrich the spiritual and cultural lives of urban and rural residents, and continue to promote the transformation of outdated customs and practices.- ，。，，，。、、、，，。，，. -Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to comprehensively improve the level of people's livelihood security and social governance.

Unremittingly grasp the anti-corruption struggle and strive to eradicate the soil and conditions for the breeding of corruption. Strengthen the restraint and supervision of exercise of power, and educate and guide cadres to enhance their ability to resist and prevent corruption.- ，，。，，，、、，。，。，. He ended by talking about the need to implement the priorities from the CEWC and ensure social stability, food and energy supplies, etc, ahead of the New Year and Spring Festival. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the State Council study session, which discussed the need to strengthen enforcement procedures, improve methods and enhance supervision to boost the quality and effectiveness of administrative law enforcement. Professor Hu Jianmiao of the Central Party School was the guest speaker at the session. Li Qiang then spoke. He said -that administrative law enforcement is an important means for the government to perform its duties according to law and manage economic and social affairs, and promoting strict, standardised, impartial, and civilised law enforcement is a key aspect of building a law-based government. Currently, there are still instances of abuse of administrative discretion and unjust law enforcement in certain areas and localities. Efforts must begin with issues strongly raised by the public and businesses, further improving the benchmark system for administrative discretion and standardising the operation of power. To address the issue of incomplete benchmark coverage, it is necessary to promptly improve benchmarks for discretion in areas such as licensing, collection, enforcement, and inspection. To resolve the problem of unreasonable discretion ranges, the severity of violations by business entities and their capacity to bear penalties should be considered, and the principle of ‘proportionality of offence and punishment' should be followed to determine penalty limits. Regarding the issue of inconsistent local standards, coordination and guidance should be strengthened, and timely adjustments should be promoted.- ，、，。、。，，。，、、、。，，--。，，. -Li Qiang pointed out that next year will launch a special action to standardise law enforcement involving enterprises, continuously optimise the business environment, promote stable expectations and strengthen confidence. It is necessary to standardise the law enforcement procedures, fully implement the publicity of administrative law enforcement, the record of the whole process of law enforcement, and the legal review system of major law enforcement decisions, unblock the channels of appeal, and protect the appeal rights of those being supervised according to law. In improving enforcement methods, flexible measures can be applied to minor offences that involve no intent and pose limited social harm. Strengthen law enforcement supervision, pay attention to abnormal growth in fines and confiscations, a large number of off-site law enforcement (this is largely about issues of jurisdiction), and large-scale maximum penalties, review and verify relevant law enforcement behaviours, and correct any problems in a timely manner. Strengthen the use of information technology to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement supervision.- ，，，。，、、，，。，、、，。，、、，，。，. Li ended with the need to -safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the people and enterprises, and maintain a fair and competitive market order.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a brief report on Wang Yi's speech on China's diplomacy in 2024. The full English version of the speech is available on the Ministry's website. Let me highlight key excerpts. Wang began by talking about Xi Jinping's head of state diplomacy. He then said: -Over the past year, new breakthroughs have been made in building a community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village…In the course of 2024, China and Brazil have announced joint efforts to build a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as two emerging countries; China and Serbia have launched efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the first of its kind in China's relations with European countries. Globally, a growing number of countries have pitched in to build a community with a shared future. What's worth mentioning in particular is that Chinese and African leaders have agreed to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, giving expression to the shared desire of the 2.8 billion Chinese and Africans to pursue common development in greater solidarity. China has also made efforts to build communities with a shared future with particular regions, including with Central Asia, ASEAN, countries in the Lancang-Mekong river basin, Arab states, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. These efforts are opening up new vistas of harmonious coexistence between different civilizations…With the joint efforts of China and other countries, the notion of humanity sharing a common future has been written into multiple resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (U.N.) and multilateral documents, and the goal of building a community with a shared future has been established in various fields such as cybersecurity, climate change, and health. We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N., supported the U.N. in holding theSummit for the Future, and endeavored to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We have accelerated the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives. To date, 82 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, 119 countries and international organizations have given support to the Global Security Initiative, and the 78th U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China to establish an International Day of Dialogue among Civilizations. Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been established as the noble goal for practicing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.- -We have actively worked for the restoration of world peace and endeavored to save human lives. On the Ukraine crisis, we have always maintained an objective and impartial position, and actively pushed for peace talks. Over the past year, our special envoy conducted three rounds of shuttle diplomacy. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We also brought other Global South countries together to launch the group of ‘friends for peace' to gather consensus for finding a path to peace. The Gaza conflict has taken too many civilian lives. The immediate priority is a comprehensive ceasefire, the key is to ensure humanitarian assistance, and the fundamental way out is to realize the two-state solution. Over the past year, we have pushed for the adoption of the first resolution by the Security Council on a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitated the reconciliation dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration by various Palestinian factions, and delivered multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. We will continue to make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. We have mediated peace in northern Myanmar and facilitated multiple rounds of peace talks among conflicting parties. We have supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and realizing peace and reconstruction. We have also made consistent efforts to promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. Facing the dramatic change in Syria, China will continue to stand with the Syrian people and uphold the ‘Syrian-led and Syrian-owned' principle. China opposes the attempt of terrorist forces to exploit the situation to create chaos, and will help Syria maintain its sovereignty and restore stability.- He then talked about how Chinese modernisation has created opportunities for the world. Under this, he said that 155 countries had joined BRI. The next bit was on the Global South. Wang said: -The collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. China promoted new proposals and new developments of mechanisms and strengthened the force for unity and progress in the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations, so as to leave their mark on the progress of humanity. Building on its historic expansion last year and setting off this year from the new starting point of greater BRICS cooperation, BRICS is bringing more partners into its big family to make the platform a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations. Considering the reasonable concerns of developing countries, China promoted the adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building, proposed the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, worked with fellow Global South nations to jointly launch an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science with fellow Global South nations, and pushed for the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance at COP29. China called on developed countries to take concrete actions to earnestly fulfill their due responsibilities, provide sufficient financial support to developing countries, and uphold global climate justice. China has stayed committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and helped fellow developing countries move faster in rejuvenation. At FOCAC, China and Africa agreed on the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan for stronger cooperation between the two sides in the next three years, and agreed on ten partnership actions for modernization covering 10 key areas such as trade and investment, industrial chain cooperation and green development in an all-dimensional boost to Africa's development. China and Arab states saw significant early harvests from the ‘eight major cooperation initiatives' and went on to develop ‘five cooperation frameworks' in five dimensions: innovation, finance, energy, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchanges. China deepened the synergy of development strategies with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and continued to upgrade its cooperation with Pacific island countries.- Then Wang talked about specific relations. He cast this in terms of -all-round diplomacy, which has built up the trend toward a new type of international relations-. One of the goals for this is to build a -amicable and harmonious home in Asia-. He said that China-Russia ties had -grown more mature and stable, demonstrated in a clearer way its independence and resilience, and set an example of friendly exchanges between major countries and neighbors.- He added: -China-Russia relations are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party, and are not subject to interference or coercion from any external factor. Amid shifting global dynamics, China and Russia will maintain a high degree of strategic mutual trust, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard global strategic stability.- On Europe, he said: -Europe holds an important position in China's diplomatic agenda. A healthier and more stable China-Europe relationship serves the fundamental interests of both sides and the common aspiration of the world.- During engagements with European leaders, Xi -encouraged the European side to take a long-term and strategic perspective, see China as a partner and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to the benefit of both sides and the world at large. China and Europe are two great civilizations of the world and two major forces of the times. China stands ready to work with the European side to handle differences and disputes properly, seek win-win solutions, and jointly safeguard free trade and multilateralism.- This is the paragraph on India and Japan, which are clubbed together. -China is having more trust and less suspicion with major countries in this region. When meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping put forth important propositions on improving China-India relations, which received positive response from Prime Minister Modi. The two sides agreed to step up strategic communication, safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas, and strive to bring the bilateral relationship back to the track of stable development at an early date. China and Japan reaffirmed the commitment to promoting the China-Japan strategic relationship of mutual benefit in an all-round way, and to building a constructive and stable relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. In line with Japan's commitment on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water, China has recently started independent sampling and monitoring and will work with the international community to urge the Japanese side to earnestly fulfill its international obligations and responsibilities.- Share Tracking People's Daily Then there are two paragraphs dealing with the US. -There is a lot of interest in China-U.S. relations. How China and the United States get along concerns the well-being of the two peoples and also the future of the world. This year, we have followed the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, focused on implementing the San Francisco Vision, and worked to maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations. China and the United States held two rounds of strategic communication and five meetings of the Financial Working Group and the Economic Working Group respectively. The two sides advanced practical cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, law enforcement and climate change,extended the science and technology agreement, and co-signed each other's resolution on artificial intelligence at the U.N. General Assembly. Nearly 15,000 young Americans visited China through the initiative of ‘50,000 in five years', sowing the seeds of friendship between the two countries. Such progress has been widely welcomed by Chinese and Americans across the sectors as well as the international community at large. This fully shows that as long as China and the United States cooperate with each other, they can accomplish many great things together. In the meantime, China firmly safeguards its sovereignty, security and development interests, and firmly opposes the illegal and unreasonable suppression by the U.S. side. In particular, with regard to the U.S.' gross interference in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan, China has to make a firm and robust response to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests and safeguard the basic norms governing international relations. Last month, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden and sent a congratulatory message to President-Elect Trump, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-U.S. relationship at this critical juncture. President Xi Jinping summed up seven pieces of experience and inspiration based on a thorough account of bilateral exchanges in recent years, and drew four clear red lines that must not be challenged, namely, the Taiwan question, China's path and system, democracy and human rights, and China's development right. He stressed that China's goal of a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged; its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged; its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged; and its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remains unchanged. This is not only the authoritative interpretation of China's U.S. policy, but also our earnest expectation on future China-U.S. relationship. The fact that China has maintained its U.S. policy stable and consistent demonstrates its firm strategic resolve and broad-mindedness as a major country. We will engage in dialogue, manage differences, enhance mutual trust, remove misunderstandings and expand cooperation with the U.S. side, and work with the U.S. to explore the right way for our two major countries to get along with each other on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world.- Subscribe now Wang then made three points about China's diplomacy: First, China's diplomacy upholds Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy -as the fundamental guideline- and that -the Party's leadership is the most defining feature of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and our greatest political strength to overcome all risks and challenges.- Second, China's diplomacy is -people's diplomacy.- Third, -China's diplomacy is always about standing up for responsibilities-, i.e., -We have resolutely countered the attempt of using Taiwan to contain China and the myth of seeking U.S. support for ‘Taiwan independence', firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and effectively strengthened the international community's commitment to the one-China principle. We have taken justified and firm measures to safeguard China's rights against certain countries' provocations in the South China Sea, and worked with ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have refuted false narratives hyping up the so-called ‘human rights issues', set the record straight, and gained overwhelming support from over 100 countries for China's just position. More countries have come to realize that playing double standards will only disgrace oneself and interfering in others' internal affairs is ultimately unpopular.- Leave a comment He then made five points about China's diplomacy for 2025. Before doing so, this is how he assessed China's global standing. -China today is already a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to lead new endeavors, and greater moral appeal.- First, China will be a firm force for peace in a world of turbulence and conflicts. We hope the incoming U.S. administration will make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions, overcome obstacles, and achieve the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. We will deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and all-round practical cooperation with Russia, and work for steady progress in China-EU relations toward independence, mutual success and benefit to the world. Stability in China will provide a strong underpinning for global strategic stability, and certainty in China will help cushion uncertainties in other parts of the world. We will carry forward the Chinese way of settling hotspot issues and continue our constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and other hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar. Second, China will be a firm force for unity in the face of division and confrontation. We support the holding of the second China-Central Asia Summit, and will work for the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Protocol. We have properly handled differences and are working with India to find the right and bright path for big, neighboring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side. We will partner with Africa in implementing the ten partnership actions for modernization, expedite the building of ‘five cooperation frameworks' with Arab states, and use the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum as an opportunity to open a new chapter of cooperation. We will continue to pool the collective strength of the Global South through unity. Third, China will be a firm force for openness in the face of decoupling and severing supply chains. We will deliver on the eight major steps of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, advance both the major flagship projects and the ‘small and beautiful' livelihood programs, and create new space for win-win cooperation of higher quality, enhanced resilience and greater sustainability. We are determined to pursue higher-standard opening up, accelerate the development of the FTAAP, and safeguard the global free trade system as well as the stable and unimpeded functioning of the industrial and supply chains. We advocate a world economy that is cooperative, stable, open, innovative and eco-friendly, and we are ready to join hands with all countries on the path toward modernization. Fourth, China will be a firm force for justice in the face of the counter currents of unilateralism and bullying. We will hold solemn commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war, promote a correct view of history, uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We will effectively fulfill the role as the SCO rotating chair, support Brazil in hosting the BRICS summit and the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), support South Africa in hosting the G20 summit, and work for a more just and equitable international order. Fifth, China will be a firm force for inclusiveness in the face of ideological differences. We will promote the common values of humanity, deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries, join forces for the progress of human civilization, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship among people of different countries. We will step up experience-sharing on governance and development, tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and cement China's friendship with countries around the globe. We will expand two-way exchanges between the Chinese people and people elsewhere, and do our best to stage a successful Asian Winter Games to showcase a diverse China through the charm of ice and snow.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) foreign ministers' meeting. Xinhua reports: -Emphasizing that ensuring security, promoting development, pursuing cooperation and seeking win-win results are the urgent aspirations of the overwhelming majority of countries, Wang called on CICA to play a unique role in this regard, build an Asian community with a shared future and expand new space for win-win development. Wang called on CICA member countries to adhere to peaceful coexistence and seek common security; jointly advance Belt and Road cooperation to promote prosperity and development; respect diverse civilizations and promote exchanges and mutual learning; practice multilateralism and build a beautiful home together. Noting that Chinese modernization is a modernization that follows the path of peaceful development and brings more opportunities to Asian countries, Wang said that China stands ready to work with CICA member states to forge a new form of Asian civilization featuring win-win development through solidarity and coordination.- Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report with data from China's National Energy Administration. It says that: As of 2024, the installed capacity of operational and approved nuclear power units in China is approximately 113 million kilowatts.

Xi's Lessons from Qiao Shi's Life - State Council Plans CEWC Agenda Implementation - Change in Macroeconomic Policy Mainly Due to External Environment...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, December 17, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is on the event held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of late top legislator Qiao Shi. Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the event. Xi's full speech is available on Page 2. In the first part of the speech, Xi outlines Qiao's accomplishments and the positions he held. Some key points in this: Xi said that Qiao was -an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a time-tested and loyal communist fighter, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary and politician, and an outstanding leader of the Party and the country-. ，，、，... -During the ‘Cultural Revolution', Comrade Qiao Shi suffered severe persecution. He adhered to the Party's principles, sought truth from facts, and carried out a tenacious struggle. --，。，，. Xi said that during his tenure as the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Qiao -attached great importance to maintaining national security and unity, resolutely opposed ethnic separatist activities, and made important contributions to maintaining national political stability and social order.- ，，、. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 13th Central Committee, Secretary of the Central Secretariat, and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Comrade Qiao Shi conscientiously implemented the principle of strict Party governance, emphasised strengthening the discipline awareness of the whole Party, strengthening Party conduct and clean governance, and fully utilising the important role of discipline inspection in promoting reform, opening up, and economic development. He attached great importance to the strict enforcement of the Party's political discipline and severely investigated and dealt with serious violations of the Party's political discipline. He resolutely opposed corruption, made great efforts to correct unhealthy tendencies within the Party, promoted the formulation and improvement of laws and regulations on clean government construction, led the formulation of a series of Party discipline regulations and provisions, and promoted and guided the establishment of the Ministry of Supervision. While serving as the president of the Central Party School, he vigorously deepened the reform of the party school and promoted the work of the party school into a new period of development. 、、，，，，。，。，，，，。，，. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 14th Central Committee and Chairman of the NPCSC, Comrade Qiao Shi devoted significant effort to upholding and improving the people's congress system. He emphasised combining the strengthening of democracy with the strengthening of the rule of law, advancing the orderly development of democratic political construction along the direction and path of socialism with Chinese characteristics…He attached great importance to the implementation of the Constitution and focused on strengthening supervision over the implementation of the Constitution and laws. He also attached great importance to legislative work, proposing that the NPC ‘make accelerating economic legislation its primary task', which promoted the initial establishment of the socialist market economy legal framework and laid a solid foundation for forming the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He emphasised the lawful exercise of supervisory powers, advancing the standardisation and institutionalisation of supervision work. After retiring from his leadership positions, he firmly supported the leadership of the Party Central Committee and remained committed to the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, with particular attention to democratic and legal development, Party conduct and clean governance, and the fight against corruption. 、，。，。，。，。，--，，。，。，，，、. In the next bit, Xi talks about what must be learned from Qiao's life. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his noble character of adhering to beliefs and dedicating himself to ideals. Comrade Qiao Shi was unwavering in his belief in the lofty ideal of communism and infinitely loyal to the Party and the people. In 1991, in response to the setbacks and low ebb in international communism at the time, he clearly pointed out that ‘the communist ideal is our spiritual pillar and the driving force for the advancement of our cause. Holding firm to communist beliefs is the most basic requirement for Communist Party members.' ‘The development of human society from lower to higher stages will ultimately lead to a communist society; this is the inevitable course of historical development'. He emphasized: ‘to persist in the cause of socialism on the land of China and continuously achieve new victories is of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to all mankind'. Ideals and beliefs are the foundation for the Party's establishment and development, as well as the anchor for Party members and officials. All Party members must regard strengthening their ideals and beliefs as a lifelong task, constantly cultivating, refining, understanding, and progressing in upholding the lofty communist ideal and the shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, standing firm like a mountain in both favorable and adverse circumstances, and able to withstand the test of great waves.- ，、。，。1991，、，，-，。-，-，-。：-，，，。-，。，、，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his strong Party spirit of upholding the Party's work conduct and discipline. Comrade Qiao Shi always unwaveringly adhered to Party leadership, gave high importance to the issues of work conduct and Party building, and continuously strengthened Party discipline construction. He clearly stated that ‘anyone who does not execute or covertly resists the Party Central Committee's decisions, who damages the Party's centralization and unity, who violates Party discipline - this is absolutely unacceptable.' He deeply despised corruption and unhealthy practices. During his time leading the CCDI, he intensified efforts to investigate and handle cases, focusing on bureaucratism, formalism, abuse of power for personal gain, and other issues that seriously affected relations between the Party and the masses, achieving significant results. Party spirit, Party conduct, and Party discipline are an organic whole, wherein the Party spirit is the root, Party conduct is the manifestation, and Party discipline is the guarantee. We must always adhere to the Party's comprehensive leadership and the Party Central Committee's centralized and unified leadership, unwaveringly comprehensively enforce strict Party governance, unswervingly enforce strict Party governance, advance the building of Party integrity and the anti-corruption struggle, and maintain the Party's advanced nature and purity, ensuring that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- ，、。，，。：-，，。。-，，，、，。、、，，，。，，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his precious quality of maintaining his original aspiration and diligently serving the people. Comrade Qiao Shi always placed the Party's cause and people's interests first, fulfilled his duties, and devoted himself entirely to public service. He held profound feelings for the people, clearly pointing out that ‘people from all walks of life across the country, the vast majority of ordinary people, regardless of gender or age, are the ones we serve'. While leading the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, he emphatically stressed that we should ‘take protecting the people, serving the people, being the people's servants as the fundamental starting point and the important standard for measuring the work of every political and legal cadre', and ‘only by constantly thinking about what the masses think about, being concerned about what the masses are concerned about, can we truly work wholeheartedly and make our team a team truly loved by the people'. The country is the people, and the people are the country. We must always adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, uphold the people-centered development philosophy, earnestly safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, strive to bring benefits to the people, and let the fruits of modernization benefit all people more fully and fairly.- ，、。，，。，：-，，，。-，，-，，，，-，-，，，-。，。，，、，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his political commitment of actively pursuing reform and daring to act. Comrade Qiao Shi resolutely supported and implemented the line, principles, and policies advanced since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, unwaveringly advancing reform and opening up. In the early period of reform and opening up, he clearly pointed out that ‘we must be determined to run the special economic zones well; it simply has to be done well, and running the special economic zones well will not be a mistake'. Regarding political and legal work in the new period, he emphasized that ‘everything conducive to reform and opening up and conducive to the development of productive forces must be protected and supported by law; everything detrimental to reform and opening up, detrimental to the development of productive forces, must be opposed and restricted by law; everything undermining reform and opening up, democracy and rule of law, and the development of productive forces must be struck down and punished by law.' In 1992, he emphasized the need to deeply study and implement the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour from the height of it being ‘another great liberation of thought'. Reform and opening up is the important magic weapon for the Party and people's cause in order to make great strides to catch up with the times. We must unwaveringly hold high the banner of reform and opening up, adhere to maintaining integrity while innovating, take the reform of the economic system as the guide, promoting social fairness and justice and improving people's well-being as the starting point and foothold, closely focus on Chinese-style modernization to further comprehensively deepen reform and promote high-level opening up, and strive to compose a new chapter of reform and opening up.- ，、。，。，：-，，。-，：-、，；、，；、、，。-1992，--。。，，，、，、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his persistent pursuit of respecting the rule of law and enforcing the rule of law. Comrade Qiao Shi was a faithful practitioner of democratic legal system construction. He clearly pointed out that ‘we must recognize that the legal system is absolutely not something optional or dispensable. Strengthening material civilization and spiritual civilization construction must rely on legal system guarantees; ensuring the economy does not distort and the country remains stable for a long time must also rely on legal system guarantees, thereby overcoming tendencies to slight or despise the legal system, and improving the consciousness of establishing and maintaining the legal system.' Under his leadership and effort, the 8th NPC and its Standing Committee issued a batch of important economic laws, creating a good legal environment for establishing and developing the socialist market economy. The rule of law is an important guarantee for Chinese-style modernization. We must always adhere to the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the joint promotion of ruling the country according to the law (reference to an overarching principle), governing (Party and state's processes and exercise of power within the boundaries of the legal framework) according to the law, and administering (rules for the actions of departments, ministries, officials, etc.) according to the law (、、), adhere to simultaneously building a law-based country, law-based government, and law-based society, comprehensively promote scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and adherence to the law by all people, and comprehensively build a socialist modern country on the track of the rule of law. ，、。。：-、。，；，，，、，、。-，，。。，、、，、、，、、、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his work style of seeking truth from facts and being pragmatic. No matter which position he worked in, Comrade Qiao Shi always attached importance to integrating theory with practice and creatively used Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods to analyse problems. During his investigation of the Dabie Mountain area, he said that ‘when researching economic development in mountain areas, borrowing experiences from other places is necessary, but one must definitely be grounded in local conditions, adapt to local circumstances, and absolutely must not blindly compare with big cities or coastal regions.' He emphasised that ‘we must be truly responsible to the people, always adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, do not engage in empty talk, do not practice formalism, do not engage superficial actions/going through the motions, and practically fulfill responsibilities on the ground'. Seeking truth from facts is the fundamental requirement of our Party for understanding and transforming the world. We must always adhere to connecting theory with reality, persist in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, keeping pace with the times, being practical and realistic, resolutely oppose formalism and bureaucratism, concentrate our hearts and strength to promote development, and solidly advance the construction of Chinese-style modernisation.- ，、。，，。：-，，，，、。-：-，，，，，。-。，、、、，、，，。 If you are interested in others' speeches, they are available on Page 6. Next, there's a report (English report) on the State Council's Executive Meeting. This is the first meeting after the CEWC. The report says that the meeting was held -to study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference and make arrangements for the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference.- 1216，，. -The meeting emphasized the need to align thoughts and actions with the Party Central Committee's scientific assessment of the economic situation and its decisions and arrangements for next year's economic work, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility, urgency and initiative for implementation. All departments of the State Council must fully align themselves with the various arrangements determined by the Party Central Committee, be proactive, formulate implementation plans, and produce specific task lists, timelines, and roadmaps to ensure that all work progresses in an orderly manner.

Efforts should focus on improving the project review and management mechanism, moderately increasing the autonomy and flexibility of local governments, and enhancing the efficiency of bond issuance. It is necessary to strengthen the full process management of special bonds, and improve the fund supervision mechanism and repayment mechanism. It is necessary to do a good job in the issuance and use of special bonds next year, doing so as soon as possible, and provide strong support for promoting a sustained economic recovery.- ，--，、，。，，。，。，，. -The meeting studied policy measures to promote the high-quality development of government investment funds, pointing out that it is necessary to build a scientific and efficient management system, highlight government guidance and policy positioning, and operate government investment funds in a market-oriented, law-based and professional manner in order to better serve the overall national development. It is necessary to develop and expand long-term capital and patient capital, improve the differentiated management mechanism of different types of funds, and prevent the crowding-out effect on social capital. It is necessary to improve the responsibility mechanism with consistent rights and responsibilities and compatible incentives and constraints, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure.- ，，，、、，。、，，。、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily In addition, the meeting heard a report on a three-year campaign to improve work safety, emphasising the importance of investigating major risks and hidden dangers thoroughly. It called for strengthened measures at the turn of the year to protect the safety of people and their property. the meeting also discussed the revitalisation of the football industry, seeing it as key in transforming China into a strong sports nation. The meeting urged intensified efforts to implement measures aimed at advancing work on football development. the meeting also deliberated and approved the adoption of a draft regulation on the management of China's public security video image information system. Subscribe now Third, there's a commentary drawing from the CEWC meeting. It says that the CEWC made a systematic deployment and put forward the overall requirements and policy orientation for economic work next year. -Currently, the most important things are: first, carefully study and comprehend, accurately understand the Party Central Committee's decision-making intentions; second, implement without deviation, and thoroughly integrate all requirements into doing well next year's economic work.- ，，，，. It adds that: -Economic and social development goals have strong guiding significance. The conference proposed the main expected objectives for next year's economic and social development, pointing out the need to maintain stable economic growth, maintain overall stability in employment and prices, maintain basic balance in international payments, and promote synchronized growth of resident income and economic growth. These were proposed based on in-depth research, accurate judgment, and scientific analysis, considering both the present and the long-term, releasing a strong signal of promoting continuous economic improvement, and powerfully boosting confidence and motivation. Economic growth is a fundamental and highly correlated indicator. Whether stabilizing employment, preventing risks, benefiting people's livelihood, strengthening confidence, or effectively responding to external environmental changes and challenges, resolving various contradictions in development requires maintaining a certain economic growth rate. Placing stability in growth, employment, and prices in a prominent position, while simultaneously proposing ‘seeking progress in stability, promoting stability through progress, maintaining integrity while innovating, establishing before breaking, systematic integration and collaborative coordination' provides a clear direction and scientific methodology for doing next year's economic work well.- 。，，、，，。、、，、，，。，、、、，，，。、、，-、，、，、-，，。 Scientific and effective macroeconomic regulation is an important guarantee for the steady and healthy development of the economy. The meeting emphasized that ‘more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies should be implemented next year'. It is clear that a more proactive fiscal policy will be implemented, the fiscal deficit ratio will be increased, the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds will be increased, and the issuance and use of local government special bonds will be increased. The tone of monetary policy has been adjusted from ‘prudent' to ‘moderately loose', which is the first time in 14 years. The tone of macroeconomic regulation has changed significantly, mainly due to the deepening of the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment. China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges. To do a good job in economic work next year, we must face up to the difficulties and take positive actions, increase the intensity of counter-cyclical regulation, further enrich and improve the policy toolbox, and provide strong policy support for promoting the continued improvement of the economy.- 。--。，、、。----，。，，，、，，，.

Xi on Self-Revolution - What the Party is Thinking about When Coordinating the Relationship between Demand & Supply	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 16, 2024. Just about the entire paper today is dedicated to featuring announcements of candidates for national moral models. Consequently, there are only two pieces that are worth noting in today's edition. First, there is a report on Qiushi publishing an article drawn from Xi Jinping's speech at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI on January 8, 2024. This was the meeting that framed Xi Jinping's thoughts on Self-Revolution. In the Qiushi piece, Xi begins by framing the self-revolution of the Party as the second answer for the Party to successfully break free from the historical cycle of rise and fall, and ensure that it never degenerates, changes color or flavor. The first answer, of course, was Mao's framing that -let the people supervise the government-, i.e., democracy. Xi said: -The ideals pursued by our Party are lofty and sacred, and the missions it shoulders are arduous and demanding. Only by examining ourselves against the requirements of the times, remaining vigilant with a strong sense of crisis awareness, and forging ourselves with the spirit of self-revolution can we continuously enhance our leadership capacity and governance level, ensuring that the Party never degenerates, never changes colour, never loses its flavour, and always remains the strong leadership core of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, it must be recognised that, with changes in the situation and tasks, shifts in the external environment, and transformations within the Party's membership, various contradictions and problems will inevitably arise within the Party. It is essential to have the courage to turn the blade inward, promptly eliminate various negative influences, and ensure that the party always remains full of vigorous life and exuberant vitality. This is the reason why we must advance the Party's self-revolution.- ，，，，，，、、，。，、，，，，。. Xi added: -The courage to carry out self-revolution is the most distinctive character and greatest strength of our Party. The nature, purpose, original intention and mission of the Party determine that our Party always represents the fundamental interests of the broad masses. By not seeking private interests, we gain the thorough spirit of self-revolution, enabling us to seek the root and greater good, adhere to truth and correct mistakes, and dare to examine ourselves and constantly reflect on our shortcomings. By not shying away from the truth or glossing over mistakes, and by promptly discovering and solving our own problems, we can effectively fight back against the ‘entrapment/hunting' and corruption from all interest groups, power cliques, and privileged classes. This is the secret behind our Party's ability to maintain its advanced nature and purity and the source of its confidence to carry out self-revolution. To deeply advance the Party's self-revolution, it is necessary to address the following issues in practice.- 。、。，、，、，、；、，，、、--。、，.，. Share Tracking People's Daily Then Xi highlights the 9 issues that needed to be grasped () in order to promote self-revolution. These are: Taking the upholding the centralised and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee as the fundamental guarantee Taking leading the great social revolution as the fundamental purpose. Under this, he said: Plan the self-revolution of the Party in light of the new requirements of the practice of the great social revolution, use the new achievements of great social revolutionary development to examine the actual effectiveness of the Party's self-revolution, and strive to achieve: leading the great social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, and promoting the Party's self-revolution through the great social revolution. At present, we should plan and promote the self-revolution of the Party closely around the central tasks of the Party, so that the self-revolution of the Party can better serve the central tasks of the Party. ，。，，、。，，. Taking the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the fundamental guideline that must be adhered to Taking breaking free from the historical cycle of rise and fall as the strategic goal. Under this, he said: -Advancing the Party's self-revolution is a magic weapon for breaking free from the historical cycle of dynastic rise and fall. To focus on this strategic goal, we must maintain a high level of political vigilance, promptly eliminate the viruses eroding the Party's healthy body, and promptly remove various hidden dangers that undermine the Party's governing foundation, thereby ensuring the Party's continued health and continuously consolidating its long-term governing position.- ，。。，，，，，. Taking solving the unique problems of a big Party as the main direction. Under this, Xi tells us that the unique problems of a big Party are encapsulated in the -six how to always .- Xi had articulated this in the January 2023 CCDI plenary session. Xi says: Solving these difficulties is definitely not the work of a single day or a moment. In advancing the Party's self-revolution, we must adhere to the problem-oriented approach, maintain strategic determination, treat both the symptoms and root causes, adopt comprehensive measures, coordinate efforts, persist unyieldingly, work persistently and long-term, transform small victories into great victories, and demonstrate the advantages of a big party through continuously resolving its unique challenges. ，。--，。，，、、、、，，. Taking establishing a sound system for comprehensive and strict Party governance as an effective approach to achieve objectives. Under this, Xi writes: -It is necessary to closely follow the general requirements of Party building in the new era, ensuring comprehensive coverage in content, universal coverage of targets, a full chain of responsibilities, and thorough integration of systems. Persist in governing the Party through systems and rules, continuously improve the Party's self-revolution system and normative framework, and further form a positive cycle of relying on the Party's own strength to discover problems, correct deviations, drive innovation, and achieve an overall enhancement of governing capabilities.- ，。，、、、，、，，、、、. Taking the forging of a strong organisation and building an excellent team as a key emphasis/focal point. Under this, Xi writes: Deeply implement the Party's organisational line in the new era, improve the organisational system that is connected from top to bottom and has strong execution, enhance the political and organisational functions of Party organizations, focus on resolving issues such as weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffective Party management, and promote comprehensive improvement and comprehensive strengthening of Party organizations at all levels. Adhere to implementing the new era's standards for good cadres, strictly control the political gate, capability gate, and integrity gate, ensuring that the broad masses of Party members and cadres are loyal, clean and responsible. ，、。，、，，、、，、。，、、，. Taking rectifying discipline, upholding integrity, and combating corruption as an important starting point. Taking combining self-supervision with people's supervision as a powerful driving force. Under this, Xi said: -We must consciously accept supervision by the people, and effectively integrate intra-Party supervision with supervision by state organs, democratic supervision, judicial supervision, mass supervision, and public opinion supervision, so as to achieve a virtuous interaction and mutual gain between self-discipline and external discipline.- ，、、、、，、. Subscribe now The Six How to Always are below: How to always ensure that we always stay true to our original aspiration and keep the mission firmly in mind? How to always unify thoughts, will and actions? How to always ensure that we maintain a strong governing ability and leadership level? How to always maintain the entrepreneurial spirit? How to always identify and solve problems in a timely manner? How to always maintain a clean and upright political ecology? Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there is a commentary drawing from the conclusions of the CEWC. The article begins by talking about the need to coordinate the five important relationships that were highlighted in the CEWC readout. These are: It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalising existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving quality and expanding total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernisation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The commentary then takes the case of the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It says: China has the world's largest and most comprehensive manufacturing system. Among 500 major industrial products, over 220 rank first globally in production output. This robust supply capability not only supports steady growth in foreign trade, with China's share of global goods exports ranking first for 15 consecutive years, but also continuously generates effective demand through high-quality supply, providing a constant driving force for economic growth. 、，500，220。，，15，，. -Supply creates demand. Focusing on improving the quality and efficiency of the supply system can create and stimulate new demand. Taking the NEV industry as an example, it took 6 years from annual production of over 10,000 vehicles to annual production of over 1 million vehicles for the first time. It also took only 6 years for China's NEV industry to achieve a leap from annual production of 1 million vehicles to 10 million vehicles. Since July, retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles have begun to exceed fuel vehicles. The reason why NEVs have gained market favor and achieved overtaking opportunities by both continuously improving quality through technological innovation and meeting people's expectations for a high-quality lifestyle.- 。，。，，，6。6，。7，。、，，. -The core of deepening supply-side structural reform is to advance industrial innovation with scientific and technological innovation. This Central Economic Work Conference made important arrangements around leading the development of new quality productive forces through scientific and technological innovation, and proposed to carry out large-scale application and demonstration actions of new technologies, new products and new scenarios. Looking to the future, creating new consumer demand through high-quality supply and promoting the upgrading of consumption quality will surely achieve a virtuous cycle and coordinated efforts.- ，。，。，、，、. Demand drives supply. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has coordinated the expansion of domestic demand and the deepening of supply-side structural reforms, firmly grasped the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, and promoted a smoother domestic circulation and more efficient connection between domestic and foreign markets. Especially since this year, the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' policies have continued to exert their strength, continuously releasing consumption potential and driving investment growth. The overall policy of replacing old consumer goods with new ones has driven the sales of related products to exceed 1 trillion yuan. From January to October, national fixed asset investment increased by 3.4% year-on-year. Among this, infrastructure investment increased by 4.3% year-on-year, 0.2 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months; manufacturing investment increased by 9.3%, 0.1 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months. 。，，，、。，----，、。1。1103.4%。，4.3%，90.2；9.3%，90.1. -The Central Economic Work Conference has deployed the key tasks for next year, with ‘vigorously boosting consumption, improving investment efficiency, and expanding domestic demand in all directions' as the top priority. This reflects an efficient coordination of total supply and demand and a deep understanding of economic laws. Implementing special action to boost consumption, expand and strengthen the implementation of ‘two new' policies, provide greater support for ‘two heavy' projects, these policy measures, both grounded in the present and looking toward the long-term, will inevitably effectively stimulate domestic demand potential, consolidate and expand domestic circulation, and better drive the domestic and international dual circulation.- ，-、，-，，。，--，--，、，，，. -Currently, China's economic operation faces numerous difficulties and challenges, including insufficient domestic demand and the adverse impact of an unstable and uncertain international environment on external demand. It is essential to recognise that expanding domestic demand is not only crucial for economic stability but also for economic security; it is a strategic move, not temporary expediency. In this context, it is particularly urgent and important to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand.- ，，。，，，，。，. -Practice has shown that achieving a virtuous cycle of the national economy requires coordinated efforts and dynamic balance between supply and demand. On one hand, it is necessary to focus on the supply side, continuously deepen supply-side structural reform, making advancements and retreats, providing support and applying pressure to enhance the alignment and balance between supply and demand. On the other hand, attention must be directed toward the demand side, accelerating efforts to address shortcomings in domestic demand, particularly in consumption, so that domestic demand becomes the primary driver and stabilising anchor of economic growth. Only by acting in accordance with economic laws can better outcomes and results be achieved. The ‘five must-coordinate' principles are an important understanding of economic work laws that must be firmly grasped. By studying, understanding, and applying Xi Jinping Economic Thought and using scientific methods to plan and promote economic work, we can surely take the initiative in development and achieve steady and long-lasting progress.- ，，、。，，、，、。，，。，。--，。、、，，、.

2024 CEWC Readout & Assessment - Xi Calls for 'Equal-footed Consultation' with US - Xi Meets Dmitry Medvedev	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, December 13, 2024. Page 1: The front page is all Xi Jinping, including the Central Economic Work Conference readout. So let's begin by breaking down the 2024 CEWC readout. In his speech at the CEWC, Xi reviewed the country's economic work in 2024, analyzed the current economic situation and arranged next year's economic work. My Note: I have some initial thoughts going through this readout, although I am sure I haven't spent enough time with it to come up with a detailed assessment yet. But here goes. First, there is a reaffirmation that the economic goals for the year will be achieved. I am highlighting this in light of recent discourse on Beijing wavering on the GDP target. Second, compared to last year's readout, this one talks about having a -more proactive fiscal policy- and specifically to -raise the fiscal deficit ratio.- Last year, the objective outlined was to -appropriately intensify- fiscal policy. In terms of fiscal policy changes, the document calls to increase the issuance and use of special bonds by local governments, expand the scope of investment domains, and broaden the use of these bonds as project capital. Third, also compared to last year, the document this time talks about implementing -a moderately loose monetary policy- from an earlier -prudent monetary policy-. This phrase was used in the Politburo meeting earlier this week. As reports have informed, this is the first time we are seeing such language since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The document also calls to reduce the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates in a timely manner. Fourth, the requirement of boosting domestic consumption is once again on the top of the list of tasks for next year. Last year's CEWC had it second among the nine tasks. The top task was to focus on technology. In 2022, domestic demand was the top priority in the CEWC readout. The document calls to -vigorously boost consumption- and support the two new policies and two heavy projects, through more central funding. Towards the end of the document, this is a very clear statement of intent: -It is necessary to closely grasp key links to complete the key tasks of economic work next year, targeting the prominent issues of insufficient demand by focusing on boosting domestic demand, especially residential consumption demand; address deep-seated development constraints and external challenges by unwaveringly deepening reforms and expanding opening up…- Fifth, the second priority in the list is to focus on technology linked to industrial development. In contrast, there's no real emphasis on consumer technology or platform economy, although it does get a mention. One noteworthy aspect of this is the call to -comprehensively rectify ‘involution-style' competition and standardize the behavior of local governments and enterprises-. This is indicative of far more intervention by the state, particularly through the central government and regulatory changes to ensure what it contends is market order. Sixth, with regard to the real estate sector, the readout calls to -reasonably control the supply of new land for real estate projects, revitalize existing land and commercial and office buildings, and promote the disposal of existing commercial housing. Promote the construction of a new model of real estate development and build relevant basic systems in an orderly manner.- This is somewhat different from the readout last year, which had called to -meet the reasonable financing needs of real estate enterprises of different ownerships equally-. The readout this year essentially entails a continuation of the policies that have been enacted this year. Seventh, I thought this was worth noting: -Support economically developed provinces to take the lead, and encourage other regions to adapt to local conditions and showcase their strengths. Deepen industrial cooperation among the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions, and vigorously develop the marine economy and bay area economy-. I wonder if this is also somewhere a concern with regard to low-end industrial capacity being outsourced beyond China's border, and therefore, a call to transfer capacity to the interiors. Eighth, the exclusion of some ideas is interesting. For instance, there is a reference to balancing the relationship between total supply and total demand, but there is no mention of supply-side structural reform; it was mentioned in 2022 and 2023. Also, there's not really any substantive space given to boosting private sector confidence compared to last year's readout. There's no mention of the ‘Two Unswervings', which again was something that was referenced in 2022 and 2023. Finally, towards the end, the paragraph on implementation is rather scathing, and a reflection of systemic inertia and the frustration of the top leadership. Subscribe now Share Tracking People's Daily With that done, here's what the readout says: -The meeting held that this year was a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. In the face of the complex and severe situation characterized by increasing external pressures and mounting internal difficulties, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core united and led the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to respond calmly and adopt comprehensive measures. Economic operation is generally stable while making steady progress, high-quality development is solidly advancing, and the main economic and social development goals and tasks are about to be successfully achieved. New quality productive forces have steadily developed, reform and opening-up have been continuously deepened, risks in key areas have been mitigated in an orderly and effective manner, work on people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and solid strides have been made in Chinese-style modernization. The development journey over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements have been encouraging, especially the decisive deployment of a package of incremental policies at the meeting of the Politburo on September 26, which effectively boosted social confidence and significantly led to economic recovery.- ，--。、，，、，、，，。，，，，。，，926，，. -The meeting pointed out that the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment have deepened, and China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges, mainly due to insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, pressures on employment and income growth for the people, and numerous risks and hidden dangers that still remain. At the same time, it must be seen that China's economic foundation is stable, has many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential, and the long-term supporting conditions and basic trends have not changed. We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence, and strive to transform positive factors in all aspects into development results.- ，，，，，，。，、、、，。、，. -The meeting held that in practice, we have continuously deepened our understanding of the laws of economic work. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for doing economic work well. At critical moments and important junctures, the Party Central Committee has promptly assessed the situation and made decisions and deployments, ensuring that China's economic ship can brave the waves and move forward steadily. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalizing existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving quality and expanding total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，。，、，、，、。，----。，。，。，。，. -The meeting stressed that to do a good job in economic work next year, we must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, build a modern industrial system, better coordinate development and security, implement more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies, expand domestic demand, promote the integrated development of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, stabilize the property and stock markets, prevent and resolve risks and external shocks in key areas, stabilize expectations, stimulate vitality, promote the sustained recovery of the economy, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, and complete the goals and tasks of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan' with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start to the ‘15th Five-Year Plan'.- ，，，、，，，，，，，，，，，，，，、，，，，--，--. -The meeting pointed out that next year, we must maintain stable economic growth, maintain overall stability in employment and prices, maintain a basic balance in international payments, and promote the synchronization of residents' income growth and economic growth. The meeting stressed that next year, we must adhere to the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, promote stability through progress, uphold integrity while pursuing innovation, establish first before breaking new ground, integrate systems holistically, and ensure coordinated collaboration; enrich and improve the policy toolbox, and improve the foresight, precision, and effectiveness of macroeconomic regulation.- ，，、，，。，、，、，、，，、、. -It is necessary to implement a more proactive fiscal policy.

Party and government agencies must adhere to the principle of frugality.- 。，、。，。，----。，。，，、、，--。. -It is necessary to implement a moderately loose monetary policy. Fully leverage the dual functions of monetary policy tools, including the total amount and structure, reduce the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates in a timely manner, maintain ample liquidity, and ensure that the growth of social financing scale and money supply aligns with the expected targets for economic growth and the general price level.

Xinhua reports: -In the letter, Xi extended congratulations to the council and all its members, and sent sincere greetings to people from all sectors in the United States who have been caring for and supporting business cooperation between the two countries. Noting that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important relationships in the world, Xi said it concerns not only the immediate interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also the future of and destiny of the entire humanity. Xi said both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, adding China is prepared to stay in communication with the United States to expand cooperation, manage differences, continue exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era, and realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.- -Economic and trade relations are an important part of bilateral relations, Xi said, noting the interests of the two countries are closely intertwined, and the room for cooperation is infinitely vast. The two sides should properly handle differences through equal-footed consultation, and make the pie of cooperation bigger based on their complementary advantages, said the Chinese president. The success of one side should be an opportunity rather than a challenge for the other, and one's achievement should help rather than hinder the development of the other, he added. Xi said openness is a key driving force for human civilization and progress, adding it is the only path toward prosperity and development for every country. Reform and opening up is a historic process in which China and the world achieve development and progress together, he said, adding a few months ago, the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a comprehensive plan for further deepening reform across the board to advance Chinese modernization. Xi said China will always uphold the basic state policy of opening up to the outside world, keep improving its market-oriented, law-based, and world-class business environment for companies from all countries including the United States, and continue to liberalize and facilitate trade and investment. Chinese modernization, with its new achievements, will provide new opportunities for the world, he added. Xi expressed hope that USCBC and friends from all sectors will continue to care for and support China-U.S. relations, take an active part in Chinese modernization, join hands together to write a new chapter of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit, and make new contribution to the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's message to the 2024 Imperial Springs International Forum.

Xi emphasized that in a world marked by intertwined changes and turmoil, peace and development remain the shared aspirations of all peoples. China stands ready to work with other countries in the spirit of ‘promoting global solidarity', upholding fairness and justice to safeguard global peace and stability, adhering to win-win cooperation to promote sustainable global development, and committing to inclusiveness and mutual learning to advance human civilization to new heights, Xi said.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with Chairman of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev. Xinhua says: -Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 75 years ago, China and Russia have blazed a new path featuring mutual respect, harmonious coexistence and win-win cooperation between major and neighboring countries, setting an example of new-type international relations as well as relations between major neighboring countries, Xi said. He said China is willing to work with Russia to strengthen the synergy of development strategies, tap the intrinsic momentum of bilateral cooperation, and continuously bring benefits to the two countries and peoples. China and Russia should strengthen communication and coordination within such multilateral frameworks as the United Nations (UN), the BRICS cooperation mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core, and practice true multilateralism so as to make the international order more just and equitable and jointly safeguard global strategic stability and international fairness and justice, Xi said. Xi pointed out that since the establishment of relations between the CPC and the United Russia party more than 20 years ago, the two sides have conducted high-level and constructive interactions, strengthened exchanges and mutual learning on party and state governance, continuously enriched the content of institutionalized exchanges between the two parties, and helped consolidate political and strategic mutual trust between China and Russia. As important forces promoting human progress, the two parties should further coordinate and cooperate closely, lead the global governance in the right direction, and pool the consensus of friendly political parties in countries around the world, especially in the Global South countries, to push the world forward in the right direction, Xi said. On the Ukraine crisis, China has repeatedly emphasized the need to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, to promote the easing of the situation as soon as possible, Xi said. He added that China will continue to adhere to its consistent position and work with the international community to create favorable conditions for the political settlement of the crisis.- The report adds: -Medvedev delivered a signed letter to Xi from Russian President Vladimir Putin-. -Noting that the exchanges and cooperation between the United Russia party and the CPC bear special responsibilities in the relations between the two countries, Medvedev said the United Russia party is willing to promote pragmatic cooperation and youth exchanges through the dialogue mechanism between the ruling parties of Russia and China, strengthen education on traditional values such as patriotism and promote the long-term development of bilateral relations. Medvedev said that the Russian side speaks highly of China's position on the Ukraine crisis, pays attention to the Group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis, an initiative put forward by China, Brazil and other countries, and is willing to actively promote the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with foreign envoys. The PD report says: Xi Jinping pointed out that China has a long history and a vast territory. He hoped that the envoys will visit more parts of China, listen more to the voices of the Chinese people, fully understand the China of the past, the present and the future, objectively reflect China's contemporary outlook, development path and direction, and actively play the role of bridge builders, promoters of cooperation and inheritors of friendship between China and the world … Chinese-style modernization is not a modernization pursued in isolation. China is willing to share its development opportunities with all countries, achieve mutual benefit and mutual success, and work together to achieve the modernization of all countries in the world with peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- ，、。，，、、，、、，、、...。，、，、、. Xi Jinping emphasized that the era we are in faces major challenges and crises, such as geopolitical conflicts, unilateral actions, rising protectionism, and climate change, which urgently require joint action by all countries. At this new historical crossroads, nations should draw lessons from human history, strengthen unity and collaboration, and pool greater efforts to safeguard world peace and development. As a stabilizing, positive, and progressive force in the international community, China will always unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, and together with other countries, advocate an equal and orderly world multipolarization, inclusive and beneficial economic globalization, practice the common values ​​of all mankind, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- ，、、，。，，，。、、，，，、，，.

As a founding member of the SCO, China has always regarded the organization as a priority in its diplomacy.

Politburo Studies Border Governance - Xi Meets Heads of International Organisations - China's Economy in 'Critical Period'	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 11, 2024. I am doing a brief edition today owing to paucity of time. But I think it covers all the really substantive material from the paper. Three important reports on the front page today.

Strengthen multidisciplinary research related to border history and border governance, and accelerate the construction of China's independent border knowledge system.

The achievements of border research should be effectively utilized to tell the story of China's border governance in the new era. Cultivate a team of researchers with firm political positions, strong theoretical grounding, solid theoretical cultivation, and comprehensive quality for border governance studies. ，，。，。，、。，。、. Share Tracking People's Daily The other lead report on the page is on Xi's remarks when meeting with the heads of major international economic organizations, who were in Beijing to attend the ‘1+10' dialogue. Xinhua says: -Xi briefed the guests on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially the important measures recently adopted by China. He said that after more than 40 years of sustained and rapid development, the Chinese economy has ushered in a phase of high-quality development, contributing around 30 percent to the world economic growth. China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and continuing to play the role of the largest engine of world economic growth. China's development is open and inclusive. China will further opening-up to the outside world, proactively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and build a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for and share more development dividends with other countries, he said.- -Noting the progress in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) over the past decade, Xi welcomed international economic organizations to continue actively participating in the BRI cooperation and promote the modernization of all countries that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- Regarding global economic governance, Xi stressed that promoting world economic growth is inseparable from effective and proactive global economic governance. International economic organizations should keep pace with the times, respond to the call of the times and the expectations of the people of the world; they should actively participate in and promote the reform of the global economic governance system, build a more fair and reasonable global economic governance system, reflect the development and changes in the global economic structure, and increase the representation and voice of the Global South. All parties have already reached some consensus in this regard; the key is to turn the vision into reality. Regardless of how global economic governance is reformed, it must adhere to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and ensure equality of rights, opportunities, and rules for all countries. ，，，、。，，，，，。，。，，，、、.

China will always focus on doing its own things well and resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests. At the same time, China's determination to promote high-level opening up will not change. ，、、，、、，。、、，。，、、。. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a very long feature article that says that as 2024 draws to a close -China's economy is entering a new and critical phase-, which will require critical decisions. It says that: -The road ahead is by no means smooth. Looking at the outside world, the international environment is more severe and complex, the global economic growth momentum is insufficient, and some countries continue to increase their containment and suppression of China. Looking inside, domestic effective demand is insufficient, economic performance shows divergences, there are still several risks and hidden dangers in key areas, and there are pains associated with the transition between old and new drivers of growth … At present, China is at a critical stage of accelerating the pace of transformation and upgrading, striving to advance high-quality development. It is at a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Critical periods require critical decisions. Facing various risks, challenges, and uncertainties, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has taken a comprehensive view and courageously taken on responsibilities, uniting and leading the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to tackle difficulties and forge ahead, steering the giant ship of China's economy fearlessly and bravely.- 。，，，。，，，，。-、，。-。，、，、。。，、，、，、. The first section of the article talks about the significance of the September 26 Politburo meeting. It says that the meeting sent -a strong signal to stabilize the overall economic development and continue the long-term positive trend.- It adds that -before and after this meeting, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the State Financial Regulatory Administration, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments released a package of incremental policies.- There's a detailing of some of the steps that have been announced since September. But the focus of this section is essentially Xi's leadership. The second section talks about the development of new quality productive forces. It says: -At present, the world is at a new stage where informatization fully drives innovation and serves as the foundation for reshaping a nation's core competitiveness. Whoever can better understand and grasp this trend, better adapt to and lead the direction of productivity development, will be able to comprehensively enhance their overall national strength.- ，、。，，. This section essentially reiterates the importance of transforming traditional industries, focussing on emerging industries, and building a modern industrial layout with a focus on technology, along with the agenda of green transformation. For instance, it says: -Green development is the underlying color of high-quality development, and the new quality of productivity itself is green productivity.- ，. The third section discusses the need to focus on livelihood issues. It acknowledges that: -At present, some local governments are facing financial difficulties, incidents of companies laying off workers and delaying wages are increasing, employment pressure is rising, and the task of improving people's well-being has become even more arduous and challenging.- ，，，，. The section also touches on the issues of demographics, food security, urbanisation, etc. The fourth and final section discusses opening up. The basic idea here is that reform and opening up is a -firm choice- that comes from the Party's and Xi's -scientific assessment-. At one point, the article also says: At present, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and transformations of the world, the times, and history are unfolding in unprecedented ways. A few countries are engaging in ‘decoupling and breaking chains' and building ‘small yards with high walls', while protectionism, unilateralism, and hegemonism continue to rise. The more we encounter countercurrents, the more we must actively embrace and promote economic globalization. At the crossroads of choices in this era, China consistently stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress.- ，，、、，----，、、。，。，，. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

The report says: -The meeting pointed out that, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the National Supervisory Commission, and discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels have deeply studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the state, they have continuously strengthened political oversight, vigorously promoted the rectification of conduct, discipline enforcement, and anti-corruption efforts, and solidly carried out education on Party discipline.

The supporting conditions and fundamental trends for long-term positive development have not changed.

Xi Jinping emphasised that doing a good job in economic work next year requires the joint efforts and hard work of the entire Party and all of society.

Difficulties and challenges are there every year, but we have always developed through trials and grown stronger through tests.

All parties should further focus on development, jointly foster a peaceful and stable development environment, advance the improvement of global governance, maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain, and cultivate new momentum for economic growth.- ，，，。，、。，，，，. He added that -China is a staunch defender of economic globalization and multilateralism. Over the long term, China's economy has continuously injected strong momentum into the global economy, increasingly demonstrating its distinct characteristics of development.- He then made three points with regard to China's economic policy going forward: First, there is an operating mechanism for stable growth, adhering to the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability and long-term planning. We will increase counter-cyclical adjustments, step up the implementation of macroeconomic policies, do everything possible to expand domestic demand and boost consumption, make greater efforts to solve outstanding problems, and promote the continued recovery of the economy. Second, there is incremental space for sustained growth, and new demands and new momentum will continue to form. We will further comprehensively deepen reforms, accelerate the construction of a unified national market, focus on promoting scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and continuously enhance the endogenous driving force of the economy. Third, there are positive spillover effects, and we will always share development opportunities with the world. We will unwaveringly promote high-standard opening up, introduce more self-initiated and unilateral opening policies,expand a global network of high-standard free trade zones, and continue to create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. Li added: -China is willing to work with all parties to safeguard the basic norms of international relations and the multilateral trading system. China supports international economic organizations in playing an important role in global governance and will actively assume international obligations that match its own capabilities to jointly promote the healthy and stable development of the world economy.- ，、。，，。，、。，，、，，。，、。，，，。，。，，，、、。，，。，。，，.

For the global economy, as Chinese enterprises ‘go global', their products, technologies, business models, and management expertise promote connectivity in trade, economics, and other fields. This helps stabilise global supply chains and inject new vitality into the world economy. The ‘going global' of Chinese enterprises makes the Chinese economy more closely interconnected with the global economy.- ，，、，，。，--，、、，，，。--，.

This bit is interesting: -At present, China is more actively connecting with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and steadily expanding institutional opening up such as rules, regulations, management, and standards. This requires Chinese companies to not only focus on building hard power, such as high-quality products and projects, but also to be more familiar with and master international common rules, respect the laws and regulations of the host country, strengthen compliance awareness, brand awareness, and corporate management, and lay a solid foundation for sustainable development.- ，，、、、。，、，、、，.
