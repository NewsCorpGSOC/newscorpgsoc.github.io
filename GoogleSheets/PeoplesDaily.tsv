Previewing the FOCAC MeetingToday's paper has a lot of preview articles related to the FOCAC summit. The lead article is a piece titled Xi Jinping's stories with African friends 习近平同非洲朋友的故事. The article calls the FOCAC summit -not only a grand event for China and Africa, but also a significant event for the ‘Global South' and the entire international community.- 这不仅是中国同非洲的一件盛事，也是-全球南方-和整个国际社会的一件盛事. The piece informs that since 2013, President Xi Jinping has visited the African continent 5 times, hosted the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit twice, and met frequently with African leaders at home and abroad.

These efforts have led to an average increase of 30% to 60% in local crop yields, benefiting over 1 million small-scale African farmers. The 'grain bags' and 'vegetable baskets' of the African people have become more abundant, and agricultural modernization is gradually becoming a reality. 截至2023年底的10年间，中国在非洲建成24个农业技术示范中心，推广300多项先进农业技术，带动当地农作物平均增产30%至60%，惠及100多万非洲小农户。非洲人民的‘粮袋子'和‘菜篮子'丰富了，农业现代化正逐步成为现实.

Faced with a new round of global scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, China and Africa are increasingly communicating in the fields of new technology, new energy and emerging industries, bringing new opportunities for cultivating modern industrial talents and promoting sustainable development.- -中国作为全球最大的发展中国家，最了解非洲国家的处境和面临的挑战，急非洲之所急，解非洲之所难。-这是很多非洲人的共同感受。面对全球新一轮科技革命和产业变革，中非在新科技、新能源和新兴产业领域的交流日益密切，为培养现代工业人才、促进可持续发展带来新机遇. -In the 1960s, Senegal's founding president and poet, Léopold Sédar Senghor, proposed the idea of building a Museum of Black Civilizations. He actively advocated for the ‘spirit of black tradition' and promoted African traditional culture and values. Over 50 years later, Senghor's dream finally became a reality. In December 2018, the Museum of Black Civilizations, built with China's assistance, officially opened in Senegal.

It has not only been beneficial for Africans directly, but also indirectly led to other actors focussing on Africa China's economic engagement in African countries is creating value and opportunities for African people and businesses. Both sides are also identifying and investing in new drivers of growth Xi Jinping is deeply, personally invested in deepening China-Africa engagement Deepening China-Africa engagement represents the rise of the Global South, and not just in a material sense but also in a sense of civilisational distinctness Increasingly, African countries are being inspired by and are learning from China's economic and political experience Share Tracking People's Daily On Page 6, there's an article by Wang Yi, previewing the FOCAC summit. Wang says that the forum will -draw up a new blueprint for the common development of China-Africa relations and write a new chapter of unity and cooperation in the ‘Global South'.- He calls it the most important diplomatic event being held domestically. In the first section, Wang recalls a bit of history. He then talks about FOCAC being established in 2000, adding that: Share Tracking People's Daily In the second section, Wang makes five points. First, he talks about how Xi has been personally engaged in promoting China-Africa relations. -Guiding the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future through head-of-state diplomacy. Since becoming President, Xi Jinping has visited Africa five times, presided over two Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summits, as well as the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 and the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue, among others. He has also welcomed numerous African leaders to China. Through high-level exchanges with ‘visiting relatives' and ‘family portraits', China-Africa relations have entered a new era. During his visit to Africa, at the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2015, President Xi Jinping repeatedly emphasised that China and Africa have always been a community with a shared future. In 2018, at the FOCAC summit in Beijing, President Xi Jinping proposed to build a China-Africa community with a shared future that features ‘joint responsibility, win-win cooperation, delivers happiness for all, enjoys cultural prosperity, enjoys common security, and promotes harmony between man and nature'. The leaders of China and Africa unanimously agreed to work together to build a closer China-Africa community with a shared future.- 以元首外交引领中非命运共同体建设。习近平主席就任国家主席以来已五次访问非洲，主持召开两次中非合作论坛峰会以及中非团结抗疫特别峰会、中非领导人对话会等，还接待了众多非洲领导人来华访问。通过-走亲戚式--全家福式-的高层交往，引领中非关系迈入新时代。习近平主席访问非洲期间以及在2015年中非合作论坛约翰内斯堡峰会上，多次强调中非从来都是命运共同体。2018年，习近平主席在中非合作论坛北京峰会上提出构建-责任共担、合作共赢、幸福共享、文化共兴、安全共筑、和谐共生-的中非命运共同体，中非领导人一致同意携手构建更加紧密的中非命运共同体. -African leaders have publicly praised the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind on bilateral and multilateral occasions, and African countries have voted enthusiastically to include this concept in the UN General Assembly resolution.- 非洲领导人在双多边场合纷纷公开赞赏构建人类命运共同体理念，非洲国家踊跃投票支持将这一理念写入联大决议. Second, he argues that seeking development and cooperation is the common pursuit of China and African countries. Under this, he mentions the linking of BRI with the AU's Agenda 2063. He also mentions the ‘10 Cooperation Plans,' ‘8 Major Initiatives,' and ‘9 Projects' under FOCAC. Wang adds: -Africa is the first continent to collectively welcome and support the Global Development Initiative, with 33 countries joining the Friends of GDI group, accounting for over 40% globally. Africa is a demonstration region for the high-quality joint construction of BRI and the implementation of GDI, and has become the most proactive and enthusiastic region in the world in responding to China's major initiatives and proposals.- 非洲是首个整体欢迎和支持全球发展倡议的大洲，33国加入倡议之友小组，全球占比超过40%。非洲是高质量共建-一带一路-、落实全球发展倡议的示范区，已成为当今世界响应中方重大倡议主张最主动、最积极的方向. He also references Chinese investments and projects in Africa. Subscribe now Third, cooperation between the two sides in international affairs. Wang writes: -China is the largest developing country, and Africa is the continent with the highest concentration of developing countries. China and Africa share similar historical memories and shoulder common historical responsibilities. These have fostered a sincere friendship of good friends, good brothers and good partners. The two sides have closely cooperated in international and regional affairs, and have firmly trusted and supported each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns.- 中国是最大的发展中国家，非洲是发展中国家最集中的大陆，中非拥有相似的历史记忆，承担着共同的历史责任，孕育出好朋友、好兄弟、好伙伴的真挚情谊。双方在国际和地区事务中密切配合，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上坚定相互信赖支持. Subscribe now Fourth, peace and security cooperation. Wang writes that the -global political and security situation is becoming increasingly complex.- -Only by adhering to the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can we embark on a path of universal security. In April 2022, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Security Initiative. Adhering to the core principles of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, paying attention to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and resolving differences and disputes between countries in a peaceful manner, these core principles are consistent with Africa's principles of solving African problems in an African way, playing a leading role in regional peace and security affairs, and promoting the ‘silencing of guns in Africa', which has received support and praise from many African countries. 随着百年变局加速演进，全球政治安全形势更加错综复杂。只有坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，才能走出一条普遍安全之路。2022年4月，习近平主席提出了全球安全倡议。坚持尊重各国主权、领土完整，坚持重视各国合理安全关切，坚持以和平方式解决国家间的分歧和争端等核心要义，同非方坚持以非洲方式解决非洲问题、坚持在地区和平安全事务中发挥主导作用、推动-消弭非洲枪声-等理念相融相通，得到众多非洲国家的支持和赞誉. China is not only the proposer of GSI, but also an active implementer. China has constructively participated in African peace and security affairs, and actively promoted regional countries to engage in dialogue and cooperation on hot-spot issues such as in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes region. In response to hot-spot issues in the Horn of Africa, China proposed the ‘Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa', appointed a special envoy to mediate for the cause of regional peace and development, and successfully held two Horn of Africa Peace Conferences. In response to non-traditional security challenges such as food security, China has provided Chinese solutions for world food security governance and strengthened international exchanges and cooperation through multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS. We are concerned about the urgent needs of our African friends and have provided emergency food aid to Africa many times, meeting challenges together with practical actions.- 中国不仅是全球安全倡议的提出者，也是落实的行动派。中方建设性参与非洲和平安全事务，积极推动地区国家就萨赫勒、非洲之角、大湖地区等热点问题展开对话合作。针对非洲之角地区热点问题，中国提出-非洲之角和平发展构想-，任命特使为地区和平发展事业奔走斡旋，成功召开两届非洲之角和平会议。针对粮食安全等非传统安全挑战，中方通过联合国、二十国集团、金砖国家等多边机制，为世界粮食安全治理提供中国方案，加强国际交流合作。我们急非洲朋友之所急，多次向非洲提供人道主义紧急粮援，以实际行动共迎挑战.

No Party Spirit, No Membership - Breakdown of US NSA's China Visit & Beijing's Questions About VP Harris - India-China Talks - Xi Presses Reform Agend...	Instead of going page-by-page today, I'll go issue-by-issue, since that works better for today. Let's begin with a report on Xi Jinping presiding over the sixth meeting of the Central Committee for Comprehensively Deepening Reform on Thursday morning. Xi said that -further deepening reform is an advancement based on the comprehensive deepening of reform since the new era, and it has a solid foundation and favourable conditions.- 他强调，进一步全面深化改革是在新时代以来全面深化改革基础上推进的，具备坚实基础和有利条件. -We should make good use of the existing reform achievements and important experiences, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, keep pace with the times, be realistic and pragmatic, fully mobilise the enthusiasm of all parties, and do our best to organise and implement the reform tasks.- 要运用好已有的改革成果和重要经验，解放思想、实事求是、与时俱进、求真务实，充分调动各方面积极性，全力抓好改革任务的组织实施. The meeting approved: A guideline on upgrading pilot free trade zones Work Plan for the Implementation of Important Reform Measures from the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee by Relevant Departments of the Central and State Organs The report then praises the -landmark and leading institutional innovation achievements- of the 22 free trade pilot zones set up by the CPC Central Committee since the 18th Party Congress. It adds: Share Tracking People's Daily Next, let's look at the report on Xi Jinping meeting with US NSA Jake Sullivan. Xinhua says: As per Xinhua, Sullivan said that his talks with Wang Yi were -candid, substantive and constructive.- He added that: The US readout is very brief. It says: -The two sides discussed further implementation of the commitments President Biden and President Xi made at the November 2023 Woodside Summit, including on counternarcotics, military-to-military communications, and AI safety and risk. They also discussed cross-Strait issues, Russia's war against Ukraine, and the South China Sea. Both sides welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, including planning for a call between President Biden and President Xi in the coming weeks.- Share Tracking People's Daily While in Beijing, Sullivan also met with CMC vice chairman Zhang Youxia. Here is the Chinese reporting on the meeting: The US readout on this meeting says: Subscribe now There's also a press briefing that Sullivan did before leaving Beijing. Key points: -We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy.- -This was a true working visit. Over the course of 14 hours of meetings, we discussed progress and next steps on implementation of the Woodside commitments, including our work on counternarcotics and efforts to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs into the United States; military-to-military communications including an upcoming engagement between our theater commanders; as well as work towards another round of AI safety and risk talks. Among other issues of global concern, we discussed the recent efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.- -The United States will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security without unduly limiting trade or investment. We have continued concerns about China's unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices. We remain deeply concerned about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and its impact on both European and transatlantic security, not to mention on Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine…I also underscored the longstanding U.S. commitment to universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. In all of my meetings, I stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; emphasized the United States' commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; and I reaffirmed the United States' commitment to our Indo-Pacific allies including our concerns about destabilizing actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea.- Then we get to the questions. -I think the meeting with Vice Chairman Zhang was very important. There is no substitute for actually being able to sit across the table, not just with the Vice Chairman but with his whole team, and be able to hear from them their perspective on critical issues, and them be able to hear from us our perspective on those same issues, whether it's cross-Strait relations or the South China Sea or cyber issues. And being able to have that exchange, which is rare, I think allows us to clarify our intentions and our concerns and hear theirs, and try to use that in service of responsible management of the relationship going forward.- This bit is interesting, since it tells us that Beijing was clearly interested in understanding what a Harris presidency would mean for US-China ties. And that there were direct questions, it seems, to that effect. Q Thank you. From the Wall Street Journal. Just to follow up on the question about the U.S. election, I'm curious about what questions, if any, did the Chinese ask you about what a potential Harris administration would represent for U.S.-China relations. And connected to this, did you raise the issue specifically of potential election interference by China during your trip here today? Let me take a moment here and highlight this from a report today in SCMP on Harris' latest interview with CNN: Finally, I do recommend pondering over this paragraph. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also put out a detailed review of the visit. Director General Yang Tao of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs said that Sullivan-Wang conversations spanned six sessions, totaling more than 11 hours. They discussed the China-U.S. relations, sensitive issues and major international and regional hotspots. I am only going to highlight anything not covered above. First, the key to keeping the China-U.S. relations to the right direction lies in the guidance and stewardship of the two presidents; Second, the key to avoiding conflict and confrontation between China and the United States lies in abiding by the three joint communiques; Third, the key to smooth interactions between China and the United States lies in treating each other as equals; Fourth, the key to a steady and sustained China-U.S. relationship lies in cementing the popular foundation; Fifth, the key to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States lies in developing a right perception. These ‘five keys' will help the two sides chart a better future and find a right way for the two major countries to get along with each other.- -The two sides also agreed on a number of specific matters, including: to maintain high-level exchanges and communication at various levels; to continue cooperation in such areas as anti-narcotics, law enforcement, repatriation of illegal immigrants, and tackling climate change; to hold in due course a theater commander-level video call between the two militaries and the second round of intergovernmental dialogue on AI, among other institutionalized arrangements; and to maintain communication on international and regional hotspots including the Middle East, Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula. These new outcomes will help the two sides remove interference, overcome obstacles, and move toward the San Francisco vision, and jointly promote a healthy, stable and sustainable China-U.S. relationship.- On the South China Sea, he said: -Developing alliances and partnerships is something up to the United States itself, but it should not use it to hurt China's interests. The Philippines should keep its word, and the United States should also do things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.- The final bit on China-US ties today is a report confirming that on September 7, the China-US commercial and trade working group will hold its second vice-ministerial meeting in Tianjin. Share Tracking People's Daily The General Office of the Party Central Committee has issued new regulations outlining how underperforming and unqualified Party members should be dealt with. The document is called -Measures for the Organizational Handling of Unqualified Party Members of the Communist Party of China- 中国共产党不合格党员组织处置办法. The report on this says that the -formulation and implementation of these ‘Measures' are of great significance for implementing the strategy of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, building a Party member team with firm beliefs, political reliability, reasonable structure, high quality, strict discipline, and outstanding performance, and continuously enhancing the Party's vitality and vigor.- 《办法》的制定和实施，对于贯彻全面从严治党战略方针，建设信念坚定、政治可靠、结构合理、素质优良、纪律严明、作用突出的党员队伍，不断增强党的生机和活力，具有重要意义. The Measures have 27 articles, mainly covering four aspects: The overall requirements, concepts, methods, and principles of organisational handling of such cadres The applicable situations for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion are detailed, with detailed procedures and subsequent matters for handling The provisions for situations that can be exempted from handling, or where this can be done in a combined manner, and other policy requirements that should be grasped The work responsibilities, work disciplines, etc. for handling of such cases 《办法》共27条，主要包括4方面内容：一是对组织处置的总体要求、概念和方式、原则等作了规定；二是规定了限期改正、劝其退党和除名的适用情形，细化处置程序及后续事项；三是对可以不予处置的情形、合并处置等应把握的政策要求作出规定；四是规定了组织处置的工作责任、工作纪律等. If you are further interested, on Page 4, there's an interview with an official from the Central Organisation Department on these new regulations. The official informs that the draft measures were approved by the Politburo Standing Committee on May 21, 2024. I am only covering the question about the applicable circumstances under which someone gets taken to task for organizational handing under this document. The official says that the ‘Measures' discuss 15 scenarios for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion.

Data shows that since the 14th Five-Year Plan, the number of enterprises related to the wind energy industry and the solar energy industry has grown rapidly, with an average growth rate of 21.6% and 21.7% from 2021 to 2023, respectively. As of July 31, 2024, the number of enterprises related to energy-saving and environmental protection industries in China was close to 5 million, a year-on-year increase of 19.3%. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese government today issued a new White Paper, titled China's Energy Transition. My colleague Rakshith Shetty, who has been researching China's new energy policies, has provided me with a short summary of the key highlights from the document. The paper documents China's actions and achievements in transitioning to green and low-carbon energy over the past decade. It highlights that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, China's energy sector has entered a stage of high-quality development guided by President Xi Jinping's new energy security strategy. Below are key data and takeaways from the white paper: China's investment in energy transition reached USD 676 billion in 2023 Clean energy consumption increased from 15.5% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2023, while coal consumption dropped by 12.1 percentage points In 2023, clean energy accounted for 58.2% (1,700 GW) of the total installed power generation capacity (2,920 GW) and generated 39.7% (3,800 TWh) of the country's total electricity, up ~15 percentage points from 2013 Over the past decade, clean energy accounted for more than 50% of the increase in total electricity consumption China invested over RMB100 billion from the central budget to upgrade rural power grids, enabling nationwide electricity access by 2015 By 2023, clean energy heating in northern China approached 80%, and charging facilities for new energy vehicles increased from less than 100,000 in 2013 to almost 8.6 million Energy consumption per unit of GDP (energy intensity) decreased by more than 26% from 2013 to 2023 The number of coal-fired boilers and power plants decreased by more than 80% nationwide China collaborated with over 100 countries and regions on green energy projects In 2023, China's wind power and PV exports helped other countries reduce CO2 emissions by about 810 million tonnes The second chapter focuses on China's efforts to promote green energy consumption through energy conservation, efficiency improvements, and strengthening institutional constraints for carbon reduction. As part of its commitment to reducing energy intensity, China has introduced various energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies and industries. These initiatives have led to significant energy savings, equivalent to approximately 1.4 billion tonnes of standard coal, and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of about 3 billion tonnes. To further support these efforts, China has established a comprehensive framework of standards and regulations. By the end of 2023, the country had released 335 national standards on energy consumption limits and product energy efficiency. Moreover, the energy conservation service industry has experienced rapid growth, with its total output value exceeding RMB 500 billion in 2023, a twofold increase compared to 2013. These developments demonstrate China's dedication to promoting sustainable energy consumption and reducing its carbon footprint. The third chapter emphasises the importance of accelerating the development of non-fossil energy sources to pursue eco-environmental progress, promote green and low-carbon economic and social development, and achieve peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals. The fourth chapter highlights China's efforts to implement an innovation-driven development strategy in the energy sector. China is improving top-level design and overall plans to establish innovation as a primary driver in energy technology. It adopts an open competition mechanism for selecting the best candidates to undertake key energy technology projects and a multi-team research mechanism for finding the best pathways and achieving optimal results. China is applying supercritical and ultra-supercritical power generation and deep peak-shaving technologies in the coal-fired power industry to raise its environmental and energy efficiency indicators to world-leading standards. The fifth chapter explains the modernisation of energy governance in China. The country has focused on building a unified national market, removing barriers within the energy market, and facilitating smooth and efficient market operations. The monopoly held by power grid enterprises in the purchase and sale of electricity has been largely eliminated, and energy prices are now determined primarily through market forces. China has strengthened the coordination of fiscal, taxation, investment, financing, and other macroeconomic policies, reinforced market regulation, and improved its public services to ensure both efficiency and fairness in its energy transition. The chapter also highlights how China has established a comprehensive legal framework to support its energy transition, comprising the Energy Conservation Law, the Renewable Energy Law, and other relevant laws and regulations Finally, the last chapter highlights China's contributions to the global energy transition through its own advancements.

The section after this talks about cultivating ethics; this deals with political but also academic and social ethics. Few interestings bits are: Make the study and implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important expositions on education a compulsory course for teacher training and an important task for teacher education and training, so that teachers can grasp its profound connotation and achieve unity of knowledge and action. 把学习贯彻习近平总书记关于教育的重要论述作为教师培养的必修课，作为教师教育和培训的重要任务，使广大教师把握其深刻内涵、做到知行合一. It also calls for -zero tolerance for violations of teachers' ethics.- The section after this deals with improving the professional quality of teachers and optimising resource allocation. Section 5 deals with protecting teachers' rights and interests. This covers not just pay and other financial support, but also supporting them when it comes to criminal acts and reducing burdens so that they focus on core tasks.

Professor Wu Yushao from Fudan University was the expert speaker. Vice Premier Liu Guozhong, State Councilor Wang Xiaohong and State Councilor Shen Yiqin participated in discussions. Li Qiang eventually spoke. He said that population ageing will be a basic part of the Chinese national conditions for quite some time to come. It is necessary to understand this situation objectively and dialectically. It is necessary to attach great importance to the challenges brought by ageing, but also see that ageing contains new development opportunities, and the elderly population is also a valuable resource. It is necessary to act in accordance with the trends and take the initiative, enhance strategic foresight, and make forward-looking plans; combine coping with population aging with promoting economic and social development, strengthen service, financial and institutional guarantees, and cultivate new development momentum in actively coping with population ageing.- 李强在听取讲座和交流发言后指出，人口老龄化是今后较长一段时期我国的基本国情。要客观辩证看待老龄化发展新形势。既要高度重视老龄化带来的挑战，又要看到老龄化蕴藏着新的发展机遇，老龄人口也是宝贵的资源。要顺势而为、主动作为，增强战略预判、做好前瞻部署，将应对人口老龄化和促进经济社会发展相结合，加强服务、资金和制度保障，在积极应对人口老龄化中培育发展新动能.

ECNS reports: -This marks an important step in the demonstration flight of ARJ21 aircraft around Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Launched on Aug. 21, the demo flight will exceed one month and encompass several high-plateau airports in Xizang, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu. This move aims to fully demonstrate the adaptability of ARJ21 aircraft to high-plateau airports and high-plateau routes, of airport ground service equipment and of special flight procedures, so as to better and more comprehensively meet the requirements of high-altitude operation. Daocheng Yading Airport in Sichuan Province, located at 4,411 meters above sea level, is known as the world's highest-altitude civilian airport. In July 2020, the ARJ21 aircraft completed maximum take-off and landing altitude tests locally. These tests verified that the ARJ21 is capable of serving all high-plateau airports, and paved the way for airlines to use the aircraft along more high-altitude routes, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), its developer. Plateau airports refer to those airports with an altitude of more than 1,500 meters above sea level. They include high-plateau airports that exceed 2,438 meters above sea level.- Page 2: There are two reports on Shanghai and Guangdong holding events to mark the 120th birth anniversary of Deng Xiaoping.

Han writes that -A scientific fiscal and taxation system is the institutional guarantee for optimising resource allocation, maintaining market unity, promoting social equity, and realising long-term peace and stability of the country. Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems is of great significance to comprehensively promoting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality development- 科学的财税体制是优化资源配置、维护市场统一、促进社会公平、实现国家长治久安的制度保障，深化财税体制改革对于以高质量发展全面推进中国式现代化意义重大. In the first section, Han largely talks about why fiscal and taxation system reform is needed. He argues: The fiscal and taxation system is an important basic system that affects the allocation of resources, and fiscal policy is an important tool for macro-control. We must adapt to the changes in the principal contradiction of our society, accelerate the improvement of fiscal and taxation systems and mechanisms that are conducive to high-quality development, address the prominent issues that hinder the establishment of a new development pattern and the promotion of high-quality development, stimulate the vitality of various business entities, shape new development momentum and advantages, and create social wealth and material foundation that match the modernization level of more than 1.4 billion people. 财税体制是影响资源配置的重要基础制度，财政政策是宏观调控的重要工具。必须适应我国社会主要矛盾变化，加快完善有利于高质量发展的财税体制机制，破除构建新发展格局、推动高质量发展面临的突出问题，激发各类经营主体活力，塑造发展新动能新优势，创造出与14亿多人口现代化水平相匹配的社会财富和物质基础. Finance is the foundation and important pillar of national governance, and the fiscal and taxation system is an important part of the high-level socialist market economic system. We must adapt to the requirements of advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, strengthen our foundations, leverage our advantages, address weaknesses, and bolster areas of deficiency. Focus on building a unified national market, improve the macroeconomic governance system, accelerate the enhancement of the tax system and fiscal mechanisms, and strengthen coordination with other reforms, fully implement the requirements of modern budget management, and better transform China's institutional advantages into national governance effectiveness. 财政是国家治理的基础和重要支柱，财税体制是高水平社会主义市场经济体制的重要组成部分。必须适应推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化的要求，固根基、扬优势，补短板、强弱项，围绕构建全国统一大市场、健全宏观经济治理体系，加快完善税收制度和财政体制，加强与其他改革协同配套，全面落实现代预算管理要求，把我国制度优势更好转化为国家治理效能. Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation system is an objective requirement for promoting Chinese-style modernization… At present, the urban-rural, regional development and income distribution gaps in China are still prominent. The per capita resource availability is low, and the ecological environment is under significant pressure, while the external environment for development is becoming increasingly severe. It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the fiscal and taxation system and mechanism to promote shared development, expanding the ‘cake' while also dividing it better, promoting coordinated development between urban and rural areas, enhancing public welfare, and advancing common prosperity.

Politburo Meeting - China-Philippine Vessel Collision - Wang-Sullivan Meeting Preview - India Okays Chinese Investments	Hi folks, Instead of covering reports from the paper today — a lot of which I did not find interesting — I am highlighting some key stories over the past few days. First, there was a Politburo meeting on Friday. This was covered in the paper on Saturday. Xinhua has a detailed report on this. It says: The meeting reviewed -policies and measures to open up a new vista in the large-scale development of China's western region.- The report adds that -some other issues- were also discussed at the meeting. Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there's a preview of the upcoming visit by Jake Sullivan from August 27 to 29. The briefing provided by MoFA outlines the following points: -Since the Xi-Biden meeting in San Francisco in November 2022, -Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication. The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the U.S. President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan.- The official adds: On the Ukraine war, the official said: -The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.- On the South China Sea, the official said: -China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.- On the Middle East issue, he called for the US to adopt a -responsible position-. The official ended by saying that -China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the U.N.-Centered international system and international order-. Let's also look at the press briefing by the White House before the visit. Some key points: Each time the two (Sullivan and Wang) have met, they have typically spent about 10 to 12 hours over two days covering bilateral issues, global regional issues, and cross-Strait issues. We expect to follow the same format in Beijing next week…As I mentioned earlier, I expect these meetings will cover roughly the same format as we have in previous rounds, discussing key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship and advancing counternarcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, and AI safety and risk discussions — all outcomes of the Woodside summit. I expect we will also spend some time on areas of difference, as we always do. Mr. Sullivan will raise U.S. concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base, the South China Sea, and various other issues. I expect the two will also exchange views on other global issues, like DPRK, Middle East, and Burma. And I expect they will also discuss cross-Strait issues.- The official talked about pressing Beijing on theater command-level communications and -ensuring the resilience- of military-to-military communications. On counternarcotics, the official said that -we've seen some good action in that space over the last couple of months, including the scheduling for the first time in quite some time of three fentanyl precursors. But there's always more we can do.- On Biden's China policy: -I think what has been so successful in this administration is our China policy is not about changing China at its core, right? It's about positioning the United States to make the investments, build the alliances we need to succeed and grow stronger. And that really is the focus here. Part of that, then, is also ensuring we've got open channels of communication and high-level diplomacy to manage the risks of competition.- Finally, do note that on Friday, the US tightened its export controls to -further restrict the supply of both U.S.-origin and ‘U.S. branded' items to Russia and Belarus for the Kremlin's illegal war on Ukraine.- A total of 123 entities were added to the list, including 42 located in China, 63 from Russia and 14 in Türkiye, Iran, and Cyprus. Beijing reacted angrily -The move is a typical act of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction … It undermines the international trade order and rules, impedes normal international economic and trade exchanges, and affects the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains … The U.S. side should immediately stop its wrong actions, said the spokesperson, adding that China will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.- Subscribe now Third, SCMP reports that a PLA delegation led by Ground Force Commander Li Qiaoming arrived in Moscow for talks on Thursday, as Chinese Premier Li Qiang left for Belarus. -According to a Russian defence ministry statement cited by state news agency Sputnik: ‘A protocol meeting was held between the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Colonel General Alexander Fomin, and the Commander of the Ground Forces of the People's Liberation Army of China, Colonel General Li Qiaoming.' Li Qiaoming was in Moscow on a working visit at the invitation of commander-in-chief of the Russian ground forces, Army General Oleg Salyukov, the statement added. Sputnik News said the two sides discussed topical issues of mutual interest on military cooperation, but did not elaborate. There has so far been no official announcement from the Chinese side about the visit.- Leave a comment Fourth, there's an interesting report in Caixin that Chinese banks have committed 1.4 trillion yuan ($196 billion) in loans to support a total of 5,391 projects, which have been selected by local authorities under the whitelist system. The report says: Share Tracking People's Daily Fifth, the Economic Times has an interesting report on the Indian government green-lighting some Chinese investments. The report says: The report says that this shift has come amid pressure from the industry. As per the report, the electronics industry told the government that the blocking of Chinese investment -cost local manufacturers $15 billion in production losses as well as 100,000 jobs in the past four years.- -In submissions to various ministries, the electronics manufacturing industry had also said that India had lost out on export opportunities worth $10 billion as well as $2 billion in value addition.- It adds: -Last month, ET reported that the government told industry it planned an inter-ministerial panel to expedite the approval of investment proposals by Chinese firms to operate in India or tie up with Indian companies if they meet certain criteria. That plan has been implemented and two rounds of meetings have been held… ‘The inter-ministerial panel is meeting every six-seven weeks to take stock of the situation and grant approvals after doing thorough checks,' an official said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Sixth, there was another collision between a Chinese and Philippine vessel in the South China Sea.

Xi Defines Deng's Legacy - Li Qiang's Belarus Visit - China-Bhutan Boundary Talks - Guideline on Improving Market Access System - The Curious Case of ...	Page 1: Today's front page is largely dedicated to a report on Xi Jinping's remarks at the event marking Deng Xiaoping's 120th birth anniversary. Xi said that Deng was -an outstanding leader with high prestige, who was recognized by the entire Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups across the nation. Deng was a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat. He was a time-tested communist fighter, the core of the Party's second generation central leadership, the chief architect of China's socialist reform and opening up and modernization construction, the pioneer of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the primary founder of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and a great internationalist who made significant contributions to world peace and development. His outstanding contributions to the Party, the people, the country, the nation, and the world have left an indelible mark in history, inspiring future generations.- 他强调，邓小平同志是全党全军全国各族人民公认的享有崇高威望的卓越领导人，伟大的马克思主义者，伟大的无产阶级革命家、政治家、军事家、外交家，久经考验的共产主义战士，党的第二代中央领导集体的核心，中国社会主义改革开放和现代化建设的总设计师，中国特色社会主义道路的开创者，邓小平理论的主要创立者，为世界和平和发展作出重大贡献的伟大国际主义者。他对党、对人民、对国家、对民族、对世界作出了突出贡献，功勋彪炳史册、永励后人. The report adds that in his speech, Xi lauded the -outstanding contributions to the cause of national independence and people's liberation led by the Party and the establishment of New China, and carried out fruitful work for the establishment of the socialist system and socialist development. After the end of the ‘Cultural Revolution', as the core of the Party's second-generation central leadership, he led the Party and the people in achieving a great historical turning point, promoted a new leap in the sinicization of Marxism, opened up a new phase of socialist modernization, established the correct path for achieving the complete reunification of the motherland, firmly defended the glorious banner of socialism, and successfully pioneered socialism with Chinese characteristics.- 习近平在讲话中指出，邓小平同志的一生，是光辉的一生、战斗的一生、伟大的一生。他为党领导的民族独立和人民解放事业、建立新中国作出卓越贡献，为社会主义制度建立和社会主义建设开展了卓有成效的工作。-文化大革命-结束后，他作为党的第二代中央领导集体的核心，带领党和人民实现了伟大历史转折，推动实现了马克思主义中国化新的飞跃，开辟了社会主义现代化建设新局面，确立了实现祖国完全统一的正确路径，坚定捍卫了光辉的社会主义旗帜，成功开创中国特色社会主义. ‘Xi Jinping emphasised that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical achievements are comprehensive and pioneering, and their impact on China and the world is profound and long-term. His lifelong struggle fully demonstrated a lofty character of unshakable faith in the ideals of communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics, his great love for the people, his theoretical quality of always adhering to seeking truth from facts, his political courage to constantly pioneering and innovating, his far-sighted strategic thinking, and his broad-minded and selfless character. We will always remember his great historical achievements, and we will forever admire his noble revolutionary spirit.- 习近平强调，邓小平同志的历史功勋是全方位的、开创性的，对中国和世界的影响是深刻的、长远的。他一生的奋斗历程，充分展现了对共产主义远大理想和中国特色社会主义信念无比坚定的崇高品格、对人民无比热爱的伟大情怀、始终坚持实事求是的理论品质、不断开拓创新的政治勇气、高瞻远瞩的战略思维、坦荡无私的博大胸襟。他的伟大历史功勋，我们永远铭记；他的崇高革命风范，我们永远敬仰. -Xi Jinping emphasised that China is a strong force for maintaining world peace.

We should champion the common values of all humanity, implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system, and continuously offer new opportunities to the world through the new progress of Chinese-style modernization.- 习近平强调，中国是维护世界和平的坚定力量。我们要始终高举和平、发展、合作、共赢旗帜，推动构建人类命运共同体，弘扬全人类共同价值，落实全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，积极参与全球治理体系改革和建设，不断以中国式现代化新进展为世界提供新机遇. Share Tracking People's Daily Cai Qi then spoke, praising Xi's speech about Deng. He termed it -insightful and profound, with strong political, ideological and guiding significance-, while calling on everyone to study it. Among the others who spoke at the event were: Qu Qingshan, head of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Miao Hua, member of the CMC and Director of the Political Work Department of the CMC Wang Xiaohui, Party Secretary of Sichuan Province The full text of Xi's speech is available on Page 2. There is a lot of history that Xi covers in the speech. I am sharing below some key excerpts along with my takeaway:- -In the spring and summer of 1989, amid the backdrop of the Soviet Union's dissolution and dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, China experienced a severe political turmoil. At this critical moment, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the Party and the people in firmly opposing the chaos, resolutely defending the socialist state power, and ensuring that the Party and the country withstood a severe test of turbulent storms. Subsequently, he deeply reflected on the lessons learned during the process of reform and opening up, emphasising the need to focus on strengthening Party building, enhancing ideological and political work and education on fine traditions, improve the Party's leadership level and governing ability, and ensure the stability of the red country.- 邓小平同志坚定捍卫了光辉的社会主义旗帜。在改革开放进程中，他始终旗帜鲜明反对搞资产阶级自由化。在苏联解体、东欧剧变大背景下，1989年春夏之交我国发生严重政治风波。危急时刻，邓小平同志领导党和人民旗帜鲜明反对动乱，坚决捍卫社会主义国家政权，使党和国家经受住了险风恶浪的严峻考验。之后，他深刻总结改革开放进程中的经验教训，强调要聚精会神抓党的建设，加强思想政治工作和优良传统教育，使党的领导水平和执政能力得到提高，确保了红色江山稳固. Subscribe now Also check out this paragraph from Xi's speech: In the new era and on the new journey, we must continue to deeply study and apply Deng Xiaoping Theory, fully and accurately understanding its scientific essence and core essence. For example, Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the Party's basic line should guide us for a hundred years, and that it is necessary to unify around adhering to the economic construction as the center, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhere to reform and opening up throughout the entire process of socialist modernization. Emancipating the mind means seeking truth from facts, aligning thoughts with reality, and ensuring that the subjective conforms to the objective. Both planning and markets are economic tools. As long as they contribute to the development of productive forces, they can be utilized. We must uphold independence and self-reliance; at the same time cannot close the door and be isolated or be blindly xenophobic/anti-foreign influence. Instead, we must implement opening up to the outside world. It is necessary to encourage some regions and individuals to become rich and prosperous first; let those who become rich first help others to become rich later, ultimately realizing common prosperity for all, without permitting polarization. We must adhere to the dual focus on material and spiritual civilization, ensuring both are strengthened. We should take bold and steady steps in pursuing reform, carefully managing the relationship between reform, development, and stability, with stability being the top priority. The key to successfully managing China's affairs lies in the Party, which must simultaneously promote reform and opening up while fighting corruption. These important thoughts and assessments are filled with materialist dialectics, reflecting a broad perspective and strategic vision. They grasp the main contradictions and key aspects of issues, highlighting the distinctive style and unique appeal of Deng Xiaoping Theory. Only by understanding these important ideas and conclusions within the historical background, focusing on an overall and dialectical understanding, knowing both the meaning and the reasoning behind it, understanding not only what is true but also why it is true, can one correctly apply them to guide practice. If we focus on one aspect at the expense of another or place too much emphasis on one while neglecting others, it can lead to deviations in practice, or even to principled and directional errors (原则性、方向性错误). Our Party has experienced such lessons in history, and we must learn from them deeply.- 新时代新征程，我们必须继续深入学习运用邓小平理论，完整、准确理解它的科学内涵、核心要义。比如，邓小平同志强调，党的基本路线要管一百年，要把坚持以经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放统一于社会主义现代化建设全过程；解放思想就是实事求是，使思想和实际相符合，使主观和客观相符合；深化党和国家领导制度改革，不是要改变社会主义制度、削弱党的领导，而是要更好彰显社会主义制度优势、加强和改善党的领导；民主集中制是最便利、最合理的制度，要大力发扬党内民主和人民民主，同时要有正确的集中，全党要有核心、党中央要有权威；计划和市场都是经济手段，只要对发展生产力有好处，就可以利用；要坚持独立自主、自力更生，同时不能闭关自守、盲目排外，要实行对外开放；要鼓励一部分地区、一部分人先富裕起来，以先富带后富，最终实现全体人民共同富裕，不能搞两极分化；要坚持物质文明和精神文明两手抓、两手都要硬；搞改革胆子要大、步子要稳，要处理好改革、发展、稳定的关系，稳定压倒一切；办好中国的事情关键在党，要一手抓改革开放，一手抓惩治腐败。这些重要思想和论断充满唯物辩证法，体现了全局视野和战略眼光，抓住了事物的主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，彰显了邓小平理论的鲜明风格和独特魅力。对这些重要思想和论断，只有结合历史背景，注重整体把握、辩证把握，知其义又明其理，知其然又知其所以然，才能正确用以指导实践。如果顾此失彼、畸轻畸重，就容易导致实践偏差，甚至犯原则性、方向性错误。历史上我们党有过这样的教训，我们一定要深刻汲取。 Finally, I'd like to highlight the paragraph on common prosperity.

This report is from a case in Guangzhou. Delivery driver Mo, who was riding on his electric bike, had an accident with a person named Hu, who was also driving an electric bike. The accident left Hu severely injured, with an open comminuted fracture of the right patella. Following a disagreement on compensation, Hu sued Mo and the delivery company. Hu Ziyuan, a judge of the Huangpu District People's Court of Guangzhou, assessed that the focus of the dispute is whether Mo was performing his duties when he was driving the electric vehicle at the time of the accident. If it is determined that the damage was caused in the course of Mo performing his duties, his employer shall bear the liability for compensation. The delivery company argued that Mo's last order was delivered at 12:06 pm. After this order was completed, he had no new order or delivery records on that day. Therefore, technically, this accident occurred during Mo's personal time, outside the scope of his duties, and therefore, it is unrelated to the company.	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/xi-defines-dengs-legacy-li-qiangs	2024-08-22T23:16:15-07:00

China-Fiji Ties - Xi's Messages on Reform Implementation - Former Greek FM on China's Democracy	Page 1: Before I get to the contents of the page, for those watching, Xi Jinping is back in public today, meeting with visiting Vietnam leader To Lam. Now, the top report today is about the publication of a new collection of documents, spanning a period from the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 till the second session of the 14th NPC in March 2024. Out of the total 75 pieces published, 33 are by Xi Jinping and 18 by other leaders. 19 of the pieces are being published for the first time The report says that this compilation serves as an -important textbook for the entire Party to deeply study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the major policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee-. Key contents of the book are highlighted on Page 2. Next, there's a report on Li Qiang meeting with visiting Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. Xinhua says: He added that -the vision of ‘Sea of Peace' aligns with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, sharing the same ideals and goals.- -和平之海-愿景同中方倡导的和平共处五项原则理念相通、目标相同... Subscribe now Next, there's an article talking about the third plenum resolution. This is interesting in the context of the praise that it heaps on Xi Jinping, insisting that the document has his imprimatur, and discusses implementation. The article tells us about how Xi has always proceeded with the spirit of nailing nails, and taken decisive action amid policy arguments around reforms related to deep-rooted challenges. Then we get this nugget about time. Also this bit about the spirit of nailing nails: To hammer in nails, the first thing is to fully understand the spirit of reform. ‘We must guard against empty reform slogans, prevent simple forwarding and copying of central documents, and avoid mechanical inspections and evaluations.' Rectifying formalism and reducing burdens on grassroots levels means tackling these stubborn issues. General Secretary Xi Jinping once noted the phenomenon of ‘overnight transmission,' but thorough study and understanding inevitably takes time. How can it be accomplished in one go, mistaking rapid transmission for effective implementation? A careful reading of the Decision shows that every reform measure is rooted in the profound Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This is the source of understanding the spirit of reform.- 如何钉钉子？《之江新语》一书有篇《抓落实如敲钉子》。文中，以-钉不到点上-，比喻-撒胡椒面-、浅尝辄止、朝三暮四；以-只钉一两下-或-钉个三四下-，阐明-要一抓到底，常抓不懈-的道理；再拿-敲钉子也不能光凭着一股蛮力，逢墙乱钉-，来讲述-抓落实还要结合实际，因地制宜-。钉到点上，首要的是把改革精神吃透。-要防止空喊改革口号，防止简单转发照搬中央文件，防止机械式督察检查考核。-整治形式主义、为基层减负，督办的就是这些顽瘴痼疾。习近平总书记曾注意到-传达不过夜-现象，学深悟透必定需要时间，又怎能一蹴而就，把传达迅速当作落实有力？细读《决定》，每一项改革举措，无不扎根于博大深邃的习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。这也是理解改革精神的源头活水. Later the piece talks about precision in methods, i.e., that steps taken should adapt to local conditions, and it talks about innovation. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, on the front page, is a report on the passing of Zhou Guangzhao, a renowned physicist and former president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was 95. As per China Daily, Zhou was a -pivotal figure in China's nuclear weapons program- He was -honored with the prestigious ‘Two Bombs, One Satellite' Meritorious Service Medal in 1999. Zhou made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including his discovery in 1960 of the partial conservation of axial current — one of the most important contributions to particle physics and the key to understanding the interactions of fundamental particles known as pions. His work was also instrumental in the research and development of China's first atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb and other nuclear weapons.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's an article by Georgios Katrougalos, former foreign minister of Greece, talking about China's -whole-process people's democracy-. He writes that: -Democracy is a common value of all mankind and a common pursuit of people of all countries. There is no single model for achieving democracy that is applicable to all countries.- 民主是全人类共同价值，是各国人民的共同追求。实现民主并不存在适用于所有国家的单一模式. China's whole-process people's democracy integrates democracy into all domains, aspects and links of the country's political life. Survey results in recent years show that the Chinese people have maintained a high level of satisfaction with their political system and government performance, which shows the success of China's relevant policies. 中国全过程人民民主将民主贯穿于国家政治生活的各领域、各方面、各环节。近年来的调查结果显示，中国民众对本国政治制度和政府表现保持较高满意度，这展现了中国有关政策的成功。 It is very important to fully apply the results of technological advancement to promote the development of democracy. The development of technologies such as the Internet, big data, and AI has enriched democratic practices, providing the government with more convenient ways to listen to the voice of the people. Reality also shows that without effective regulation, digital technologies can pose a threat to democratic development. China has a clear understanding of this and has introduced a series of laws and regulations, including the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law. 将科技发展成果充分应用于促进民主事业发展十分重要。互联网、大数据、人工智能等技术的发展丰富了民主实践，使得政府有更加便捷的途径倾听人民的声音。现实同样表明，如果没有有效监管，数字技术也可能对民主发展构成威胁。中国对此有清醒的认识，出台了网络安全法、数据安全法、个人信息保护法等一系列法律法规. -The spirit of democracy also requires respect for the sovereignty, independence and equality of all countries, and ensuring that all countries participate equally in global decision-making. At present, the climate crisis, regional conflicts, and growing inequality between countries are hindering global development and affecting the global democratic cause.- In this context, he praises GDI, GSI and GCI as -important for promoting democracy.- 民主精神同样要求尊重各国主权独立、平等，确保各国平等参与全球决策。当前，气候危机、地区冲突、国家间日益加剧的不平等等问题正在阻碍全球发展，也对全球民主事业造成影响。中国提出全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议等重要全球倡议，强调联合国在维护多边主义方面发挥的重要作用，倡导国际合作，推动不同文明在民主等问题上加强对话沟通、互学互鉴，这对于弘扬民主十分重要.

Breakdown of Wang Yi's Post-Plenum Article on China's Foreign Policy	Hi folks, In today's edition, I am only doing a full breakdown of Wang Yi's post-plenum article, which is published in the paper on Page 6. If you have been following official discourse on foreign affairs, directionally, there is nothing particularly new in the piece. But there are some useful takeaways: Share Tracking People's Daily In the first section, Wang clarifies that foreign policy must serve the goal of Chinese-style modernisation. He reiterates that -Chinese-style modernization is modernization that follows the path of peaceful development.- Within this context, he says that China has done the following since the 18th Party Congress: First, China's growing strength and its demonstration is to safeguard world peace and stability. -We adhere to a new development philosophy, build a new development pattern, and promote high-quality development; over 1.4 billion Chinese people are marching proudly towards modernization, driving the overall strength of developing countries to grow continuously and leading to the most significant and progressive shift in the global balance of power in modern history. We have written a new chapter in the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability, and have lifted nearly 100 million rural poor people out of poverty, accounting for over 70% of global poverty reduction; China's contribution to world economic growth has exceeded 30% for many consecutive years, which has effectively promoted the cause of global development. We have written the adherence to the path of peaceful development into the Party Constitution and the state Constitution, have proposed to promote the construction of a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation, and have taken a new path that is completely different from the rise of traditional powers. We have proposed the new security concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security and are the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. We have promoted the five nuclear powers to issue a joint statement on preventing nuclear war, explored and implemented solutions to hot-spot issues with Chinese characteristics, and achieved important results such as promoting reconciliation and resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A China that is committed to reform and innovation will continue to develop and grow, successfully overcoming the so-called ‘Thucydides Trap' and the ‘middle-income trap', and will further enhance the forces of world peace and international justice.- 为维护世界和平稳定彰显中国力量。习近平总书记指出：-改革开放这场中国的第二次革命，不仅深刻改变了中国，也深刻影响了世界-。我们贯彻新发展理念、构建新发展格局、推进高质量发展，14亿多中国人民昂首迈向现代化，带动发展中国家整体实力不断壮大，推动国际力量对比发生近代以来最具进步意义的重大变化。书写了经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹的新篇章，实现近1亿农村贫困人口全部脱贫，对世界减贫贡献率超过70%，对世界经济增长贡献率连续多年超过30%，有力推进了全球发展事业。我们把坚持走和平发展道路写入党章和宪法，提出推动构建相互尊重、公平正义、合作共赢的新型国际关系，走出了一条与传统大国崛起截然不同的新路。提出坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的新安全观，是安理会常任理事国中派遣维和人员最多的国家。推动五核国发表关于防止核战争的联合声明，探索并践行中国特色热点问题解决之道，取得促成沙特伊朗和解复交等重要成果。一个矢志改革创新的中国不断发展壮大，必将成功跨越所谓-修昔底德陷阱-、-中等收入陷阱-，必将进一步增强世界和平与国际正义的力量.

It has fully implemented the pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system for foreign investment, completely lifted restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, and significantly strengthened intellectual property protection. As a result, China's global ranking in the business environment has jumped from 96th to 31st, and the country's total volume of goods trade and foreign investment attraction ranks among the top in the world.
