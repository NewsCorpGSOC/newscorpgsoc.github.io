Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 06, 2024.

Li said that hosting the CIIE is an important measure for China to expand opening up and cooperation, representing China's solemn commitment to the world. If the first CIIE was a one-way invitation from China to the world, then each subsequent edition has become a mutual commitment between China and the world, reflecting the shared aspiration for opening up and cooperation. In today's world, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, the tide of anti-globalization is rising, unilateralism and protectionism are clearly on the rise, and the factors of instability and uncertainty facing the cause of global peace and development are increasing. The more the situation is like this, the more we must adhere to openness, expand openness, and enhance openness, to promote lasting peace, stability, development and prosperity. ，，。2018，，。，，。，，，、，、。，、、，、. Li then made three proposals: First, we should better build consensus on opening up while adhering to the principle of keeping our promises. All parties should jointly adhere to international economic and trade orders and rules and earnestly fulfil multilateral and bilateral economic and trade agreements. China will further expand institutional opening up and actively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, Li said, pledging efforts to implement the strategy for upgrading pilot free trade zones. Second, we should better expand the space for opening up while adhering to mutual benefit and win-win results. All parties should maintain a mindset of achieving success together, create new development space through closer market and resource connections, and adopt methods that are more conducive to innovative cooperation. China is willing to open up its enormous market further, including implementing the unilateral opening up and offering zero-tariff treatment for all tariff lines from the least developed countries and continuously hosting exhibitions such as the CIIE and the Canton Fair, so as to truly turn China's large market into a great opportunity for the world. Third, we should better shoulder the mission of opening up while adhering to the common destiny. China firmly safeguards the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and supports developing countries in sharing more benefits of globalisation. It is willing to continue to closely coordinate and cooperate with all parties in international economic organisations, take the lead in exploring the implementation of the WTO's ‘Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement' and other achievements, and work together to build an open world economy. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain sound, and the Chinese government is capable of promoting steady economic growth and contributing more to global development and the welfare of humanity. 。，。，，。。，，，。，，100%，、，。。，，，《》，。，，、.

It is hoped that all parties will jointly resist non-regional forces inciting confrontation in the area and take concrete actions to safeguard regional peace and stability. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a combined report on Li Qiang's meetings with the Prime Ministers of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at the sidelines of the CIIE. Xinhua's report on Li's meeting with Kazakh PM Olzhas Bektenov reports Li saying that: -China is ready to work with Kazakhstan to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other on issues concerning each other's core interests, continue to expand mutually beneficial cooperation and bring more benefits to the two peoples. Li pointed out that China is willing to strengthen the docking of development strategies with Kazakhstan, take high-quality Belt and Road cooperation as the guide, continue to expand bilateral trade, consolidate production capacity and investment cooperation, create highlights in energy and mineral cooperation, enhance the level of connectivity and push for more practical results. He called on the two countries to jointly work for the success of the Year of Chinese Tourism in Kazakhstan next year, strengthen cooperation in culture, education, sub-national and other fields, and enhance mutual understanding and amity between the two peoples. China stands ready to coordinate closely with Kazakhstan within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia mechanism, actively implement the three global initiatives, practice genuine multilateralism, safeguard economic globalization and free trade, and promote the development of global governance toward a more just and equitable direction, Li said.- Xinhua's report on the meeting with Uzbek PM Abdulla Aripov says that: -China will work with Uzbekistan to transform those common understandings into concrete actions and cooperation results so as to bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, Li said. China and Uzbekistan should always view their relations from a strategic, long-term perspective, provide firm mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and be trustworthy friends and partners, Li said. The two countries should further align their development strategies, expand economic and trade cooperation, strengthen connectivity infrastructure construction, and build the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway into a flagship project of the Belt and Road cooperation, he said. Li also stressed tapping into cooperation potential in emerging industries such as new energy, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, cross-border e-commerce, 5G and green mining. China stands ready to strengthen cooperation with Uzbekistan in areas such as culture, education, tourism and poverty reduction, and to facilitate the people-to-people exchange, Li said. The two countries should continue to strengthen their coordination and cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia Mechanism, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries and all other developing countries, he added.- Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology holding an event to discuss the pilot program to expand opening-up in value-added telecom services in four designated areas in Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan and Shenzhen. This was announced in late October. Xinhua had then reported that -the pilot program allows foreign investors to operate wholly-owned businesses such as internet data centers and engage in online data processing and transaction processing in the designated areas. They will also have greater access to China's cloud computing service and computing power service markets-. Page 6: There's a report on the CMC's Political Work Department beginning work to recruit university graduates. The report says that the direct selection and recruitment targets are mainly selected from among fresh science and engineering graduates engaged in ‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines. For specialties urgently needed and in shortage, candidates can also be selected in appropriate numbers from non-‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines, but must be from undergraduate programs that were admitted in the first batch of enrollment. At present, the goal is to have over 800 military (police) officer positions for open recruitment. Share Tracking People's Daily First, Xinhua reports that China on Monday appealed to the WTO against the EU's final ruling of countervailing measures on Chinese electric vehicles. China firmly opposes the final measures of the EU to impose high countervailing duties on Chinese-made EVs, despite a barrage of objections raised by relevant parties, including the governments of EU member states, the industry and the public, said the Ministry of Commerce. To safeguard the development interests of the EV industry and global cooperation on green transformation, China decided to make the appeal to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. The complaint followed China's previous appeal to the organization against the EU's initial anti-subsidy measures for Chinese EVs, according to the ministry. China believes that the EU's ruling, lacking factual and legal basis while violating WTO rules, is an abuse of trade remedy measures and a practice of trade protectionism in the name of countervailing, the ministry's spokesperson noted. China has urged the EU to face up to its own mistakes, immediately correct its illegal practices, and jointly safeguard the stability of the global EV industrial chain and supply chain as well as the overall China-EU economic and trade cooperation, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the EU's incoming trade chief Maros Sefcovic believes that China is the bloc's -most challenging trade partner-. Second, SCMP reports that -a historical drama about Chinese President Xi Jinping's late father, Xi Zhongxun, will be shown on state television from Tuesday – the first time his story has been dramatised for TV. The first episode of Time in the Northwest will make its debut during prime time on CCTV's main channel, according to a trailer aired on Sunday. The series spans 25 years of Xi Zhongxun's life – from 1927 to 1952 – across 40 episodes as he rises from the son of poor farmers in rural Shaanxi province to lead the Communist Party revolution in China's northwest, news website The Paper reported on Sunday. It said the series highlighted Xi Zhongxun's efforts to mobilise support for a revolutionary base in Yanan, Shaanxi, to address ethnic and religious issues in the region, and to drive economic development. The series is set against the backdrop of the failed First United Front – an alliance between the party and the Kuomintang – and the building of the party's revolutionary bases in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.- Third, China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, delivered an interesting speech at the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (MCCI) event in Kolkata recently. Some useful points from that are: Xu's summary of the Modi-Xi meeting: -The two sides reached a series of common understandings, including strengthening communication and cooperation, enhancing strategic mutual trust; holding talks between our foreign ministers and officials at various levels to bring the relationship back to sound and steady development at an early date; making good use of the Special Representatives mechanism on the China-India boundary question, ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas, and find a fair and reasonable settlement; strengthening communication and cooperation in multilateral fora to safeguard the common interests of developing countries.- -This year, the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in India have issued over two hundred and forty thousand visas (240,000 visas), 80% of which were business visas. This shows the vitality of economic and trade exchanges between the two countries.- -Chinese companies have made important contributions to local development and exports. Facts show that China-India commercial exchanges are inseparable. Indian media reported that some electronic, chemical, and renewable energy products still need to be imported from China. Imposing tariffs and restrictions on Chinese products is not conducive to the development of downstream industries and the interests of consumers in India. Indian companies need highly skilled workers from China to install equipment and carry out repairs. The Chief Economic Advisor of the Indian Government also called for more investment from China in the new ‘Economic Survey'.- -China is advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. India has also put forward the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047'. The two countries have the same development goals and broad prospects for cooperation. China wants to develop well for itself, and hopes India will develop well too. No country understands better than China what a great cause it is to enable more than 1.4 billion Indians to live a good life, and how much effort it requires. We would like to work with India to help each other succeed, achieve common development and revitalization, promote the unity and cooperation of the Global South, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- -This September, I met with Chairmen of some of India's leading companies during my visit to Gujarat and Maharashtra. These entrepreneurs have studied the policies proposed by the Third Plenary Session, and are even familiar with important concepts such as ‘new quality productive forces'. I believe that these entrepreneurs pay close attention to the latest developments in China because they think that China's policies will bring new development opportunities to all countries, including India.- Xu then made three proposals: First, he called for closer commercial ties. -India's high-quality products will have broad business opportunities in China. In fact, in Fiscal Year 2024, some products that the Indian industry promoted, such as pepper, iron ore, and cotton yarn have achieved an increase of more than 17%, 160%, and 240% in exports to China. China welcomes more Indian companies to make full use of platforms such as the China International Import Expo to help more Indian high-quality products to be exported to China and share China's development dividends.- (Note: It is worth highlighting that there is no comment from Xu on non-tariff barriers that the Indian side has complained about for a while.) Second, he talked about FDI. -Actively attracting FDI and effectively protecting the rights and interests of foreign enterprises are the reasons behind China's rapid development…By maintaining the stability and continuity of FDI policies, China continues to consolidate the confidence of foreign companies in China. The Third Plenary Session proposed that all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing industry be removed comprehensively, and foreign companies are encouraged to participate in the Chinese upstream and downstream supply chains. Indian companies can enhance ‘Make in India' by ‘investing in China'. At the same time, the industrial structures of China and India are highly complementary. India has a competitive edge in IT, software and biomedicine, while China is seeing rapid expansion in electronic manufacturing and emerging industries. India is in a major drive to improve infrastructure, an area where China has rich experience. Companies of both countries, if connected, will produce an effect of ‘1+1=11'. Such cooperation will help to sustain economic growth in both countries and inject new dynamism into the global economy. The business community hopes that India will lift its restrictions on investment and government procurement against neighboring countries, so as to promote common development of industries and benefit the people of the two nations.- (Note: This is a direct demand from the Chinese side for India to take back the investment scrutiny that began with Press Note 3 in April 2020.) Third, people-to-people engagement. Xu said that -as two large ancient civilizations with a population of over 1.4 billion, relaxing visa restrictions and restarting direct flights will have great significance. It will enhance people-to-people exchanges and bring the relationship between the two nations back to sound and steady development at an early date. In 2024, the number of Chinese outbound tourists is expected to reach one hundred and thirty million. India should not miss this opportunity. Furthermore, China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie industry. During my visit to Mumbai last month, I passed many Bollywood filming locations such as Bandra Fort and ‘Queen's Necklace'. The well-developed film industry in India left a deep impression on me. Indian films, including ‘Dangal' or Wrestling Competition, and ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan' are very popular in China. China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie sector and promote mutual understanding between the two peoples.- (Note: I support this recommendation. Easing visas and restarting direct flights is a no-brainer to me. When it comes to movies and entertainment, I think this is for Beijing to act upon, and I hope Xu will make the case at home. China imposes artificial barriers to limit foreign entertainment content; a lot of this is protectionism in the garb of political control. I agree with Amb. Xu, Beijing must allow for Indian movies, television, music, etc, greater access to the Chinese market.) In the meantime, if you are interested in how the patrolling agreement is shaping up, Rajat Pandit reports for the Times of India that the Indian -Army ‘successfully' undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday, after conducting similar patrols in Demchok last week.- With the first one done, the Indian side will be sending patrols to the four other PPs in the area now. The report adds that the -Army now has ‘unrestricted access' to the five PPs in Depsang and and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers.- The report adds: -The PLA, too, is conducting similar patrols with advance information to India to prevent the possibility of any clash.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Combining Top-Level Design & Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones - Discussing the Future of China's AI Governance - Li Qiang Calls for Supporting...	Hi folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend. I took a bit of a break late last week, celebrating Diwali. There were lots of colourful lights and much-needed sleep to enjoy. The wonderful thing about living in a multicultural, multi-faith society is that you have so many new year's within one year that you can always re-start and renew resolutions that didn't work out. So, here's wishing everyone reading this newsletter a happy and prosperous year ahead. Warmly, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, I want to cover a piece from Saturday. This one deals with Xi's engagement with officials at the provincial and ministerial level. It makes some really interesting points about the principles and boundaries of reform: The combination of top-level design and ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' is one of the distinctive characteristics of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era. On October 29, 100 days after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, at the opening session of a special seminar for provincial and ministerial-level leaders to study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, General Secretary Xi Jinping's remarks on ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' were thought-provoking. ‘Some people say, at this point in time, we're still -crossing the river by feeling the stones-. Isn't that conservative and timid? ‘Reforms that follow familiar paths are like swimming in a pool, where lines mark shallow and deep ends clearly. But in a turbulent river, don't we need to feel for stones to cross? It's not that, after decades of reform and opening up, we've already figured out every issue. If everything were clear, why would there still be a need for reform?' These words sound familiar. During his first local inspection after the 18th Party Congress in Guangdong, the General Secretary made it clear: ‘We cannot say that feeling the stones to cross the river was necessary in the early stages of reform and opening up, but now we can no longer mention feeling the stones to cross the river'. There are both key approaches for overall planning. In the new era of comprehensively deepening reform, an important reform methodology, which is also a major theoretical achievement we have made, is ‘combining top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones.' The combination of the two reflects the important principle of governance of seeking progress while maintaining stability and has multiple practical implications.- ，。，1029，，--。-，，，、？--，，，、。，？，。？-。，：-，-。，。，，，--。，，。 Later the piece adds: -Top-level design emphasises systematic thinking and overall strategy, while ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' emphasises daring to explore and experimentation at the grassroots level. ‘We must combine top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones' - this is an inherent requirement for further comprehensively deepening reform, and it is also an inevitable choice to enhance the systematic, holistic, and coordinated nature of reform, and to improve the cohesion, driving force, and implementation of reform.- 、，、。--，，、、，、、. The piece then stresses that during his remarks, Xi spoke about -- using both hands, adopting a dual strategy or doing two things in tandem. It adds: -The General Secretary profoundly pointed out: ‘For things we are confident about and have thought through carefully, we should implement top-level design; for things we are uncertain about and that are not yet mature, we should cross the river by feeling the stones - these two approaches should be used in tandem'. Reform is a journey of exploration full of unknowns. The coordination of ‘using both hands' contains the harmonisation of ‘knowing' and ‘doing'. For what is clearly understood, we must ‘commit to advancing resolutely'. For what is not so clearly understood yet still requires breakthroughs, we should neither stand still nor rush forward blindly. Over these years, a series of major reforms have formed replicable experiences through pilot exploration, which have then evolved into institutional achievements, and finally expanded to larger scales. Comprehensively deepening reform is thus about ‘accumulating small victories into big victories'.- Another phrase that the piece talks about is ‘establish first, then break' . Reform is a process of breaking the old and establishing the new. At this point in history, the prioritisation between breaking and establishing concerns not only the strategic planning of top-level design but also the orderly steps of crossing the river by feeling the stones. The General Secretary has a clear view: ‘To further comprehensively deepen reform, we must adhere to institutional building as the main line and emphasise the simultaneous approach of establishing and breaking, prioritising establishment before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, with in-depth risk assessments, and proper control of timing, extent, and effectiveness. What needs to be established should be proactively established, and it must be established firmly, sustainably, feasibly, and effectively; what needs to be broken should be broken in a timely manner, decisively, and thoroughly on the basis of what has been established, achieving steady and swift reform progress through the unity of breaking and establishing'. ，。--。、、、，。：-、，；、，，‘'。-。--，----。，--。-、-？，。，，，。，--。--。。，，，。：-，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，.- Subscribe now A couple of paragraphs towards the end are also interesting, since they set the boundaries for the reform agenda: -What should not be changed? The General Secretary pointed out: ‘Our fundamental political system, basic political system, and supporting systems are all very mature now. The People's Republic of China has been established for 75 years, the People's Congress for 70 years, and the Political Consultative Conference for 75 years - do they still need major reforms? Where would further reforms lead? We shouldn't reform just for the sake of reform, nor should we reform blindly'. What must not change? Take economic system reform for example. For example: on the issue of ‘letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation while better leveraging the role of government', General Secretary Xi Jinping recalled the lengthy discussion process during the preparation for the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, emphasising that ‘this important assertion is absolutely crucial.' Another example is the consistent adherence to and implementation of the ‘Two Unwaverings'. The General Secretary also responded to the concerns of those who try to distinguish the importance of the two: ‘There's no singling out, no one-sidedness; this has never wavered. We must be fair and just, maintain the balance, and not weigh one as more important than the other'. These things that cannot be casually changed or easily altered were also established through repeated experiences of exploration and were ultimately solidified through top-level design. The General Secretary made this assessment: ‘As the reform has progressed to this day, we already have a relatively clear big picture in terms of the top-level design of the reform'.- ？：-、。75，70、75，？？，。-？，，--，，，--。，--，。：-，，。，，。-、，，。：-，，.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 04, 2024. Page 1: There isn't a lot useful on the front page today. There's a report (English report) on Li Qiang's visit to Shanghai, where he discussed vocational education and skilled talent training. Li visited the Shanghai Nanhu Vocational &amp; Technical College. He said there -it is necessary to deepen the integration of industry and education as well as the cooperation between colleges and enterprises, optimize the setting of college disciplines and majors based on the needs of the society and industries' actual development and strengthen hands-on skill practice, adding that more skilled teachers are needed to innovate the models and methods of teaching.- Li added: -It is necessary to grasp the trend of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, aim at the forefront of science and technology and the world's first-class, cultivate more ‘high-tech, cutting-edge and scarce' skilled talents with strong theoretical foundations and practical capabilities to help achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening.- ，，、--，. Noting that there are ever-growing demands for elderly care, childcare and medical care, Li urged efforts to strengthen the training of skilled workers in the related fields. In addition, while visiting the WorldSkills Museum, Li said that -governments at all levels should continue to refine support policies for the cultivation of skilled workers by strengthening institutional innovation and investment. Efforts should also be made to improve the systems of development planning and services for skilled workers with a view to broadening their development channels and enhancing their incomes-. Subscribe now Also on the page is a long article previewing the 7th China International Import Expo. The article calls it a -major economic and diplomatic- event. One key point in the piece is: -Opening up is the inevitable path to world prosperity and development. Looking back at history, openness and inclusiveness lead to progress, while isolation and narrowness lead to obstacles. After the Cold War, economic globalisation developed rapidly, greatly promoting the flow of goods and capital, providing strong momentum for world economic development. In today's world of ‘you are in me, and I am in you', opening up and cooperation is the only choice. China's hosting of the Import Expo is a major initiative to proactively open its market to the world, and a practical action to promote the building of an open world economy and advocate inclusive economic globalisation. Only by gathering the power of cooperation through openness can we achieve great things, accomplish good things, and sustain long-term success, bringing a bright future for global development. Opening up is a distinctive marker of Chinese-style modernization. Major trading partners with more than 150 countries and regions, ranking first in total goods trade for 7 consecutive years, outward direct investment flow ranking among world's top three for 12 consecutive years…Since reform and opening up, China has forged a path of seeking common development through openness. The Import Expo is a vivid example that ‘the more China develops, the more it opens up', witnessing China's door of opening up growing ever wider. Only an open China can become a modernised China…- ，。，，。，，，。-、-，。，，、。，、、，。，。150，7，12……，。-，-，。，. Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report discussing China's energy mix. Some key data points: -In the first eight months, the investment in key energy projects was about 1.7 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.2%. Among these, investment in energy network infrastructure has been steadily released. Investment in 5 under-construction ultra-high voltage DC transmission projects across provinces and regions is accelerating, LNG receiving terminal investments in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Shandong are growing rapidly, and under-construction projects are quickly materializing into physical work progress. Non-fossil energy power generation investment is growing steadily. A batch of centralized wind power projects in Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Xinjiang are accelerating, while five newly approved nuclear power projects in Shandong Zhaoyuan, Jiangsu Xuwei, Zhejiang Sanao, Guangdong Lufeng, and Guangxi Bailong are gradually materializing into physical work progress. Investment in new energy business forms is expanding in multiple areas. In the first 8 months, completed investment in new energy storage increased by 21% year-on-year, while pumped storage completed investment increased by 45.5% year-on-year. A batch of multi-energy complementary clean energy base projects in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are progressing in an orderly manner, while Inner Mongolia's under-construction green hydrogen production projects and Henan's under-construction hydrogen facilities projects continue to form effective investment. The completed investment in key energy projects has maintained relatively rapid growth, further consolidating the foundation of energy supply security and injecting momentum into high-quality economic and social development. As of the end of September, the national total power generation installed capacity reached 3.16 billion kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 14.1%. Coal, oil, and gas production capacity has steadily improved, with crude oil and natural gas production increasing by 2% and 6.6% year-on-year in the first three quarters of this year. ，。5，、、、，。。、、、、，、、、、5。。8，21%，45.5%。、、，、。，，。9，31.6，14.1%。、，，、2%、6.6%. -In the first three quarters, China's new installed capacity of renewable energy power generation was 210 million kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 21%, accounting for 86% of the newly-installed capacity of electricity.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 9: The entire page is dedicated to views from academics as part of a roundtable discussing the establishment of -oversight systems to ensure the safety of AI- and improving the mechanisms for developing and managing generative AI, which were goals outlined in the resolution issued after the Third Plenum. First, Liu Yanhong from the China University of Political Science and Law argues that the development of generative AI can be classified into three stages: the preparatory stage involving pre-training and algorithm upgrades aided by human annotation the operational stage where input data is processed by algorithms to produce generated outputs, and the generative stage where the outputs are applied in society. Liu says that -We must understand the operational mechanisms of generative AI in depth, grasp the characteristics of the formation and development of security risks at each stage, and use legal means to strengthen systematic governance, ensuring that the immense power contained in generative AI always operates within the framework of the rule of law.- ，，，。，，，. She then outlines the key risks for each stage. For the first stage, Liu argues that the risks are primarily related to data security. At this stage, it is important to ensure -appropriate classification of data and the establishment of usage patterns and protection methods for different types of data to properly address relevant data security risks, avoiding illegal use or improper disclosure of data, which could lead to infringement disputes.- 、、。，，，，. Liu adds: -Legal rules for generative AI's acquisition and use of government data should be clarified to both meet society's needs for utilizing government data and strongly support the development, training, and application of AI government service large models to improve public service and social governance intelligence levels, while also regulating its processing methods to avoid results derived from government data harming individual rights or disrupting social public order.- ，，、，；，、. On personal data collection, She argues that -generative AI tends to over-collect personal data to improve conclusion accuracy, such as analyzing medical health data to mine personal whereabouts and predict personal life trajectories. Therefore, collection must adhere to law, collecting personal data within the minimum scope needed for technology, and setting reasonable data processing depths to avoid excessive mining of potential information.- ，，，、。，，，，. For the second stage, Liu highlights the -inherent risk of algorithmic bias.- Liu says: -To prevent and resolve algorithm bias risks, targeted governance should be conducted according to the principles and domains of algorithm bias formation. Legal regulatory requirements should be deeply embedded into the algorithmic models of generative AI, promoting technology for good, eliminating algorithmic bias, and ensuring reasonable use of generative AI algorithms and allocation of computing resources. Based on the concept of combining technology and management, strengthen full-cycle safety supervision of algorithms, implementing legal regulatory requirements throughout the entire process of generative AI operation. When setting algorithms, it is essential to adhere to relevant legal rules and technical standards, implement the regulatory requirements of ‘machine learning + human annotation', review the algorithm modules with risks, and better discover the technical risks within the generative AI algorithm models; when congenital algorithmic biases are discovered, corrections should be made from within the algorithm based on legal requirements, ensuring that the modified algorithm can operate normally; if problems occur afterwards, conduct source-tracing governance of AI algorithms, achieve precise attribution of responsibility and make corrections, promote the improvement of regulatory standards for generative AI algorithms, fill gaps in preliminary preventive review, and use both technical and legal means in parallel to equally emphasise development and management.- ，。，，，。，，。，-+-，，；，，；，，，，，. For the third stage, Liu writes that there are many risks from the risk of abuse to IPR risks, exacerbating information asymmetry, widening the digital divide, and damaging the interests of digitally disadvantaged groups. In terms of IPR risks, Liu argues that -substantial analyses of the technical models and principles of generative AI should be conducted according to the standards of intellectual property law. If human intervention is necessary to ensure that the generated outputs possess originality and innovation, intellectual property rights should be granted and ownership clearly defined, reinforcing the systematic protection of intellectual property rights in the field of generative AI. At the same time, it is necessary to reasonably determine the scope of protection for the intellectual property rights of generated outputs to avoid an unlimited expansion of the protection scope, which could hinder the promotion and application of generative AI and technological development.- ，、，，，，；，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Gu Liping from the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing Normal University discusses the importance of strengthening privacy protection in the era of artificial intelligence and ensuring personal information security. Gu argues that -the right to privacy faces severe challenges in the era of AI.- Gu elaborates the types of harms and challenges in the first bit before saying that: In terms of solutions, Gu stresses the -principle of informed consent-. He adds: -The principle of informed consent includes two aspects: knowledge and consent. Consent must be based on knowledge. Without sufficient knowledge and understanding, there can be no real consent. Information, understanding and voluntariness are the three elements of the principle of informed consent. On the basis of comprehensive ‘information', individuals can independently express their ‘consent'. This requires that when users use artificial intelligence, easy-to-understand and clear prompts and instructions should be made to obtain users' consent to the collection and use of personal information. If personal information will flow between different platforms, users need to be informed of the scope, target and use boundaries of the flow. For a good and smooth user experience, users can also be given the option of one-time or phased authorization. Users should be informed about the scope, methods, and purposes of personal information collection, as well as who their personal information will be shared with, and they should have the option to withdraw at any time. When conducting personal information analysis, users should be alerted via pop-ups or other forms and provide real-time authorization. Establishing a data lifecycle and timely deletion of personal information is also an effective way to protect the security of personal information.- ，，，。、，。--，--。，，。，、、。，。、，。，。、. The author also calls for -protect privacy rights and personal information security by improving database security, core data encryption, personal data anonymization and other technologies-. ，，、、，. Subscribe now The third and final write-up is by Professor Zhang Xin from the School of Law at the University of International Business and Economics. Zhang argues that for a variety of reasons, AI entities can cause -complex, dynamic and unforeseen risks.- Therefore, she calls for a -modular governance framework- for AI. -Such a framework must cover the entire industrial chain and various levels of endpoints, starting from key nodes such as data modules, algorithm modules, and model architectures, to design corresponding governance modules.- ，，、、，. Zhang later adds that -AI entities are deeply interactive, highly interconnected, and dynamically adaptable. Correspondingly, the governance approach should go beyond traditional individual-centered governance and promote the formation of a governance ecosystem characterized by extensive interconnectivity, multi-party participation, and multi-level collaboration. In this context, technical communities such as developers and operations and maintenance personnel will play a crucial ‘whistleblower' role in the governance of artificial intelligence entities. We should better leverage the supervisory advantages of technical communities and establish effective constraint mechanisms within artificial intelligence companies. Additionally, we should actively enhance the digital literacy of a wide range of users, raising their awareness of the lawful, safe, and responsible use of artificial intelligence entities, achieving positive interactions with these entities, and fostering an upward and virtuous operational state.- 、。，，、、。，、--。，。，、、，，.

Xi Calls to Strengthen Confidence in Reform Agenda - China-Finland Ties - New Inspections Target Propaganda & United Front Organisations - Made in Chi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, October 30, 2024. Page 1: Xi Jinping dominates the front page today. The main report is about Xi's remarks at the opening of the study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee for principal officials at the provincial and ministerial level. Xi called on them to -continue to deepen the study and implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenum, guide the entire Party and the people of the country to strengthen their confidence in reform, and better unite their hearts and minds to advance reform in a steady and sustained manner.- 、、，，，. As per the report, Xi said that: The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Party initiated a new era of comprehensively deepening reform and systematically designing and advancing reform on a new journey, creating a new situation for China's reform and opening up, which has been of epoch-making significance. Comprehensively deepening reform in the new era has achieved major practical, institutional and theoretical results, and is one of the most magnificent chapters in the history of China's reform and opening up. It has provided strong momentum and institutional guarantees for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and continuing to write the ‘two miracles', and has also provided a solid foundation and valuable experience for further comprehensively deepening reform on the new journey. ，、，，。、、，，、--，. He added that -maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation is a major principle that must be firmly grasped and consistently adhered to in further comprehensively deepening reform. Our reform has direction and principles. Adhering to the Party's comprehensive leadership, adhering to Marxism, adhering to socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, and taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and enhancement of people's well-being as the starting point and ultimate goal—these are all fundamental, directional, and long-term matters that reflect the Party's nature and purpose, conform to China's national conditions, and align with the fundamental interests of the people. These principles must remain unwavering, regardless of circumstances. We must stick to the general goal of continuing to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, always moving forward in the direction guided by the general goal, resolutely reforming what should be reformed and not reforming what should not be reformed. We must adapt to new trends in the times, new requirements of practice, and new expectations of the people, emphasise economic system reform as the focus, comprehensively and coordinately advance reforms in all areas, vigorously promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation and innovation in other aspects, to provide strong momentum and institutional guarantees for Chinese-style modernization.- ，、。、。、、、，、，、、，，，，。、，，，。、、，，，、、、，。 Xi Jinping pointed out that reform is a systematic project that requires scientific methods and proper handling of various relationships. We must adhere to the unity of reform and rule of law, using the force of reform to improve the rule of law, further deepen reform in the legal field, and continuously improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics; better utilise the positive role of the rule of law in eliminating resistance to reform and consolidating reform achievements, be good at using rule of law thinking and methods to advance reform, ensure major reforms have legal basis, and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of all citizens and legal persons. We must adhere to the dialectical unity of breaking and establishing, doing both simultaneously by establishing first and breaking later, proactively establishing what should be established, breaking what should be broken in a timely manner and on the basis of what's been established, and realise the steady pace of reform in the unity of breaking and establishing. We must adhere to the unity of reform and opening up, steadily expand institutional opening up, actively connect with international high-standard economic and trade rules, deepen the reform of the foreign trade, foreign investment and outbound investment management system, and create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, internationalised. We must properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation. The design of reform plans must grasp objective laws, pay attention to the coordination and supporting measures of various reform initiatives, enhance the consistency of reform orientation, establish and improve work mechanisms with clear responsibilities, complete chains, and interlocking links, strengthen tracking and effectiveness evaluation, and promote the thorough and precise implementation of reform measures.- ，，，。，，，；、，，，。，、，，，。，，，、，、、。，，，，、、，，. Xi Jinping stressed that leading cadres, especially senior cadres, should shoulder important responsibilities for promoting reform. We must strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge, we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development. We must be good at using scientific methods to promote reform, make systematic arrangements, and act after careful planning. Xi Jinping pointed out that broadly building consensus and fully mobilizing all positive factors is very important for smoothly advancing reform. We must effectively do a good job in guiding public opinion on reform, strengthen positive publicity, sing the main theme and transmit positive energy. We must strengthen the study and interpretation of some major theoretical viewpoints put forward in the ‘Decision' of the Plenary Session, especially strengthen publicity and interpretation for the grassroots and the masses, promptly resolve doubts and confusion, respond to social concerns, build consensus widely, and build a solid ideological foundation and mass foundation for the whole party and society to jointly grasp reform. Guide cadres and masses to strengthen their awareness of the bigger picture and correctly handle the adjustment of interest relationships and personal gains and losses in reform. Xi Jinping finally emphasised that all regions and departments should conscientiously implement a series of major measures determined by the Politburo meeting, fully implement all stock policies and incremental policies, take coordinated actions, effectively do a good job in various tasks in the last two months, and strive to achieve the economic and social development goals and tasks for the whole year. ，。、，、，，，，。，、。，、，。，，、。《》，、，，，，、。、，。，，，，，. Li Qiang then spoke underscoring the importance of Xi's speech and calling on truly everyone to -unify thoughts and actions with the spirit of the General Secretary's important speech and the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee, and creatively implement the reform tasks.- Share Tracking People's Daily On Page 2, there's a commentary discussing Xi's remarks. It says: -Reform and opening up is always ongoing, never completed. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made systematic arrangements for further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. The Central Committee organised this special seminar for provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres to further unify thinking and action, and to better implement the spirit of the plenary session. We must thoroughly study and understand the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, deeply grasp the guiding ideology, overall objectives, major principles, and scientific methods for further comprehensively deepening reform; strengthen our confidence in reform, maintain the correct direction of reform, reinforce reform responsibilities, and gather reform synergy. With unwavering courage and determination, we should work together to effectively implement the ‘Decision' of the plenary session. ，。、。，，。，、、、，、、、，，《》. It adds that in order to -strengthen confidence, unite efforts, and drive reform steadily forward, we must first correctly understand and grasp the historic achievements of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era.- 、，，. Then the article reiterates Xi's assessment of reform since the 18th Party Congress, which I have covered above. The article then adds: -The comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era was planned and advanced against the backdrop of China's reform entering a crucial phase and deep-water zone, marked by distinctive features such as broad scope, deep involvement of interests, great difficulty in tackling tough problems, and and having strong interconnectedness and linkages. Daring to advance into deep waters, daring to crack hard nuts, daring to traverse dangerous rapids, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united and led the whole Party and people of the country, with great historical initiative, enormous political courage, and strong sense of responsibility, to break through the constraints of ideological concepts, break through barriers of vested interests, resolutely eliminate of the drawbacks of various systems and mechanisms in all aspects, achieving a transformation of reform from localised exploration and breaking through ice to systematic integration and comprehensive deepening. The comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era is one of the most magnificent chapters in the historical process of China's reform and opening up; its great achievements are solid and can withstand the test of history and the people. This fully demonstrates that the Communist Party of China is a party with great reform and innovation spirit, and fully proves that the ‘Two Establishments' are of decisive significance for us in responding to various risks and challenges and advancing the construction of Chinese-style modernization. ，、、、。，，，，、、，，，，、、。，，。，--、. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era ‘also provides a solid foundation and valuable experience for further comprehensive deepening of reform in the new journey'. All great causes advance through continuous struggle, and perfecting the socialist system with Chinese characteristics is a dynamic process. Since the 18th Party Congress, our Party has timely summarized fresh experiences, continuously deepened its understanding of the laws of reform, and formed a series of new thoughts, new viewpoints, and new assertions from General Secretary Xi Jinping regarding comprehensively deepening reform, providing fundamental guidance for further comprehensively deepening reform. By emphasising institutional construction as the main thread, promoting the socialist system with Chinese characteristics to become more mature and well-defined, broadly consolidating the consensus that ‘reform and opening up is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves', we have formed an ideological foundation and mass foundation for the whole Party and society to jointly pursue reform. On the new journey, by adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as guidance, anchoring to the overall goal of further comprehensively deepening reform, making good use of valuable experience, and mobilising all positive factors, we will certainly be able to promote reform to advance steadily and far along the correct direction. ，--。，。，，，、、，。，，--，、。，，，，，. -Today's China has entered a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong nation and the great rejuvenation of the nation through Chinese-style modernization. It is in a situation where progress is becoming increasingly difficult and perilous, and where not advancing will lead to regression, making progress imperative. The more we move forward in the complex environment of turbulent clouds, the more we must strengthen our confidence and unite our hearts and efforts, demonstrating the spirit of ‘not shying away from the labour of reaching the summit', striving to open up new horizons for reform and development. and strive to open up new horizons for reform and development. We firmly believe that with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and with the whole Party and people of the country united in heart and determined to forge ahead, Chinese-style modernization will certainly open up broad prospects through reform and opening up.- ，、，、、。，、，--，。，，、，.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Finland have always existed in friendship, respected and trusted each other, and set an example of equal exchanges between countries that transcend historical, cultural and institutional differences. As the world is undergoing accelerated changes unseen in a century and the risks and challenges facing humanity are increasing, the future-oriented new-type cooperative partnership between China and Finland holds exceptional value and should be cherished and advanced. China is willing to work with Finland to strengthen strategic cooperation, carry forward friendly traditions, and further advance the new type of cooperative partnership between China and Finland for the future, so as to better benefit the two countries and their peoples and make new contributions to world peace and development.- ，，。，、，、、，。，，。，，。，，，，，.

He added that Finland -is willing to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with China next year, strengthen high-level exchanges, expand cultural exchanges, and deepen practical cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, green energy, and sustainable development.

China has repeatedly pointed out that the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs is irrational, fraught with numerous non-compliance issues, and is a protectionist move under the guise of ‘fair competition', said the spokesperson in a statement released on the ministry's website. China has already appealed to the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. Noting that the EU is still willing to continue talks on price commitments for Chinese-made EVs, the spokesperson said China always advocates the resolution of trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, and had made the utmost efforts to this end. Currently, technical teams from both sides are engaged in a new phase of consultations.

According to Mr. Amorim, the aim is to use some of the Belt and Road framework to find ‘synergy' between Brazilian infrastructure projects and the investment funds associated with the initiative, without necessarily formally joining the group, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted him as saying. The Chinese ‘call it the belt [and road] … and they can give whatever names they want, but what matters is that there are projects that Brazil has defined as a priority and that may or may not be accepted [by Beijing]', Mr. Amorim said.- Finally, do check out this Bloomberg report, which argues that -despite more than six years of US tariffs, export controls and financial sanctions, Xi is making steady progress in positioning China to dominate industries of the future.

Politburo Discusses Inspections - Building Cultural Power - Zhong Yin Commentary: 3 Perspectives on China's Economy - Birth Support Policies - Boostin...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, October 29, 2024. Page 1: The lead reports today discuss the 17th group study session of the Politburo and the meeting of the Politburo to review the report on the third round of disciplinary inspection launched by the 20th Central Committee. First, let's look at the review of the third round of disciplinary inspection. The report says: The meeting pointed out that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the inspection work adhered to the central objectives and served the overall situation, focused on problem-orientation, maintained a strict tone, innovateed organizational methods, deepened coordination between upper and lower levels, and continued to prominently play the role of the sharp sword. Based on the findings of the inspection, Party building efforts within central and state organs, as well as centrally managed financial institutions, have been strengthened, and various achievements have been made. However, certain problems continue to exist. It is essential to seriously and earnestly grasp the inspection rectification issues, reinforce the political responsibility of ‘top leaders' and leadership team members, strengthen organisational coordination and daily supervision of inspection rectification, and combine inspection rectification with deepening reform, with comprehensive and strictly Party governance, and with the building of leadership teams and cadre ranks, integrate into daily work, integrate into functional responsibilities, and use rectification effectiveness to promote high-quality development. ，，、，、，、，。，、，，。，--，，，，，、，. The meeting emphasised that Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must continuously raise their political stance, strengthen their sense of political responsibility in performing duties, dare to act and be good at acting, overcome difficulties, and take initiative to share the Party's worries and fulfil responsibilities for the country. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee and implement the reform tasks with a spirit of nailing nails. It is necessary to enhance our awareness of potential dangers, coordinate development and security, focus on preventing and resolving risks in key areas, and firmly hold the bottom line of security. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the leadership team, strictly implement democratic centralism, promote the ability of leading cadres to move up and down, and continuously enhance cohesion and combat effectiveness. It is necessary to clearly understand the situation of the anti-corruption struggle, deeply advance comprehensive and strict Party governance, carry the anti-corruption struggle through to the end with a thorough spirit of self-revolution, adhere to the integrated advancement of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, deepen the treatment of both symptoms and root causes and systematically treat them, continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in combating corruption, continuously perfect the mechanisms for power allocation and operational constraints, focus on eliminating the soil and conditions where corruption breeds, and promote the normalization and long-term effectiveness of preventing and controlling corruption. ，（），，、，、。，。，，，。，，，、。，，，、、，、，，，，、. Subscribe now My Note: I think it is worth looking back to the report announcing the launch of inspections from April. It said that the inspections would cover 34 economic work departments and financial agencies. The full list of the institutions covered is available here. Back then, we were told that the purpose of the inspections was to: -deeply understand the performance of the inspected organizations in fulfilling their functions and responsibilities; promoting high-quality development; preventing and resolving major risks; coordinating deep-seated reforms and high-level opening-up; comprehensively grasping the deepening of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party; the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations; as well as the rectification of problems discovered by inspections, audits and other supervision; focus on identifying political deviations, promote the resolution of outstanding problems; and provide strong support for high-quality development.- I think it is interesting that there is nothing celebratory in the report in terms of the anti-corruption crackdown. Instead, it calls to -continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in combating corruption.- In addition, it reiterates the significance of the Third Plenum reform agenda and talks about using effective rectification to serve high-quality development. Another noteworthy aspect is the emphasis on holding the bottom line of security. To me, this is a timely reminder that the current stimulus effort does not imply shifting away from broader economic goals or the security focus of economic policy. Share Tracking People's Daily The other key report on the page is on the group study session of the Politburo.

The first perspective is -bottoming out and stabilizing- . -Currently, many economic indicators are showing marginal improvement, and positive signals are steadily strengthening. Many economists believe that China's economy is showing signs of bottoming out and stabilizing. Looking at the demand side - in September, the year-on-year growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 1.1 percentage points compared to August; fixed asset investment growth stopped falling and stabilized, with the growth rate for the first three quarters matching that of January to August; exports grew by 6.2% in the first three quarters, and by the end of September, foreign exchange reserves returned to $3.3 trillion.

Looking at the supply side—in September, the added value of industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 5.4% year-on-year. The growth rate stopped falling after 4 months of decline, and rebounded by 0.9 percentage points from August; the service industry production index increased by 5.1%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from August; the manufacturing PMI was 49.8%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points from August. The marginal improvement of macro indicators is the most intuitive positive factor, which fully demonstrates that the trend of steady improvement in China's economy has continued. ，，。，。——981.1；，18；6.2%，9，3.3。、、--、，，，，--。——95.4%，4，80.9；5.1%，80.5；49.8%，80.7。，. We must both face difficulties and maintain confidence. Currently, some new situations and problems have emerged in economic operations. However, the difficulties encountered are issues arising during development and transformation, and can be completely overcome through effort. This is precisely the methodology for comprehensively, objectively, and calmly viewing the current economic situation. ，。。、，。. The second perspective is that of the -combination punch- , which can help understand the effectiveness of regulation. -On September 26, the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee released strong signals for stabilising growth, coordinating and deploying a combination punch of ‘policy reinforcement' and ‘reform acceleration'. This carries weight, and its effects are beginning to show. Social expectations and market confidence are recovering. The implementation of major national strategies and key security capability building projects is a major deployment focusing on the overall situation of building a strong country and national rejuvenation. The accelerated implementation and promotion of the ‘two major' constructions not only drive current investment growth and promote industrial transformation, but also lay a more solid foundation for long-term high-quality development. Large-scale equipment renewal and trade-in of consumer goods benefits both enterprises and people, serving both current and long-term interests. Since the reinforcement of these ‘two new' policies, they have both driven rapid sales growth in key consumer goods such as automobiles, home appliances, and home furnishings, and promoted the high-end, intelligent, and green transformation and upgrading of related industries. Land, fiscal, financial, and other policies have been intensively introduced, promoting the real estate market to stop falling and stabilize. Both existing and incremental policies are showing effectiveness, with positive factors in real estate market operations continuously increasing. Accelerating the formulation of unified national market construction guidelines, releasing new versions of the negative list for market access ... with the accelerated implementation of major reform measures proposed by the Third Plenum, they will effectively stimulate the vitality of the whole society. Strong macro-control capabilities and precise counter-cyclical adjustments are important magic weapons for the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and an important manifestation of our institutional advantages.- 926，，----，，。。、，--，、，；，，--，、、，、、；、、，……，。，……，。、，，. The third perspective is that of ‘new consumer groups' . -Confidence exists both in the present and the future. In the first three quarters, China's new energy vehicle production and sales reached 8.316 million and 8.32 million units, respectively, increasing by 31.7% and 32.5% year-on-year. Looking at a longer timeframe, China's new energy vehicle production and sales have ranked first globally for nine consecutive years. Such data can boost our confidence. Behind these numbers lies future consumption trends, which are supporting factors for long-term economic improvement. Looking at new energy vehicles, Germans view it from a comparative perspective, seeing both the present and, more importantly, the future. German media listed consumer structure and mindset as important factors: ‘Chinese people are much more open-minded, with the average age of electric vehicle buyers being 34 (versus 56 in the EU).' This reveals the future potential of ‘developmental consumption'. According to a 2022 market survey, users under 40 accounted for 84% of China's new energy vehicle users, with those under 30 accounting for about half. Indeed, comparatively speaking, China's new consumer groups provide stronger and more lasting support for new energy vehicles. In today's China, from new energy vehicles, driverless technology, smart wearable devices, to integrated circuits, low-altitude economy, virtual reality industry…whether emerging industries or future industries, their significant characteristic is being driven by technological innovation and led by green low-carbon development. Since the new era, from consensus to action, from investment to consumption, from supply to demand, the new development concept has played a ‘conducting baton' role, guiding China's industrial deep transformation and upgrade, accelerating the transformation of development methods, promoting the ‘mutual advancement' of new quality productive forces and new consumer groups. Such ‘mutual advancement' is of symbolic significance. In today's China, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth has increased from 55.4% in 2012 to 82.5% in 2023. When the younger generation becomes the main force of consumption, when high-quality population development closely combines with people's high-quality life, from ‘survival consumption' to ‘developmental consumption', the consumption space of over 1.4 billion Chinese people will be greatly expanded, and consumption upgrading will maintain good momentum. This is the deep advantage of China's super-large market and the long-term advantage of China's high-quality population development. With the accelerated construction of a modern industrial system supported by the real economy, and the solid advancement of the all-round development of people and the common prosperity of all people, this ‘mutual advancement' will further evolve in depth and breadth, and promote high-quality population development to support the all-round realisation of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，。，831.6832，31.7%32.5%。，9。。，。，，，。：-，34（56）。---。2022，4084%，30。，，。，、、，、、……，、。，，，，--，、，--。--，。，，201255.4%202382.5%。，，----，14，，，。，，--，. The Chinese economy has always grown and developed in overcoming difficulties and surpassed itself in responding to challenges. This is historical experience and economic law. Facing difficulties, strengthening confidence, and working hard when seeing the right opportunity, we have the conditions and ability to complete this year's economic and social development goals and tasks, promoting our economy to continue its upward trend and long-term improvement. 、，，。、，，，、，、。 Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There's a report on the new State Council directive on birth support policies aimed at building a society more conducive to raising children. Xinhua summarises this well: -A directive from the State Council outlines 13 targeted measures to enhance childbirth support services, expand child care systems, strengthen support in education, housing and employment, and foster a birth-friendly social atmosphere. People in flexible and new forms of employment and rural migrant workers, who have already participated in the basic medical insurance scheme for urban workers, will be included in the country's maternity insurance scheme, according to the document. New mothers and fathers can feel more confident taking time off work, as the document urges local authorities to ensure the implementation of maternity, childbirth reward, paternity and child care leave policies. A childbirth subsidy system will be established, and the country has pledged to increase related personal income tax reliefs. Notably, suitable labor pain relief and assisted reproductive technology services will be added to the list of services that qualify for medical insurance reimbursement, according to the document. The country will also enhance health education for adolescents to prevent unintended pregnancies and improve early-pregnancy and abortion care services. More efforts will be made to increase the supply of quality pediatric resources, channel those resources toward the community level, and ensure more balanced distribution among regions. To increase the accessibility of child care services, child care services centers will be established at the prefecture and city levels, and child care facilities will be planned, constructed, approved and delivered for use in step with newly constructed communities, the document says. Capable localities are encouraged to raise the limits of loans from the housing provident fund for families with multiple children to support them in purchasing homes.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on a new notice issued to promote the use of new energy vehicles in central and state organs. The report says: -According to the classification of vehicle usage characteristics, the notice clarifies that confidential communication vehicles, law enforcement and patrol vehicles with relatively fixed routes, and business vehicles with single-use scenarios that mainly operate within urban areas should, in principle, be equipped with new energy vehicles; for special professional technical vehicles used for environmental sanitation, technical surveys, inspection and testing, etc., when new energy vehicles can meet the requirements, they should be given priority in procurement. The notice requires all departments and units to strengthen coordinated management of new energy vehicle procurement by their subordinate units. When preparing annual official vehicle equipment update plans, they should specify the quantity of new energy vehicles to be procured. Except for special circumstances such as geographical environment, climatic conditions, and lack of suitable vehicle models, the proportion of new energy vehicles in that year's official vehicle equipment updates should reach the target requirements specified in the ‘14th Five-Year Plan for Energy and Resource Conservation Work in Public Institutions', and gradually increase according to regulations thereafter.- ，，、、，；、、，，。、，，，、，《--》，.

The report adds: -Over a long period of time, the United States has generalized the concept of national security, abused export control measures and sanctioned and suppressed enterprises from other countries including China. Such actions have seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of these enterprises, and undermined the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains, the spokesperson said.

Xi's Global South Pitch at BRICS+ Meeting - Wang Huning Visits Xinjiang - Aligning People’s Congresses with Party Agenda - China's Diplomatic Push at ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, October 25, 2024. Page 1: The main story today is drawn from Xi Jinping's remarks at the BRICS+ dialogue that took place in Kazan, Russia, on Thursday. The full text of Xi's remarks is on Page 2 and available in English. Xi stressed the significance of the rise of the Global South. But he added that -peace and development still faces severe challenges, and the road to prosperity for the Global South will not be straight.- He then added: We should uphold peace and strive for common security. We should come forward together to form a stabilizing force for peace. We should strengthen global security governance, and explore solutions to address both symptoms and roots of hotspot issues. Many parties have warmly responded to my Global Security Initiative. Under the Initiative, we have made prominent progress in maintaining regional stability and in many other areas. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. We should promote early deescalation to pave the way for political settlement. Last July, Palestinian factions reconciled with each other in Beijing, marking a key step toward peace in the Middle East. We should continue to promote comprehensive ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and revive the two-State solution. We must stop the flames of war from spreading in Lebanon and end the miserable sufferings in Palestine and Lebanon. We should reinvigorate development and strive for common prosperity. The Global South emerges for development and prospers through development. We should make ourselves the main driving force for common development. We should play an active and leading role in the global economic governance reform, and make development the core of international economic and trade agenda. Since its introduction three years ago, the Global Development Initiative has helped make available nearly US$20 billion of development fund and launch more than 1,100 projects. And recently the Global Alliance on Artificial Intelligence for Industry and Manufacturing Center of Excellence has been established in Shanghai. China will also build a World Smart Customs Community Portal and a BRICS Customs Center of Excellence. We welcome active participation by all countries. We should promote together development of all civilizations and strive for harmony among them. Diversity of civilization is the innate quality of the world. We should be advocates for exchanges among civilizations. We should enhance communication and dialogue, and support each other in taking the path to modernization suited to our respective national conditions. The Global Civilization Initiative I proposed is exactly for the purpose of building a garden of world civilizations in which we can share and admire the beauty of each civilization. China will coordinate with others to form a Global South Think Tanks Alliance to promote people-to-people exchanges and experience-sharing in governance. Xi ended by saying that -we support more Global South countries in joining the cause of BRICS as full members, partner countries or in the ‘BRICS Plus' format…- Share Tracking People's Daily Moving on, there's a report on Wang Huning visiting Hotan and Kashgar in Xinjiang from October 21 to 24. It says: Wang said that -we must adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, thoroughly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, fully and accurately implement the Party's strategy for the governance of Xinjiang in the new era, adhere to the main line of building a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, and better build a beautiful Xinjiang in the process of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. Wang visited schools, hospitals, villages and the homes of people belonging to ethnic minority groups. He said that: -Efforts to promote ethnic unity should be implemented in grassroots governance, school education, and aspects of people's daily lives. The awareness of the Chinese nation as a community should be instilled in the hearts of children from an early age, so as to promote all ethnic groups to hold together like pomegranate seeds.- When visiting an economic and technological development zone and related enterprises in Hotan, Wang said that -it is necessary to build a modern industrial system with the characteristics and advantages of southern Xinjiang, cultivate a group of enterprises with long industrial chains and strong driving capabilities, support the improvement of people's livelihood, and enhance the vitality of development.- ，、、，，。，，，、，，. Support for higher education, opening up, protection and utilisation of historical relics and sites were among other key aspects that he talked about. The report adds: -During the investigation, Wang Huning said that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee has thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches on Xinjiang work, further consolidating the good situation of Xinjiang's overall social stability and the good situation of people living and working in peace. To do a good job in Xinjiang, it is necessary to always put the maintenance of social stability in the first place/as the priority, ensuring long-term stability in the overall situation in the region. It is necessary to do a solid job in ethnic and religious work, carry out cultural enrichment in Xinjiang, and guide people of all ethnic groups to forge a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, strengthening the ‘five identifications'. We must promote Xinjiang to embark on the track of high-quality development and consolidate the material foundation for Xinjiang's social stability and long-term peace and stability. The spirit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps should be promoted, with deeper integration of civilian and military development, forming new advantages in stabilising and defending the border in the new era.- ，，，、。，，。，，、--。，。，，.

Zhao stressed the importance of -upholding, improving and running the system of people's congresses at a new historical starting point.- Zhao visited Dandong, Dalian and Shenyang, carrying out extensive research at the offices of the local people's congress standing committees, while also presiding over symposiums. -He stressed that studying and implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech (on the work of people's congresses at the 70th anniversary of the NPC's founding) is a compulsory course and basic skill for people's congresses at all levels to do their jobs well. It should be combined with studying the General Secretary's series of important expositions and important instructions on the people's congress system and the work of people's congresses, so as to fully grasp the development context, core essence and rich connotation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on upholding and improving the people's congress system, and always adhere to the correct political direction in the work of the people's congresses.- ，，、、，、、、，. -Zhao Leji pointed out that the people's congresses should leverage the significant political advantages of the people's congress system in practice, adhere to the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, ensure that the Party's propositions become the will of the state and the people's common actions through legal procedures, and ensure that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work.

Xinhua English summarises the last paragraph well: -Zhao also took the time to visit legislation outreach and community deputy liaison offices, enterprises, villages and rural households. During these visits, he engaged in profound exchanges with both deputies to the people's congresses and local residents. In the course of such interactions, he pointed out that people's congresses should consciously practice whole-process people's democracy, establish sound mechanisms for gathering public opinion and wisdom, and ensure the effective performance of deputies' responsibilities in accordance with the law.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's investigation and research tour in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from Tuesday to Thursday. Xinhua reports that Li -called for concrete efforts to facilitate the progress of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TSFP) and ensure the supply of energy-. The report covers Li's remarks on dealing with desertification, soil and water conservation management, forest belt construction and dairy technology innovation, as well as ecological, grass and seed research, and research on the promotion of improved varieties. They key point from my perspective are these: In Ningxia, Li -called for continuous energy technology research, and the promotion of the on-site deep processing of coal resources. He said that policy guidance and support should be enhanced and efforts be made to make good use of building facades, particularly rooftop spaces, to release the development potential of new energy, such as photovoltaic power.- In Inner Mongolia, he called to -put the development of new energy and clean energy in a more prominent position, and promote the complementary and deep integration of traditional energy and new energy. It is necessary to vigorously promote the clean and efficient use of coal, further improve the efficiency of power generation and heating, and ensure that the people can spend the winter in warmth.- He also stressed the need to -forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong meeting with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi in Beijing.

Piantedosi said Italy is willing to enhance law-enforcement and security cooperation with China to jointly address security issues.- Also on the page are reports of three CPC delegations visiting Laos, Thailand and Ethiopia. The delegation to Thailand was led by Chen Gang, a member of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee. Xinhua reports that it met with Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy Pirapan Salirathavibhaga, Deputy Pheu Thai Party leader Chusak Sirinil and other leaders of political parties. The delegation to Laos was led by Qu Qingshan, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Xinhua reports that Qu met with Bounthong Chitmany, a politburo member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) Central Committee, a permanent member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee, and vice president of Laos. Qu also met with Kikeo Khaykhamphithoune, a member of the Political Bureau of the LPRP Central Committee and deputy prime minister of Laos, and Khamphanh Pheuyavong, a member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee and head of the Propaganda and Training Board of the LPRP Central Committee. The delegation to Ethiopia was led by Vice Minister of Education Wu Yan.

If you are interested, here's a related Xinhua report with details of an event that took place.

The report says that the Chinese viewpoint was that the country -has embarked on a human rights development path that suits its national conditions, is supported by the people, and conforms to the trend of the times.- Chen Xu, head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and China's permanent representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, highlighted the significance of the Decision following the Third Plenum. He said that -China will further deepen reforms in an all-round way, promote Chinese-style modernization, enhance the well-being of all people, and strengthen human rights law enforcement and judicial protection.- The report adds: -On September 18, the Chinese representative spoke to publicise China's achievements in human rights development, pointing out that China has built a comprehensively moderately prosperous society as scheduled, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty; it has continuously developed whole-process people's democracy, promoted the legal protection of human rights, and promoted the people to enjoy more extensive, substantial and comprehensive democratic rights; it has continuously improved the levels of employment, education, social security, and the quality of living environment. At present, China is promoting Chinese-style modernization and will continue to improve the level of human rights protection with the achievements of modernization construction.- 918，，，；，，、、；、、，。，. The next segment is useful to recap in entirety: -China advocates respecting each country's right to independently choose its path to human rights development and opposes using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or hinder their development. In the face of baseless attacks and false accusations, the Chinese delegation resolutely defended its position during the meeting, clearing up the confusion and reaffirming its stance. On September 24, in response to the United States and some other countries attacking and smearing China's human rights situation at the meeting, more than 100 countries supported China's just position and opposed the politicisation of human rights issues in different ways, such as joint and individual statements. Cuba, speaking on behalf of nearly 80 countries, including China, emphasized that respecting national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, are fundamental principles of international relations. Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet are internal affairs of China, and the politicization of human rights issues and the application of double standards should be opposed, as well as using human rights as a pretext to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. All parties should adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, follow the principles of universality, fairness, objectivity, and non-selectivity, and respect the right of all peoples to choose their own development paths based on their national conditions. Uganda, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, Venezuela, on behalf of the Group of Friends in Defence of the UN Charter, and Gambia, on behalf of the African Group, spoke in support of China's position, pointing out that all parties should objectively view the human rights situation in other countries, conduct dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect, avoid selective and double standards, and jointly resist the wrong practice of politicising, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues. Chen Xu, representing the ‘Group of Friends in Promoting Human Rights through Dialogue and Cooperation', made a joint statement, noting that the politicisation and polarisation of the Human Rights Council is intensifying. The Human Rights Council should not be a venue for confrontation and pressure but should play its proper role in building trust and promoting cooperation through dialogue and exchanges between countries.- ，、。，、。924，，100、，，。80，、，。、、，，。，、、，。、--、，，，，、、。--，。，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Some other key points: On October 2, the Chinese representative called for the effective protection of the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people… Li Xiaomei, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the UNHRC, urged the United States and other Western countries to immediately lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China during an interactive dialogue with the Council's Special Rapporteur on Unilateral Coercive Measures. Li said that unilateral sanctions seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations, and seriously infringe on human rights. China has always firmly opposed them. The United States has a poor human rights record, but it often abuses ‘long-arm jurisdiction' based on domestic law, completely violating human rights in the name of democracy and human rights. ，。，，，，。，--，、.

BRICS Summit Special: Examining Leaders' Remarks & the Kazan Declaration	I'll limit this edition to the BRICS summit-related engagements. This anyway dominates the paper today too. At least, I found little else interesting in the paper today. So here goes. The top story on the front page today is based on Xi Jinping's speech at the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. The speech has been published on Page 2; full English version is available here. Key points: -At this summit, we have decided to invite many countries to become partner countries, which is another major progress in the development of BRICS…We must make full use of this summit, maintain the momentum of BRICS, and consider and devise our strategy to address issues that have a global impact, determine our future direction, and possess strategic significance. We must build on this milestone summit to set off anew and forge ahead with one heart and one mind.- -We must work together to build BRICS into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.- Then Xi made a five-point proposal of building a: : Peaceful BRICS; : Innovative BRICS; : Green BRICS; : Fair BRICS; and : Humanistic BRICS -We should build a BRICS committed to peace, and we must all act as defenders of common security. We humans are an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can we pave the way for universal security. The Ukraine crisis still persists. China and Brazil, in collaboration with other countries from the Global South, initiated a group of Friends for Peace to address the crisis. The aim is to gather more voices advocating peace. We must uphold the three key principles: no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames, and strive for swift de-escalation of the situation. While the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, the flames of war have once again been rekindled in Lebanon, and conflicts are escalating among the parties. We must promote an immediate ceasefire and an end to the killing. We must make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question.- -We should build a BRICS committed to innovation…China has recently launched a China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center. We are ready to deepen cooperation on innovation with all BRICS countries to unleash the dividends of AI development. China will establish a BRICS Deep-Sea Resources International Research Center, a China Center for Cooperation on Development of Special Economic Zones in BRICS Countries, a China Center for BRICS Industrial Competencies, and a BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network.- We should build a BRICS committed to green development…China's high-quality production capacity, as exemplified by its manufacturing of electric vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, provides a significant boost to global green development. China is willing to leverage its strengths to expand cooperation with BRICS countries in green industries, clean energy and green mining, and promote green development through the entire industrial chain, so as to increase the ‘green quotient' of our cooperation and upgrade the quality of our development. -We should build a BRICS committed to justice, and we must all act as forerunners in reforming global governance. The international power dynamics is undergoing profound changes, but global governance reform has lagged behind for a long time. We should champion true multilateralism and adhere to the vision of global governance characterized by extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. We must ensure that global governance reform is guided by the principles of fairness, justice, openness and inclusiveness. In light of the rise of the Global South, we should respond favorably to the calls from various countries to join BRICS. We should advance the process of expanding BRICS membership and establishing a partner country mechanism, and enhance the representation and voice of developing nations in global governance.- -The current developments make the reform of the international financial architecture all the more pressing. BRICS countries should play a leading role in the reform. We should deepen fiscal and financial cooperation, promote the connectivity of our financial infrastructure, and apply high standards of financial security. The New Development Bank should be expanded and strengthened. We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape.- We should build a BRICS committed to closer people-to-people exchanges…We should enhance the exchange of governance experiences among BRICS countries, and fully harness the untapped potential for cooperation in areas such as education, sports, and the arts so that our diverse cultures can inspire one another and illuminate the path forward for BRICS…China will implement a capacity-building program for BRICS digital education. We will open 10 learning centers in BRICS countries in the next five years, and provide training opportunities for 1,000 local education administrators, teachers and students… Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the front page are reports on Xi's meeting with the presidents of Iran and Egypt. The meeting with India's Narendra Modi is covered on Page 2. I covered this in detail in the edition yesterday. First, the report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says: -Iran, Xi said, is a country with important regional and international influence and a good friend and partner of China. The strategic significance of China-Iran relations has become more prominent as transformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at faster pace, he said. The Chinese side supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and national dignity, steadily advancing its own economic and social development, and improving and deepening good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries, he added. The Chinese side, he said, stands ready to work with Iran to firmly support each other, uphold the basic norms governing international relations such as non-interference in internal affairs, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries, adding that his country is also willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Iran in various fields, promote the sound and steady development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, and better benefit the two peoples. Xi congratulated on and welcomed Iran's participation in the BRICS Summit for the first time as a full member, pointing out that China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Iran within BRICS and other multilateral frameworks, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and push forward the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.- -Xi pointed out that China is deeply concerned about the current situation in the Middle East, saying that an early ceasefire and end of war in Gaza are the key to easing regional tensions. The international community should work together to urge relevant parties to earnestly implement the UN Security Council resolutions and avoid further instability in the region, he added.- Among other things, Pezeshkian said -China is Iran's most important partner for cooperation.- He added that -Iran is also ready to work with China to continue firmly supporting each other on issues concerning their respective core interests and opposing hegemony and bullying.- Subscribe now The report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi says that: -Xi pointed out that this year marks the China-Egypt year of partnership and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. China firmly supports Egypt in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, he said. The two sides should continue to firmly support each other, consolidate political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, jointly build the Belt and Road with high quality, strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and push bilateral relations toward the goal of building a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era, Xi said. China is also willing to strengthen coordination with Egypt to promote the steady and long-term development of greater BRICS cooperation, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries, he added.- -The two sides exchanged views on the current situation in the Middle East. Xi pointed out that China is deeply worried about the current situation in the Middle East. Noting that wars and chaos in the region serve no one's interests and the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue, Xi said the pressing task now is to fully and effectively implement the UN Security Council's relevant resolutions and end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible. Only by implementing the two-state solution can a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue be promoted at an early date, he said. China appreciates Egypt's efforts to promote a ceasefire and end of war, and stands ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Egypt to jointly push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the easing of the regional situation, Xi added.- Share Tracking People's Daily At this point, let me go back to the BRICS Summit. There has been an agreement on partner countries, but I still don't have a list of these countries. In the meantime, let's look at what different leaders said and what the final declaration says. First, let me highlight the Indian Prime Minister's remarks at the Closed Plenary of the BRICS Summit: -We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war. And just as we were able to overcome a challenge like COVID together, we are certainly able to create new opportunities to ensure a secure , strong and prosperous future for future generations. In order to counter terrorism and terror financing, we need the single minded, firm support of all. There is no place for double standards on this serious matter. We need to take active steps to stop radicalization of youth in our countries. We must work together on the long pending matter in the UN of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The same way, we need to work on global regulations for cyber security and for safe and secure AI.- -India is ready to welcome new countries into BRICS as Partner Countries. In this regard all decisions should be taken by consensus, and the views of BRICS founding members should be respected. The Guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures adopted during the Johannesburg summit, should be complied with by all members and partner countries.- -We must move forward in a time bound manner on reforms in global institutions such as the UN Security Council, Multilateral development banks, and the WTO. As we take our efforts forward in BRICS, we must be careful to ensure that this organisation does not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions, instead of being perceived as one that wishes to reform them.- One of the key points that he made at the open meeting was: -We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) developed by India is a huge success story and has been adopted in many countries. Last year, together with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed, it was launched in the UAE as well. We can also cooperate with other BRICS countries in this area.- Share Tracking People's Daily The key points from Putin's remarks at the open meeting are as follows: He proposed -creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.- -I would like to note that this year our association has managed to agree on a number of initiatives aimed at solving critically important common tasks. In particular, this concerns increasing the sustainability of supply chains and added value, countering protectionism, developing e-commerce, and establishing contacts through special economic zones. We believe that the launch of a special mechanism for consultations of BRICS countries on issues of the World Trade Organization will facilitate the development of a common position on the formation of fairer rules of the game in the global economy and the reform of the international financial system.- -We consider the initiatives on the BRICS partnership on carbon markets and the climate research platform to be promising.- It was proposed to open a BRICS grain exchange, which would facilitate the formation of fair and predictable price indicators for products and raw materials, taking into account their special role in ensuring food security. The implementation of this initiative will help protect national markets from negative external interference, speculation and attempts to cause artificial shortages of food products. Over time, one could also think about transforming the grain exchange into a full-fledged commodity exchange.- He talked about the importance of a joint energy research platform and a BRICS platform for precious metals, as well as for diamonds. -Russia has also put forward an initiative to establish a BRICS public health research network, which is designed to strengthen national health systems through the exchange of best practices. It is important to further strengthen the capacity of the BRICS vaccine center and tuberculosis research network.- -I would like to draw attention to the Russian proposal to create a BRICS alliance in the field of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to regulate artificial intelligence technologies, including to prevent their illegal use. In Russia, the business community has adopted a code of ethics in this area, which our BRICS partners and other countries can join.- Subscribe now Looking at the remarks of other leaders is also really useful. It helps understand the very diverse approaches and priorities of all the countries. As I had said in my comments to CNN recently, most of them are approaching the group pragmatically rather than ideologically. I am relying on machine translation of the comments available on the Russian presidential website. Egypt's Sisi talked about supporting multipolarity and basically added: -The world order suffers from many problems and crises, political crises that are aggravated by economic problems, leading to security problems, lack of financing for development goals, and rising costs of resources. Therefore, we in Egypt attach priority importance to taking significant steps to ensure financing for development goals in developing countries by creating reliable mechanisms and instruments to ensure sustainable development in developing countries.- He added: -Egypt confirms its readiness to strengthen interaction, coordination with the countries of the association on various international platforms, including in such areas as the climate agenda, strengthening, ensuring food security, digitalization, education and science. We are also committed to further work to ensure financial cooperation and the transition to national currencies, ensuring financial payments in national currencies, as well as interaction in the areas of digitalization, interaction with the BRICS Business Council and strengthening public-private partnership interaction based on the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism.- Brazil's Lula da Silva mentioned the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. He also talked about climate change. A key point added was: -It is now necessary to create alternative monetary relations between our countries. We are not talking about replacing our internal money, but when we talk about a multipolar world, we must create a financial system, we must seriously discuss this topic. Technically, we cannot wait any longer – we must decide.- Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed stressed the importance of -intra-BRICS trade, investment and tourism-. Supported the proposal on AI. He added that -prompt consideration of applications for membership in BRICS and the New Development Bank will make it possible to create a system of alternative financing for infrastructure projects that are important for development.- He stressed the significance of -African representation in the UN Security Council-. Iran's Pezeshkian said that -the period of unilateralism, when prosperity and development can only be realized on the path determined by Western directions, is coming to an end. I can say that the result of such an approach of Western countries can only worsen the situation in all corners of the world. And with great regret, I must say that the Americans have contributed to the growth of conflicts, as well as wars throughout the world. This is the unleashing of various wars, various conflicts, and we understand very well what is happening right now in Lebanon and Palestine.- He added: -The efforts that have been made so far to reduce the dollar's dominance in the world economy must be strengthened and implemented through operational solutions, such as the creation of a BRICS currency basket or a new settlement mechanism independent of the dollar. Independent parties can no longer pay for the United States' misguided financial policies or ineffectiveness in combating organized corruption in its financial sector.- He talked about Palestine, and the importance of financing support for development projects. He added: -I think it is necessary to create an electronic platform for all BRICS members in order to facilitate mutual trade processes between these parties, as well as to reduce dependence on ‘world domination' in the sphere of trade. We need to think about how we can improve the system of mutual settlements based on national currencies. We are well aware that we should not depend on Western settlement systems any longer, this is a big threat to all countries. Maybe not today, but tomorrow.- South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa said that -We look forward to hearing reports from our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on the use of national currencies in international trade and financial transactions among the BRICS countries and their trading partners.- He added: -Emerging economies are heavily affected by the impacts of climate change. However, they bear the least blame for the current climate crisis. It is therefore imperative that industrialized countries meet their climate commitments to ensure a just and equitable transition. It is important that climate action does not exacerbate inequality or hold back the development of countries in the Global South.- And he said: -It is necessary to increase cooperation among BRICS countries by launching common development programs in the field of exports, industrial cooperation and technology exchange. We call for recalibration and modification of trade routes to ensure more sustainable industrialization. Reform of the World Trade Organization is also necessary. Cooperation among BRICS countries in the field of mineral resources and mineral sourcing needs to be considered. This is of great importance for development and achieving the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our economies.- UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was very brief. He avoided any overt political remarks. Insted, he highlighted the country's success in sectors such as technology, logistics, and the green economy. He added: -The UAE has invested in major renewable energy projects such as solar energy, wind energy, to use natural energy sources, natural resources more efficiently. This is part of our vision to achieve a more sustainable future, taking into account climate change.- Next, the NDB's Dilma Rousseff spoke. She said that the international situation was complex and was further -complicated by the fact that the dollar is used as a weapon to change the living conditions of the population, which also affects the international system, that is, trust [in it] and its integrity.- She further stated: -For 2024-2025, we planned to finance 39-40 projects in the field of infrastructure, transport, clean electricity, clean water, digital projects worth more than 10 billion dollars. To date, we have financed a total of 101 investment projects worth 35 billion dollars. The new development bank envisages and wants to focus on financing in national currencies. This is very important for us to increase our capacity for financing. This is our strategy. The target for 2022–2026 was to implement 30 percent of financing in national currencies. Today, we have reached 28.3 percent, so we are almost reaching our target of 30 percent.- Putin responded to her remarks by adding: -You said that the dollar is used as a weapon. Yes, indeed, we see that this is so. In fact, I think that this is a big mistake for those who do this, because using the dollar, which is still the most important instrument of world finance, as a means of achieving political goals undermines confidence in this currency and reduces its capabilities. But it is not us who do this, it is other people who do this. But we do not refuse, we do not fight the dollar. But if we are not allowed to work with it - what to do, then we are forced to look for other alternatives, which is what is happening. We, striving for cooperation, nevertheless, it seems to me, must understand that the longer we live and work by someone else's rules and on someone else's platforms, the longer this transition to a new and more just economic and financial system will last, and this may be accompanied by major upheavals, including those that we are seeing, in particular, in the Middle East. We will talk about this with our colleagues.- Subscribe now Let's now look at the Kazan Declaration. This is a very, very long document. So I am just going to highlight some key points: We welcome the considerable interest by countries of the Global South in BRICS and we endorse the Modalities of BRICS Partner Country Category. We strongly believe that extending the BRICS partnership with EMDCs will further contribute to strengthening the spirit of solidarity and true international cooperation for the benefit of all. We commit to further promoting BRICS institutional development. We reaffirm our support for the rules-based, open, transparent, fair, predictable, inclusive, equitable, non-discriminatory, consensus-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, with special and differential treatment (S&amp;DT) for developing countries, including Least Developed Countries and reject the unilateral trade restrictive measures that are inconsistent with WTO rules. We welcome the outcomes of the 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and reiterate our commitment to work towards the implementation of the decisions and declarations of WTO Ministerial Conferences. We note however there is still a need for further efforts in many outstanding issues. We emphasize the importance of reforming the WTO and strengthening the developmental dimension in its work. We commit to engage constructively within the WTO to attain the goal to deliver a fully and well-functioning two-tier binding WTO dispute settlement system by 2024 accessible to all, and the selection of new Appellate Body Members without further delay. We agree to enhance our dialogue on multilateral trading system and WTO-related issues and welcome the establishment of the BRICS Informal Consultative Framework on WTO issues. We reiterate the decision under the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025 to take actions to support the necessary WTO reform to enhance the WTO's resilience, authority and efficacy, and promote development and inclusivity. We are deeply concerned about the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the world economy, international trade, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Such measures undermine the UN Charter, the multilateral trading system, the sustainable development and environmental agreements. They also negatively impact economic growth, energy, health and food security exacerbating poverty and environmental challenges. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We call for the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, which includes increased representation of EMDCs in leadership positions to reflect the contribution of EMDCs to the global economy. We support a merit-based, inclusive and equitable selection process for the top positions at the Bretton Woods institutions, increased geographical representation and the role and share of women. We note the quota increase at the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) and urge members to secure domestic approvals to make quota increase effective. We welcome the decision to create a 25th chair at the IMF Executive Board to enhance the voice and representation of Sub-Saharan Africa. We acknowledge the urgency and importance of realignment in quota shares to better reflect members' relative positions in the world economy, while protecting the quota shares of the EMDCs, in particular, the poorest members. We welcome the IMF Executive Board's ongoing work to develop by June 2025 possible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through a new quota formula, under the 17th GRQ. The discussions should result in quota realignment that is fair and transparent, enhances the representation of underrepresented IMF members, and transfers quota share from advanced economies to EMDCs. We look forward to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) 2025 Shareholding Review. We reiterate that the objectives, principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, including its principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) in the light of different national circumstances, must be honoured. We condemn unilateral measures introduced under the pretext of climate and environmental concerns and reiterate our commitment to enhancing coordination on these issues. We will strengthen cooperation on a whole range of solutions and technologies that contribute to the reduction and removal of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). We also note the role of carbon sinks in absorbing GHGs and mitigating climate change, whilst also highlighting the importance of adaptation and stressing the need for the adequate provision of the means of implementation, namely financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building. We reiterate that the unilateral coercive measures, inter-alia in the form of unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions that are contrary to international law, have far-reaching implications for the human rights, including the right to development, of the general population of targeted states, disproportionally affecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations. Therefore, we call for their elimination. Share Tracking People's Daily On the Middle East conflict, the statement says: -We reiterate our grave concern at the deterioration of the situation and humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the unprecedented escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank as a result of the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. We stress the urgent need for an immediate, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and detainees from both sides who are being illegally held captive and the unhindered sustainable and at scale supply of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and cessation of all aggressive actions. We denounce the Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations, facilities, personnel and distribution points. For this purpose, we call for the full implementation of resolutions 2712 (2023), 2720 (2024), 2728 (2024) and 2735 (2024) of the United Nations Security Council and in this regard welcome the continuous efforts by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the State of Qatar, other regional and international efforts in order to reach immediate ceasefire, accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid and Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We call for adherence to international law. We are also alarmed that the further escalation of the conflict in the Gaza Strip fuel tension, extremism and severe negative consequences both regionally and globally. We call on all relevant parties to act with utmost restraint and to avoid escalatory actions and provocative declarations. We acknowledge the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel. We reaffirm our support for the State of Palestine's full membership in the United Nations in the context of the unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution based on international law including relevant UNSC and UNGA resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative that includes the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine in line with internationally recognised borders of June 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital living side by side in peace and security with Israel.- We express alarm over the situation in Southern Lebanon. We condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts. We stress the need to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Lebanon and to create conditions for political and diplomatic solution in order to safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East while underlining the importance of strict observance of UNSC resolutions 1701 (2006) and 2749 (2024). We strongly condemn attacks on UN personnel, threats to their safety and call upon Israel to immediately cease such activity. We express our concern over the increasing incidents of terrorist attacks linked with ICT capabilities. In this regard, we condemn the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024, resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians. We reiterate that these attacks constitute a grave violation of International Law. We stress the importance of ensuring the exercise of navigational rights and freedoms of vessels of all states in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait, in accordance with international law. We encourage enhanced diplomatic efforts by all parties to that end, including by addressing the causes of the conflict, and continued support for dialogue and Yemen's peace process under UN auspices. We stress that Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be strictly observed. We condemn illegal foreign military presence that lead to increasing risks of a large-scale conflict in the region. We emphasize that illegal unilateral sanctions seriously exacerbate the suffering of the Syrian people. We condemn the attack against the diplomatic premises of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Syrian capital Damascus by Israel on 1 April 2024 that constitutes a violation of the fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Share Tracking People's Daily On the war in Ukraine, all we have is this: -We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine as expressed in the appropriate fora, including the UNSC and the UNGA. We emphasize that all states should act consistently with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation. We note with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.- Subscribe now Other security issues referenced are those in Sudan, Haiti, non-proliferation and disarmament, terrorism, prevention of an arms race in outer space, informatio and misinformation, corruption, drug production, trafficking and abuse, the situation in Afghanistan, etc. On Afghanistan, two points worth noting are: We urge for more visible and verifiable measures in Afghanistan to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorists. We call on Afghanistan authorities to reverse the effective ban on girl's secondary and higher education. On development issues, the document says: We believe it is necessary to address the international debt properly and in a holistic manner to support economic recovery and sustainable development, taking into account each nation's laws and internal procedures, accompanied by sustainable external debt and fiscal prudence. We recognise the need to address in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner the debt vulnerabilities of both low and middle income countries. One of the instruments, amongst others, to collectively address debt vulnerabilities is through predictable, orderly, timely and coordinated implementation of the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment with the participation of official bilateral creditors, private creditors and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in line with the principle of joint action and fair burden-sharing. We support the NDB in continuously expanding local currency financing and strengthening innovation in investment and financing tools. We encourage the Bank to follow member-led and demand-driven principles, the employment of innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize financing from diversified sources, and in this regard, we acknowledge the initiative to create new investment platform to leverage the existing institutional infrastructure of the NDB to boost the investment flow into the countries of BRICS and the Global South mechanisms. We support the enhancement of capacity building and knowledge exchange, including by building synergies with knowledge sources from developing countries, the assistance of member countries in achieving the SDGs and the further improvement of efficiency and effectiveness to fulfill its mandate, aiming to be a premier multilateral development institution for EMDCs. We agree to jointly develop the New Development Bank into a new type of MDB in the 21st century. We urge the Bank to execute its purpose and functions in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the New Development Bank in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. We support the further expansion of NDB membership and expedited consideration of applications of BRICS countries in line with the NDB General Strategy and related policies. We reiterate our commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. We recognise the widespread benefits of faster, low cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access. We welcome the use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners. We encourage strengthening of correspondent banking networks within BRICS and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), which is voluntary and non-binding, and look forward to further discussions in this area, including in the BRICS Payment Task Force. We agree to discuss and study the feasibility of establishment of an independent cross-border settlement and depositary infrastructure, BRICS Clear, an initiative to complement the existing financial market infrastructure, as well as BRICS independent reinsurance capacity, including BRICS (Re) Insurance Company, with participation on a voluntary basis. We reaffirm the need to develop a fair agricultural trading system and implement resilient and sustainable agriculture. We commit to minimize disruptions and promote rules-based trade in agriculture and fertilizers with the view to ensure a continuous flow of food and essential inputs for agricultural production which should be exempted from undue restrictive economic measures, inconsistent with WTO rules, including those affecting producers and exporters of agricultural products as well as business services with regard to international shipments. In this regard, we welcome the initiative of the Russian side to establish a grain (commodities) trading platform within BRICS (the BRICS Grain Exchange) and to subsequently develop it including expanding it to other agricultural sectors. We reject unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures, that are not in line with international law, under the pretext of environmental concerns, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), due diligence requirements, taxes and other measures and reconfirm our full support for the call in COP28 related to avoidance of unilateral trade measures based on climate or environment. We also oppose unilateral protectionist measures, which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition. We welcome the establishment of the Contact Group on Climate Change and Sustainable Development by BRICS Environment Ministers on 28 June 2024 in Nizhny Novgorod and the adoption of the Framework on Climate Change and Sustainable Development at the High-level Dialogue on Climate Change (30 August 2024, Moscow). We look forward to establishing the BRICS Climate Research Platform (BCRP) to enhance the scientific and expert exchange of views, knowledge and best practices of the grouping. There's a lot after this on health, tourism, disaster prevention, competition law and policy, customs and tax, IP cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, science, education, culture, etc. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Breakdown of the Meeting between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping	Hi folks, The main BRICS summit concluded earlier today in Kazan, Russia. I'll be coveringXi Jinping's engagement and the Kazan declaration in tomorrow's newsletter breaking down the People's Daily. Today, I am doing a special brief detailing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Xi Jinping in Kazan. My quick takeaway is that this meeting seems to have yielded positive outcomes. This is the first step on a long road to re-engaging, building trust and potential normalisation. A lot has to happen still; and a lot can impede this process still. In terms of the key developments, there is an agreement between the two sides to begin all-round dialogue, which is welcome. Xi Jinping's formulation of referring to India as a major country is noteworthy, particularly given the hierarchy of countries in Chinese official discourse. India generally tends to fall within the peripheral diplomacy category. More important, however, is his comment that -development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India-. It is, of course, terribly early but this is a good sign. It provides a frame for arriving at some sort of a new balance in ties. Also positive is that there will be a meeting of the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question sometime soon. The Indian side in its briefing has suggested that it expects further talks to deal with the issue of further easing in Eastern Ladakh, including de-escalation. But this doesn't seem to have been a part of the conversation, thus far. That said, there is a curious line in the Chinese readout that: Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle. One wonders what these were. Anyway, let's look at the readouts below: The Chinese readout after the meeting said: Xi Jinping pointed out that China and India are both ancient civilizations, major developing countries, and important members of the Global South. They are also both in a critical period of modernization in their respective countries. It is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples for China and India to correctly grasp the historical trend and the direction of development of bilateral relations. The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, enhance strategic mutual trust, and facilitate each other's pursuit of their development aspirations. Both sides should also shoulder international responsibilities, set an example of unity and self-reliance for the vast number of developing countries, and contribute to promoting world multipolarization and the democratization of international relations. ，、、，。，。，，。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that the essence of China-India relations is how two neighbouring developing major countries, each with over 1.4 billion people, should get along with each other. Development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India. Both sides should continue to uphold important consensuses that India and China are ‘development opportunities for each other, and do not constitute threats to each other' (、) and are ‘cooperative partners rather than competitors/rivals (), and adhere to the correct strategic understanding, and and jointly seek the bright path of peaceful coexistence and common development between neighbouring major countries. ，14。--。-、-、--，，、. As per the Chinese readout, Modi said that under the current international situation, -India-China cooperation is conducive to promoting economic recovery and world multipolarization.- He added that -India is willing to strengthen strategic communication with China, enhance strategic mutual trust, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation. India is willing to fully support China's work as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and strengthen communication and cooperation within multilateral frameworks such as BRICS.- ，，28，。，，。，，。，. The two leaders positively evaluated the significant progress made recently through intensive communication between both sides in resolving issues related to the border areas. Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle.- 。，. -The two sides agreed to give full play to the role of the meeting mechanism of the special representatives of the two countries on border issues, jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, and seek fair and reasonable solutions. The two sides agreed that the foreign ministers and officials at all levels of the two countries should conduct dialogues to push the bilateral relations back on the track of stable development as soon as possible. The two sides agreed to strengthen communication and cooperation at multilateral forums to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. The two sides believed that this meeting was constructive and of great significance, and agreed to view and handle China-India relations from a strategic height and long-term perspective, not to let specific differences affect the overall situation of bilateral relations, and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and prosperity and advance world multipolarization.- ，，，。，，。，，。，，，，、. The Indian readout after the meeting says: -Welcoming the recent agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 in the India-China border areas, Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility. The two leaders agreed that the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question will meet at an early date to oversee the management of peace &amp; tranquility in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question. The relevant dialogue mechanisms at the level of Foreign Ministers and other officials will also be utilized to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations. The two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbors and the two largest nations on earth, will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity. It will also contribute to a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world. The leaders underlined the need to progress bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges.- India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri made the following points at the MEA's press briefing after the meeting. The two leaders welcomed the agreement reached by the two sides on the border issue. -Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of not allowing differences on boundary related matters to disturb peace and tranquility on our borders,- said Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. The two leaders -instructed the Special Representatives to meet at an early date.- -Both of them stressed that with maturity and wisdom and by showing mutual respect for each other's sensitivities, interests, concerns and aspirations, the two countries can have a peaceful, stable and beneficial bilateral relationship-. -As we have maintained over the last four years, the restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas will create space in returning us towards the path of normalisation of bilateral relations. Officials will now take the next steps to discuss enhancing strategic communication and stabilising bilateral relations by utilising the relevant official bilateral dialogue mechanisms, including at the level of our respective foreign ministers.- They had a -very productive exchange- on BRICS. Misri added that Modi expressed -full support- for China's SCO presidency. In responding to questions about the impact of the meeting on the LAC and on confidence-building measures (CBMs): Misri said that: -it is certainly our expectation that as a result of not only the agreement that was arrived at just a couple of days ago between Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators but also as a result of the endorsement of that agreement at the highest leader level possible between the two countries as happened in the meeting today where both PM Modi and President Xi Jinping welcomed the efforts made by Indian and Chinese negotiators and the results that were achieved by that, I think these should certainly lead to an easing of the situation along the LAC.- On CBMs, he said that -these evolve continuously-. As the two sides engage once again in multiple formats, this is certainly a subject that I think will be under discussion between the two sides.- On the question of whether soldiers will continue to be deployed along the LAC, he deferred the question to military leaders. On the question of normalisation, he said that we have embarked on the path of normalisation (in Hindi, he said: ek yatra ek tarah se chal padi hai). He added that the agreement between the two sides has opened a pathway, but both need to walk on that path now (in Hindi: yeh rasta khul gaya hai; raste par chalne ki ab hum dono ko aawashakta hai). He added that on trust, what ever process we follow going forward, we hope that it will boost trust between the two sides. On the question of whether the border agreement covers Depsang and Demchok, Misri said that the answer is within is statements issued over the past few days. In essence, he confirmed that Depsang and Demchok were the only issues that the current agreement covers. The agreement that was arrived at, he said, -essentially pertains to these areas.- If you are interested, this is what he had said yesterday when asked a similar question: -Well, what it will entail is that in the pending areas under discussion, patrolling and indeed grazing activities, wherever applicable, will revert to the situation as it obtained in 2020. Incidentally, I should say that this is also what the External Affairs Minister was talking about yesterday when he was speaking at the NDTV World Summit, I think. And as to the other part of your question, what the, as far as the disengagement agreements reached previously are concerned, those agreements were not reopened in these discussions. The agreement that was reached yesterday, very early yesterday morning, was focused on issues that had remained outstanding in the last couple of years. So that is what I would say at this point in time.- On the question of whether Russia played a role as peacemaker between India and China, he said: -We are in Kazan; we are in Russia. I think we can certainly thank Russia for providing the venue.- You can watch the full briefing below. It's an 18-minute video, which is in loop.

Hi folks, Before we get to today's edition, I wanted to point to something that I am looking forward to during the day. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping will be meeting for their first formal bilateral talks since October 2019. This comes after a deal was announced separately by both sides on the issues related to the standoff between the two forces in Eastern Ladakh. For those interested, do check out my piece in the Indian Express yesterday discussing the deal and the many questions that remain. The piece is beyond the paywall. So I am attaching a PDF here for those who would like access.

Page 1: The front page today is dominated by Xi Jinping's visit to and meetings in Kazan, Russia. He is accompanied by Cai Qi and Wang Yi. First, let's look at the report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Vladimir Putin. -Xi Jinping pointed out that this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. Over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have gone through ups and downs and explored the correct way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other through ‘non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties'. The two sides have upheld the spirit of lasting good-neighbourliness and friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination, and mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and continued to deepen and expand comprehensive strategic cooperation and practical cooperation across various fields, injected strong impetus into the development, revitalization and modernization of the two countries, and made important contributions to enhancing the well-being of the Chinese and Russian people and safeguarding international fairness and justice. At present, the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, resulting in a fast-changing and turbulent international landscape, but the profound and lasting friendship between China and Russia will not change, nor will their sense of responsibility as major countries for the world and for the people. Despite complex and severe external challenges, bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade continues to advance, and large-scale joint projects remain stable in operation. The two sides should continue to promote the in-depth docking of BRI and the Eurasian Economic Union to provide dynamic support for promoting the high-quality development of their respective economies.- ，75。75，，-、、-。、、，，，、。，，，，。，，。--，. Xi Jinping stressed that next year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and major global powers, China and Russia should deepen their comprehensive strategic cooperation, strengthen communication and coordination within multilateral frameworks such as the UN and the SCO, promote a correct view of World War II history, firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core, and jointly maintain global strategic stability and international fairness and justice. Xi Jinping pointed out that the BRICS cooperation mechanism is the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries and developing countries in the world today. China highly appreciates the work done by Russia as the chair country for this year's BRICS Summit and looks forward to having in-depth discussions with BRICS leaders on the future development of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, promoting consensus among all parties, sending positive signals of solidarity and cooperation, promoting strategic collaboration and practical cooperation in various fields among BRICS countries, and striving for more new opportunities for the Global South. ，80，80。，，、，，，，。，。，，，，，.

China is willing to import more high-quality agricultural products from Laos and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in areas such as education, culture and youth, Xi said. Congratulating Laos on successfully hosting the East Asian Leaders' meetings on cooperation, Xi said he welcomes Laos' active participation in BRICS cooperation. The two sides should strengthen multilateral coordination and collaboration to jointly safeguard international fairness and justice and the interests of developing countries, he said.- Among other things, Sisoulith -reiterated that the Lao party and government will unswervingly adhere to the one-China policy, firmly support the Chinese government in defending its national core interests and support China's legitimate position on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

He pointed out that efforts must focus on achieving the centennial goal of building a strong military, aiming to form joint operational capabilities based on network information systems, and accelerating the construction of a new military training system and put great effort into innovative development of integrated training. There should be a strong emphasis on unit integration training, tactical coordination training, and adversarial verification training, continuously pushing integrated training practices to develop in a more realistic and in-depth manner. ，，，，。、、，. He stressed the need to revise and improve training content in accordance with the military training outline, quickly cultivate a professional team proficient in integrated operations and training organisation, further standardise training management, improve the supporting conditions, and continuously deepen the training practice. It is crucial to ensure responsibility for training, improve institutional mechanisms, maintain a proper training conduct/atmosphere, and consolidate the collective strength to advance integrated training, striving to create a new era of realistic combat-oriented training. ，，、，，，。，，，，.

The report says: Song said that -both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China, and Chinese culture is the spiritual root and home for compatriots on both sides. We support Taiwan's cultural figures in countering ‘Taiwan independence in culture', promoting spiritual harmony between compatriots on both sides, and strengthening confidence in Chinese culture. This will provide strong spiritual power for the comprehensive advancement of building a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation, creating new successes in the development of Chinese culture on the journey toward national reunification. Liu Chao-shuan said that Chinese culture is the most fundamental connection between the two sides, having already been internalised in the hearts of the Taiwanese people. The ‘de-Sinicization' of Taiwan is worrying. He expressed hope for deepening cultural exchange and mutual understanding, carrying forward the values and wisdom of Chinese culture, and enhancing the foundation for peaceful cross-Strait development.- ，。--，，，、，。，，。--。，，，.

Xi's instructions were conveyed by Vice Premier He Lifeng during an event held in Tianjin on Sunday. -It is necessary to be pioneers in reform and opening up, further improve the systems and mechanisms for high-level opening to the outside world; actively participate in the high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, expand international cooperation, innovate methods for attracting investment, and help build the ‘Invest in China' brand; consolidate and enhance the industrial foundation of advanced manufacturing, promote the upgrading, greening, and digitalization of industries, create digital industries and future industries, and develop new productive forces in line with local conditions.- ，；--，，，--；，、、，、，.

For instance, this article discusses economic and practical cooperation under the BRICS umbrella. Some key points: The import and export trade volume between China and countries such as Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa grew from 960.21 billion RMB in 2009 to 4.32 trillion RMB in 2023, with an average annual growth rate of 11.3%. So far, the BRICS New Development Bank has approved more than 100 projects with a total amount of more than $34 billion. In 2021, the New Development Bank expanded its membership for the first time, accepting Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay as new members. At the end of August this year, at the 9th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the New Development Bank, Algeria was officially approved to become a member of the New Development Bank. The report also mentions China setting up the China-BRICS Science and Innovation Incubation Park for the New Era in Xiamen. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Zhang Hanhui, China's ambassador to Russia, on the BRICS+ Cooperation. He argues that the -BRICS cooperation mechanism is active and effective, and its shaping power has continued to increase. The BRICS countries have built multi-level, wide-ranging and all-round cooperation mechanisms led by the heads of state meeting, have actively expanded the breadth of cooperation through the ‘BRICS+' cooperation model, and have helped the Global South countries achieve the development goals of mutual achievement and common revitalization. The BRICS countries maintain close coordination on international affairs, defend fairness and justice, and promote world multipolarization. All parties support the development of the New Development Bank, promote the reform of the international financial system, and safeguard the development interests of the Global South countries; they have held a special video summit of BRICS leaders on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, insisted on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through dialogue and negotiation, and promoted political solutions to hotspot issues; and they have proposed ‘BRICS proposals' regarding counter-terrorism, climate change, energy, food, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and other domains of international governance, delivering a ‘strong voice from the South'.- ，。、、，-+-，、。，，。，，；，，；、、、、、--，--.

China actively supports Russia in doing a good job during its rotating presidency, building consensus and pooling strength through the Kazan meeting, promoting the great development and great achievements of BRICS+ cooperation, and working together to promote an equal and orderly world multi-polarization and inclusive economic globalization, and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- 。，、，--、，，.

It adds that the -China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 covers 9 areas, including both existing areas of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and emerging areas with huge cooperation potential between the two sides. For the first time, China and ASEAN have reached the highest level of agreements in their respective economic and trade agreements, covering chapters on the digital economy, green economy, and supply chain connectivity. They have also achieved agreements on the highest level of standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures in their respective treaty practices. These upgrades will fully expand mutually beneficial cooperation between China and ASEAN in emerging fields, strengthen the integration of standards and rules between the two sides, jointly build a safe, stable, and efficient regional supply chain cooperation network, and elevate China-ASEAN win-win cooperation to a new level.- —3.0，，。9，—，。、、，。，，、，. The article adds: -Currently, the global problem of insufficient overall demand is more prominent, making the market a scarce resource for economic development. China and ASEAN's combined populations account for a quarter of the world's total, and their large-scale markets are the main foundation for promoting economic prosperity. The upgraded FTA will further integrate and connect the two large markets, certainly generating more significant economies of scale, industrial clustering effects, and development spillover effects-. 1/4，。、，、、. The article also makes the point that the completion of negotiations on the deal also -reflects the clear attitude of both sides to firmly support multilateralism and free trade.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 16: There is an article by Zheng Zongwen discussing the BRICS summit. The author writes that more than 30 countries have applied to join the BRICS cooperation mechanism, demonstrating the increasing appeal and attraction of the BRICS cooperation mechanism.- Zheng argues that the popularity of the BRICS is the -choice of history and the call of the times.- A key point that the author makes is: -One arrow is easily broken, but ten arrows are hard to bend.- ，. BRICS cooperation has always taken independence and self-reliance as its cornerstone, demonstrating responsibility for promoting human social progress. Faced with the choice between peaceful coexistence or confrontation and antagonism, BRICS countries adhere to the role positioning of -not starting from scratch/a new system/starting over, not engaging in camp confrontation, not wanting to replace anyone' (、、), uphold the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, equal treatment, unity and mutual assistance, openness and inclusiveness, and consensus through consultation, striving to seek the greatest common divisor and draw the largest concentric circle. From respecting each other's development paths to resolutely opposing interference in other countries' internal affairs, from jointly defending development rights to jointly exploring the path of modernization, every step forward in BRICS cooperation crystallises profound thinking on changing one's own destiny and pursuing reform and progress, and demonstrates the tremendous power of the collective awakening of the vast number of developing countries. At present, certain major countries, driven by geopolitical objectives, are seeking to coerce other countries to take sides and create camp confrontation, disregarding other countries' interests and engaging in self-centeredness, arbitrarily containing and suppressing emerging market countries and developing countries. The enlarged BRICS as the first echelon of the Global South will stride forward along the path of independence, self-reliance, and united self-strengthening, continuing to build a solid ‘golden defense line' to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，。，-、、-，、、、、，、。，，、，。，，，，，。----，、，--. The next bit talks about BRICS cooperation essentially being a win-win model, focussing on key areas, such as economic development, technology, production and supply chain cooperation, food security cooperation and sustainable development. -BRICS cooperation has always pursued fairness and justice, contributing wisdom to improving the global governance system. Faced with the contest between multilateralism and hegemony and power politics, BRICS countries represent the Global South countries in voicing more just opinions. From maintaining the authority and status of the United Nations to promoting reforms of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, BRICS countries, while maintaining the stability of the global governance system, support its timely reform and rectification of historical injustices. From holding the BRICS Leaders' Special Video Summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue, to China and Brazil proposing a ‘six-point consensus' on the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis, to establishing a ‘Friends of Peace' group for the Ukraine crisis, BRICS countries take the lead in speaking and acting justly, playing a constructive role in promoting the resolution of international and regional hotspot issues. From establishing a working group on cybersecurity issues to setting up the ‘China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center', BRICS countries actively engage with new domains of global governance, playing a positive role in ensuring equal participation of Global South countries in international affairs and safeguarding their rights. The enlarged BRICS is an expansion of the world's justice front, and will continue to contribute ‘golden wisdom' to promote the construction of a global governance pattern featuring joint consultation, joint construction and shared benefits.- ，。，。、，，，。，--，--，、，。-—-，，、。--，--.

Ford, chairman and chief executive officer of General Atlantic. Xi pointed out that China-U.S. ties are one of the world's most important bilateral relations, which bear on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. Xi said China has always handled the China-U.S. relationship based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and always believes that each country's success presents opportunities for the other.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: First, there's a report (full speech text - English text) on Li Qiang's remarks at the SCO meeting in Pakistan. Li called on the SCO members to move towards the following: First, efforts to build an even more solid political foundation. The fundamental reason why the SCO has stayed vibrant since its inception is that we have upheld the Shanghai Spirit, a vital political consensus, and endeavored to be trustworthy and reliable partners for each other. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, SCO cooperation in various fields will move forward steadily as long as the Shanghai Spirit remains entrenched. Second, efforts to provide more reliable security safeguards. As we speak, geopolitical conflicts, power politics and acts of bullying continue to undermine regional peace and stability, while on such fronts as cyber security and biosecurity, new threats and new challenges continue to emerge. No country is immune, and the only true security is security for all. Only by further improving the mechanisms and tools to tackle threats and challenges can we provide better safeguards for common development. Third, efforts to foster closer economic bonds. The SCO's continuous expansion of membership in recent years has created more notable economic complementarity among member states. By deepening our economic ties, resisting external attempts of pulling us apart, and tapping into and pooling our respective strengths in resources, market and industries, we will be able to foster even stronger synergy for development. Fourth, efforts to cultivate stronger emotional bonds. Our region is home to diverse and splendid civilizations, where different nations and cultures have interacted and converged with each other throughout the course of history and coexisted in harmony. This has been the source of popular support for cooperation among SCO member states. We need to further promote mutual learning among civilizations and cultural exchanges so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of SCO member states. Fifth, efforts to boost coordination in multilateral fora. Embracing 26 countries from three continents, the SCO family is a constructive force that carries important global influence. With our commitment to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and our enhanced communication and coordinated actions, SCO member states will better rally the developing world in promoting a more just and equitable global order. Li then made four proposals: First, enhancing strategic synergy for our shared purpose. Pursuing peaceful development is the abiding purpose of the SCO. We should stay grounded in the fundamental and long-term interests of the region, bear in mind the big picture and keep external disruptions at bay. Our best efforts must be directed toward mapping out the SCO's development strategy for the next decade and drawing up roadmaps for cooperation in various areas. Member states should step up strategic communication, bridge differences and boost mutual trust through dialogue, and pool strengths for unity. Second, expanding practical cooperation in line with development needs. The year 2025 will be the SCO Year of Sustainable Development. China stands ready to deepen cooperation with all sides in poverty reduction, digital economy and green development, to generate sustained momentum for development. We should continue to draw impetus from openness and cooperation, boost the region's trade and investment facilitation and connectivity, and maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains. Active efforts should be made to establish an SCO development bank in order to provide financing support for countries in their pursuit of development. Third, proactively addressing major risks. Our region continues to face grave security issues. The fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism remains a long-term, arduous task, and various challenges lie ahead in such areas as safeguarding information security and combating transnational organized crime. China stands ready to work with all sides to strengthen intelligence sharing and joint operations, move faster to build a universal center to address the challenges and threats to the security of SCO member states and the Anti-Drug Center, and strive for major outcomes at next year's summit, so that we can put in place new platforms and a new architecture for regional security cooperation. Fourth, expanding people-to-people exchange to meet popular expectations. We should fully leverage the role of the SCO Committee on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, develop an effective SCO digital education alliance, organize excellent events under our flagship programs such as the Forum on People-to-People Friendship and the Forum on Friendship Cities, the Forum on Women, and the Art Exhibition of Young Artists, and increase our peoples' participation and sense of fulfillment, to keep people-to-people friendship strong for generations to come.

Military Theory Conference - Li Qiang Meets Kyrgyz & Tajik PMs - World Buddhist Forum - 6 trln in Stimulus Expected? - Lashing out at Malabar Drills -...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, October 16, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is on Xi Jinping's instructions at the military theory work conference, which was held in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday. Xi -emphasised that the modernization of military theory is an important part of the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, and plays a crucial leading role in the development of the cause of strengthening the armed forces. In the new era and on a new journey, as the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, a new military revolution is rapidly advancing, and China's security and development needs are undergoing profound changes, the task of achieving the goal of strengthening the military has become more urgent, and it is necessary to comprehensively strengthen military theory work.- ，，。，，，，，. -It is necessary to implement the thought on strengthening the military in the new era; implement the military strategic guidelines for the new era; persist in combining the basic principles of Marxism with the practice of building the people's army; draw from the essence of China's excellent traditional military culture; focus on the battlefield, the troops, and the future; keep a close eye on changes in technology, warfare, and adversaries; grasp firmly the research on major issues of war preparedness and military building under new historical conditions; optimize top-level design for military theory innovations; improve the model of relevant research and enhance the application of military theory; and build a modern military theory system with Chinese characteristics so as to provide scientific support and leadership for achieving the PLA's centennial goal and accelerating the building of a world-class military.- ，，，，、、，、、，，，，，，、. Zhang Youxia was present at the meeting and also delivered a speech, emphasising Xi's message. Subscribe now The other top story on the page is about Qiushi's publication of a speech by Xi at a symposium on literature and art on October 15, 2014. This is quite a famous speech, but for those who might not have followed back then, I'll do a full breakdown of the report. If you want to read a full translation of the speech by Rogier Creemers back then, here's the link. -The speech emphasised that literary and artistic undertakings are important undertakings of the Party and the people, and the literary and artistic front is an important front of the Party and the people. Literature and art are the clarion call for the advancement of the times, and they best represent the style of an era and are most able to shape the atmosphere of an era. To achieve the ‘two centenary' goals and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the role of literature and art is irreplaceable, and there is much for literary and artistic workers to do. The majority of literary and artistic workers should recognize the status and role of literature and art from such a perspective, recognize the historical mission and responsibility they bear, adhere to the people-centred creative approach, strive to create more excellent works worthy of the times, carry forward the Chinese spirit, gather Chinese strength, and inspire people of all ethnic groups across the country to vigorously move forward into the future.- ，，。，，。--、，，。，，，，、，. -The speech pointed out that achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the prosperity and flourishing of Chinese culture. It is essential to place great importance on and fully leverage the significant role of literature, art, and cultural workers. Both history and reality have proven that the Chinese nation possesses immense cultural creativity. At every major historical juncture, culture can sense the changes in national fortunes, stand at the forefront of the times, and sound the clarion call of the era, cheering millions of people and our great motherland. Raising the banner of spirit, establishing spiritual pillars, and building a spiritual home all cannot be separated from literature and art. Writers and artists in our country should become the forerunners, pioneers, and advocates of the times, and write and record the great practice of the people and the progressive requirements of the times through more literary and artistic works with strength, morality, and warmth.- ，。。，。，、、，、。、、，。、、，、、，、. The next paragraph stresses the importance of -creating and producing excellent works that are worthy of our great nation and great era.- It says: -The central task of literary and artistic work must be the creation and production of excellent works. We must strive to create and produce more excellent works that spread contemporary Chinese values, embody the spirit of Chinese culture, reflect the aesthetic pursuits of the Chinese people, and organically unify ideological content, artistic quality, and aesthetic appeal. Innovation is the lifeblood of literature and art.- ，、、，、、。. Xi then stressed the importance of -the originality of literature and art- and called to -strive to cultivate a group of influential literary and artistic leaders in various fields, and build a large team of literary and artistic talents.- The next bit is important to remember: -The speech pointed out that socialist literature and art, in essence, is the literature and art of the people. Literature and art must reflect the voice of the people and must adhere to the fundamental direction of serving the people and serving socialism. This is a basic requirement put forward by the Party for the literary and artistic front, and it is also the key to determining the future and destiny of China's literary and artistic undertakings. First, the people need literature and art. To meet the people's growing spiritual and cultural needs, we must focus on cultural development and increase the spiritual and cultural wealth of society. Second, literature and art need the people. Whether excellent works can be produced fundamentally depends on whether they can write for the people, express emotions for the people, and reflect the thoughts of the people. Third, literature and art must love the people. There are a hundred or even a thousand methods for literary and artistic creation, but the most fundamental, crucial, and reliable method is to be rooted in the people and in real life. A good work should be one that withstands the evaluation of the people, experts, and the test of the market. It should prioritise social benefits but also achieve a balance between social and economic benefits. Literature and art should not be slaves to the market and should not be tainted with the stench of money.- ，，，。，、。，。，。，，。，。，、、。，。、，、、、。，、、，，。，. The speech pointed out that the Chinese spirit is the soul of socialist literature and art. Every era has its own spirit. Literature and art are projects that shape the soul, and literary and artistic workers are the engineers of the soul. Literary and artistic workers should uphold the banner of core socialist values, fully recognize the responsibilities on their shoulders, and vividly and creatively reflect these core values in their artistic creations. Patriotism should be the main theme of literary and artistic creation, guiding the people to establish and uphold the correct views of history, the nation, the state, and culture, while enhancing their sense of pride and confidence in being Chinese. Through literary and artistic works, we should convey truth, goodness, and beauty, and transmit positive and virtuous values, guiding people to aspire to and pursue a life that values morality, respects morality, and upholds morality. We should inherit and promote China's excellent traditional culture and Chinese aesthetic spirit in line with the conditions of the new era. ，。。，。，，、。，、、、，。，，、、。，. The final paragraph calls to strengthen the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

Subscribe now Page 7: There's a report based on data released by the State Taxation Administration on individual income taxation. It informs that more than 70 percent of people earning an income did not have to pay tax in China last year. Individuals with an annual income of less than 100,000 yuan ($13,600), did not have to pay personal income tax last year. Li Ping, the deputy director of the STA's tax science research institute explained -in 2018, China revised the Individual Income Tax Law for the seventh time, raising the basic deduction standard from the original 3,500 yuan per person per month to 5,000 yuan. At the same time, six special additional deductions were established for children's education, support for the elderly, housing loan interest, housing rent, continuing education, and major illness medical treatment. In 2022, a special additional deduction for the care of infants under 3 years old was added, and in 2023, the standards for three special additional deductions for the care of infants under 3 years old, children's education, and support for the elderly were increased.- The report also informs that among the individual income tax payers in China, high-income earners with an annual income of more than 1 million yuan account for about 1% of the number of taxpayers, and the individual income tax declared and paid by this group accounts for more than 50% of the total individual income tax. The individual income tax paid by the top 10% accounts for more than 90% of the total individual income tax. While on this subject of taxation, do check out this Bloomberg report. It says: -China has begun enforcing a long-overlooked tax on overseas investment gains by the country's ultra-rich, according to people familiar with the matter. Some wealthy individuals in major Chinese cities were told in recent months to conduct self-assessments or summoned by tax authorities for meetings to evaluate potential payments, including those in arrears from past years, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The move underscores growing urgency within the government to expand its sources of revenue as land sales tumble and growth slows. It also aligns with President Xi Jinping's ‘common prosperity' campaign to create a more equal distribution of wealth in the world's second-largest economy. The individuals contacted are facing up to 20% levies on investment gains, and some are also subject to penalties on overdue payments, said the people, adding that the final amount is negotiable.- Another report on the page informs that the inter-provincial electricity spot market has officially begun operation on Tuesday. This is a key step towards building a unified electricity market system. The State Grid said that building on the existing medium- and long-term electricity trading mechanism, the spot market allows for day-ahead and intra-day transactions across provinces. Since the pilot use started in January 2022, the market has been running smoothly and steadily for 31 consecutive months. Up to date, it has achieved full coverage of areas operated by the State Grid and the western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with over 6,000 trading entities and a cumulative transaction volume of over 88 billion kilowatt-hours, of which more than 44 percent are clean energy sources. Share Tracking People's Daily First, there's too much in this to offer a summary, but if you are interested, do check out Xinhua Institute's new report: ‘Eight Major Steps' Heralds Promising New Decade of Belt and Road Cooperation. Second, check out this report from Caixin discussing the potential of the central government possibly raising 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds to support local governments. -​​China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds over three years as part of its efforts to buttress the slowing economy through fiscal stimulus, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told Caixin. The funds will be partly used to help local governments resolve their off-the-books debts, according to the sources. Speculation about the size of China's new fiscal stimulus has been rife since the Ministry of Finance pledged at a press briefing Saturday to help local governments relieve debt pressure without specifying the amount. The central government will expand the quota for local authorities to bring their hidden debt onto the books by a ‘relatively large scale,' Finance Minister Lan Foan said at the briefing. By helping manage the tens of trillions of yuan of off-the-books debt, the measure could free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents, he noted. Lan also announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers in a bid to revive the country's real estate sector, which has now been in a slump for more than three years. Part of the funding will come from local governments issuing special-purpose bonds, which are typically used to finance infrastructure and public welfare projects. Other fiscal measures will include injecting capital into China's major state-owned commercial banks and subsidizing ‘important groups,' such as students, Lan said. The central government is looking into additional fiscal policies, the finance minister said, adding that it has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt.- SCMP also has a very useful explainer on when we are likely to get more details on this stimulus. It says: -When talking on Saturday about introducing a one-time, large-scale, debt-ceiling increase for local governments to swap their hidden debts, Lan said specifics on the amount of money will be disclosed after the proper legal procedures. Historically speaking, the NPC Standing Committee usually holds a chairman's meeting in the second week after the National Day holiday, and the time and agenda of the upcoming legislature gathering are decided. Thus, more details of China's fiscal stimulus might be disclosed in late October or early November after the NPC Standing Committee meeting. Last year, the NPC Standing Committee meeting was held from October 20-24 and a resolution was passed to issue an additional 1 trillion yuan (US$ 141.3 billion) worth of treasury bonds. In December, there will be another Politburo meeting focused on economic issues and the Central Economic Work Conference will likely take place. At that time, more signals about raising the headline fiscal deficit and bond issuance for the next year should come to light. Many economists expect that the size of the overall stimulus package might be counted in the trillions of yuan. But Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, said China's policymakers may not announce an overall figure at all. ‘First, they don't need to come up with such a number for the [NPC] to approve. Second, it's hard to come up with such a number, as the line between fiscal, monetary and industrial policies is often blurred in China,- he said in a note on Saturday. And it would be politically incorrect to be seen flooding the economy with money in China, especially after the ‘4 trillion yuan stimulus' in 2008, he added. Back then, the number was first announced by the former premier at a State Council executive meeting and disclosed to the public a few days later.- Third, Xinhua reports that China unveiled a national mid and long-term development program for space science on Tuesday, which will guide the country's planning of space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050. -The program, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office. The program outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap. The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, panoramic view of Sun-Earth, habitable planets, and biological and physical sciences in space, Ding Chibiao, vice president of the CAS, said at the press conference.- The report adds: -In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the space station operation, implementing the manned lunar exploration project, and the fourth phase of its lunar exploration program as well as the planetary exploration project. Five to eight space science satellite missions will be approved during the period, according to the program. The international lunar research station initiated by China will be constructed during the second phase from 2028 to 2035, and approximately 15 scientific satellite missions will be carried out during this period. In the third phase from 2036 to 2050, China will launch over 30 space science missions.- -In the next decade, China's space station will focus on cutting-edge technologies, addressing major national needs, and promoting the health and well-being of its people. It will focus on four research areas, namely, space life and human body research, microgravity physics, space astronomy and Earth science, and new space technologies and applications, according to Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA. China plans to launch a 2-meter caliber space telescope to explore the forefront issues in space astronomy. In order to support its operation and research, scientific centers have been established at Peking University, the Yangtze River Delta region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, aiming to achieve breakthroughs in cosmology, galaxy science, as well as the study of celestial bodies in the Milky Way and the solar system, Lin said.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Special Report: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. I am thrilled to share the publication of my latest paper: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China. Share Tracking People's Daily This paper recommends a pathway for India to arrive at a new modus vivendi in its relationship with China. I begin by providing an overview of the current state of the relationship and structural factors that are shaping its direction. Thereafter, the paper provides a detailed assessment of the Indian debate on China and Chinese discourse on India before recommending a way forward. In essence, I argue that volatility is likely to be the norm in the India-China dyad owing to certain structural factors. However, it is in the interest of both sides to ensure a certain amount of stability and predictability in the relationship. In order to do so, the paper contends that Indian strategy should be focussed on expanding national power and dealing with China from a position of strength, while building new mechanisms of engagement and scrutiny. The paper ends with six broad recommendations for Indian policy going ahead. I hope that these serve as a starting point for a robust debate on Indian policy, what is a desirable relationship with China, and what India should be doing to ensure that we get there.

Xinhua reports: Wang -called for an immediate, complete and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages.- He also -called for unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wang said that the international community is deeply worried about the prolonged escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Noting that all lives are equally precious, regardless of nationality or ethnicity, Wang said that the humanitarian disaster in Gaza must end and that countering violence with violence cannot truly address the legitimate concerns of all parties. Pointing out that the conflict in Gaza has once again demonstrated that the Palestinian question remains a core issue in the Middle East, Wang said the voices of the international community are clear, which hope all parties return to the political path of a -two-state solution- as soon as possible. Doing so would realize the peaceful coexistence of Israel and Palestine and the harmonious coexistence of the Jewish and Arab peoples. This is the right way to achieve stability and lasting security for all parties, including Israel, Wang said.- -Wang said that China is highly concerned about the tension between Israel and Iran and believes that renewed conflict and turmoil in the region serves the interests of no one. Wang stated that China urges all parties to proceed with caution to prevent falling into a vicious circle.

As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has always stood on the side of peace, international law and truth and will continue to play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation and restoring peace in the region, Wang said. Wang stressed that United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is mandated by Security Council resolutions to carry out peacekeeping missions, adding that the Israeli side should take concrete measures to ensure the safety of UNIFIL personnel.- The Times of Israel notes that -Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that Iran is a threat to the Middle East and the entire world.- -‘We expect that China will express a balanced and fair position in relation to the war that was imposed on Israel,' says the Israeli readout, ‘which accurately reflects who are terrorist elements in our region and who is the state that protects itself against attacks by those terrorists.' They discuss the importance of economic cooperation, and Katz notes the 20,000 Chinese workers who remained in Israel during the war. ‘We agreed to continue the relationship and work together to strengthen the ties between the countries based on the long-standing friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people,' says Katz's office.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua's report on Wang's call with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi has Wang saying that -China will continue to demonstrate a sense of duty as a responsible major country and play a constructive role in promoting the cooling down of the conflict-. It adds: -The two sides spoke highly of China-Iran relations, emphasizing a commitment to maintaining exchanges at all levels and promoting practical cooperation. Araghchi said Iran is deeply concerned about the risk of an overall escalation of the current regional situation and does not want to see a further expansion of conflict. Iran highly values China's influence in international affairs and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to cool down the situation through diplomatic means, Araghchi said, adding that Israel should avoid taking risks and proceed cautiously.- -Wang said that the negative impacts of the current Gaza conflict are clearly spilling over, and regional tensions are escalating continuously. China has always advocated for resolving hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation and opposes exacerbating tensions, expanding conflicts and taking military adventures, Wang said, calling on all parties to make more efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wang said that China will proceed from the merits of the issue, strengthen communication among all parties, build a broader international consensus, and pool the strengths of all parties. Wang said that China is pleased to see the Iranian government carry out mediation diplomacy, enhance understanding with relevant parties and improve relations with regional countries. China supports the historic reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and is willing to jointly push for a positive outcome from the second meeting of the China-Iran-Saudi Arabia Trilateral Joint Committee to consolidate the momentum of reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia and inject positive energy into regional peace and stability, Wang added.- Subscribe now Two other stories to note.

He called for China-UNDP cooperation in areas such as rural revitalization, green development, digital economy, South-South cooperation and trilateral cooperation. Page 6: There's a report based on a presser yesterday discussing the support for private enterprises. The report informs that China currently has 141,000 specialised and innovative SMEs and 14,600 ‘Little Giant' enterprises. ‘Wang Jiangping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that in terms of technological innovation, this year, central government funding will support more than 1,000 key ‘Little Giant' enterprises to create new drivers of growth, tackle new technologies, develop new products, and strengthen the supporting capacity of industrial chains. Through special re-loan projects, more than 1,100 ‘Little Giant' enterprises will be supported in technical transformation and equipment upgrades. In terms of digital transformation, the second batch of pilot cities for the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises has recently been selected. The central government has allocated 2.7 billion yuan, with more than 12 billion yuan invested by local governments. Next year, another batch of pilot cities will be selected, and it is expected that more than 40,000 small and medium-sized enterprises nationwide will receive support for digital transformation.- ，，1000--、、、。，1100--。，，27，120，，4。 On financing, the report says: -The National Financial Regulatory Administration will focus on promoting financial institutions to increase support for the real economy, accelerate the improvement of the coordination mechanism for supporting small and micro-enterprise financing, and help alleviate financing difficulties for small and micro-enterprises. The State Administration for Market Regulation, together with relevant departments, will innovate and implement quality-based financing credit enhancement policies, promoting a credit enhancement mechanism based on enterprises' technological capabilities and quality qualifications, improving the accessibility and convenience of financing for small and micro-enterprises. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will actively provide small and medium-sized enterprises with one-stop services for talent introduction, financing connections, and digital empowerment, effectively helping enterprises reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance quality.- ，，。，、，. 、、，、、. Later the article says: -The draft law on promoting the private economy, which is currently open for public consultation, is considered an important measure to boost the confidence of private enterprises. Deputy Minister of Justice Hu Weilie said that the draft law on promoting the private economy, for the first time, includes ‘the two unwaverings' and ‘cultivating and promoting entrepreneurial spirit' into the law, and clearly states that ‘promoting the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy is a major policy that the country will adhere to for the long term.' This fully demonstrates that promoting the development of the private economy is a fundamental policy that the Party and the country will consistently and persistently uphold. Once these principles are enshrined in law, they will gain stability and binding force, which will certainly promote the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy, and create a better environment for the joint development of all types of ownership, including the private economy.- -。，‘'‘'，‘、、，'，。，、、，. -In response to issues such as local protectionism and market fragmentation, more stringent institutional measures with binding force will be introduced and implemented. The revision of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People's Republic of China will be accelerated to prevent and curb unfair competition. The implementation of the Fair Competition Review System will be further strengthened, promoting the removal of policies and measures that hinder a unified market and fair competition, thereby unlocking the potential of China's vast market. Efforts will be made to strengthen comprehensive governance of market order, with a focus on cracking down on illegal activities such as intellectual property infringement, trade secret theft, and the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, in order to enhance business vitality through a well-ordered market environment.- 、，。《》，。《》，，。，、，.

Xinhua reports that the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that -the successfully concluded election is ‘significant' for implementing the principle of ‘patriots administering Macao' and advancing the successful practice of ‘one country, two systems' with Macao characteristics.- The report adds that an article on the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's website said that -Sam had received broad public support for his deep affection and sense of responsibility toward Macao and the country, willingness to collaborate with various social groups and sectors, and commitment to promoting socio-economic development and improving the well-being of Macao residents. Sam, who previously served as president of Macao's Court of Final Appeal, has handled a number of major cases and effectively safeguarded national security and the constitutional order of the Macao SAR, the article said. The Macao society has confidence in Sam to safeguard both the overall interests of the country and the fundamental interests of Macao, and ensure the steady and sustained practice of -one country, two systems- with Macao characteristics, it added. The article also said Sam demonstrates his capability of adapting to changes and seeking transformation, and the will to seize opportunities and pursue reform.- There is also a front page commentary on Sam's election. It talks about the election process, saying that -all sectors of Macau society and the general public actively participated and exercised their democratic rights in accordance with the law. The entire election process was open, fair, just, legal, stable and orderly…- The article says that Sam was able to garner support because of six planks: Being patriotic and loving Macau, having unwavering dedication Being skilled at uniting people and pooling wisdom Being focused on development, seeking truth and being pragmatic Being people-oriented, with a strong emphasis on livelihood Safeguarding national security, maintaining stability Being pioneering and innovative and courageous in breaking through 、；、；、；、；、；、……，，、。 The article then basically doubles down on the significance of the one country, two systems framework. It says that the election -fully reflects the Macau society's heartfelt support for ‘one country, two systems'...- It adds that -practice has fully proven that ‘one country, two systems' is a great initiative under socialism with Chinese characteristics and the best institutional arrangement for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability after the return of Hong Kong and Macau to the motherland, and it must be adhered to for a long time'.- ，--，、，。 Further, the piece reiterates that -the destinies of Hong Kong, Macau, and the mainland have always been closely linked, and national development has always been the strongest foundation for the development of Hong Kong and Macau.-、，、. Subscribe now Finally, there's a long, long article under the byline Jin Sheping , discussing economic policy shifts and basically calling for greater confidence. The article begins by making the case that China's long-term fundamentals remain strong. It says that through this year, -overall economic performance has been stable with steady progress; however, some new situations and problems have also emerged-. --，、，，。 The piece begins talking about the September 26 Politburo meeting, which discussed the economy. The meeting called to -effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency of doing a good job in economic work- and -strive to complete the goals and tasks of economic and social development throughout the year.- 926，。，，----. Section one then says that in order to strive to achieve the year's goals, -we must strengthen our confidence in overcoming difficulties-. Then we get some data points from the holidays: The trade-in program for home appliances during the National Day holiday led to the sales of eight categories of home appliances under the program reaching 17.835 billion yuan. During the seven-day National Day holiday, domestic tourist numbers and total tourist spending increased by 10.2% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2019. The article then says: -Currently, all regions and departments are conscientiously implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. A series of measures to support stable economic growth and high-quality development have been introduced in quick succession, effectively guiding societal expectations and strengthening confidence in China's economy.- ，，，，. Then we get some sprinkling of positive information about the real estate sector and consumption vouchers and subsidies by local governments. For instance: -On October 1st, the online signing area of newly constructed commercial housing in Shandong reached 93,800 square meters, a year-on-year increase of 46.8%. From October 1st to noon on October 3rd, compared to the same period last year, Beijing saw a 92.5% increase in new home viewings and a doubling of purchase intentions, while second-hand home viewings increased by 104.1%. Some properties in Guangzhou received over 150 visits per day, a 200% increase compared to normal times.- 101，9.38，46.8%。1013，92.5%、2，104.1%。150，200%. This next macro assessment is worth reading: -On one hand, the external environment has become increasingly complex, severe, and uncertain, and the adverse effects of changes in the external environment on China's economy have increased. The ‘global economy is stagnant', said the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report, updated in July. Currently, major world economies are experiencing weak growth momentum and heavy debt burdens. Many have recently implemented interest rate cuts, and international market volatility has increased. Global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertainty and instability have increased. These factors will have an adverse impact on China through trade, investment, finance and other channels. In particular, it is important to note that some external forces are trying to contain, blockade, and suppress China, deliberately attempting to hinder the historical process of building a socialist modern power in an all-round way and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Rhetoric about ‘decoupling and breaking supply chains' and ‘small yards with high walls' has become louder, reflecting the increasing complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment China faces. On the other hand, while China's economy continues to recover and improve, downward pressure has increased. Since the third quarter, key economic indicators such as industrial production, investment, and consumption have fluctuated. Some industries are experiencing ‘involution-style' competition, and some enterprises are struggling to adapt to optimization, upgrading, or transformation. In some cases, increased production has not led to increased revenue or profits, some companies face significant operational difficulties, and in some sectors hidden risks remain relatively high.- ，，。--，7《》。，、，，，，，、、。，、、，、。----，、、。，，，、，--，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The article then says that given all this, where does confidence come from? The answer is that first, -confidence comes from a deep understanding of (China's) development advantages.- -Since the new era, under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, China's economic development has formed significant advantages. Deeply understanding, utilizing, consolidating, and developing these important advantages is not only a key support for the long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy but also an essential foundation for solving the challenges faced in economic development. China's development benefits from five strategic advantages: the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the notable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the solid foundation accumulated through sustained rapid development, a long-term stable social environment, and the spiritual strength of self-confidence and self-reliance. Additionally, China possesses the institutional advantage of a socialist market economy, the demand advantages of a super-large-scale market, the supply advantages of a complete supporting industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs, which have laid a solid foundation for responding to risks and challenges…History and reality have repeatedly proven that the creation and continuation of China's economic miracle is inseparable from the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the fundamental guarantee of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. On the path forward, as long as we steadfastly uphold the Party's comprehensive leadership and give full play to the role of the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the giant ship of China's economy will surely ride the wind and waves and sail towards a brighter future.- ，，。、、，，。--：、、、、。，、、、，。，--，，，；，，，、，、，，……，，。，，，，. Second, confidence comes from -a deep understanding of the development trend.- Under this point, we basically get selective economic data citation, along with the argument that China's -innovation power and development vitality are surging-, with factors supporting the development of new quality productive and high-quality development surging. This paragraph is useful with quotes from Xi. The reason I point this out is because it is indicative of deep anxieties. Think of this as a pep-talk by a coach at the back of a terrible inning to pick up the team. -What determines the prospects of economic development is never how many difficulties there are, but how we view difficulties, how we resolve to solve them, and how we deal with them. Only by looking at the long-term and trends from a development perspective can we overcome difficulties more effectively. ‘China's development prospects are bright, and we have the confidence and assurance to say so'. ‘The world today is undergoing unprecedented changes not seen in a century, but time and momentum are on our side. This is where our determination and confidence lie.' ‘When have there not been difficulties? We tackle them one by one, year after year, and the Chinese nation has been doing this for over 5,000 years. Overcoming challenges is crucial to boosting confidence.' General Secretary Xi Jinping's profound expositions contain a profound ‘grand historical perspective'. Based on the ‘grand historical perspective', we can more deeply understand that the ‘long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy have not changed and will not change'.- ，，、、。、，。-，。--，，，。--？，、，5000。，。-，--。--，--。 The second section calls to accurately grasp the focus of policy measures. First the section talks about investments in water conservancy projects. It says that from January to August this year, national investment in water conservancy construction reached 801.94 billion yuan, an increase of 10.7% compared to the high level of the same period last year, setting a new record. The number of water conservancy projects implemented and the number of jobs created both exceeded those of the same period last year, making significant contributions to promoting sustained economic growth and stable development. Among these, more than 7,800 water conservancy construction projects were arranged with newly issued national bonds, with investments of 303.77 billion yuan completed. 18，8019.4，10.7%，，、，。，7800，3037.7. -As the external environment becomes more complex and severe, the role of domestic demand in ensuring China's stable economic growth has become more prominent. 700 billion yuan in central budget investment has already been allocated, and all of the 700 billion yuan designated for ‘two major' constructions from the 1 trillion yuan of ultra long-term special government bonds has been fully allocated to projects…Since the beginning of this year, the proactive fiscal policy has been moderately strengthened and improved in quality and efficiency. The role of government investment has been leveraged and efforts have been intensified to lay the foundation, benefit the long-term, make up for shortcomings, and adjust the structure. High-quality investment is becoming an important driving force for promoting high-quality development. Additionally, the 300 billion yuan in national bond funds supporting the ‘two new' initiatives has been fully allocated, providing stronger support for expanding domestic demand. ，。7000，1--7000……，、，，、、、，。，--3000，. -To strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks, we must increase the intensity of countercyclical policy adjustments, strengthen the overall coordination and systematic integration of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and tax policy, monetary and financial policy, investment and consumption, and income distribution; strengthen the coordinated innovation of policy tools, grasp the timing and effectiveness of policy implementation, amplify the policy combination effect, and enhance the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation.- ，，、、、，，，，. The article then signals support for the private economy, by talking about the release of the draft Private Economy Promotion Law, which is open for public comments until November 8. The article also mentions the issuance of living allowances to people. It also references the Guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Implementing the Employment First Strategy. It says that this is the first time since the new era that the central government has issued a guiding document to promote employment. Also, in order to achieve the goals for the year, the article calls to maintain -the bottom line of people's livelihood, strengthen assistance and support for low-income people, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food and water, electricity, gas and heat, and effectively ensure food and agricultural production to ensure national food security.- The final section of the article calls on everyone to take on responsibilities and act. The goal is to break through the -stubborn diseases of formalism and bureaucratism.- -Reform the defects in thinking, eliminate chronic problems in work style, and promote a spirit of practical action. In the current situation, to truly enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency in doing economic work well, we must resolutely overcome simplistic thinking, inertial thinking, and responsibility-avoiding thinking, and use ideological breakthroughs to promote practical action and responsibility-taking. Resolutely break the negative mindset of ‘just getting by without striving for excellence' in doing work, and discard the selfish attitude of ‘not taking risks, taking up fewer tasks'; resolutely eliminate the dependency on ‘first consulting the old almanacs (sort of like resorting to past experiences)' when encountering issues, and discard the lax approach of ‘lying flat and watching, being conservative and procrastinating'; resolutely break the stability-seeking mentality of ‘first thinking about avoiding responsibility, not thinking about taking responsibility' when doing things, and discard the mistaken understanding that ‘doing more leads to more mistakes, doing less leads to fewer mistakes, doing nothing leads to no mistakes'... Great winds and waves are precisely the touchstones for testing responsibility and commitment. Setting good benchmarks for selecting and appointing people, and encouraging cadres to better assume responsibilities, can cultivate firm doers and pragmatists for the construction of Chinese-style modernization, achieve success through overcoming difficulties, open up paths in daring to forge ahead, and develop a bright future for China's economy through unremitting struggle.- 、、。，，、、，。-、-，-、-；--，-、-；-、-，-、、-……，。，，、，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily While on the economy, I am still catching up with the developments of the past 10 days or so. Anyway, Caixin reports: China's finance ministry on Saturday announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers, and promised intensive support to help localities with their hidden debts… ‘Countercyclical' fiscal measures are ‘by no means' limited to those announced Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Foan said at a press conference on the same day, adding that policymakers are studying other policy tools. For example, the central government has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt, he noted…Tools including local government special-purpose bonds (SPBs), special funds and tax policies will be used in tandem to arrest the slide in the real estate market, Lan said. The central government will allow local authorities to tap their SPB proceeds, mainly used for funding government projects, to buy back undeveloped land from developers, according to Liao Min, a vice finance minister. In some regions, SPB proceeds can also be used to increase the reserve of land for sale, Liao said.- On local government debts, the report adds: -At the press briefing, Lan said that the central government had allowed local governments to use bond quotas of 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) and more than 2.2 trillion yuan in 2024 and 2023, respectively, to resolve hidden debt and pay overdue arrears to businesses. He added that the central government will step up support for local governments to deal with their debts by expanding the quota for swapping off-the-books for on-the-books debt. This will be a one-time expansion of a ‘relatively large scale,' the minister said, noting that it can free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents. ‘This forthcoming policy will be the most significant measure introduced in recent years to support (hidden) debt resolution,' Lan said, noting that it will be detailed after going through legal procedures. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also pledged to issue special treasury bonds to help major state-owned commercial banks supplement their core capital. The program is already in the works, Liao said. A cross-department work group, including the MOF, is waiting for banks to hand in their capital injection plans, he said, noting that the lenders will publish their plans according to rules for listed companies.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There is a confirmation that Li will be heading to Pakistan for the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting. Also, there is a brief report informing that Li Xiaoxin, who is the deputy chief of the Organisation Department, led a delegation to Russia from October 9 to 12. Page 3: There's a report with data on China's shipbuilding industry. It says: -From January to September, the shipbuilding completion volume was 36.34 million deadweight tons, an increase of 18.2% year-on-year; new orders were 87.11 million deadweight tons, an increase of 51.9% year-on-year; and as of the end of September, the backlog of orders was 193.30 million deadweight tons, an increase of 44.3% year-on-year. From January to September, China's three major shipbuilding indicators accounted for 55.1%, 74.7% and 61.4% of the global total in terms of deadweight tons.- Subscribe now Page 8: There is an article by Yang Wanming, Party Secretary and President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). He is writing in the context of Xi's speech recently marking the 70th anniversary of the CPAFFC. In that speech, Xi had said: -People are the creators of history, and building a community with a shared future for mankind is the future of the people of all countries in the world. China is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with friends from all countries, give full play to the unique role of people-to-people diplomacy, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- He had then made three points: First, we should build a broad consensus on promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind in the spirit of ‘shared responsibility as dwellers of the same planet'…China is willing to work with all countries in the world to promote the common values ​​of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and an inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, and make the planet Earth a peaceful, friendly and harmonious home for all-. --，。，，。--，--。，，，。，、、、、、，、、、，、，、、. Second, we must gather a strong force to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through the concept of win-win cooperation. The Communist Party of China is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also a party that seeks progress for mankind and world harmony. I proposed the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and the GDI, GSI and GCI, all in order to promote the building of a better world and create a better life for people of all countries. The practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind for more than 10 years has brought many inspirations. One of the important ones is that only through win-win cooperation can we accomplish things, do good things, and do great things. China does not pursue self-centered modernization, and welcomes more foreign friends to actively participate in China's modernization process. The country is committed to providing new opportunities for global development with its achievements in modernization, and promoting a global modernization that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity to better benefit people of all countries.- ，。、，、。、、，，。10，，、、。，。，，，、、，. Third, with an open and inclusive mindset, we should embrace all civilizations to build a community with a shared future for humanity…Harmony while maintaining diversity is the law governing the occurrence and development of all things, as well as the principle behind the transmission and development of human civilization. Mutual exchange and learning are essential requirements for the advancement of civilization and serve as important driving forces for the progress of human civilization, as well as for world peace and development. Chinese civilization is an open system formed in constant exchange and mutual learning with other civilizations, and remains ever new through its inclusiveness. The Chinese nation is an open and inclusive nation, and the Chinese people are kind and friendly people. China is willing to work with all parties to practice the GCI, promote a view of civilization that emphasizes equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness, enhance understanding and deepen friendship through sincere communication, transcend civilizational barriers through civilizational exchanges, transcend civilizational conflicts through civilizational mutual learning, and promote the world to develop in the direction of a community with a shared future. ，。-，。-，。，。，。，。，，、、、，，、，、，. In the article today, Yang writes that more than 300 international friends from nearly 100 countries attended the CPAFFC anniversary event. He writes that over the years the association has established -friendly exchange and cooperation relationships with over 400 organizations and institutions in more than 150 countries, coordinated and promoted the establishment of over 3,000 pairs of friendly city (province/state) relationships between China and more than 140 countries, and built a ‘circle of friends' and ‘network of partners' spanning five continents…- ，。、，150400，1403000（），----，----，、. It has coordinated and mobilised resources from international friendly cities, multinational corporations, friendly organizations, and various other sectors. It has promoted the establishment of diverse mechanisms for local exchanges between China and foreign countries and vigorously advanced pragmatic cooperation in fields such as trade, education, technology, culture, ecology, health, poverty alleviation, and human resources training, etc… ，。，、、，，、、、、、、、，，. Yang concludes with a few points for work going forward: We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for people-to-people exchanges, give full play to the role of friendly organisations as communication channels, continue to consolidate old friends and make new friends, enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and people of other countries, and lay a solid foundation for social public opinion of friendship between China and foreign countries. We will work with friends from all over the world to build more bridges of pragmatic cooperation, give full play to the role of international sister cities as cooperation platforms, mobilize resources and strengths in various fields at home and abroad, constantly innovate cooperation methods, expand cooperation fields, and enhance cooperation effectiveness, so that local and sister cities cooperation can better benefit people of all countries. We will work with friends from all countries to build more bridges for cultural exchanges, give full play to the role of cultural exchanges as a bond to link hearts and enhance friendship, carry out wide-ranging, in-depth and diversified cultural exchanges and mutual learning activities between China and foreign countries, inspiring mutual resonance of hearts, and promoting the ‘heart-to-heart communication, emotional bonding, and strength gathering' of the Chinese and foreign people. We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for youth friendship, fully leveraging the fundamental and long-term role of youth exchanges in the development of relations between countries, inviting more foreign youth to come to China, encouraging more Chinese youth to go out into the world, and striving to cultivate successors for the cause of friendship between Chinese and foreign people. ——，，，，、，，。——，，，，，、、，。——，，，、，、、，，-、、-。——，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Former Taiwan president Tsai ing-wen is in Europe. She will be visiting the Czech Republic and Brussels. She was also expected to travel to London, but that seems to have been cancelled -due to the British Foreign Office, which worried that such a visit could compromise Foreign Secretary David Lammy's first official visit to China next week.- Meanwhile, Xinhua reports that the Eastern Theater Command has just launched its ‘Joint Sword-2024B' drills in the Taiwan Strait and the north, south and east of the island of Taiwan. -Li Xi, spokesperson for the theater command, said the drills involve vessels and planes closing in on the island from multiple directions and assaults by joint forces. The drills focus on joint sea-air combat readiness patrol, the blockade and control of key ports and areas, strikes on sea and land targets, and the seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, so as to test the joint real-combat capabilities of the forces of the command, Li said. The drills are a powerful deterrent to the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' elements, and are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national sovereignty and national unity, Li said.- This comes after President Lai Ching-te's Double Tenth speech. Some key remarks: The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. On this land, democracy and freedom are growing and thriving. The People's Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan. Taiwan is resolved in our commitment to upholding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and achieving global security and prosperity. We are willing to work with China on addressing climate change, combatting infectious diseases, and maintaining regional security to pursue peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For a long time now, countries around the world have supported China, invested in China, and assisted China in joining the World Trade Organization, thereby promoting China's economic development and enhancing its national strength. This was done out of the hope that China would join the rest of the world in making global contributions, that internally it would place importance on the livelihoods of the people, and that externally it would maintain peace. As we stand here today, international tensions are on the rise, and each day countless innocents are suffering injuries or losing their lives in conflict. We hope that China will live up to the expectations of the international community, that it will apply its influence and work with other countries toward ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. And we hope that it will take up its international responsibilities and, along with Taiwan, contribute to the peace, security, and prosperity of the region and the globe. In an era when the international landscape is becoming increasingly chaotic, Taiwan will become more calm, more confident, and stronger; it will become a force for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. I believe that a stronger democratic Taiwan is not only the ideal of our 23 million people, but also the expectation of the international community. Beijing responded with anger. There's this latest Xinhua commentary, which says: -Recently, Lai continued to brazenly preach his ‘two states' claim, openly clamoring that ‘Taiwan has sovereignty' and that ‘the People's Republic of China (PRC) has no right to represent Taiwan'...The Taiwan regional leader repeatedly referred to the mainland as ‘China.' He has been playing with concepts and confusing right and wrong. By attempting to highlight the political differences between the two sides of the Strait and break up their historical ties, Lai fabricated the false concept that ‘the Republic of China equals Taiwan' out of thin air to further advance his ‘Taiwan independence' plot. Lai has been indulging in outright secessionist and blatantly provocative remarks. Certainly, his increasingly hostile words lead nowhere, only escalating tensions and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. If Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities continue going against the historical trend and pursuing their separatist line, they would plunge people in Taiwan into serious calamity.- Subscribe now	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/china-vietnam-deals-taiwan-drills	2024-10-13T19:42:29-07:00
