Special Report: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. I am thrilled to share the publication of my latest paper: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China. Share Tracking People's Daily This paper recommends a pathway for India to arrive at a new modus vivendi in its relationship with China. I begin by providing an overview of the current state of the relationship and structural factors that are shaping its direction. Thereafter, the paper provides a detailed assessment of the Indian debate on China and Chinese discourse on India before recommending a way forward. In essence, I argue that volatility is likely to be the norm in the India-China dyad owing to certain structural factors. However, it is in the interest of both sides to ensure a certain amount of stability and predictability in the relationship. In order to do so, the paper contends that Indian strategy should be focussed on expanding national power and dealing with China from a position of strength, while building new mechanisms of engagement and scrutiny. The paper ends with six broad recommendations for Indian policy going ahead. I hope that these serve as a starting point for a robust debate on Indian policy, what is a desirable relationship with China, and what India should be doing to ensure that we get there.

Xinhua reports: Wang -called for an immediate, complete and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages.- He also -called for unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wang said that the international community is deeply worried about the prolonged escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Noting that all lives are equally precious, regardless of nationality or ethnicity, Wang said that the humanitarian disaster in Gaza must end and that countering violence with violence cannot truly address the legitimate concerns of all parties. Pointing out that the conflict in Gaza has once again demonstrated that the Palestinian question remains a core issue in the Middle East, Wang said the voices of the international community are clear, which hope all parties return to the political path of a -two-state solution- as soon as possible.

They discuss the importance of economic cooperation, and Katz notes the 20,000 Chinese workers who remained in Israel during the war. ‘We agreed to continue the relationship and work together to strengthen the ties between the countries based on the long-standing friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people,' says Katz's office.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua's report on Wang's call with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi has Wang saying that -China will continue to demonstrate a sense of duty as a responsible major country and play a constructive role in promoting the cooling down of the conflict-.

Araghchi said Iran is deeply concerned about the risk of an overall escalation of the current regional situation and does not want to see a further expansion of conflict. Iran highly values China's influence in international affairs and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to cool down the situation through diplomatic means, Araghchi said, adding that Israel should avoid taking risks and proceed cautiously.- -Wang said that the negative impacts of the current Gaza conflict are clearly spilling over, and regional tensions are escalating continuously. China has always advocated for resolving hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation and opposes exacerbating tensions, expanding conflicts and taking military adventures, Wang said, calling on all parties to make more efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wang said that China will proceed from the merits of the issue, strengthen communication among all parties, build a broader international consensus, and pool the strengths of all parties. Wang said that China is pleased to see the Iranian government carry out mediation diplomacy, enhance understanding with relevant parties and improve relations with regional countries.

Page 6: There's a report based on a presser yesterday discussing the support for private enterprises. The report informs that China currently has 141,000 specialised and innovative SMEs and 14,600 ‘Little Giant' enterprises. ‘Wang Jiangping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that in terms of technological innovation, this year, central government funding will support more than 1,000 key ‘Little Giant' enterprises to create new drivers of growth, tackle new technologies, develop new products, and strengthen the supporting capacity of industrial chains.

Deputy Minister of Justice Hu Weilie said that the draft law on promoting the private economy, for the first time, includes ‘the two unwaverings' and ‘cultivating and promoting entrepreneurial spirit' into the law, and clearly states that ‘promoting the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy is a major policy that the country will adhere to for the long term.' This fully demonstrates that promoting the development of the private economy is a fundamental policy that the Party and the country will consistently and persistently uphold. Once these principles are enshrined in law, they will gain stability and binding force, which will certainly promote the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy, and create a better environment for the joint development of all types of ownership, including the private economy.- -。，‘'‘'，‘、、，'，。，、、，. -In response to issues such as local protectionism and market fragmentation, more stringent institutional measures with binding force will be introduced and implemented. The revision of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People's Republic of China will be accelerated to prevent and curb unfair competition. The implementation of the Fair Competition Review System will be further strengthened, promoting the removal of policies and measures that hinder a unified market and fair competition, thereby unlocking the potential of China's vast market. Efforts will be made to strengthen comprehensive governance of market order, with a focus on cracking down on illegal activities such as intellectual property infringement, trade secret theft, and the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, in order to enhance business vitality through a well-ordered market environment.- 、，。《》，。《》，，。，、，.

From October 1st to noon on October 3rd, compared to the same period last year, Beijing saw a 92.5% increase in new home viewings and a doubling of purchase intentions, while second-hand home viewings increased by 104.1%. Some properties in Guangzhou received over 150 visits per day, a 200% increase compared to normal times.- 101，9.38，46.8%。1013，92.5%、2，104.1%。150，200%. This next macro assessment is worth reading: -On one hand, the external environment has become increasingly complex, severe, and uncertain, and the adverse effects of changes in the external environment on China's economy have increased. The ‘global economy is stagnant', said the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report, updated in July. Currently, major world economies are experiencing weak growth momentum and heavy debt burdens. Many have recently implemented interest rate cuts, and international market volatility has increased. Global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertainty and instability have increased. These factors will have an adverse impact on China through trade, investment, finance and other channels. In particular, it is important to note that some external forces are trying to contain, blockade, and suppress China, deliberately attempting to hinder the historical process of building a socialist modern power in an all-round way and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Rhetoric about ‘decoupling and breaking supply chains' and ‘small yards with high walls' has become louder, reflecting the increasing complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment China faces. On the other hand, while China's economy continues to recover and improve, downward pressure has increased. Since the third quarter, key economic indicators such as industrial production, investment, and consumption have fluctuated. Some industries are experiencing ‘involution-style' competition, and some enterprises are struggling to adapt to optimization, upgrading, or transformation. In some cases, increased production has not led to increased revenue or profits, some companies face significant operational difficulties, and in some sectors hidden risks remain relatively high.- ，，。--，7《》。，、，，，，，、、。，、、，、。----，、、。，，，、，--，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The article then says that given all this, where does confidence come from? The answer is that first, -confidence comes from a deep understanding of (China's) development advantages.- -Since the new era, under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, China's economic development has formed significant advantages. Deeply understanding, utilizing, consolidating, and developing these important advantages is not only a key support for the long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy but also an essential foundation for solving the challenges faced in economic development. China's development benefits from five strategic advantages: the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the notable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the solid foundation accumulated through sustained rapid development, a long-term stable social environment, and the spiritual strength of self-confidence and self-reliance. Additionally, China possesses the institutional advantage of a socialist market economy, the demand advantages of a super-large-scale market, the supply advantages of a complete supporting industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs, which have laid a solid foundation for responding to risks and challenges…History and reality have repeatedly proven that the creation and continuation of China's economic miracle is inseparable from the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the fundamental guarantee of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. On the path forward, as long as we steadfastly uphold the Party's comprehensive leadership and give full play to the role of the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the giant ship of China's economy will surely ride the wind and waves and sail towards a brighter future.- ，，。、、，，。--：、、、、。，、、、，。，--，，，；，，，、，、，，……，，。，，，，. Second, confidence comes from -a deep understanding of the development trend.- Under this point, we basically get selective economic data citation, along with the argument that China's -innovation power and development vitality are surging-, with factors supporting the development of new quality productive and high-quality development surging. This paragraph is useful with quotes from Xi. The reason I point this out is because it is indicative of deep anxieties. Think of this as a pep-talk by a coach at the back of a terrible inning to pick up the team. -What determines the prospects of economic development is never how many difficulties there are, but how we view difficulties, how we resolve to solve them, and how we deal with them. Only by looking at the long-term and trends from a development perspective can we overcome difficulties more effectively. ‘China's development prospects are bright, and we have the confidence and assurance to say so'. ‘The world today is undergoing unprecedented changes not seen in a century, but time and momentum are on our side. This is where our determination and confidence lie.' ‘When have there not been difficulties? We tackle them one by one, year after year, and the Chinese nation has been doing this for over 5,000 years. Overcoming challenges is crucial to boosting confidence.' General Secretary Xi Jinping's profound expositions contain a profound ‘grand historical perspective'. Based on the ‘grand historical perspective', we can more deeply understand that the ‘long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy have not changed and will not change'.- ，，、、。、，。-，。--，，，。--？，、，5000。，。-，--。--，--。 The second section calls to accurately grasp the focus of policy measures. First the section talks about investments in water conservancy projects. It says that from January to August this year, national investment in water conservancy construction reached 801.94 billion yuan, an increase of 10.7% compared to the high level of the same period last year, setting a new record. The number of water conservancy projects implemented and the number of jobs created both exceeded those of the same period last year, making significant contributions to promoting sustained economic growth and stable development. Among these, more than 7,800 water conservancy construction projects were arranged with newly issued national bonds, with investments of 303.77 billion yuan completed. 18，8019.4，10.7%，，、，。，7800，3037.7. -As the external environment becomes more complex and severe, the role of domestic demand in ensuring China's stable economic growth has become more prominent. 700 billion yuan in central budget investment has already been allocated, and all of the 700 billion yuan designated for ‘two major' constructions from the 1 trillion yuan of ultra long-term special government bonds has been fully allocated to projects…Since the beginning of this year, the proactive fiscal policy has been moderately strengthened and improved in quality and efficiency. The role of government investment has been leveraged and efforts have been intensified to lay the foundation, benefit the long-term, make up for shortcomings, and adjust the structure. High-quality investment is becoming an important driving force for promoting high-quality development. Additionally, the 300 billion yuan in national bond funds supporting the ‘two new' initiatives has been fully allocated, providing stronger support for expanding domestic demand. ，。7000，1--7000……，、，，、、、，。，--3000，. -To strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks, we must increase the intensity of countercyclical policy adjustments, strengthen the overall coordination and systematic integration of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and tax policy, monetary and financial policy, investment and consumption, and income distribution; strengthen the coordinated innovation of policy tools, grasp the timing and effectiveness of policy implementation, amplify the policy combination effect, and enhance the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation.- ，，、、、，，，，. The article then signals support for the private economy, by talking about the release of the draft Private Economy Promotion Law, which is open for public comments until November 8. The article also mentions the issuance of living allowances to people. It also references the Guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Implementing the Employment First Strategy. It says that this is the first time since the new era that the central government has issued a guiding document to promote employment. Also, in order to achieve the goals for the year, the article calls to maintain -the bottom line of people's livelihood, strengthen assistance and support for low-income people, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food and water, electricity, gas and heat, and effectively ensure food and agricultural production to ensure national food security.- The final section of the article calls on everyone to take on responsibilities and act. The goal is to break through the -stubborn diseases of formalism and bureaucratism.- -Reform the defects in thinking, eliminate chronic problems in work style, and promote a spirit of practical action. In the current situation, to truly enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency in doing economic work well, we must resolutely overcome simplistic thinking, inertial thinking, and responsibility-avoiding thinking, and use ideological breakthroughs to promote practical action and responsibility-taking. Resolutely break the negative mindset of ‘just getting by without striving for excellence' in doing work, and discard the selfish attitude of ‘not taking risks, taking up fewer tasks'; resolutely eliminate the dependency on ‘first consulting the old almanacs (sort of like resorting to past experiences)' when encountering issues, and discard the lax approach of ‘lying flat and watching, being conservative and procrastinating'; resolutely break the stability-seeking mentality of ‘first thinking about avoiding responsibility, not thinking about taking responsibility' when doing things, and discard the mistaken understanding that ‘doing more leads to more mistakes, doing less leads to fewer mistakes, doing nothing leads to no mistakes'... Great winds and waves are precisely the touchstones for testing responsibility and commitment. Setting good benchmarks for selecting and appointing people, and encouraging cadres to better assume responsibilities, can cultivate firm doers and pragmatists for the construction of Chinese-style modernization, achieve success through overcoming difficulties, open up paths in daring to forge ahead, and develop a bright future for China's economy through unremitting struggle.- 、、。，，、、，。-、-，-、-；--，-、-；-、-，-、、-……，。，，、，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily While on the economy, I am still catching up with the developments of the past 10 days or so. Anyway, Caixin reports: China's finance ministry on Saturday announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers, and promised intensive support to help localities with their hidden debts… ‘Countercyclical' fiscal measures are ‘by no means' limited to those announced Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Foan said at a press conference on the same day, adding that policymakers are studying other policy tools. For example, the central government has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt, he noted…Tools including local government special-purpose bonds (SPBs), special funds and tax policies will be used in tandem to arrest the slide in the real estate market, Lan said. The central government will allow local authorities to tap their SPB proceeds, mainly used for funding government projects, to buy back undeveloped land from developers, according to Liao Min, a vice finance minister. In some regions, SPB proceeds can also be used to increase the reserve of land for sale, Liao said.- On local government debts, the report adds: -At the press briefing, Lan said that the central government had allowed local governments to use bond quotas of 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) and more than 2.2 trillion yuan in 2024 and 2023, respectively, to resolve hidden debt and pay overdue arrears to businesses. He added that the central government will step up support for local governments to deal with their debts by expanding the quota for swapping off-the-books for on-the-books debt. This will be a one-time expansion of a ‘relatively large scale,' the minister said, noting that it can free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents. ‘This forthcoming policy will be the most significant measure introduced in recent years to support (hidden) debt resolution,' Lan said, noting that it will be detailed after going through legal procedures. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also pledged to issue special treasury bonds to help major state-owned commercial banks supplement their core capital. The program is already in the works, Liao said. A cross-department work group, including the MOF, is waiting for banks to hand in their capital injection plans, he said, noting that the lenders will publish their plans according to rules for listed companies.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There is a confirmation that Li will be heading to Pakistan for the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting.

From January to September, China's three major shipbuilding indicators accounted for 55.1%, 74.7% and 61.4% of the global total in terms of deadweight tons.- Subscribe now Page 8: There is an article by Yang Wanming, Party Secretary and President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). He is writing in the context of Xi's speech recently marking the 70th anniversary of the CPAFFC. In that speech, Xi had said: -People are the creators of history, and building a community with a shared future for mankind is the future of the people of all countries in the world. China is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with friends from all countries, give full play to the unique role of people-to-people diplomacy, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- He had then made three points: First, we should build a broad consensus on promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind in the spirit of ‘shared responsibility as dwellers of the same planet'…China is willing to work with all countries in the world to promote the common values ​​of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and an inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, and make the planet Earth a peaceful, friendly and harmonious home for all-. --，。，，。--，--。，，，。，、、、、、，、、、，、，、、. Second, we must gather a strong force to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through the concept of win-win cooperation. The Communist Party of China is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also a party that seeks progress for mankind and world harmony. I proposed the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and the GDI, GSI and GCI, all in order to promote the building of a better world and create a better life for people of all countries. The practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind for more than 10 years has brought many inspirations. One of the important ones is that only through win-win cooperation can we accomplish things, do good things, and do great things. China does not pursue self-centered modernization, and welcomes more foreign friends to actively participate in China's modernization process. The country is committed to providing new opportunities for global development with its achievements in modernization, and promoting a global modernization that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity to better benefit people of all countries.- ，。、，、。、、，，。10，，、、。，。，，，、、，. Third, with an open and inclusive mindset, we should embrace all civilizations to build a community with a shared future for humanity…Harmony while maintaining diversity is the law governing the occurrence and development of all things, as well as the principle behind the transmission and development of human civilization. Mutual exchange and learning are essential requirements for the advancement of civilization and serve as important driving forces for the progress of human civilization, as well as for world peace and development. Chinese civilization is an open system formed in constant exchange and mutual learning with other civilizations, and remains ever new through its inclusiveness. The Chinese nation is an open and inclusive nation, and the Chinese people are kind and friendly people. China is willing to work with all parties to practice the GCI, promote a view of civilization that emphasizes equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness, enhance understanding and deepen friendship through sincere communication, transcend civilizational barriers through civilizational exchanges, transcend civilizational conflicts through civilizational mutual learning, and promote the world to develop in the direction of a community with a shared future. ，。-，。-，。，。，。，。，，、、、，，、，、，. In the article today, Yang writes that more than 300 international friends from nearly 100 countries attended the CPAFFC anniversary event. He writes that over the years the association has established -friendly exchange and cooperation relationships with over 400 organizations and institutions in more than 150 countries, coordinated and promoted the establishment of over 3,000 pairs of friendly city (province/state) relationships between China and more than 140 countries, and built a ‘circle of friends' and ‘network of partners' spanning five continents…- ，。、，150400，1403000（），----，----，、. It has coordinated and mobilised resources from international friendly cities, multinational corporations, friendly organizations, and various other sectors. It has promoted the establishment of diverse mechanisms for local exchanges between China and foreign countries and vigorously advanced pragmatic cooperation in fields such as trade, education, technology, culture, ecology, health, poverty alleviation, and human resources training, etc… ，。，、、，，、、、、、、、，，. Yang concludes with a few points for work going forward: We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for people-to-people exchanges, give full play to the role of friendly organisations as communication channels, continue to consolidate old friends and make new friends, enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and people of other countries, and lay a solid foundation for social public opinion of friendship between China and foreign countries. We will work with friends from all over the world to build more bridges of pragmatic cooperation, give full play to the role of international sister cities as cooperation platforms, mobilize resources and strengths in various fields at home and abroad, constantly innovate cooperation methods, expand cooperation fields, and enhance cooperation effectiveness, so that local and sister cities cooperation can better benefit people of all countries. We will work with friends from all countries to build more bridges for cultural exchanges, give full play to the role of cultural exchanges as a bond to link hearts and enhance friendship, carry out wide-ranging, in-depth and diversified cultural exchanges and mutual learning activities between China and foreign countries, inspiring mutual resonance of hearts, and promoting the ‘heart-to-heart communication, emotional bonding, and strength gathering' of the Chinese and foreign people. We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for youth friendship, fully leveraging the fundamental and long-term role of youth exchanges in the development of relations between countries, inviting more foreign youth to come to China, encouraging more Chinese youth to go out into the world, and striving to cultivate successors for the cause of friendship between Chinese and foreign people. ——，，，，、，，。——，，，，，、、，。——，，，、，、、，，-、、-。——，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Former Taiwan president Tsai ing-wen is in Europe. She will be visiting the Czech Republic and Brussels. She was also expected to travel to London, but that seems to have been cancelled -due to the British Foreign Office, which worried that such a visit could compromise Foreign Secretary David Lammy's first official visit to China next week.- Meanwhile, Xinhua reports that the Eastern Theater Command has just launched its ‘Joint Sword-2024B' drills in the Taiwan Strait and the north, south and east of the island of Taiwan. -Li Xi, spokesperson for the theater command, said the drills involve vessels and planes closing in on the island from multiple directions and assaults by joint forces. The drills focus on joint sea-air combat readiness patrol, the blockade and control of key ports and areas, strikes on sea and land targets, and the seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, so as to test the joint real-combat capabilities of the forces of the command, Li said. The drills are a powerful deterrent to the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' elements, and are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national sovereignty and national unity, Li said.- This comes after President Lai Ching-te's Double Tenth speech. Some key remarks: The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. On this land, democracy and freedom are growing and thriving. The People's Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan. Taiwan is resolved in our commitment to upholding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and achieving global security and prosperity. We are willing to work with China on addressing climate change, combatting infectious diseases, and maintaining regional security to pursue peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For a long time now, countries around the world have supported China, invested in China, and assisted China in joining the World Trade Organization, thereby promoting China's economic development and enhancing its national strength. This was done out of the hope that China would join the rest of the world in making global contributions, that internally it would place importance on the livelihoods of the people, and that externally it would maintain peace. As we stand here today, international tensions are on the rise, and each day countless innocents are suffering injuries or losing their lives in conflict. We hope that China will live up to the expectations of the international community, that it will apply its influence and work with other countries toward ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. And we hope that it will take up its international responsibilities and, along with Taiwan, contribute to the peace, security, and prosperity of the region and the globe. In an era when the international landscape is becoming increasingly chaotic, Taiwan will become more calm, more confident, and stronger; it will become a force for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. I believe that a stronger democratic Taiwan is not only the ideal of our 23 million people, but also the expectation of the international community. Beijing responded with anger. There's this latest Xinhua commentary, which says: -Recently, Lai continued to brazenly preach his ‘two states' claim, openly clamoring that ‘Taiwan has sovereignty' and that ‘the People's Republic of China (PRC) has no right to represent Taiwan'...The Taiwan regional leader repeatedly referred to the mainland as ‘China.' He has been playing with concepts and confusing right and wrong. By attempting to highlight the political differences between the two sides of the Strait and break up their historical ties, Lai fabricated the false concept that ‘the Republic of China equals Taiwan' out of thin air to further advance his ‘Taiwan independence' plot. Lai has been indulging in outright secessionist and blatantly provocative remarks. Certainly, his increasingly hostile words lead nowhere, only escalating tensions and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. If Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities continue going against the historical trend and pursuing their separatist line, they would plunge people in Taiwan into serious calamity.- Subscribe now	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/china-vietnam-deals-taiwan-drills	2024-10-13T19:42:29-07:00	
Xi on Ethnic Affairs Policy - PRC's 75th Anniversary - Li Calls to Accelerate Economic Measures - Friends for Peace Group on Ukraine - China's Afghan ...	Hi folks, I hope this finds everyone well. I wanted to begin with a brief announcement. I will be in Washington DC all of next week, starting October 7th. It would be really good to catch up with subscribers. So if you are in town during the week, please do drop me a line as an email response to this edition and we can schedule something. I will also be taking a break from the regular newsletter, given the holidays in China. Of course, as always, I'll try and cover any major developments or pieces that might be published. Cheers, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's remarks at the National Conference on Commending Models for Ethnic Unity and Progress. The entire speech was published in Saturday's edition of the paper. Xi had a lot of praise for the Party's policies: He said that the Party had combined -Marxist ethnic theory with the specific realities of China's ethnic issues and with the best of traditional Chinese culture, creatively blazing a right path with Chinese characteristics to solve ethnic issues. On this path, the CPC has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to achieve national independence and people's liberation, creating a new situation of developing equal, united, mutually supportive, and harmonious relations among all ethnic groups. It has promoted unprecedented progress in the economic and social development in ethnic regions and improved their lives. China's ethnic minorities, regions of ethnic groups, relations between different ethnic groups, and the Chinese nation have undergone profound and historic changes.- 。，、，。，，，，、、、. He added that since the 18th Party Congress, the Party has -continuously promoted the sinicization and modernization of Marxist ethnic theory, and clearly proposed to make the forging of a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation the main line of the Party's ethnic work in the new era and the main line of all work in ethnic regions, formed the Party's important thought on strengthening and improving ethnic work, promoted ethnic regions to join the other parts of the country in securing a victory in the fight against poverty, finished the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects…- ，，，、，，、，，。 Practice has proven that the path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics is completely correct. This path: focuses on the fundamental interests and overall interests of the Chinese nation, unites all ethnic groups to the greatest extent, and realises the common struggle and common prosperity of all ethnic groups; insists on the equality of all ethnic groups, opposes ethnic oppression and discrimination, and ensures that people of all ethnic groups truly obtain equal political rights and jointly become masters of their own country; correctly grasps the relationship between maintaining national unity and implementing ethnic regional autonomy, insists on combining unity with autonomy, and ethnic factors with regional factors, and promotes the Chinese nation to become a more cohesive and unified community with a shared future. ，。，，、；，，、；，、，、。 In the next bit, Xi talks about 5000 years of history and the creation of China as -a unified multi-ethnic country-. He says that the -formation and development of the Chinese nation community is the will of the people, the general trend, and the historical inevitability.- He makes five points to elaborate on this. First, -the intermingling of bloodlines of all ethnic groups has laid the historical foundation for the formation and development of a community for the Chinese nation.- He added: -History has fully proven that the Chinese nation is the result of long-term interaction, exchange, and integration among all ethnic groups. Only by continuously uniting and integrating, and consciously joining the big family of the Chinese nation, can all ethnic groups enjoy a brighter future.- ，。，，、，、，、。，，、，. Second, the shared convictions of all ethnic groups have served as the endogenous driving force for the founding of a unified multi-ethnic country. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has adhered to the concepts of ‘the six directions share the same customs, the nine regions are interconnected' and ‘there is great harmony under heaven', and regarded great unification as ‘the eternal principle of heaven and earth and the common truth of ancient and modern times'. Since the Qin Dynasty unified China, regardless of which ethnic group ruled the central plains, all have taken the unification of the country as their mission, firmly believing in the common principle that the nation's territory must not be divided, the country must not fall into chaos, ethnic groups must not be scattered, and civilization must not be interrupted. History has fully proven that our unified, multi-ethnic country was jointly created by all ethnic groups and must be jointly safeguarded, consolidated, and developed by them. ，。-，-，-。，，，、、、。，，、. (Note: This is an important paragraph, which allows for building the narrative of continuity with the rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties or Mongol and Manchu rule.) Third, the cultural connections among all ethnic groups are the cultural genes that have shaped the pluralistic and integrated civilization of the Chinese nation. The cultures of all ethnic groups have learned from and integrated with one another, gradually transcending regional, ancestral, and religious boundaries. This process has converged to form a Chinese culture with strong cohesion and appeal, shaping the unified yet diverse framework of Chinese civilization. History has fully proven that the brilliant Chinese culture was jointly created by all ethnic groups. To forge the new glory of socialist culture, we must continuously enhance identification with Chinese culture and further promote mutual learning and integration among the cultures of all ethnic groups. ，。、，、、，，。，，，. Fourth, the economic interdependence of all ethnic groups is the powerful force for building a unified economy. Our country has a vast territory, and the resource endowments of different regions each have their own characteristics, with strong economic complementarity and a high degree of interdependence. All ethnic groups have consistently maintained economic ties characterised by mutual exchange and mutual benefit, which has significantly strengthened the overall national power and promoted the formation and development of the Chinese national community. History has fully proved that only by continuously integrating into the overall development of the country and strengthening economic exchanges and cooperation can all regions and ethnic groups better promote national economic prosperity and better realise their own economic development. ，。，，、。、，，。，、，、. Fifth, the emotional bonds among all ethnic groups are the strong ties that bind the Chinese nation as one family. Harmonious coexistence, brotherhood, and mutual assistance have always been the mainstream of ethnic relations in our country. The close brotherly ties among various ethnic groups has left many heartwarming historical stories. Especially in the process of resisting foreign aggression, preventing division, and safeguarding unity, the people of all ethnic groups were unprecedentedly united, sharing a common hatred for the enemy, writing a magnificent epic of the Chinese nation's arduous struggles and earth-shaking greatness. History has fully proved that emotional closeness is a strong bond in the formation and development of the Chinese national community. All ethnic groups must cherish, continuously consolidate, and develop the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and constantly strengthen the emotional foundation for building the Chinese national community. ，。、、，。、、，、，、。，，、，. Xi ended this section by stating that the common goal of all ethnic groups is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Finally, Xi made five points about the tasks ahead in the -new era.- He said that -the central task of the Party and the country is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. This requires the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. We must comprehensively implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially the important thinking on strengthening and improving work on ethnic affairs, adhere to the main line of forging a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, continuously promote the cause of national unity and progress, and promote the high-quality development of the Party's ethnic work.- ，、，。，，，. First, always adhere to the leadership of the Party and constantly consolidate the common ideological and political foundation for the unity and struggle of all ethnic groups. The CPC is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the most reliable backbone of all ethnic groups. We must guide the people of all ethnic groups to continuously enhance their identification with the great motherland, the Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China, and socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly establish the concept of a community of sharing weal and woe, honour and disgrace, life and death, and destiny, and work together to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ，，。，。、、、、，、、、，. Second, we should focus on building a shared spiritual home for the Chinese nation, providing strong spiritual and cultural support for advancing the construction of the Chinese national community. To build a spiritual home shared by the Chinese nation, we must enhance the recognition of Chinese culture. We should take the core socialist values ​​as the guide, deepen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and guide the people of all ethnic groups to firmly establish a correct view of the state, history, ethnicity, culture and religions. We should strengthen the historical and cultural education of young people, comprehensively promote the popularisation of the national common language and characters, and comprehensively promote the use of state-approved textbooks, so as to instil the sense of community of the Chinese nation into the hearts of children from an early age. ，，。。，、、，、、、、。，，，. Third, accelerate the high-quality development of ethnic regions and solidly promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. To promote Chinese-style modernization and achieve common prosperity, no ethnic group can be left behind. We must support ethnic regions to accelerate their integration into the overall national development and promote closer economic integration and integration among all regions. Ethnic regions must fully and accurately implement the new development concept, continue to deepen reform and opening up, vigorously develop characteristic and advantageous industries, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. We must adhere to the safeguarding and improving people's livelihoods in the process of development, enhance the balance and accessibility of basic public services, do more practical things that conform to the will of the people, benefit the people's livelihood, and warm the hearts of the people, and continuously meet the yearning of people of all ethnic groups for a better life. ，，。、，。，、。，，，。，，、、，. Fourth, promote the all-round integration of all ethnic groups and actively promote exchanges and integration among all ethnic groups. Extensive interactions, exchanges, and integration are important ways to advance the construction of the Chinese national community. We must coordinate economic and social development planning and public resource allocation, strengthen the construction of infrastructure such as transportation in border areas and ethnic minority areas, actively promote people-oriented new urbanization, and promote the mobility and integration of all ethnic groups in an orderly manner. Build an interwoven social structure and community environment, continuously broaden the practical paths for the all-round integration of various ethnic groups, and promote their close unity like the seeds of a pomegranate. ，，。。，，，。，，. Fifth, govern ethnic affairs in accordance with the law, continually improve the capacity and level of governance in ethnic affairs. We must uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, gradually refine relevant laws and regulations as well as differentiated regional support policies, and ensure the legal rights and interests of people from all ethnic groups. We should strengthen legal education and public awareness, guiding people of all ethnic groups to enhance their national consciousness, civic consciousness, and legal consciousness. ，，。，，。，、、. Towards the end, Xi stresses this: -Addressing China's ethnic issues is our internal affairs, and no external forces have the right to interfere. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have found the correct path to solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics, and we do not need anyone else to point fingers at us or act as an ‘instructor'. We must resolutely oppose all attempts to infiltrate, sabotage, slander, contain and suppress our country by using ethnicity, religion and other issues. We must strengthen the research and propaganda of the history of the Chinese nation and the theory of the Chinese national community, actively carry out foreign cultural exchanges, and tell the story of the Chinese nation community well.- ，。，、--。、、、。，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, September 30, 2024. Page 1: The entire front page today is dedicated to events marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Xi awarded the highest state honours during the event. Four people, including veteran war hero Huang Zongde and medical scientist Wang Zhenyi, were awarded the Medal of the Republic. Ten individuals, including border patrolman Bayika Kalidibek, technician Xu Zhenchao, and acclaimed actress Tian Hua, were awarded national honorary titles. Dilma Rousseff, former Brazilian president and president of the New Development Bank, received the Friendship Medal. Xi also delivered a speech. Xi said that the -great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process-. Xinhua English has a decent summation of the key points: -Xi emphasized the need to bear in mind the ambition of making the country greater. ‘We should be loyal to the country, love the country, integrate personal development goals into the overall national development, and realize personal value in fulfilling duties for the country and serving the people,' he said. He encouraged the Chinese people to hone their skills and contribute to building a strong China. He urged them to strive for extraordinary achievements in ordinary job posts, and contribute to overcoming challenges related to development and reform while safeguarding social harmony and stability. ‘A great era calls for heroes and fosters heroes. A galaxy of heroes emerging generation after generation will ensure the lasting success of the Party and the people's cause,' Xi remarked.- Subscribe now Another report on the page informs of a concert to mark the 75th anniversary of the PRC's founding. Finally, there's a report telling us that a new official compilation of the chronicle of events during the New Democratic Revolution period (1921 to 1949) has been published. Page 3: There's a report on the State Council's executive meeting. The report said that the meeting sought to -study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the current economic situation and economic work at the meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, and to study and deploy the implementation of a package of incremental policies.- 929，，. -The meeting emphasised that it is necessary to unify thoughts and actions with the scientific judgement of the Party Central Committee on the economic situation, implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, implement the policies and measures that have been clarified, effectively implement macroeconomic control, promote the coordinated efforts of various policies, focus on addressing prominent issues in economic operation, and strive to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development for the entire year.- ，，，，，，，，. For each policy, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, and the pace of implementation should be accelerated. Policies that are relatively mature should be implemented immediately, while those that need further refinement should be worked on urgently, introducing them in batches as they become ready. All departments should not avoid difficulties or shirk responsibilities, but form a strong synergy in their work. At the same time, new incremental policies should be studied promptly in response to changing situations. In-depth investigations and research should be conducted, paying attention to opinions from all sides, to continuously optimise and improve policy measures. It is necessary to strengthen policy interpretation to better build consensus and enhance confidence. ，，，、。、，。，，。，，。，、. The meeting deployed relevant measures to accelerate the implementation of 102 major projects in the 14th FYP. The meeting pointed out that the implementation of 102 major projects during the 14th FYP period is an important deployment made by the Party Central Committee coordinating immediate and long-term needs. It is necessary to focus on the overall implementation of major projects, further consolidate the responsibilities of all parties, strengthen departmental coordination and central-local linkage, strengthen financial support and factor resource guarantees, address difficulties and bottlenecks, and ensure that the construction of major projects achieves the expected results. --102。，--102，。，，，，，. The meeting also discussed the construction of a universal childcare service system, and heard a report on progress in building up China's strength in intellectual property rights. On IPR, the meeting called to -strengthen the support of intellectual property rights for key core technology research, carry out special actions for patent transformation and application, implement the construction project of the intellectual property protection system, and provide strong support for achieving scientific and technological self-reliance and promoting high-quality development.- The draft revisions to the law on science and technology popularization and the law against unfair competition were discussed and approved in principle. Also on the page is a report on the State Council approving a set of revised regulations for commending fallen heroes. As per Xinhua, -the revised regulations stipulate improved criteria and assessment procedures for identifying martyrs, better financial support and preferential treatment for their families, and strengthened protection and management of their memorial facilities. The revised regulations also highlight the need to strengthen the dissemination of martyrs' heroic deeds and improve the protocols when paying homage to them. The revised regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Wang Yi's remarks at the UNGA general debate. The full English text is available on the MFA website. Key points: What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit. In today's world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity's common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable. Share Tracking People's Daily On Ukraine, Wang said: -An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to ‘no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,' and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace. The meeting of this group was chaired by the Chinese and Brazilians. 17 other ‘Global South' countries attended the meeting. At this meeting, Wang Yi said that: -The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is not about taking sides in the conflict, engaging in bloc confrontation, or replacing existing platforms. They hope to rely on the United Nations to bring together more Global South countries and send more objective, balanced and rational voices, so as to accumulate conditions and create an atmosphere for a ceasefire, an end to hostilities and the resumption of peace talks. The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is open and welcomes the joining of more like-minded countries, in particular, Global South countries.- He added: -China hopes that the parties involved will consider resuming peace talks at an appropriate time, meet each other halfway in their dialogue, and seek common ground while shelving differences in their negotiations, fairly discuss all peace plans, and promote the establishment of a new security architecture.- He also called for -peaceful coexistence- and said that -it is necessary to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries, observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, value the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and ensure the legitimate living space of all ethnic groups.- A joint communique was issued by Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Türkiye, and Zambia. Subscribe now Back to Wang's comments at the UNGA debate. On Palestine, he said that -might must not take the place of justice.- He called for a -comprehensive ceasefire- and Palestinian statehood and full UN membership. On Afghanistan, he said that -it is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people's life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.- Interestingly, at the sidelines of the UNGA, there was a meeting between China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran on Afghanistan. Wang Yi made four points at this meeting: First, build security together. Closely track the movements of terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan, strengthen intelligence exchange and sharing, and expand law enforcement and security cooperation. Fully utilize the anti-terrorism security collaboration functions of platforms such as the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Afghanistan's Neighboring Countries and the SCO to jointly address risks and challenges, and ultimately achieve the goal of eradicating violent extremist groups within Afghanistan. 。，，。、，，. Second, implement comprehensive measures. Jointly implement the ‘Tunxi Initiative' to support Afghanistan's reconstruction, help Afghanistan cultivate self-development capabilities through deepening regional economic and trade investment, interconnectivity, and major project cooperation. Support the SCO in playing a greater role in Afghan issues, support the UN in coordinating the international community to stabilize and assist Afghanistan, help Afghanistan improve its humanitarian predicament, and promote reconstruction and development. 。--，、，。，，，. Third, uphold justice. Make Afghanistan a platform for cooperation among all parties, not a venue for geopolitical games. US actions of cutting off aid, freezing assets, and imposing sanctions on Afghanistan are key factors preventing substantial improvement in Afghanistan's economic and livelihood difficulties. The US should use the seized Afghan overseas assets to support Afghanistan in alleviating livelihood difficulties, developing alternative crops to drugs, and resettling returning refugees. 。，。、、，。，，. Fourth, provide positive guidance. Encourage the international community to focus on the most pressing and urgent difficulties facing Afghanistan, promote Afghanistan's reconstruction and development in a constructive manner, and guide the Afghan governing authorities to improve and strengthen the protection of the rights of women and children in an equal and respectful way. Strengthen the exchange of governance experiences with Afghanistan in a flexible manner, encourage the Islamic world, especially Gulf countries, to exert special influence, and support Afghanistan in exploring a modernization path that aligns with the requirements of the times and the wishes of the people. 。，，。，，. Subscribe now Back to Wang's UNGA speech. He added -the Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.- Wang also said this about Asia: -China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.- After this, Wang pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He then said: In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba. On environmental issues, he said: -At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.- On AI governance, he said: -We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.'s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building-. On human rights, he said: -China maintains that all countries' right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others' internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse.- After this, there's a big chunk on Taiwan: -Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People's Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as ‘two Chinas,' or ‘one China, one Taiwan.' On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.- Share Tracking People's Daily The final bit in the speech is about how China's modernization benefits the world. Moving on, Wang Yi also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Chinese readout says that the -two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future…and agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course.- Wang said that: -The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.- -Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ‘Taiwan independence' activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence' and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ‘Taiwan independence', and support the peaceful reunification of China. Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ‘small yard, high fence' should not become ‘big yard, iron curtain'. China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions. Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there. Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The State Department said that the two had -candid, substantive, and productive discussions-. It adds: -Secretary Blinken underscored the United States' continued concern with PRC support for Russia's defense industrial base and war of aggression against Ukraine and made clear the need for the PRC to address Russia's threat to transatlantic security. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and raised concerns about the PRC's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Secretary Blinken reiterated that it remains a top priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are detained or subject to exit bans in China. He also raised human rights concerns, including with respect to Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. The Secretary discussed concerns related to technology; U.S. policy remains designed to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security. Both sides agreed to maintain contact, including on regional and global issues. Another important report is the one on Wang Yi's meeting with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul. Wang told him that: -As long as both sides adhere to the original intent of establishing diplomatic ties, remain committed to a friendly direction and pursue mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, it is believed that the China-South Korea relationship can continue to develop in a healthy and forward-looking manner. As close neighbors and important cooperation partners, China and South Korea should create favorable conditions for their respective development and the development of bilateral relations, Wang said. The deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in the region undermines regional peace and stability and does not serve the interests of regional countries, Wang said, adding that war and chaos must not occur on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula is in the common interest of all parties. China will continue to mediate and promote talks, playing a constructive role in achieving long-term peace and stability on the Peninsula, he said.- For some context, Reuters' report informs: -The U.S. deployed the Typhon system, which can be equipped with cruise missiles capable of striking Chinese targets, this year. China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fuelling an arms race.- Subscribe now Page 10: There's a report on the PBOC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration announcing new measures (English report) to stabilize the real estate market. The mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more are required to be reduced no lower than 30 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) by Oct. 31, 2024. In principle, 18 national commercial banks need to release their plans for adjustments before Oct. 12. The minimum down payment ratio for individuals' commercial housing mortgages will be lowered to no less than 15 percent for both first-home and second-home purchases. The central bank will increase funding for financial institutions if they issue loans to support local state-owned enterprises to acquire completed yet unsold commercial housing at reasonable prices for use as affordable housing. A Bloomberg report informs: On Sunday, the trading hub of Guangzhou became the first tier-1 city to remove all restrictions, saying it will stop reviewing homebuyer eligibility and no longer limit the number of homes owned. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen said they will allow more people to purchase residences in suburban areas, as well as allow others to buy more homes. Shanghai, China's financial hub, and Shenzhen, the southern city known for its tech industry, also announced they were lowering minimum downpayment ratios for first and second homes to 15% and 20%, respectively, in a bid to boost demand. The loosening in Shanghai and Shenzhen is slightly less than expected, while Guangzhou went further than anticipated, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts including Shujin Chen. ‘We think the policies are unlikely to turn property prices around, but they could ease potential price declines,' Chen wrote in a note on Monday.- Finally, although it is not in the paper, do note this article about the Chinese, Russian coast guards jointly conducing drills and patrols in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean. The report says: -The operation aimed to maintain order in high-seas fisheries. During the mission, the vessels also conducted joint exercises in search and rescue, damage control and locating illegal vessels, demonstrating the strong collaborative capabilities of the two coast guards.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Stimulating the Economy - Wang Yi's AI, GDI & BRICS Pitches - Wang Meets 'Old Friend of the Chinese People' Muhammad Yunus - China on Hopes for Ties w...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, September 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead story on the page is the readout from the Politburo's meeting on the economy. I covered this in yesterday's edition. Before I get to other reports, let me highlight the following: First, this really helpful graphic from Hutong Research. It lists the efforts at cash infusion. Second, this Reuters report summarises the steps being taken. On the heels of the Politburo huddle, China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus, two sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters. On Tuesday by Governor Pan Gongsheng, the People's Bank of China on Friday trimmed the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, known as the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), by 50 basis points, the second reduction this year. The move is expected to release 1 trillion yuan ($142.5 billion) in liquidity into the banking system and was accompanied by a cut in the benchmark interest rate on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by 20 bps to 1.50%. Reuters reported on Thursday that 1 trillion yuan due to be raised via special bonds will be used to increase subsidies for a consumer goods replacement programme and for the upgrade of large-scale business equipment. They will also be used to provide a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children, excluding the first child. China also aims to raise another 1 trillion yuan via a separate special sovereign debt issuance to help local governments tackle their debt problems. Third, today the PBOC has cut the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent. Xinhua reports that the interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The central bank conducted 278 billion yuan (about 39.66 billion U.S. dollars) of 14-day reverse repos on Friday at an interest rate of 1.65 percent, 20 basis points lower than the previous day. A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. The central bank also announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for financial institutions on Friday. Share Tracking People's Daily Okay, now back to the paper. The other main story is Xi Jinping's letter to the faculty and students of the Communication University of China on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Xinhua reports: -Xi urged the university to take solid steps to implement the fundamental task of fostering virtues and educating people on the new journey in the new era. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the needs of the press and public communication, highlighting the university's distinctive features, deepening reform and innovation, and continuously improving its teaching and research capacity, in a bid to cultivate more high-caliber journalism and communication professionals and make new contributions to the development of the Party's cause concerning public communication and culture.- Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with Tanzila Narbayeva, chairperson of the Senate of Uzbekistan. Xinhua says: Wang said that -under the guidance of the two heads of state, the development of China-Uzbekistan relations has entered a new stage with fruitful cooperation in various fields. Following the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to push for steady and long-term growth of the bilateral ties, Wang said. Wang noted that the CPPCC National Committee is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Uzbekistan to better serve the construction of their respective countries and the development of bilateral relations.- Among other things, Narbayeva said that Uzbekistan adheres to the one-China principle. Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel in Beijing. Xinhua reports: Ding -said that China and Nepal -- two nations linked by mountains and rivers -- have enjoyed lasting friendship, setting a fine example of equality and mutual benefits between countries of different sizes. He said that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, China is ready to work with Nepal to deepen exchange and cooperation in various fields, build a high-quality Belt and Road, consolidate popular support for the bilateral friendship, and push China-Nepal relations to a higher level. Paudel said that Nepal abides firmly by the one-China principle, supports China steadfastly in safeguarding its core interests, and hopes to strengthen its exchange of governance experience with China and deepen practical cooperation in various fields.- Paudel also met with He Lifeng earlier. PTI reports that: -He assured Paudel that the Chinese government would accelerate the execution of previously announced projects, according to a press release issued by the Nepal Finance Ministry. The Communist Party leader also requested assistance from the northern neighbour in expanding direct air services from various Chinese cities to Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports…The two leaders discussed about advancing key infrastructure projects being implemented with China's assistance, such as the construction of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, the Kimathangka-Hile and Hilsa-Surkhet-Bhurigaun roads, Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University, and Damak Industrial Park. Chinese leader He underscored the importance of implementing the agreements to further strengthen the bilateral ties and also expressed his desire to expedite the development projects including infrastructure, transport and connectivity.- Subscribe now Next, there is a long article celebrating Xi's leadership of China's modernization drive. The piece refers to him as the people's leader. Also, there is another long article detailing the -record of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in promoting the strengthening of the sense of community of the Chinese nation.- Page 3: Okay, back to Wang Yi in the US. Let me begin with his speech at the BRICS foreign ministers meeting. Wang called the BRICS the -leading force of the Global South-, which must work towards -promoting an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization.- -We must advocate common security and achieve lasting peace. In today's interdependent world, mankind is an indivisible security community. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda, let alone build its own security on the insecurity of other countries. We must make good use of mechanisms such as the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Meeting of High Representatives for Security Affairs to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspot issues and jointly address various challenges. On the Ukraine issue, we must insist on preventing the spillover of conflict, avoiding the escalation of warfare, and preventing any party from fueling the fire. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. Brazil and China jointly issued the ‘Six-Point Consensus', which has received positive responses from more than 100 countries to varying degrees. On the Palestinian issue, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, support Palestine to become a formal member of the United Nations, implement the ‘two-state solution', and achieve lasting peace in the Middle East.- ，。，。，。、，，。，、、，。--，100。，。、，，--，. We must prioritise development and solve development problems. Development is the eternal theme of human society and an important yardstick of progress in the era. President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI, which has been actively supported by the United Nations and the vast majority of developing countries. The BRICS should give full play to its own advantages, promote the development issue to be placed at the centre of the United Nations' work, pay attention to the practical difficulties of developing countries, urge developed countries to earnestly fulfil their commitments, and inject stronger impetus into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We should focus on the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, energy and food security, seize the opportunities of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and cultivate new momentum for high-quality development. ，。，。，。，，，，2030。、、，，. We must uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world falls into chaos. When hegemonic behaviour runs rampant, human civilization regresses to the law of the jungle. We must firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, opposing the practice of using multilateralism only when it is convenient and abandoning it when it is not. Taking the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit of the Future as an opportunity, we should promote reforms in the international financial architecture, support the full participation of southern countries in international economic decision-making, governance, and rule-making, and enhance their voice and representation. The resolution on Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence jointly proposed by China and many southern countries has been overwhelmingly approved by the UN General Assembly, and we welcome BRICS countries to participate in its implementation so that developing countries can broadly benefit. ，。，。，。，，-，-。，，、，。--，，. He then talked about supporting Russia in hosting the BRICS summit in October. He also called to ‘create new landmark achievements in the fields of finance, artificial intelligence, energy and minerals to ensure that the BRICS+ cooperation can get off to a good start. We must also accelerate the completion of the work of setting up partner countries. This is the consensus reached by BRICS leaders at last year's Johannesburg Summit, and it is also the mission we should accomplish. Continue to open the door for expansion, to add vitality and momentum to BRICS development.- ，，、。，，、。、、，--、。，，，，、. If you are wondering what are the BRICS' specific processes and criteria for expansion, here is the document agreed upon in 2023. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Wang's speech at an event called -Global Development Initiative Supports the Global South -- China in Action-. Wang said: -over the past three years since the inception of the GDI, it has evolved from a Chinese proposition to an international consensus, and from a cooperation concept to joint actions, contributing China's solutions and injecting Chinese strength into the implementation of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development…We held a High-level Dialogue on Global Development, a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, and two Global Shared Development Action Forums, effectively building consensus on international development cooperation and promoting all parties to recommit to and start again on the Sustainable Development Goals.- ，，、，2030，...，--，，，、. Then Wang put forward some data around GDI. Over the past three years, more than 100 countries and more than 20 international organizations have actively supported and participated in the Initiative, and 82 countries have joined the Friends of GDI group. More than 70 countries and international organizations have joined the Global Development Promotion Center Network, more than 50 parties have signed cooperation documents on GDI with China, and the United Nations has established a GDI Promotion Working Group.10020，82--。70，50，. We have invested and mobilised nearly $20 billion in various development funds, established more than 30 cooperation platforms in eight key areas, established a global development promotion center, and are actively preparing to build a ‘Global South Research Center.

Wang called for: comprehensive and balanced governance of AI openness without building walls, interconnection without decoupling, equality without discrimination, and working together to create an open, inclusive, inclusive, and non-discriminatory environment for the development of AI, so that the dividends of AI can benefit all countries. He added that AI should not and cannot be reduced to a tool for maintaining hegemony and pursuing superiority. establishing an AI governance mechanism with universal participation from all countries under the UN framework, so that all countries can participate and benefit equally. Using one's own values ​​as the only criterion for judgement will only artificially create differences and obstacles, and will not be conducive to mankind working together to meet new challenges. 。、、、，，，。，。。，、、，、、、，。、。。，，。，、。，，.

China is willing to carry out AI models development and empowerment cooperation, build an international cooperation platform for AI capacity building, build an open source AI community in a responsible manner, and build a rich, diverse, healthy and benevolent AI development ecosystem in accordance with local conditions. China will organize short-term education and training on AI capacity building for developing countries, AI knowledge and expertise through a combination of online and offline methods. We will organize 10 AI training and seminar programs for developing countries by the end of 2025. China is willing to work with all countries, especially developing countries, to jointly develop AI corpora, promote and improve data infrastructure, promote and protect the diversity of civilizations, and promote fair and inclusive use of global data.

Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Wang Yi's meeting with Sergei Lavrov. Wang said that the experience of China-Russia ties shows that -as long as we adhere to permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic cooperation, and mutually beneficial cooperation and win-win results, China-Russia relations will move forward…Both sides should continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism, defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and promote the building of a more just and reasonable global governance system with the United Nations at its core. China will fully support Russia in playing its role as the BRICS chair, ensure the complete success of the Kazan Summit, and open up a new situation for BRICS+ cooperation.- They also talked about the upcoming 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Wang also met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Wang told him that: -China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes and advocated that all hotspot issues should be resolved politically through dialogue, and the same is true for the Ukrainian issue. China does not engage in geopolitical games or pursue its own self-interests, but has always actively promoted peace and negotiations, working to build consensus for peace. China has always paid attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, has provided four batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and is willing to provide new assistance according to Ukraine's needs. We hope that Ukraine will continue to take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Ukraine. We are willing to maintain communication with all parties, including Ukraine, and continue to do what China believes is right to strive for peace at an early date.- ，，。，，，。，，。，。，，. While on this, do check out Politico's reporting on a Ukrainian assessment of Wang's agenda at the UNGA. The report says: -China wants to work behind the scenes at the United Nations to enlist international support for an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, according to a Ukrainian government document. The Chinese government came into this week's U.N. General Assembly with a plan to seek support from countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa that would freeze battle lines in the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, according to the document obtained by POLITICO. The U.S. is opposed to the deal and Ukrainian officials are alarmed by it — so much so that they have circulated the document among diplomats gathered in New York for the UNGA. In its proposal, China is trying to persuade diplomats to support peace talks focused on -taking into account the security interests of each country- with the objective of -preventing Russia from losing- the war, according to the document. The paper, which was drafted by the Ukrainian government ahead of this week's high-level U.N. meetings, does not say how Kyiv is aware of China's strategy. Ukraine is also pushing on multiple fronts this week to dissuade allies from embracing the China-backed plan. Ukraine's U.N. mission in New York did not respond to a request for comment on the document. Beijing's game plan in New York involves enlisting the support of some two dozen countries -to form some kind of ‘core' group which in the future can quickly expand [to include] other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia,- the document said. China seeks their endorsement for its plan to initiate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine based around a China-Brazil joint six-point proposal released in May. That document urges -no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party.- That would allow Russia to continue hostilities at their current intensity as well as its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The six-point proposal hinges on -an international peace conference … recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.- Also noteworthy part in the report is this bit: -China's pursuit of India's support could create particular trouble for Ukraine. Kyiv has been hoping that New Delhi may help broker a peace pact it can live with. The Indian embassy in Washington declined to comment.- Meanwhile, another interesting Politico report said this week that: Ukraine has found its favored middleman to help end the war with Russia: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi…A high-ranking Ukrainian official, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject, confirmed that India was Kyiv's big hope to reach a peace pact it can live with. According to the official, Modi was clear in summertime discussions with Kyiv that — while Ukraine would inevitably need to compromise on some things to end Moscow's onslaught — any proposals to end the war should not include giving up territory to Russia. Modi, in Kyiv's eyes, has come a long way in a short time. When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, the response from Kyiv was scathing. Zelenskyy called the hug — on the same day a Russian missile strike killed dozens of Ukrainians — -a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts.- But since then, Ukraine has come to increasingly view India — the world's most populous nation, which has long promoted non-alignment in its foreign relations — as its ideal intermediary in dealings with the Kremlin. While New Delhi has consistently refrained from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has spoken in support of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ending the war. Six weeks after his Moscow trip raised Ukrainian hackles, Modi traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. He vowed to be -a friend- to Kyiv and help bring about a peace deal. India may be the only global power player that can play the role — or at least the only one able to credibly portray itself as a neutral party to both Moscow and Kyiv. Subscribe now Another noteworthy report is about Wang's comments on Security Council reform. This was part of a dialogue between the P5 and C10 countries from Africa. Wang made three points: Effectively increase the representation of Global South countries, allow more developing countries, especially small and medium-sized countries including African countries, to participate in Security Council decision-making, enhance the authority and efficiency of the Security Council, and promote the development of international order towards a more just and reasonable direction. The Security Council cannot become a club for big countries or rich countries, let alone an arena for political confrontation. We must effectively change the imbalance between North and South in the composition of the Security Council and the over-representation of developed countries. We must anchor the reform path of giving priority to special arrangements for Africa. The Security Council structure with insufficient representation of Africa is hardly reasonable, and correcting this injustice requires creativity. Last year, President Xi Jinping took the lead in announcing that China supports making special arrangements for the priority resolution of Africa's demands, which has led to just calls in support for Africa's demands. China is willing to work with Africa and all parties to jointly explore the implementation path of the special arrangements for Africa's priority. We must support the main channel status of the General Assembly's Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations. The Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations are the only platform authorized by the General Assembly and widely recognized by member states. We should jointly maintain the intergovernmental negotiation platform where everyone can sit down and talk, and continuously accumulate and expand the consensus of the international community. 。--，，，。，。、。。，。，。，。。、。，.

The readout says: -China has always placed Nepal in an important position in its peripheral diplomacy and is committed to building a closer China-Nepal community with a shared future. Next year will be the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal. The two sides should take this opportunity to promote the joint construction of the BRI and other cooperation to bear more fruit and benefit the people of the two countries… China will, as always, support Nepal in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and hopes that Nepal will find a successful development path that suits its national conditions. He appreciated Nepal's repeated reiteration that it will not allow any forces to use Nepal's territory to engage in anti-China activities. China has granted zero tariff treatment to 100% of items imported from all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, which will facilitate more Nepali specialty products entering the Chinese market. China welcomes Nepal's announcement in China of 2025 as the ‘Nepal Tourism Year' and is willing to work with Nepal to plan a series of events to promote cultural exchanges.-，、，，。100%，。2025--，，.

China and Bangladesh share a traditional friendship, and the people of both countries have deep amicable feelings for each other. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to promote this traditional friendship, strengthen political mutual trust, deepen cooperation in jointly building BRI, and push forward the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries. China is also willing to expand cooperation in areas such as agriculture, poverty alleviation, and new energy based on Bangladesh's needs, and strengthen exchanges on governance, reform, and opening-up experiences to support Bangladesh's economic and social development. The two sides can strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，，。，，，--，。，、、，，。，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, Wang met with American representatives from the National Committee on United States-China Relations, the US-China Business Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the Aspen Institute, the Asia Society, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Wang told them that: -This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. After nearly half a century of ups and downs, the most important revelation is that the two countries should be partners, not adversaries; they should help each other succeed rather than engage in vicious competition; and they should keep their word and follow through, rather than saying one thing and doing another. President Xi Jinping cares deeply about and attaches great importance to China-US relations. Based on profound reflection on the lessons learned, he has proposed the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, which are the fundamental guidelines for China's approach to US relations. In contrast to China's stable and consistent policy towards the US, the US often sends mixed signals and presents two different faces in its China policy. The root cause lies in the inability of some in the US to view and accept China's development objectively. The US needs to recognize that China also has the right to develop, and that China's development is an opportunity for both the US and the world, rather than a challenge. 。，45。，，，；，；、，、。，，、、，。，、。。，。、. Wang Yi said that during his visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, he sensed the widespread concern over the international situation, with many hoping for greater unity and coordination among major powers to shoulder their responsibilities. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should first strive for stable, healthy, and sustainable development of their bilateral relationship. They should also work with the international community to address the numerous global challenges emerging today. China-US relations are an evolving process that requires continuous dialogue and communication to eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings and misjudgments. Wang Yi expressed hope that people of insight from various sectors in the US would contribute to these efforts, foster an objective and rational understanding of China, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and help improve and develop China-US relations. ，，，，。，，，。，，。，，，.

Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong held -candid, professional and pragmatic exchanges- with US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. Xinhua says: -Wang said that the two sides earnestly implement the important consensus of the two heads of state, adhere to mutual respect, dispute management and mutually beneficial cooperation, and have achieved many visible outcomes in areas such as drug control, repatriation of illegal immigrants and cooperation on individual cases. China is willing to maintain communication with the U.S. at all levels, and push for steady and long-term law enforcement cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. side should attach importance to addressing China's concerns, demonstrate sincerity with concrete actions, and remove obstacles for deepening cooperation, Wang noted. The two sides agreed to stay in communication on important issues in the field of law enforcement.- Page 6: There's a report informing that the NDRC and the Xi Jinping Economic Thought Research Center hosted the 2024 Annual Conference on Deeply Studying and Practising Xi Jinping's Economic Thought.

Page 10: There's a report on a new guideline to promote the market entry of medium and long-term capital. Xinhua reports: -The guideline, issued by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is designed to streamline the entry of capital from social security funds, insurance and wealth management into the market. Key measures outlined include the development of a market environment that encourages long-term investments and the improvement of the quality of publicly listed companies. The guideline advocates the expansion of public equity funds and supports the stable development of private equity investment funds. Additionally, the guideline seeks to refine policies and institutions that facilitate the entry of diverse medium and long-term capital. It aims, among other things, to significantly increase the scale and proportion of medium and long-term capital investments, create a more balanced structure of capital market investors, strengthen the long-term nature of investment behaviors, and enhance the inherent stability of the market, while steadily improving investor returns.- Also, another report informs that in August, there were 23,210 cases of violations of the eight-point central regulation.

Politburo Meeting Signals Economic Easing - Wang Yi's Diplomacy in New York - Guidelines to Implement Employment-first Policy - Song Tao Meets KMT's S...	Just as I was about to publish, Xinhua has published a report stating that Xi Jinping has today chaired a meeting of the Politburo to study and assess the current economic situation and deploy the next phase of economic work. Since the beginning of this year, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to overcome difficulties and respond calmly, enhance macroeconomic regulation, focus on deepening reform and opening up, expand domestic demand, and optimize the economic structure. Consequently, the overall economic operation has been stable and steady, new quality productive forces have developed steadily, people's livelihood security has been solid, positive progress has been made in preventing and resolving risks in key areas, high-quality development has been solidly promoted, and the overall social situation remains stable. ，，、，，、、，、，，，，，. The meeting pointed out that the fundamentals of China's economy and favorable conditions, such as a vast market, strong economic resilience and great potential have not changed. At the same time, some new situations and problems have emerged in the current economic operation. It is necessary to look at the current economic situation comprehensively, objectively and calmly, face up to difficulties, strengthen confidence, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency to do a good job in economic work. We must focus on key points, take the initiative, effectively implement existing policies, intensify efforts to introduce incremental policies, further improve the pertinence and effectiveness of policy measures, and strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks. ，、、。，。，、，。、，，，、，. The next paragraph has specific policy points. It says: The meeting emphasised the need to increase counter-cyclical adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies, ensure necessary fiscal expenditures, and effectively carry out the ‘three guarantees' work at the grassroots level. It is necessary to issue and use ultra-long-term special treasury bonds and local government special bonds to better leverage the driving role of government investment. It is necessary to lower the reserve requirement ratio and implement substantial interest rate cuts. It is necessary to promote the real estate market to stop falling and stabilize, strictly control the increase in commercial housing construction, optimize the stock, and improve the quality, increase the loan issuance for ‘white list' projects, and support the revitalization of idle land. It is necessary to respond to the concerns of the people, adjust the housing purchase restriction policy, reduce the interest rate of existing mortgage loans, speed up the improvement of land, fiscal and taxation, and financial policies, and promote the construction of a new model of real estate development. It is necessary to strive to boost the capital market, vigorously guide medium- and long-term funds to enter the market, and clear the bottlenecks hindering social security, insurance, and wealth management funds from entering the market. It is necessary to support the merger and reorganization of listed companies, steadily advance the reform of public funds, and study and introduce policies and measures to protect small and medium-sized investors. ，，，--。，。，。，、、，--，。，，，、、，。，，、、。，，。 Note: This tells us clearly that we should expect more stimulus measures. The PBOC recently cut the rate of the medium-term lending facility to 2% from 2.3%. Bloomberg had earlier reported that the cut to the MLF rate is a prelude to more significant measures. Pan had also said that the central bank would cut the amount of cash banks have to hold in reserve - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR). The RRR will initially be cut by half a percentage point, in a move expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142bn; £106bn). BBC reported that further measures aimed to boost China's crisis-hit property market include cutting interest rates for existing mortgages and lowering minimum down payments on all types of homes to 15%. Anyway, the next paragraph of the Xinhua report says: The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to help enterprises overcome difficulties and further standardise the law enforcement and supervision behaviours related to enterprises. It is necessary to introduce a law to promote the private economy and create a good environment for the development of the non-public economy. It is necessary to combine promoting consumption with benefiting people's livelihood, promote income increases for middle and low-income groups, and upgrade consumption structure. It is necessary to cultivate new consumption formats. It is necessary to support and standardise the development of the elderly care and childcare industries by social forces, and speed up the improvement of the policy system for fertility support. It is necessary to increase efforts to attract and stabilise investment, promptly advance and implement reform measures such as foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector, further optimise building a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalised. ，，、。，。，，。。、，。，，、、. The meeting also called to implement the employment-first policy, -strengthen assistance to low-income individuals-, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food, water, electricity, gas, and heating, and support grain production and farmers. The final paragraph calls for complete policy implementation by all regions, departments and cadres, and says that economically developed provinces should take the lead and better play a leading and supporting role. Share Tracking People's Daily Also, before we get to the edition, let me share my discussion with Aditya Ramanathan on the recent Quad Summit for our All Things Policy podcast. Also, you can check out my new piece today in Money Control discussing how Beijing reacted and how Chinese media and analysts discussed the Quad summit. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, September 26, 2024. Page 1: There's a report on Xi Jinping's letter to people of various ethnic groups in Pu'er, Yunnan province, calling on them to bear in mind forging the sense of community for the Chinese nation to promote ethnic unity and progress. This was in reply to a letter by the descendants of the representatives from diverse ethnic groups who erected a monument in 1951 in Pu'er and made a solemn pledge to stay united and follow the leadership of the Party. In his letter, Xi said that the Chinese nation is a -big family where 56 ethnic groups love and care for each other-. Xi added that -I hope you will carry forward the glorious traditions of your ancestors- and -let the story of national unity be passed down from generation to generation. People of all ethnic groups must bear in mind the sense of community of the Chinese nation and integrate it into their blood, jointly defend the territory of the motherland, and build a beautiful homeland, so that the flower of national unity and progress will bloom even more brilliantly.- ，。，，。、，、，. Next, there's a brief report on the entire PBSC attending the funeral of Ren Jianxin, a former senior CPC leader and former president of the Supreme People's Court. Ren died aged 99 and his remains were laid to rest at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Moving on, the paper today carries the new guidelines on implementing the employment-first strategy. The document comes at a time when the jobless rate for people in China ages 16 to 24, and not in school, rose to 18.8% last month. That's up from 17.1% in July, and 13.2% in June. The first key section deals with employment and development linkages. This section makes five points: Strengthen the employment-first orientation of macroeconomic regulation. -Make high-quality and full employment a priority goal for economic and social development, incorporate it into national economic and social development plans, and promote the synergy of fiscal, monetary, industrial, price, and employment policies to enhance the employment-driving power of development. Improve the employment impact assessment mechanism, simultaneously conduct job creation and unemployment risk assessments when formulating major policies, determining major projects, and planning major productive forces, to construct an employment-friendly development model.- 。，，、、、、，。，、、、，. Enhance the employment synergy of the modern industrial system. Develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions, transform and upgrade traditional industries, cultivate and strengthen emerging industries, plan and build future industries, accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing clusters, and strive to create more high-quality job opportunities.

Support various business entities in stabilizing and expanding employment. Give full play to the leading role of state-owned enterprises in employment, and comprehensively use fiscal support, tax incentives, financial support, social security and other policies to guide various entities to better fulfill their social responsibilities of stabilizing and expanding employment. Support the development of industries and enterprises with strong employment absorption capacity. For business entities with good employment demonstration effects, prioritize land use plans and provide preferential employment support services under equal conditions. 。，、、、，。，，，. Enhance the employment carrying capacity of regional coordinated development. Deeply implement the regional coordinated development strategy and major regional strategies, and accelerate the formation of a number of employment clusters and growth poles with integrated services, connected policies, and smooth channels. Guide the orderly transfer of capital, technology, and labour-intensive industries from the east to the central and western regions, and from central cities to the hinterland. Increase policy support for old revolutionary areas, border regions, and resource-depleted areas to promote balanced employment development across regions. 。、，、、。、、、，、、，. Cultivate new momentum for employment expansion and quality improvement. Expand new employment space for the digital economy, vigorously promote industrial digitization and digital industrialization, support the healthy development of the platform economy, and effectively manage job mining and career transitions in digital transformation. Increase new green employment opportunities, actively develop green industries such as energy conservation and carbon reduction, environmental protection, ecological protection, restoration and utilization, and promote the synergy and efficiency of green development and employment growth. Open up new areas of health care employment, develop the silver economy, promote the deep integration of health and elderly care, tourism, leisure, food and other industries, and give birth to new employment growth points. 。，、，，、。，、、，。，，、、、，. Section three deals with the steps to resolve structural employment contradictions. It makes three points: Better match talent demand with education supply Improve the lifelong vocational skills training system Expand growth channels for skilled personnel The next section deals with support that needs to be provided for the employment of key groups. This includes college graduates and youth, retired military personnel, rural labour, those engaged in supporting self-employment and flexible employment, and individuals facing difficulties, i.e., older workers, people with disabilities, and the long-term unemployed. Later the document also talks about steps to be taken to protect workers' rights. This talks about the need to carry out -reforms in household registration, employment services, and personnel records, removing unreasonable restrictions and discrimination in employment based on region, status, gender, age, etc., and facilitating social mobility.- 。、，、、，、、、，。It also mentions support for women and the disabled, along with protecting rights like remuneration, vacation, safety and health. It adds: -Promote employers and employees to participate in social insurance according to law. Improve the social security system for flexible employment personnel, migrant workers, and new forms of employment. Completely remove household registration restrictions for participating in social insurance at the place of employment. Promote unemployment insurance, industrial injury insurance and housing accumulation fund to cover professional workers widely. Improve the linkage mechanism between employment and unemployment insurance and minimum living security. Pay unemployment insurance benefits according to regulations, provide layered and classified social assistance, and adjust and improve the gradual withdrawal period of minimum living security and employment cost deduction regulations. 。，、、，。、、。、，，，。 Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with leaders from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who are visiting Nanning to attend the 21st China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit.

First, he addressed the UNGA. He mentioned GDI, GSI and GCI and then said: In this changing and turbulent world, new risks and challenges keep cropping up. No country can stay unaffected. Greater solidarity and cooperation of the international community is not a choice, but a must. Countries should uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and settle disputes through dialogue, resolve differences through consultation and enhance security through cooperation. Major countries, in particular, should lead by example. They should break geopolitical circles by pursuing the greater good, rise above bloc confrontation with a broad vision for mutual prosperity, and serve as propellers for world solidarity and anchors for international peace. Countries need to share development opportunities and pursue win-win cooperation. We need to follow a people-centered development philosophy and advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, so as to deliver the fruits of development to our people and ensure common prosperity for all countries. A winner-takes-all approach is a sure way to lose the whole game, and the ‘small yard with high fences' would only imprison the builder and tear the world apart. We need to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, and defend the U.N.-centered international system, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We need to strengthen the authority of international rule of law, reject the law of the jungle where the strong bully the weak, oppose acts of hegemonism such as unilateral sanctions, protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, promote greater democracy in international relations, and uphold international fairness and justice. We need to keep abreast with the times, push back the frontier and explore new practices, and make global governance more just and equitable. China supports the U.N. in serving as the main channel in AI governance, and will propose the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All. In particular, we need to encourage the young people to bring out their creativity and contribute their share to the advancement of humankind. Subscribe now Next, Wang met with several other foreign ministers. I cannot cover all the meetings. So, I am going to pick on the one's I am interested in. First, the readout (English report) on Wang's meeting with the EU's Josep Borrell says: -Strengthening cooperation between China and the EU benefits both sides and aligns with their fundamental and long-term interests, and meets the expectations of the international community, said Wang. In a world marked by turmoil and interwoven challenges, China and the EU should enhance mutual trust and close cooperation, respect and learn from each other, and contribute to the stability of the international and regional situation and the development and progress of mankind, said Wang. It is hoped that the EU will adhere to its strategic autonomy, eliminate external interference and promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations, said Wang. Borrell, for his part, said that China's rise is an unstoppable historical trend. China is already a strong country and will continue to grow stronger.

Xinhua reports that Wang put forward three points: Firstly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of crisis in cooling down the situation. Weapons of mass destruction should not be used, nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes such as nuclear power plants should not be attacked, and civilians and civilian facilities should not be targeted, the envoy said. Secondly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility in promoting peace talks. Dialogue and negotiation is the only viable way out of the Ukrainian crisis, he noted, urging the international community to seize the current opportunity to form joint efforts to promote peace talks. Thirdly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of urgency in managing spillovers. China calls on the international community to strengthen cooperation on energy, finance, trade, food security and the protection of key infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines, so as to jointly maintain the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains, Wang said. China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor is it a party concerned, the top Chinese diplomat noted.

Nearly 80 countries, including the majority of Muslim countries, read out a joint statement on the spot in support of China, and more than 20 countries expressed their support for China's just position in different ways, clearly opposing the politicization of human rights issues and interfering in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. The clear voices of more than 100 countries fully demonstrate that the political manipulation of a few countries such as the United States has become increasingly unpopular.- -Wang pointed out that such action of the United States and its followers once again exposed their double standards on human rights issues to the world. People cannot help but ask: if the United States is so concerned about the human rights of Muslims, why does it continuously provoke or support wars in regions like the Middle East, causing numerous innocent Muslim casualties? Why does it turn a blind eye to the historical injustices faced by the Arab people and not support Palestine in becoming a full member of the United Nations? Why does it fail to play its due role in achieving a permanent ceasefire and full military withdrawal from Gaza? Wang Yi said that the majority of Muslim countries have long seen through the tricks of the United States and know that the United States is just using human rights as a cover to interfere in the internal affairs of China and developing countries. More than 100 developing countries, including Muslim countries, clearly supported China at the Human Rights Council, not only to safeguard China's legitimate rights, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and safeguard the basic principle of non-interference in internal affairs of international relations.- 、，924，，。80，20，，，。100，。，。，，，？，？、？，，，。100，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, meeting Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon, Wang said that China supports Slovenia assuming the rotating chair of the United Nations Security Council this month, is willing to work with the Slovenian side to implement true multilateralism, uphold the authority of the United Nations and the Security Council, and promote international peace and security.

Lin Jian: Quad is identified as the premier regional grouping that plays a leading role in the US's Indo-Pacific strategy. It is a tool the US uses to contain China and perpetuate US hegemony. The Indo-Pacific strategy attempts to patch up forces to exclude and contain China by peddling the ‘China threat' narrative, and Quad tries to muster military and security cooperation under the pretext of maritime issues—same intention, same tactics. Though the US claims that it does not target China, the first topic of the summit is about China and China was made an issue throughout the event. The US is lying through its teeth and even the US media does not believe it. China believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party or even harm their interests. Any regional initiative should follow the overwhelming trend of the region and promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Ganging up to form exclusive groupings undermines the mutual trust and cooperation between regional countries, runs counter to the overwhelming trend of pursuing peace, development, cooperation, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and is bound to fail. The US needs to get rid of its obsession with perpetuating its supremacy and containing China, stop using regional countries as its tool, stop glossing over the strategic intention behind all kinds of exclusive groupings, and act on its word that the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China, instead of seeking selfish gains at the expense of other countries' strategic security interests and the wellbeing of the people in the Asia-Pacific. AFP: Quad leaders said in the joint statement that they are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas, which apparently refers to China. Has China protested to relevant countries? Lin Jian: The situation in the East and South China Seas is generally stable. Some country outside the region keeps cobbling together small groupings and tries every means to meddle in maritime issues at China's doorstep in order to incite bloc confrontation, escalate the situation, and undermine regional peace and stability. Let me stress that no interference from any force will weaken China's determination in defending its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with law and keeping the region peaceful and stable. We will lodge serious protests over any act that undermines China's sovereignty and security interests. PTI: Further to what you spoke about the Quad summit in the US. The summit also for the first time approved a joint coast guard cooperation at sea. And also they have rather agreed to strengthen cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and recognized India's leadership in finalizing the IORA Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and expressed support for that. Do you have any comment on this? Lin Jian: Cooperation between countries should be conducive to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, rather than focusing on forming exclusive groupings that undermine trust and cooperation among regional countries. China is open to normal cooperation between relevant countries at sea, but the cooperation should not target other countries or undermine regional peace and stability under any pretext. PTI: You said that China will protest to anyone in violation to security interests. So can we presume that you have lodged a protest to all the Quad countries regarding the comments on the South China Sea and the East China Sea? Lin Jian: As I said just now, China will protest over any move that harms China's sovereignty and security interests. Second, the Chinese and Nepali armies are carrying out joint training in Chongqing. Xinhua reports: -Under the theme of ‘joint counter-terrorism operations in urban blocks', the joint training will include small arms shooting in special operations, counter-terrorism squad tactics, drone operations, emergency rescue, and comprehensive counter-terrorism exercises. The training will last until Oct. 1. In addition to joint exercise sessions, the two militaries will engage in research and exchange on disaster reduction and relief in earthquakes, avalanches and landslides.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Page 1: The top story on the page is an article marking the 75th Anniversary of the Founding of the CPPCC. It says that -practice has shown that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a great achievement by the Communist Party of China in combining the Marxist-Leninist theories of the united front, party politics, and democratic political theory with the realities of China. It is a major innovation in the political system under which the CPC leads the democratic parties, non-affiliated individuals, mass organisations, and people from all ethnic groups and social sectors.- ，、、，、、. Going ahead, the article calls to -take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the general outline for the work of the CPPCC, ensure the correct political direction of the development of the CPPCC's cause, and consolidate the common ideological foundation for unity and struggle…thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on strengthening and improving the CPPCC's work, uphold and strengthen the Party's overall leadership over the CPPCC, focus on the central tasks of the Party and the country in the new era and on the new journey, always plan and carry out work keeping in mind the overall situation of the work of the Party and the country, and constantly enhance the level of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in state affairs.- ，，。，，，，、、.

It is an objective requirement to actively respond to population ageing and promote high-quality population development. It is a practical need to fully unleash the talent dividend and support Chinese-style modernization. It is also a significant measure to improve the social security system and better protect and improve people's livelihoods. All regions and departments must raise their political awareness, align their thoughts and actions with the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, and work solidly to implement the reform, ensuring the achievement of the expected outcomes.- ，，，、，、，、。，，，. Li added: It is necessary to adhere to the principle of ‘voluntary participation and flexibility' to implement the delayed retirement policy and ensure that the wishes of employees are truly reflected. It is necessary to accelerate the formulation and improvement of supporting policy measures. Policies that need to be directly linked to the reform plan should be introduced and implemented as early as possible. Policies that need to be adjusted due to changes in the statutory retirement age should be formulated and implemented as soon as possible after thorough evaluation. It is necessary to further increase policy support and work efforts to effectively address the real concerns of the people. We should take expanding employment as an important measure to support the advancement of reform, implement and improve employment policies for college graduates and other young people, and protect the rights and interests of workers. -、-，。，、，。，。，，.

In particular, the jet has flown to the world's highest civil airport four times, and fully verified its adaptability to ultra high-altitude operations.- Also on the page is a report on the issuance of new technical standards for electric bicycles. This was issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology together with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Fire and Rescue Administration. The draft is open to public comments. The report has some interesting points: In 2023, there were 738 enterprises above a designated size in the power-assisted bicycle manufacturing industry, including electric bicycles, with an annual output of 42.28 million units, a year-on-year increase of 3.8% Electric bicycles caused 18,000 fires in 2021, and the number increased to 25,000 in 2023, with an average annual growth of about 20%. The draft focuses on the enhancement of fire-retardant features of e-bikes, calling for stricter flame resistance requirements for non-metallic materials to be used in electric bicycles. It also calls for limiting the use of plastic components. The draft also proposes additional features such as real-time communication and Beidou satellite positioning so as to ensure e-bike's safety through dynamic monitoring.

The draft also relaxes the vehicle weight limit for lead-acid battery models from 55 kilograms to 63 kilograms Subscribe now Page 14: There's a Zhong Sheng commentary on the recent announcement by USTR following a statutory four-year review process on tariffs on Chinese imports. The USTR report said that: -The Trade Representative is proposing modifying the actions by adding or increasing section 301 tariffs for certain products in strategic sectors. Many of the sectors are targeted by China for dominance or are sectors where the U.S. has recently made significant investments. These include: Battery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries) Electric vehicles Facemasks Lithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries Lithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries Medical gloves Natural graphite Other critical minerals Permanent magnets Semiconductors Ship to shore cranes Solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules) Steel and aluminum products Syringes and needles- The Zhong Sheng commentary argues that -the United States has politicized, instrumentalized, and weaponized economic and trade issues, and has insisted on imposing tariffs, which is protectionism that goes against the trend of the times. The United States should immediately correct its wrong practices and cancel all tariffs imposed on China.- It argues that section 301 tariffs are unpopular within the US. -The Office of the United States Trade Representative previously solicited public opinions on the results of the tariff review, and the majority of opinions opposed the imposition of tariffs or requested the expansion of tariff exemptions…Faced with many opinions opposing the imposition of tariffs, the Office of the United States Trade Representative postponed the announcement of new tariff measures on China twice, saying that it would continue to ‘review public opinions'. But facts have proved that the US government did not respect the opinions of the people, and insisted on raising the 301 tariffs on China out of domestic political compulsions. The US approach cannot achieve its declared goals; rather it will only backfire and weaken the competitiveness of American industries.- ，。，...，，--。，，，301。，，. The author adds: American tariff increases distort market rules and seriously damage the interests of the American people. The long list of tariff increases meets the needs of some US politicians to show strength to China, but it pushes up the prices of imported goods, with consumers bearing the cost of tariff increases. As per Moody's estimates, US consumers bear 92% of the cost of tariff increases on China, and American families spend an additional $1,300 each year. Outdated protectionist policies are also not conducive to protecting the interests of American workers. According to statistics from the US-based Tax Foundation, the tariff increase on China has not only failed to solve the employment problem of American workers, but has led to the loss of 142,000 jobs in the United States. US medical equipment importers and others believe that the imposition of tariffs on medical products, such as syringes, will affect doctors' access to high-quality tools and have a serious impact on American newborns and other vulnerable groups. ，。，，。，92%，1300。。，，14.2。，，.

State Council Discusses Venture Capital Sector & Regulations on Export Control of Dual-Use Items - What Guides China's New Era of Reform? - China-EU T...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, September 19, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with the report on the State Council executive meeting. The meeting studied measures to boost the development of the venture capital industry. In addition, it heard a report on this year's grain production situation and agricultural work; reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations on Commendation of Martyrs (Draft Amendment)'; and reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Export Control of Dual-Use Items (Draft)'. The meeting said venture capital is related to technological innovation, industrial upgrading and high-quality development. It is necessary to: accelerate the clearing of blockages and bottlenecks in the various stages of ‘fundraising, investment, management, and exit.' Support eligible tech companies to go public domestically and internationally, vigorously develop the equity transfer and mergers &amp; acquisitions markets, promote the pilot program of distributing physical stocks, and encourage private capital to set up market-oriented mergers &amp; acquisitions funds or venture capital secondary market funds to foster a virtuous cycle in the venture capital industry. encourage state-owned capital investment to become more responsible long-term capital and patient capital, and improve policies related to state-owned capital contributions, performance assessments, fault tolerance, and exits. consolidate the institutional foundation for the healthy development of venture capital, implement key measures for capital market reform, improve the functions of the capital market, and further stimulate the vitality of the venture capital market. ，、。--，，、，，，。、，、、、。，，，. On agriculture, the meeting called to study and formulate the policy plan for grain purchasing and storage as soon as possible, announce the minimum purchase price of wheat in the new year as soon as possible, improve the reward and compensation policy for soybean processing, and protect farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain. It is necessary to increase support for cattle and sheep breeding and implement a number of relief policies to help farmers tide over the difficulties. ，，，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next on the page is a long, long Ren Lixuan article. The crux of the article is a call to action for everyone to implement the reform agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session, and implementing action requires ideological alignment with Xi. The author contends that: -Only by learning well can we implement and execute effectively. Firm action stems from strong political consciousness and ideological consciousness. Only by being clear-headed and resolute in thought can we be strong and effective in action. To ensure the implementation of reforms and be steadfast practitioners and doers in building Chinese-style modernization, we must adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, and learn and understand the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee.- 、。、。，。，、，、、，. Later the author adds: -Thought is the banner of action and hard work. To further comprehensively deepen reform and promote Chinese-style modernization, we are treading a path never before taken by our predecessors. This journey must be guided by the correct guiding ideology. Only by adhering to the correct guiding ideology can we avoid taking the old path of being closed and rigid or the evil path of changing flags and banners, but unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuously promote the self-improvement and development of the socialist system. The ‘Decision' has put forward the ‘guiding ideology for further comprehensively deepening reform', which plays a vital role in further comprehensively deepening reform. Especially at this moment, as reform progresses, the complexity of the situation and environment we face is unprecedented, and the arduousness of the tasks of reform, development, and stability that we bear is unprecedented. The direction of the reform ship must be precise, and its navigation must be steady. The guiding ideology for further deepening reform provides a ‘compass' for the steady and far-reaching progress of reform. We must move forward in the direction guided by the guiding ideology of further comprehensively deepening reform, and we must not deviate or waver at any time. Within the guiding ideology, General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions about comprehensively deepening reform are the most important content. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping has personally led, deployed and promoted the work of comprehensively deepening reform, scientifically summarised historical experience, deeply grasped the laws of reform, and creatively put forward a series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods, clearly answering major questions such as why we should comprehensively deepen reform in the new era and how to promote comprehensively deepening reform, providing a fundamental guideline for further comprehensively deepening reform. General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform not only have in common traits of Marxist theory, such as being political, people-oriented and practical, but also possess a strong sense of historical initiative, firm commitment to upholding principles while innovating, clear problem orientation, systematic strategic layout, profound humanistic concern, and a deep global vision. Party members and cadres should deeply study and understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, grasp their rich connotations, theoretical characteristics and practical requirements, and further unify their thoughts and actions. 。、，，。，，，，。《》--，。，，，、，--。，、。，、、。，、、，，，，、、，、，。、、，、、，、、、、、。、、，、，. And much later, the author also adds: Party members and cadres must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, resolutely implement the Two Safeguards', persist in using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite hearts and forge souls, and thoroughly implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform. On the basis of learning and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, we must implement reforms with a spirit of perseverance and demonstrate our responsibility and action. On the basis of thoroughly studying and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, we must apply the spirit of driving nails to ensure the implementation of reforms, demonstrating responsibility and action. --，--，，、、，，，. Towards the end, this bit is useful to note: -The more than 300 major reform measures determined in the ‘Decision' are all innovative measures, and many strategic deployments are mainly strategic, forward-looking, and directional, still requiring the formulation of thorough and feasible reform plans through exploration and innovation. This requires all regions, departments and Party members and cadres to implement the spirit of the CPC Central Committee to the letter, closely integrate the actual situation, adapt to local conditions, explore and innovate to implement reforms well, and create fresh experiences that can be replicated and scaled.- 《》300，、、，。，，，，、. -Exploration and innovation, along with daring to act and be effective, are proactive actions based on a deep understanding of the guiding ideology, overall goals, and key principles of further comprehensively deepening reform. They are creative actions following a deep understanding of the Party Central Committee's strategic deployment intentions. They are scientific actions that follow the laws of comprehensively deepening reform and building Chinese-style modernization. This is an inherent part of being resolute practitioners and doers. Only by exploring and innovating, and daring to act effectively, can we prevent mere copying in implementation, superficiality from top to bottom, and avoid mechanical execution, oversimplification, and ‘one-size-fits-all' approaches. To explore and innovate for effective reform implementation, it is necessary to promote positive interaction and organic integration between top-level design and grassroots exploration…- 、，、、，， ，、。 、，、，、、--。 ，、.

Subscribe now Page 10: There's an article by the Theory Study Center of the Party Group of the Development Research Center of the State Council. The article talks about building a high-level socialist market economic system. They key tasks that it outlines are: The core issue in building a high-level socialist market economic system is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market. Letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better leveraging the role of the government are important practical experiences formed in the process of China's reform. To unlock the potential of the socialist market economy system at a higher level, the market mechanism must be utilised more effectively, ensuring that property rights serve as effective incentives, factors flow freely, prices respond flexibly, competition is fair and orderly, and successful enterprises thrive while weaker ones are eliminated. At the same time, the government's ability to govern the macroeconomy must be enhanced to better maintain market order, address market failures, and ensure smooth circulation of the national economy, smooth the circulation of the national economy, so as to do both ‘let it live' and ‘maintain control'. 。，，。，，、、、、。，，、，，----. The key points that then follow are: Adhere to and implement the two unwaverings. -Public ownership is the main body, and the common development of multiple ownership economies is an important part of the socialist basic economic system. The leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy is an essential requirement of a socialist state. It is necessary to actively implement the Decision by concentrating state capital in key industries and sectors related to national security and the lifeblood of the national economy, in public services, emergency capabilities, and public welfare areas, and in forward-looking, strategic emerging industries. This requires deepening the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises, establishing a system for optimising the layout and structural adjustment of the state-owned economy, and improving the system and mechanism that promote state-owned enterprises focusing on their main responsibilities and core businesses. The private economy is an inherent element of China's economic system and an important force in promoting the development of the socialist market economy. However, there are still problems such as unequal market access and the failure to effectively protect legitimate rights and interests. It is necessary to accelerate the implementation of the ‘principles and policies that help foster a favorable environment and create more opportunities for the development of the non-public sector' put forward in the ‘Decision' to ensure equal access to factors and business activities after access. Guide private enterprises to improve corporate governance, strengthen the compliance and legal operation of private enterprises, and promote the private economy to better play an important role in stabilizing growth, maintaining employment, and promoting innovation within the framework of the socialist market economic system.- --，、。、。，《》、，、、，，，，。，，、。《》--，。，，、、。 Build a unified national market. Under this, the article points to the fact that -the construction of a national unified factor market faces problems such as local investment promotion involution, imperfect factor price formation mechanisms, insufficient social security connections, and imperfect free flow mechanisms for factors like land and data. The construction of a national unified product market faces issues such as local protectionism, market access barriers, different treatments for different ownership systems, monopolies, and unfair competition.- ，，，，、。、、、。It proposes that: we must strengthen the rigid constraints of fair competition review and intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition efforts…standardise local laws and regulations on attracting investment, and prohibit giving preferential policies in violation of laws and regulations. Establish and improve a unified, standardized and information-sharing public resource trading platform system such as bidding and procurement by the government, institutions and state-owned enterprises, achieving full-process open management of projects. Improve the regulatory mechanism for new economic organizations such as platforms. Improve the land, capital, technology, and data markets, improve the price mechanism of factors mainly determined by market supply and demand, and prevent the government from improperly intervening in price formation. Promote pricing reforms in water, energy, transportation and other fields to achieve more efficient allocation of factor resources. 《》，，。，。、、、，。。、、，，。、、，。 Ensure fair competition in the market. Improve the macroeconomic governance system. Under this, the article calls to -improve the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanism, promote the coordinated efforts of planning, finance, currency, industry, price, employment and other policies, and bring both economic policies and non-economic policies into the consistency assessment of macroeconomic policy orientation to improve the comprehensive efficiency of macroeconomic regulation and control…deepen the reform of the fiscal and taxation system, improve the budget system, optimise the tax structure, increase local independent financial resources, improve the financial transfer payment system and improve the government debt management system. Accelerate the improvement of the central banking system, smoothen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, improve the capital market function of coordinating investment and financing, improve the financial supervision system, and improve the financial system's ability to serve the real economy and prevent and resolve risks.

Share Tracking People's Daily First, Euractiv reports that Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis are set for tough talks on Thursday ahead of a pivotal vote by EU member states next week. -Wang's visit, which follows whistle-stop trips to Germany and Italy earlier this week, is a last-ditch effort ahead of a vote next Wednesday (25 September) on whether to definitively implement the EU executive's proposed duties of up to 35.3% on electric vehicles (EVs). According to reports by the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU), Wang told Chinese and European automakers at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (18 September) that China-EU trade ties are now at a ‘crossroads', with ‘one path leading to openness and collaboration [and] the other to protectionism and isolation'. Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told Euractiv on Wednesday that the European Commission remains ‘open to a negotiated solution ... provided that such a solution is adequate and effective in addressing the risk of injury to EU industry that we established in our investigation.' The European Commission argues the tariffs are necessary to protect European automakers against unfairly subsidised Chinese competitors.- The report adds: -Fifteen of the EU's 27 member states, representing at least 65% of the union's population, must vote against the tariffs to prevent their introduction for five years starting from the end of October. Germany abstained in an initial non-binding vote on the proposed duties held in early July, while Spain voted in favour. Only four member states voted against it. Beijing's push to persuade European capitals to vote against the tariffs reportedly yielded some success over the past week. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both supported Beijing's call for a negotiated solution to the dispute. However, one person familiar with the matter told Euractiv that Germany will likely abstain again next week unless a block is likely to be achieved. But on Monday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said after a meeting with Wang that Rome will continue to ‘support the position of the EU'.- Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced a decision to impose countermeasures against nine US military companies for arms sales to Taiwan. Xinhua reports: -Pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 6, 9 and 15 of China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, China decided to take the following countermeasures against Sierra Nevada Corporation, Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC, Cubic Corporation, S3 AeroDefense, TCOM, Limited Partnership, TextOre, Planate Management Group, ACT1 Federal and Exovera: Their movable, immovable and all other types of property in China will be frozen. Organizations and individuals in China will be prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation or other activities with the above-mentioned enterprises. The decision will become effective from Sept. 18, 2024.- -In response to a query concerning recent U.S. plans to sell arms to China's Taiwan region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, particularly the August 17 Communique of 1982; seriously violates China's sovereignty and security interests; damages China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; and sends an erroneous signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces. ‘China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this, and has lodged stern representations with the U.S. side. China has taken firm countermeasures and announced that it will impose sanctions on nine U.S. military companies,' he said. The United States continues to arm Taiwan, supporting Lai Ching-te and Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in their stubborn pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence' and their provocations regarding the one-China principle, Lin noted. This once again proves that the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the greatest saboteur of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait are the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' forces and the conniving support of external forces led by the United States, he added. It should be noted that the DPP authorities are attempting to seek ‘Taiwan independence' through military build-up, and the United States is determined to help advance that agenda by arming Taiwan, Lin said, adding that any such actions will only backfire and lead to disastrous consequences, ultimately ending in failure, Lin said. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the heart of China's core interests, and it is the most important red line that cannot be crossed in China-U.S. relations. No one should underestimate China's firm will and strong ability to oppose ‘Taiwan independence' and defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Extols the Superiority of the People's Congress System	It's the holiday edition today with the mid-Autumn festival upon us. But there were two important stories over the weekend. So let me cover those today. First, there was a meeting at the Great Hall of the People marking the 70th anniversary of the National People's Congress. The entire PBSC was present. Xi Jinping delivered a major speech. The full text of the speech was published in the paper on Sunday. I am going to rely on that and Xinhua's English report. Xi said: -70 years ago, the first session of the First NPC adopted the Constitution of the PRC, marking the formal establishment of the people's congress system, which is the basic political system of the country. The establishment of the people's congress system meant that China's politics had fundamentally achieved a great leap from a system where a few held power and the vast majority were oppressed and exploited, to one where the Chinese Communist Party leads and the people are the masters of their own country. This was an unprecedented achievement in thousands of years of history, realising a great transformation in China's political system. The system of people's congresses is the result of the arduous exploration and long-term struggles of the Chinese people under the CPC leadership. It is an entirely new political system that has grown from the Chinese soil and a great invention in the evolution of political institutions. From the initial exploration and proposal of the basic concept of the people's congress system during the New Democratic Revolution, to its establishment and implementation during the period of socialist revolution and construction, to its continuous consolidation and improvement during the new period of reform, opening-up and socialist modernization, and to its further development towards greater maturity and institutionalisation in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the system of the people's congress has gone through an extraordinary journey. It is now deeply rooted in China and has become an integral part of the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- 70，《》，。，、、，，。，，。，，，、，，，. Subscribe now In the next part of the speech, Xi made five points, highlighting the significant advantages of the system of people's congresses. First, the people's congress system has demonstrated significant political advantage of upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and ensuring that the Party leads the people to effectively govern the country according to law. The people's congress system upholds the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, firmly safeguards the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and upholds the Party's core leadership role in taking overall charge and coordinating all entities. This system is conducive to ensuring and consolidating the Party's leadership position and its governance status from both an institutional and legal perspective, ensuring that the Party's propositions become the will of the state through legal procedures, ensuring that the candidates recommended by the Party organization become the leaders of the state power organs through legal procedures, ensuring that the Party exercises leadership over the state and society through the state power organs, and ensuring that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work. This effectively overcomes the chaos and disunity of old China, where there was no central leadership (a group of dragons without a leader - ), the country was fragmented (akin to a dish of loose sand - ), and constant political infighting and mutual attacks exposing each other's faults were commonplace. ——、。、、，，、，，，，，、、。、、. Second, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of practising whole process people's democracy and guaranteeing that the people are the masters of the country. The people's congress system upholds the people's dominant position, upholds the principle that all state power belongs to the people, supports and guarantees the people's exercise of state power through the people's congresses, and embodies the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship. The implementation of the people's congress system, together with the implementation of basic political systems, such as the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of grassroots mass autonomy, consolidates and develops the broadest patriotic united front, and together forms a comprehensive, extensive, and organically connected system of people being the true masters of the country. This is conducive to ensuring that all people, in accordance with the law, engage in democratic elections, democratic consultations, democratic decision-making, democratic management, and democratic supervision, and manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law. This effectively overcomes the phenomenon in some countries where the people appear to have rights in form but lack real power in practice, and where grand promises are made during elections, only to be ignored once the election is over. ——、。，，，。，、、，，、、，、、、、，、、。、、. — (Note: For any rational observer, the first point fundamentally undermines the second point. But if you read them in conjunction, the message is quite clear, that as long as the power and legitimacy of the Party to rule is not challenged, policy dialogue is possible.) Third, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of implementing democratic centralism and ensuring that the country's political life is both vibrant and stable and orderly. The people elect their own representatives through democratic elections to form people's congresses at all levels. The state administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs are created by the people's congresses, are responsible to the people's congresses, and are supervised by the people's congresses. People's congress representatives come from all regions, ethnic groups, and all walks of life; they listen to and convey the opinions and suggestions of the public through various forms and channels. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees implement democratic centralism, fully leveraging democracy, and exercise their powers collectively. This demonstrates a high degree of unity between democracy and efficiency, ensuring that state organs operate in a highly coordinated and efficient manner, and that the country's various undertakings are organised and advanced in a unified and effective way. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where there is mutual obstruction, severe internal friction, and situations where matters are discussed but not decided, or decided but not implemented. ——、。，。、、、，，。、、，。，，。，，。、、. Fourth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of ensuring the comprehensive rule of law in the country and promoting the legalisation of all aspects of national governance. According to the Chinese Constitution, the NPC has the power to amend the Constitution and supervise its implementation, while the NPC Standing Committee interprets the Constitution and oversees its implementation. The NPC, its Standing Committee, and local people's congresses with legislative power have the authority to draft and amend laws and regulations, and the people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees have the right to supervise the implementation of laws and regulations and supervise the state organs to perform their duties in accordance with the law. Such an institutional arrangement is conducive to giving full play to the functional role of the people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels in the construction of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics; it is conducive to promoting scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and public adherence to the law; it is conducive to continuously improving the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution as the core; it is conducive to ensuring the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws; and it is conducive to maintaining social fairness and justice. This effectively overcomes the phenomena seen in some countries where there are no laws to follow, laws are not enforced, or where power overrides the law or suppresses it. ——、。，、，、，、，、.，，、、、，，，。、、. Fifth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of maintaining national unity and ensuring long-term stability. China is a unified multi-ethnic country and also a unitary state. The people's congress system serves as an institutional guarantee for maintaining national unity, ethnic solidarity, and social stability. Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, we have rationally divided the powers of the central and local governments, with the central government having comprehensive governance authority over all local administrative regions, including ethnic autonomous areas and special administrative regions. We uphold the principle of equality among all ethnic groups. In areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated, regional autonomy is practised, and autonomous organs are established to exercise the powers and autonomy of local state organs in accordance with the law. We adhere to the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems', establishing special administrative regions in Hong Kong and Macau, maintaining the constitutional order of the special administrative regions as defined by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and supporting the Chief Executives and governments of the special administrative regions in governing in accordance with the law. These institutional arrangements are conducive to maintaining the unity of the legal system, safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, fully leveraging the initiatives of both the central and local governments, and concentrating efforts to achieve major undertakings. They also help to consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations based on equality, solidarity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and promote the building of a Chinese national community. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where local governments act independently, central authority is weak (the tail is too large to wag – ), and ethnic extrangement/divisions and conflicts persist. ——、。，，、、。，，。，，，。--，、，，。，、，、，、。、、. Share Tracking People's Daily In the next bit, Xi begins by talking about the -strong vitality and significant superiority- of the people's congress system. Xinhua English summarises the next two paragraphs well: -Xi pointed out that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, our Party has stood at a new historical juncture, gained a deep understanding of the new changes to the principal contradictions in Chinese society, actively responded to the people's new demands and aspirations for democracy and rule of law, and improved the organizational and working systems of people's congresses, making historic achievements in its work. We adhere to adapting the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and fine traditional Chinese culture, deeply grasp the laws governing the development of socialist democracy, and continuously promote theoretical and practical innovations in the system of people's congresses. Noting that the system of people's congresses is an important institutional vehicle for realizing whole-process people's democracy in China, Xi said it is imperative to uphold the CPC's leadership, adhere to the use of a system of institutions to ensure that the people run the country, exercise law-based governance on all fronts, uphold democratic centralism, and stick to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. Efforts must be made to modernize China's system and capacity for governance, give full play to the role of deputies to people's congresses, strengthen the self-improvement efforts of people's congresses at various levels to uphold their four-fold role as political, working, representative institutions, and institutions of state power. This series of new concepts, ideas and requirements form the Party's important thoughts on upholding and improving the system of people's congresses, providing fundamental guidance for the high-quality development of people's congresses in the new era. After this, he put forth five points of action going forward. First, give full play to the role of people's congresses in ensuring full and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees must fully perform their functions, firmly safeguard the unity, dignity, and authority of the country's legal system, ensure effective implementation of the Constitution and laws, and make sure that all state organs fulfill their duties and carry out their work within the scope permitted by the Constitution and laws. Second, it is important that people's congresses play a leading role in legislative work. Xi urged efforts to improve the legislative framework featuring guidance from Party committees, the leading role played by people's congresses, support from the government, and participation by all parties. Efforts should be made to step up legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related fields, improve the quality of legislation, and continuously improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He also urged efforts to accelerate the improvement of a legal system featuring equal rights, equal opportunities and fair rules for all to ensure that citizens fully enjoy their rights. In addition, he called to adhere to deepening reforms within the framework of the rule of law, achieving unity between reform and the rule of law; major reforms should be based on the law and should be elevated to the status of legal systems in a timely manner. Third, he called to give full play to the key role of the oversight by people's congresses in the Party and state supervision systems. It is imperative to improve the system through which people's congresses oversee the government, the supervisory commissions, the people's courts and the people's procuratorates. Xi urged people's congresses to strengthen oversight of the implementation of the Constitution and laws, and intensify the review and oversight of government budgets and final accounts and the oversight over the management of state-owned assets and government debts. People's congresses should work to promote the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's decisions and plans, and ensure that all state organs exercise their powers by law and that the legitimate rights and interests of the people are safeguarded and realized. Administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory and procuratorial organs at various levels should readily accept oversight from people's congresses and effectively fulfill their respective supervisory duties. Fourth, Xi pointed out that people's congresses should play an exemplary role in maintaining close ties with the people. All state organs and their employees must foster a strong sense of service to the people, put the people above all else, and maintain close ties with them. Deputies to people's congresses shoulder the honorable duties entrusted to them by the people, Xi noted, urging them to faithfully represent the interests and will of the people, and serve as the bridge that links the Party and the state with the people. He stressed the need for all state organs to provide support for the deputies to the people's congresses to perform their duties in accordance with the law, improve the systems and mechanisms for contact with deputies, and ensure that deputies reach out to the public on a greater variety of issues and in more diversified ways. Fifth, Xi emphasized that party committees at all levels should strengthen their overall leadership over the work of the people's congresses, and support the people's congresses and their standing committees in exercising their powers and carrying out their work in accordance with the law. The leading Party members groups of the standing committees of the people's congresses at all levels should always adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, fulfill their main responsibilities for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, and strengthen the political, ideological, organizational, work style, and disciplinary construction of the people's congresses in line with the requirement to uphold the four-fold role. They should train personnel that maintain political resolve, serve the people, respect the rule of law, promote democracy, and are diligent and responsible, and continuously improve the quality and level of the people's congress work in the new era and on the new journey. Towards the end, Xi said: -Democracy is a common value of all mankind. The great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in developing people's democracy have enriched global democratic theory and practice, and contributed Chinese wisdom and solutions. We should draw on the beneficial achievements of human political civilization, but we must not simply copy Western political systems. We are willing to continue exploring with all countries and peoples around the world who pursue peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, to jointly explore paths for achieving broad, genuine, and effective democracy, and to make new contributions to the progress of human political civilization.- 。，，。，。、、、、、，、、，。 70 years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call to ‘struggle to build a great socialist country' in his opening speech at the first session of the First NPC. Now, the new journey of building a comprehensive modern socialist country has begun, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. The entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, keep in mind the original intention and mission, actively develop whole-process people's democracy, strive to build socialist political civilization, give full play to the significant advantages of the people's congress system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization!- 70，，--。，，。，、，，，，、! Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Saturday, there was a detailed report (English report) on Xi's visit to Gansu and Shaanxi. Xinhua has a detailed English report too. In Gansu, Xi was accompanied by Gansu governor and Party secretary. He visited Tianshui, Lanzhou and other localities. Xi visited the Fuxi temple in Tianshui. Xi said that -it is imperative to protect and pass on the precious cultural heritage, so that the wisdom and creativity of ancestors will constantly inspire future generations and enhance national pride and confidence.- He then visited the Huaniu apple production base in the Maiji district of Tianshui. There, he listened to a report of a project to divert water from the Taohe River. The big message from Xi was that -the key to rural revitalization is industrial revitalization.- He called for -strengthened efforts to protect and optimize cultivation of this variety (of apples) and apply new marketing models so that this specialty industry will be expanded, and more people will increase their incomes. He wished villagers a prosperous life.- Xi then visited the Maijishan Grottoes. He said that -China's four major grottoes are the treasures of Chinese civilization, all of which have important historical and cultural value. He called on cultural relic workers to continue the -Mogao Spirit,- devote themselves to protecting national treasures, and make greater contributions to promoting the inheritance and innovative development of China's traditional culture and enhancing the influence of Chinese culture.- Next stop was Lanzhou, where he first went to a service center for Party members and residents. He also visited a police station. -He emphasized the necessity of focusing on the practical needs of residents, especially the elderly and children, and continuously improving community services. It is imperative to adhere to and develop the ‘Fengqiao model- in the new era, and make more solid progress on community-level governance and social security. Work must be done to continue to take actions against the practice of formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots units, so that grassroots cadres can devote more time and energy to serving the people.- Then, Xi visited a section of the Yellow River near the Zhongshan Bridge in Lanzhou, where he stressed the importance of ecological protection. The next day, he listened to a -work report from the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the provincial government, and affirmed the province's achievements in various work.- Xi added: Gansu should promote new-type industrialization, accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, strengthen and improve industries with distinctive advantages, actively develop strategic emerging industries, develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, and build a significant national manufacturing base for new energy and new-energy-related equipment. He also urged the province to actively cultivate modern specialty agriculture in cold and arid climate, and nurture a number of competitive agricultural brands. Efforts should also be made to promote the integrated protection and systematic management of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grass and sand there, and fortify the ecological security shelter in the western part of the country. He stressed the need for the province to deepen reform and expand opening up with greater courage and determination, actively integrate into the building of a unified national market, deepen reform related to state assets and state-owned enterprises, and encourage and support the development of the non-public sector. Efforts should also be made to implement the people-centered new urbanization strategy effectively, enhance the comprehensive carrying capacity of the counties, expand the county economy, and promote the integrated urban and rural development. Xi urged the province to take the initiative to serve and align local development with coordinated regional development strategy, expand cross-provincial cooperation, and deeply integrate itself into high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the construction of the new western land-sea corridor. Xi pointed out that Gansu Province has a profound historical and cultural heritage and is rich in resources of revolutionary culture. It is necessary to carry forward the revolutionary traditions and strengthen cultural heritage protection, he said. Efforts should be made to support the Dunhuang Academy in its efforts to become an example of world cultural heritage protection and a center of Dunhuang studies, and advance the building of the national cultural parks dedicated to the Great Wall, the Long March and the Yellow River, so as to provide a powerful source of inspiration for modernization. Efforts should also be made to further integrate culture and tourism, developing the cultural tourism sector into a pillar industry. Xi emphasized the need to promote social advancement and governance and establish a solid foundation for common prosperity among all ethnic groups. It is important to pool resources to address the demands of the people and accomplish practical livelihood projects that are tangible and accessible to the people. Work must be done to consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, and prevent any risk of lapsing or relapsing into poverty en masse in rural areas. Efforts should be made to promote the transformation of rural customs to cultivate a civilized rural atmosphere, continuously forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation and strengthen the governance of religious affairs in accordance with the law. He emphasized efforts to ensure the basic needs of the people affected by the earthquake that struck Jishishan County are met, and advance post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, making sure the people are safe and warm during the winter. Work must be done to effectively ensure workplace safety. Finally, on September 12, Xi met with senior officers at colonel-level and above, and representatives of model soldiers at the grassroots and civilian staff of the PLA troops stationed in Lanzhou. He was accompanied by CMC Vice Chairman He Weidong. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!
