The Myth of World Order	The world today is at a crossroad, caught between the remnants of the old order and the uncertainties of a new one. As great power competition resurfaces on the global stage, the coming years promise to reshape the international landscape. From the ashes of conflict and transformation, a new order will inevitably emerge. But does world order really matter? In this episode of The Great Power Show, Manoj Kewalramani talks to Shivshankar Menon, former Indian National Security Advisor and one of the world's leading strategic affairs thinkers, about the churn in the world today. Menon challenges the conventional wisdom that order-building is a hallmark of great powers. Drawing from historical transitions and contemporary geopolitics, he argues that moments of chaos often drive progress and the rise of great powers. The episode also focuses on India's strategic positioning in this evolving environment, analysing the opportunities and challenges it faces in navigating the current period of global turbulence. Tune in for an engaging dialogue on history, strategy, and the future of global power dynamics. About: The Great Power Show is a bi-weekly podcast featuring candid conversations and thought-provoking interviews with leading scholars, thinkers and practitioners on the geopolitical and geo-economic changes shaping our world.

US Companies on Export Control & Unreliable Entities Lists - New Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future - 58 Tigers Taken Down in 2024 - ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, January 3, 2025. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan sending a New Year card in return to representatives of middle school teachers and students in the US State of Washington. Xinhua reports: -In the card, Xi and Peng said the year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. During the Second World War, China and the United States fought together for peace and justice, and the friendship between the two peoples stood the test of blood and fire and is growing ever stronger, they said. The couple expressed their hope that the youth of China and the United States will continue to participate in China's initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study programs in a five-year span, strengthen exchanges and interactions, enhance mutual understanding, carry forward traditional friendship, and contribute to the development of China-U.S. relations and world peace.- China's Ministry of Commerce didn't get that friendship memo. Although it is not in the paper today, in a first-ever development, Beijing on Thursday put 28 American companies on its export control list. This was done in order to -safeguard national security and interests and fulfil international obligations, including non-proliferation commitments.- As a consequence, -it is prohibited to export dual-use items to the 28 US entities; related export activities currently underway should be stopped immediately. Also, -in exceptional cases where export is deemed necessary, the exporter must apply for approval.- The 28 entities are: 1. General Dynamics 2. L3 L3 Harris Technologies） 3.

Maritime Tactical Systems 25. Pacific Rim Defense 26. AEVEX AEVEX Aerospace 27. LKD LKD Aerospace 28. Summit Technologies Inc. In addition, the Ministry placed 10 American companies on its unreliable entities list for selling arms to Taiwan. Xinhua reports that these companies: Will be prohibited from engaging in China-related import or export activities Will be barred from making new investments in China Senior executives of these companies will be banned from entering China The work permits and visitor or residency status of senior executives of these companies will be revoked, and any related applications they submit will not be approved. The report adds: -The MOC stated that these companies have engaged in arms sales to the Taiwan region and conducted so-called cooperation on military technologies in recent years, despite China's strong opposition. Their actions severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, severely violated the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and severely undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, the ministry said, adding that the companies will be legally held accountable. Noting that China's unreliable entity provisions only target a few foreign entities that undermine China's national security, the ministry said the Chinese government will always welcome foreign companies to invest and expand their businesses in China, and is committed to providing a stable, fair and predictable business environment for law-abiding companies operating in China.- The 10 companies that have been added to the list are: Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Lockheed Martin Missile Systems Integration Laboratory Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories Lockheed Martin Ventures Javelin Joint Venture Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems General Dynamics Information Technology General Dynamics Mission Systems Share Tracking People's Daily Back to news about Xi. The Chinese president exchanged messages of congratulations with Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on the 45th anniversary of bilateral ties. Xinhua reports: Xi said that -In recent years, the political mutual trust between the two sides has been strengthened, practical cooperation in various fields has delivered fruitful results, and the China-Ecuador friendship has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people…Notably the China-Ecuador Free Trade Agreement, which has been successfully signed and entered into force, has given a strong boost to upgrading economic and trade cooperation and injected fresh impetus into the development of bilateral relations, the Chinese president said. ‘I attach great importance to the growth of China-Ecuador relations and stand ready to work with President Noboa to take the 45th anniversary as a new starting point to renew the traditional China-Ecuador friendship and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields so as to lift China-Ecuador relations to a higher level,' Xi said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's visit to Jinan in Shandong Province. Li said that -entering the new year, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference, with a sense of responsibility and urgency that time waits for no one, seize every moment, promote early implementation of policies, quick advancement of projects, ensure tangible outcomes of measures, and strive to achieve a good start to this year's economic development.- ，，，，、，、、，. Xinhua English summarises the rest well. Visiting a home appliance store, Li said that -the government's consumer goods trade-in scheme is of great significance to meet the needs of people for high-quality life, unlock consumption potential, promote industry upgrades and facilitate economic circulation. China will continue to implement this initiative with greater support, Li said, adding that procedures will be optimized to facilitate consumer spending.- He also visited a charging and battery-swapping station. Li -encouraged exploratory and innovative efforts in developing charging and battery-swapping services and related areas. Measures should be taken to deepen reform of the energy management system, transform the energy sector and foster new drivers of growth,- he added. Li then visited a sports stadium and a water management project. He said that -stadiums and modern water networks are not only significant infrastructure projects, but also important for public welfare, and called for efforts to strengthen supply of resources such as funds and land. Concerning urban renewal, it is important to stress the planning and layout of drainage networks and maintain strict oversight throughout the entire construction process to ensure that the project quality is able to stand the test of time, Li added. Efforts should be made to attract more private investment to participate in the construction of infrastructure and public services, he said.- Finally, there's a long, long article reviewing the development of work related to propaganda, ideology and culture in 2024. I am not detailing this. But the most significant development of course was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Culture in particular, which was formally established in October 2023. Patriotism is also a key trait that is highlighted in the article. Subscribe now Page 2: Wang Yi spoke at the opening ceremony of the new Research Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind in Beijing. This has been established by the China Foreign Affairs University. Wang said: -Building a community with a shared future for mankind is a significant original concept proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It is the core idea of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and represents China's answer to the era's question of ‘What kind of world to build and how to build it?' It holds valuable theoretical significance, major contemporary relevance, and profound global influence.- ，，，，-、-，、. -Wang Yi said that the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind highlights the original mission of the CPC. General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that the CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and strives for the cause of human progress. Building a community with a shared future for mankind reflects our Party's innate internationalist sentiment, organically combines the fundamental interests of the Chinese people with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, and closely links the future and destiny of China with the future and destiny of the world; transcends the differences in social systems and ideologies, and transcends the differences in history, culture, and development stages, and establishes a banner and direction for China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on the new journey.- ，。，，。，，，、，、，、. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind promotes the fine traditions of Chinese culture. This major initiative is a vivid practice of the ‘two integrations' and an innovative achievement of the sinicization of Marxism. It embodies the Chinese nation's worldview of ‘Great Unity' , the value of ‘harmony is the most precious' , and the perspective of righteousness/morality and interests that ‘puts righteousness first' . It demonstrates the peaceful, inclusive and innovative nature of Chinese civilization. It is the promotion and sublimation of China's excellent traditional culture under new historical conditions. It will surely unleash the timeless appeal and inspiration of Chinese culture, and will surely promote Chinese civilization to make new contributions to the progress of human civilization. 。--，，--、--、--，、，，，. -The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind demonstrates the profound power of scientific theory. Since its proposal in 2013, this concept has evolved into a broad and complete structure, with the construction of ‘five worlds' (these are: building a world of lasting peace, building a world of universal security, building a world of common prosperity, building an open and inclusive world, and building a clean and beautiful world) as its goal, global governance through consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits as its implementation path, the practice of universal human values as its guiding principle, the building of a new type of international relations as its foundational support, the ‘three major global initiatives' as its strategic guidance, and high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road' as its practical platform It enriches and develops Marxist theories of international relations, transcends traditional theories of international relations, and illuminates the path forward for global governance.- 。2013，、，--，，，，--，--，，，. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind clarifies China's proposition amid the once-in-a-century changes that are unfolding. Facing changes of the times and historical questions, building a community of shared future for mankind clearly advocates the spirit of ‘working together for this one and only planet Earth', an open and inclusive mindset, and a vision of win-win cooperation. It proposes transcending conflict and confrontation through peaceful development, replacing absolute security with common security, discarding zero-sum games for mutual benefit and win-win results, preventing clashes between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning, and protecting the homeland of Earth through green development, promoting state-to-state relations from peaceful coexistence toward shared destiny, injecting strong momentum into promoting world peace and development cause.- 。、，--、、，，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report informs of a symposium being held to study and implement a compilation of excerpts from discourses on the natural resources work by Xi Jinping. He Lifeng attended and spoke at this event. Xinhua English summarises the report well: -Xi's important discourses provide a fundamental guidance for natural resources work in the new era, He noted, adding that upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership over natural resources work is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in this regard. He also stressed adhering to the people-centered development philosophy, serving the modernization featuring harmonious coexistence between man and nature, and improving development of China's geographical space while doing the natural resources work. Efforts should also be made to effectively translate learning outcomes into practical work results, he added.- Finally, a report informs that Li Dianxun has been appointed as acting Governor of Hubei. Page 3: Just one report to note. 35-ton of emergency relief supplies, including tents, folding beds, solar lights, food, water purifiers and medical equipment, were sent by China to Vanuatu following the December 17 earthquake in Port Vila. Chinese Ambassador to Vanuatu Li Minggang held a -handover ceremony- which was attended by Vanuatu's caretaker Prime Minister Charlot Salwai.

Some data points to note: From January to November 2024, nationwide a total of 23,000 cases of illegal dining and drinking were investigated, and 36,000 people were criticized, educated and dealt with.- 2024，。2024111，2.3，3.6. From January to November 2024, discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels investigated and dealt with 192,000 cases related to the ‘four winds', criticized and educated 269,000 people, of which 188,000 were given Party disciplinary and administrative sanctions. ，2024111--19.2，26.9，18.8.

Although it's not in the paper, there's also this separate Xinhua article discussing the continuation of Xi's anti-corruption campaign. It says that in 2024, the number of cadres under central management ( or so-called ‘tigers') who have been -publicly announced as fallen- by the CCDI reached 58. The last to fall in the year was Zhou Jiabin, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress, and Secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee, on December 28, 2024. The piece reiterates that the fight against corruption -has no endpoint, only a constant process.- It adds that it is necessary to -persevere in purifying the political environment.- -In the past year, the CCDI, the NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels have continuously consolidated and built upon the overwhelming victory in the anti-corruption struggle, promoted the normalization and long-term effectiveness of preventing and combating corruption, and further improved the effectiveness of combating corruption.- ，，，。，，、，. The piece also talks about maintaining -no forbidden areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance- when it comes to corruption. Then we get some data, before there is discussion on new approaches to tackle corruption and the focus on hidden corruption. Following the launch of the rectification campaign in April 2024, a total of 566,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption were investigated and dealt with nationwide. A total of 433,000 people were punished, and 14,000 people were transferred to the procuratorate. From January to November 2024, the ‘Skynet' operation repatriated a total of 1,306 fugitives. These included 120 Party members and state employees and 46 individuals against whom red notices had been issued.

Xinhua informs: -The national average reading in 2024 stood at 10.9 degrees Celsius, 1.01 degrees Celsius above the annual average, breaking the previous record set in 2023, which was 10.71 degrees Celsius. A total of 19 provincial-level regions logged record-high temperatures last year -- including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi. Average precipitation across the country reached 697.7 mm in 2024, 9 percent more than the annual average- Outside of the People's Daily, I found this article by Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute, China Institute of International Studies, making the pitch for a Pan-Asian Railway Network, rather interesting. It points to continued Chinese interest in pursuing railway connectivity projects abroad. Xiang also makes the case that this is not simply about economic efficiency but also a strategic requirement. The article begins by discussing the history of this idea, dating it back to the 1960s. Back then, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) had proposed a plan for constructing a freight railway network spanning the Eurasian continent, known as the Trans-Asian Railway project. Fast forward to April 2010, when representatives from 18 Asian countries signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Trans-Asian Railway Network in Busan, proposing the construction of a Trans-Asian Railway network spanning 81,000 kilometers. 60，、，（ESCAP），。，。，，19999，，。20104，18《》，8.1。，. Apart from making the economic argument for such a network, Xiang writes that for Asian countries -collaborating on the construction and operation of cross-border railways can strengthen economic interests and cultural ties, while fostering mutual understanding and trust, reducing conflicts, and maintaining regional peace and stability.- ，，，，，. He then discusses the challenges, writing that indeed, advancing such a grand project -not only requires gathering the political will and cooperative consensus of various countries, but also overcoming difficult and complex practical problems.- -The planning of the Pan-Asian Railway Network will first have to deal with the complexity and diversity of countries in the region, which have differences in terms of development levels and interests, making coordination costs high and difficulties great in aspects like route planning, construction standards, and operational management. Additionally, railway construction requires enormous investment, has long construction periods, and slow capital recovery. For cross-border railways, different countries will also have disputes surrounding benefit distribution and operational models, affecting cooperation enthusiasm and smooth project implementation. At the same time, engineering and technical problems cannot be ignored. Eurasian countries' railways have multiple track gauges; if cross-border connectivity is only based on the existing different track gauges, it will inevitably significantly constrain transportation efficiency. Whether ‘trains running on the same track gauge' can be achieved is a significant test of the quality of the Pan-Asian Railway Network. And to lay new electrified tracks, Asia's terrain is complex, some railway sections need to traverse mountains, deserts, rivers, tropical rainforests and other challenging sections, construction difficulty is high, engineering technical requirements are high, this will not only increase construction costs, but also involve many thorny environmental and socio-cultural issues. ，，，。，、，、、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，。--，。，，、、、，，，，. But Xiang sounds optimistic, citing China's high-speed rail network development as an example that has -demonstrative and radiative effect, encouraging neighbouring countries to accelerate their railway construction plans.- He adds: -Through BRI's framework for interconnectivity cooperation, China and its neighbours have launched numerous benchmark projects for the Pan-Asian Railway Network. In addition to the operational China-Laos Railway and Jakarta-Bandung HSR, there are over a dozen cross-border railway projects under construction or planning. A groundbreaking development is the China-Europe Railway Express, which, since its launch in 2016, has exceeded 100,000 cumulative trips, connecting 227 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries. ，4.6，，--，--，。，。--，。，。，201610，25227、11100. He adds: -As an ‘infrastructure fanatic' , China's experience and technology can help the Pan-Asian Railway Network ‘dream come true'. The China-Laos Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung HSR have activated the ‘high-speed rail dream' of ASEAN countries. The three lines of the Pan-Asian Railway Network in Southeast Asia, namely the East Line, the Central Line and the West Line, have all made progress to varying degrees. China and ASEAN are deeply integrating the Pan-Asian Railway Network planning with development plans such as the ‘ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan 2025', jointly formulating detailed construction plans and timetables, and solidly promoting pragmatic cooperation, committed to complete the strategic jigsaw puzzle of land and sea connectivity among ASEAN countries as soon as possible, and laying a solid foundation for the development of the ASEAN Community. --，--。--。、、，。《2025》，，，，. Currently, with the rise of trade protectionism and anti-globalization trends, major power competition, and geopolitical tensions, Asia-Pacific regional cooperation is facing bottlenecks and constraints. The more this is the case, the more urgent it becomes for regional countries to build consensus around connectivity, and the construction of the Pan-Asian Railway Network is also most timely. Under the new circumstances, the construction of the Pan-Asia Railway will help break down trade barriers, provide an efficient and low-cost cross-border transportation channel for the Asia-Pacific region, inject new impetus into economic and trade exchanges within the region, and help integrate resources in the Asia-Pacific region, promote the process of regional economic integration, and enhance the overall competitiveness of the regional economy. For countries prioritizing security and development, cross-border railway cooperation can strengthen strategic collaboration, increase political trust, reinforce a sense of shared destiny, hedge against geopolitical risks and challenges, and can also reduce dependence on maritime energy transportation through opening up land energy channels, thereby better ensuring their energy security, enhancing regional strategic stability, and improving the collective ability to respond to complex challenges.- ，、，。，，。，、，，，，。，，，，，，，，，.

Previewing CCDI Plenary - How Xi Has Led Reform - China's Flexible Retirement System - Commemorating Shen Junru's Life to Support for Xi - Wang Shida ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 2, 2025. Page 1: There's a long, long Xinhua article on how Xi Jinping led China in 2024 to take new and solid steps towards modernisation. It says that in 2024, Xi visited -more than 10 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the Macao Special Administrative Region, made four visits abroad, presided over a series of important meetings, attended a series of major events, delivered a series of important speeches, and put forth a series of important instructions, which promoted new achievements in the theory and practice of governing the country.- I am not going to detail the full article. Rather, let me just point to some key extracts: The piece says that -this is an era of great changes, and even more so an era of great possibilities.- ，。 Xi Jinping -personally served as the head of the drafting group for the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Congress, throughout the process laying out plans, organizing research, carefully guiding, and taking the pulse/setting the direction.- 2023，2024，7。，、、、. The article specifically references this speech that Xi delivered towards the end of October on the subject of reform. In it, Xi outlined the approach to properly handle four key relationships. In it, Xi had also called on leading cadres to -strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge; we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development.- The article reiterates that -high-quality development- remains the Party's -primary task.- The article touches upon policy shifts since the September 26, 2024, Politburo meeting, praising Xi for demonstrating -great foresight- and -extraordinary wisdom and ability in steering China's economy.- 、，、，、，. What are new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping provided a profound explanation: ‘Its characteristic is innovation, its key lies in high quality, and its essence is advanced productivity. How to develop new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward clear requirements: ‘Cannot rush in hastily, surge up in a rush all together and disperse in a rush together, must adapt measures to local conditions, each having their own strengths'.- ？：-，，。-？：-、、，，.- The piece then discusses China's achievements in technology and innovation, progress in regional coordinated development, and coordinating development and security. The last of these includes -preventing and resolving financial risks, especially systemic risks-, -development of new energy and national energy security- and -food security.- The third section of the article deals with employment, rural revitalisation, urban-rural integrated development, and the work done to -narrow the urban-rural gap, regional gap, and income gap, and promote the common prosperity of all people-. Two bits to note in the foreign policy section. -China's poverty alleviation process shows that with the tenacity, perseverance and a fighting spirit of ‘dripping water wears away a stone and following a blueprint to the end', the poverty problem in developing countries can be solved, and weak birds can fly first and fly high. If China can succeed, other developing countries can also succeed. This is the global significance of China's successful victory in the battle against poverty.- -，、、，，、。，。.- Also: -‘We admire the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and are willing to learn from the experience of the Communist Party of China.' ‘We will continue to deepen cooperation with China and actively participate in the process of Chinese-style modernization.' ‘President Xi Jinping seeks the well-being of the people, maintains social fairness and justice, advocates peace rather than war, cooperation rather than confrontation, and creation rather than destruction, and has set an example for the world' ... This is the echo of the times of Chinese-style modernization, and this is the global significance of the new form of human civilization created by China today.- -，--，--，，、、，-……，. Subscribe now Next, there's a piece that previews the upcoming CCDI plenary session. It says that: In 2024, the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission along with discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to making the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and directives, and the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the top priority of political supervision, focusing on key tasks such as the implementation of a package of incremental policy deployments, keeping watch on important deployments such as high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, strengthening supervision and inspection, ensuring proper implementation, and resolutely preventing disobedience of orders and violations of prohibitions. 2024，，，，，，、. Then we get some data: In terms of inadequate supervision and abuse of power in the field of ecological and environmental protection, -from January to November 2024, more than 24,000 related issues were investigated and dealt with, and more than 34,000 people were criticized, educated and dealt with, of which more than 19,000 were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- ，、。2024111，2.4，3.4，1.9. The CCDI and NSC made -special arrangements to strictly investigate corruption in the field of grain purchase and sales.- -From January to November 2024, discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels across the country investigated and dealt with more than 14,000 related issues, criticized and educated more than 21,000 people, of which more than 13,000 people were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- 2024111，1.4，2.1，1.3. The piece talks about how supervision is following the agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, with -discipline inspection and supervision organs actively performing political supervision duties to clear obstacles and further the development of new quality productive forces.- --。，. How does it do this? Here's an example: -Shanghai's Shibei Hi-Tech Service Industry Park has gathered a batch of technological innovation enterprises. Shanghai Jing'an District's Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, through visits, learned that small and micro enterprises face problems of having few tangible assets and difficulty in financing. They actively promoted functional departments and financial enterprises to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, provided enterprises with personalized financing loan solutions, while also supervising the park to accelerate the systematic construction of intellectual property operation and maintenance services. As of now, nearly 20 enterprises have received intellectual property pledge financing services, and their funding problems have been effectively solved.- 。、，、，，。，20，. (Note: I don't think that this is the norm for the CCDI and NSC to facilitate financing solutions for enterprises. It also is an example of significant political and Party interference in financing decisions. But then the piece also talks about the CCDI engaged in supervision with regard to cultural relics protection.) Towards the end, the article says: Inspection tours are a strategic institutional arrangement for strict and comprehensive Party governance. In 2024, according to the Party Central Committee's deployment, the Central Inspection Work Leading Group organized two rounds of inspections, inspecting 68 units in total. As of now, the completion rate of the 20th Central Committee's full-coverage inspection task is nearly 50%. The Central Inspection Groups put the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important instructions and directives in the primary position, closely monitored power and responsibility to strengthen political supervision, deeply understood the inspected Party organizations' situations regarding fulfilling functional responsibilities, implementation of major reform deployments, preventing and resolving major risks, deepening strict and comprehensive Party governance, strengthening leadership teams and cadre talent team building, and carefully finding political deviations. 。2024，，，68。，50%。，，、、、、，.

It says that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, the statutory retirement age for men will be gradually raised from 60 to 63 in the course of 15 years, while that for women cadres will be raised from 55 to 58, and that for women blue-collar workers will be raised from 50 to 55.- The document adds that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, employees who have reached the minimum years of contribution required by the state to receive a basic pension on a monthly basis may voluntarily choose flexible early retirement. The maximum early retirement period is up to three years before the statutory retirement age, and the retirement age cannot be lower than the original statutory retirement ages of 50 years for women blue-collar workers, 55 years for women cadres, and 60 years for men. When employees reach the statutory retirement age, the employer can flexibly delay retirement by reaching an agreement with the employee, with the delay time no longer than 3 years from the statutory retirement age.- 《》，202511，，，3，50、5560。，，，3. Page 3: There's a brief report informing that the China-Maldives FTA has taken effect from January 1, 2025. Also on the page, there's a report based on comments by MoFA's Mao Ning on China's focus on the Global South. I guess this is signalling for the year ahead. Mao said: -As Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out, the collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. In the past year, greater BRICS cooperation made a good start, the new model of ‘SCO plus' came into shape, and the African Union took part in the G20 Summit for the first time. Global South countries have joined hands to take part in multilateral cooperation more actively and extensively, bringing new impetus for the transformation of economic globalization, and adding new dynamism to global governance. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations. China will continue to practice true multilateralism, firmly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and bring the Global South together in solidarity for greater strength, so as to leave the mark of the Global South on the progress of humanity.- Leave a comment Page 6: There's a long piece marking the 150th birth anniversary of Shen Junru, who among other things was the chairman of the China Democratic League. One key excerpt from the article, given that history is never about history, but rather about the present. -We commemorate Mr. Shen Junru in order to learn from his spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, being selfless and fearless, and having the courage to struggle; to learn from his admirable qualities of advocating democracy, pursuing the rule of law, seeking truth, and striving for progress; more importantly, it is to learn from his steadfast political conviction of close cooperation and solidarity with the Communist Party of China and sharing weal and woe. Throughout the long revolutionary struggle, he forged deep friendships with CPC leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, becoming a trustworthy and candid friend of the Party. In his later years, Mr. Shen Junru held even deeper affection for the CPC. During the 1962 National Day celebration, Mao Zedong inquired about his health on the Tiananmen Rostrum and personally supported him as they descended the elevator after the event. Upon returning home, he emotionally declared, ‘We must always listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party of China.' This was not only Mr. Shen's earnest exhortation to the younger generations but also a vivid embodiment of the Democratic League's close alignment and resolute support for the CPC. Today, in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, members of democratic parties should take Mr. Shen Junru and other predecessors as role models, inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of multi-party cooperation, unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th CPC Central Committee, deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', strengthen the ‘Four Consciousnesses' and ‘Four Confidences', and achieve the ‘Two Safeguards', remain unwavering in thinking together, standing together, and working together with the CPC, upholding, developing, and perfecting China's new political party system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、、，、、、，、。，、，。。1962，，，：-，。-，、。，，，，，、，--，--、--、--，、、，、、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily On December 26, 2024, there was a piece by Wang Shida from China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Global Times in Chinese, arguing that while the world marks the 20th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, even today countries are realising that they need to -work together to overcome difficulties, as the region faces many new challenges requiring urgent attention.- Wang writes: -On one hand, the risk of bloc confrontation in the Indian Ocean region is intensifying. The Indian Ocean region is vast and densely populated, encompassing about 20% of the world's water bodies, a quarter of its landmass, and three-quarters of its oil, iron, and tin reserves. More importantly, the region is crucial for ensuring the safety and stability of global shipping lanes and trade routes, carrying over one-third of the world's bulk cargo and two-thirds of its oil shipments. International chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab el-Mandeb are located in the region, underscoring its significance in both economic and geopolitical terms. It is precisely because of the political and economic importance of the region that some countries have increased their involvement or interference in the Indian Ocean in recent years. The United States has been particularly active, pushing its ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy' to unite and integrate so-called ‘Indo-Pacific' allies and partners in an attempt to strengthen the containment of China. Currently, 3 of the US Unified Combat Commands are related to the Indian Ocean region, US military frequently conducts various joint exercises with regional countries, and has become the largest weapons supplier to the Indian Ocean region. Additionally, the US is leveraging mechanisms such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to bolster its influence and presence. Obviously, such actions amount to forming cliques in the Indian Ocean region, binding regional countries to America's war chariot, with growing risks of regional countries being ‘forced into camp confrontation'.- ，。、，20%、1/43/4、。，，1/3、2/3，、，。，。，--，--。，3，，。--、--。，，，--. On the other hand, the Indian Ocean region today is in urgent need of achieving sustainable development. At present, countries in the region are having to shoulder the heavy responsibility of developing the national economies and improving people's well-being, while at the same time facing several new and old challenges, such as environmental and climate change. Over the past few decades, climate change has caused countries in the region to experience increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations reported in 2021 that since the 1950s, the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than any other waters, which will lead to decreased fishing yields across the entire ocean, harming countries that are highly dependent on fisheries and lack the ability to adapt to climate shocks. In addition, by 2030, the population density of the Indian Ocean coastal areas is expected to reach the highest level in the world, with 340 million people living in potentially dangerous coastal areas. Obviously, avoiding risks of camp confrontation, opposing external power interference, or achieving regional stability and sustainable growth, including resolving lingering sovereignty disputes left behind from the decolonisation period, cannot be accomplished by any single country alone. It requires joint efforts from all Indian Ocean countries and regions as well as external () ‘positive energy countries'.- ，。，、，，。，、。2021，2050，，，。，2030，，3.4。，、，，，，--. -Although the US and other countries have been exaggerating the ‘China threat' and intensifying the containment and suppression of China under the framework of the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy', China has always developed relations with the countries in the Indian Ocean region with an attitude of equal cooperation and mutual benefit and win-win. In recent years, China's trade cooperation with the region has developed well, with increasing trade scale and growing mutual trade dependence. Currently, China is the largest import partner for over 20 countries in the Indian Ocean region, and the largest export partner for 13 countries in the region, with many regional countries joining high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. At the same time, China actively participates in multilateral cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and has hosted three China-Indian Ocean Regional Development Cooperation Forums. When the Indian Ocean tsunami occurred 20 years ago, China was a firm supporter of ‘working together to rebuild a beautiful home'. Looking to the future, China and the Indian Ocean region have broad cooperation space and huge development potential, with prospects to further advance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with regional countries, working together to achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the region.- ----、，、。，，，。，20，13，--。，，—。20，-，-。，，，，、.

Xi's New Year's Message & Warning - Putin-Xi Exchange Greetings - New Party Chiefs for Henan, Hubei, Guangxi & Qinghai	Wish all of you a very Happy New Year. Here's to another year of China-watching and analysis! If you work in a domain that requires you to conduct open-source China analysis, do please consider applying for my Watching China course. The course begins on February 1, 2025. Students and Takshashila alumni are eligible for discounts. Click here or on the image below for all the details. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 1, 2025. The front page today is dominated by Xi Jinping. The lead story is based on Xi's annual new year message. The speech (English text) essentially was a positive recap of 2024. He said: -We have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China's economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark. Grain output has surpassed 700 million tons, and China's bowls are now filled with more Chinese grain. Coordinated development across regions has gained stronger momentum, and mutually reinforcing advances have been made in both new urbanization and rural revitalization. Green and low-carbon development has been further enhanced. Indeed, a more beautiful China is unfolding before us. We have fostered new quality productive forces in light of actual conditions. New business sectors, forms and models have kept emerging. For the first time, China has produced more than 10 million new energy vehicles in a year. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields. Also for the first time, the Chang'e-6 lunar probe collected samples from the far side of the moon. The Mengxiang drilling vessel explored the mystery of the deep ocean. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link now connects the two cities across the sea. The Antarctic Qinling Station is now in operation on the frozen continent. All this epitomizes the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.- For 2025, he said: -In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan. We will implement more proactive and effective policies, pursue high-quality development as a top priority, promote greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and maintain sound momentum in economic and social development. The Chinese economy now faces some new conditions, including challenges of uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones. But we can prevail with our hard work. As always, we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident. Of all the jobs in front of us, the most important is to ensure a happy life for our people. Every family hopes that their children can have a good education, their seniors can enjoy good elderly services, and their youngsters can have more and better opportunities. These simple wishes are our people's aspirations for a better life. We should work together to steadily improve social undertakings and governance, build a harmonious and inclusive atmosphere, and settle real issues, big or small, for our people. We must bring more smiles to our people and greater warmth to their hearts. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, I visited the city again, and I was gratified to see the new progress and changes there. We will unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family. No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times. As changes unseen in a century accelerate across the world, it is important to rise above estrangement and conflict with a broad vision, and care for the future of humanity with great passion. China will work with all countries to promote friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual learning among different cultures, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We must jointly create a better future for the world.- Another report on the page covers Xi's meeting with representatives of retired officials and groups who received awards for their outstanding work. Li Ganjie spoke at this meeting. He called on everyone to -thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses and instructions on the work of veteran cadres; deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', resolutely implement the ‘Two Safeguards', and do a good job in the work of veteran cadres in the new era and new journey with high standards and high quality.- ，，--，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on Xi's remarks at the tea party arranged by the CPPCC on Tuesday morning. The full text of this speech is published on Page 2. Xi said: 2024 was a critical year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Over the past year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, we have responded calmly and adopted comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development. Chinese-style modernization has taken new and solid steps forward. 2024--。，，、，，. Xi added that -the development process over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements are encouraging. The economic operation is generally stable, progressing with stability, high-quality development is advancing solidly, scientific and technological innovation has made important progress, new quality productive forces are developing steadily, and it is expected that the annual GDP growth will be around 5%, with grain production exceeding 1.4 trillion jin for the first time.Reform and opening up continues to deepen, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee was successfully held, making arrangements for further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. Risks in key areas have been resolved in an orderly and effective manner, people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and employment and prices have remained stable. The 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the National People's Congress, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland were solemnly celebrated, and the construction of democracy and the rule of law, the practice of ‘one country, two systems' and the great cause of national reunification have made steady progress. We deeply advanced major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. We solidly carried out Party discipline learning and education, and unswervingly improved conduct, enforced discipline, and fought corruption. These achievements have further strengthened our determination and confidence in advancing Chinese-style modernization.- ，。、，，，，5%，1.4。，，、。，，、。75、70、75、25，、--。。，。，. He then added: -2025 is the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan. We must adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, better coordinate development and security, implement more active and effective macroeconomic policies, promote the sustained recovery of the economy, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, and complete the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start of the 15th Five-Year Plan.- 2025--。，，，，，，，，，，，--，--. He called on the CPPCC to -adhere to the organic integration of the Party's leadership, the united front, and consultative democracy, focus on the central tasks and serve the overall situation…- He also warned that: -in the process of Chinese-style modernization, there will not only be clear skies and gentle breezes but also fierce storms and even turbulent waves. We must maintain strategic determination, gather the powerful joint force of all Chinese people to unite and struggle, break through winds and waves, march forward bravely, and continuously push forward the great cause of building a strong country and national rejuvenation!- 、、，、，，，，、、、。、！，，。，，、，、!

Xinhua reports: -Xi said that 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of China-Russia diplomatic relations, a new significant milestone in the bilateral relationship. In the extraordinary journey over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have grown more mature and stable, he said. In face of the accelerated transformation unseen in a century and a volatile international landscape, China and Russia always move forward hand in hand along the right path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party, Xi said. Over the past year, the two heads of state held three meetings in Beijing, Astana, and Kazan, and maintained communication through phone calls, exchanges of letters, and other means, Xi said, adding that they had candid exchanges of views and reached broad consensus on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of common concern. The political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have been advancing toward higher levels under the strategic guidance of the two leaders, he added. Practical cooperation in various fields has yielded tangible outcomes, such as the completion of the China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline, and the successful launch of the China-Russia Years of Culture has fostered a closer bond connecting the two peoples through generations, Xi said. China and Russia also support each other as chairs of the BRICS mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), contributing significantly to solidarity and cooperation among the Global South, he added.- -Noting that 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, Xi said that no matter how the international landscape evolves, China remains committed to deepening comprehensive reforms, advancing Chinese modernization, and promoting global peace and development. Xi also expressed confidence that China-Russia cooperation in various fields would continue to create new opportunities for growth. The Chinese president voiced readiness to maintain close exchanges with Putin and keep China-Russia cooperation on the right course so as to continue consolidating and deepening China-Russia ties featuring permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation, injecting strong momentum into the development and modernization of the two countries, and contributing to the well-being of the two peoples and safeguarding international fairness and justice.- Share Tracking People's Daily As per Xinhua, Putin said that -looking ahead to 2025, Putin said that he stands ready to maintain close communication with Xi to jointly promote the development of bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, and further strengthen coordination and cooperation on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, BRICS, the SCO and the G20. Such efforts, he noted, will not only fully serve the interests of the two peoples but also contribute to international and regional security and stability.- Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also exchanged greetings. First, there's a report on the appointment of new Party Secretaries for Qinghai, Hubei, Henan and Guangxi. Wang Zhonglin has been appointed the Party chief of Hubei, replacing Wang Menghui. Wu Xiaojun has been appointed the Party chief of Qinghai, replacing Chen Gang. Liu Ning has been appointed the Party chief of Henan, replacing Lou Yangsheng. Chen Gang has been appointed as Party chief of Guangxi. Second, Qiushi's January 2025 edition's lead essay is a speech that was delivered by Xi on February 7, 2023, at the Central Party School. The session was attended by newly-elected members and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee, as well as principal officials at the provincial and ministerial levels. Sinocism today carried a working translation of the full article. My coverage of the reportage around the speech back then is available here.

Xi's anti-Corruption Warning at Politburo's Democratic Life Meeting	Since 2015, the Politburo has been holding annual democratic life meetings at the end of the year. These meetings entail discussions on ideological and disciplinary issues, with senior Party members offering self-criticisms before Xi. Today's People's Daily's front page covers the report on this year's democratic life meeting. Xi's remarks about the need to prioritise -political cultivation,- for Politburo members to persist with lifelong learning, the seemingly endless nature of the anti-corruption campaign and the call for them to strengthen education of family members and surrounding staff are striking. It is quite a chilling message that is being sent to the Party elite about the sword that hangs above them. The report says that: From December 26 to 27, the Politburo held its annual democratic life meeting, deeply studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The meeting focussed on consolidating and deepening the results of the Party discipline education campaign and comprehensively exerting the restraint and guarantee incentive role of party discipline education. It also focussed on taking the study and implementation of disciplinary regulations and implementation of the eight-point central regulations as important content for inspection. It also combined ideological understanding with actual work performance to conduct self-examination and Party spirit analysis, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. 122627，，、，、，、，. Xi Jinping presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. But before detailing Xi's remarks, the report says: Before the meeting, relevant departments made careful preparations. Politburo comrades had heart-to-heart talks with relevant responsible comrades, listened to opinions and suggestions, and wrote speech outlines. The meeting first heard reports on the Politburo's implementation of the 8-point central regulation and on the work of reducing grassroots burden by rectifying formalism through the year. Politburo comrades spoke one by one, focusing on the meeting's theme, conducting thorough self-examination in light of the ‘Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Chinese Communist Party', ‘Several Regulations of the CCP Central Politburo on Strengthening and Maintaining the Central Party's Centralised Unified Leadership', and ‘Detailed Rules for the CPC Central Politburo's Implementation of the Central Eight-Point Regulations', seriously identifying problems, deeply analysing, being frank and open-minded, meeting with candour and sincerity, in a serious yet lively atmosphere, achieving the expected results. ，。，，。，20242024。，，《》、《》、《》，、，、，，. The report says that the speeches by Politburo members made five points: First, more firmly safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralised and unified leadership; Second, more firmly pursuing the value of serving and benefiting the people; Third, more firmly implementing the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee; Fourth, more firmly taking the lead in learning, knowing, understanding, and observing discipline; and Fifth, more firmly fulfilling the political responsibility of strict Party governance. ，5。；、；；；. The meeting stressed that since the beginning of this year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, the Party Central Committee has united and led the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country to calmly respond and adopt comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development, ensuring that Chinese-style modernisation advances through new and solid steps. People's livelihood security has been solid and effective, the overall social situation remains stable, new achievements have been made in promoting the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law, major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has created new situations, and comprehensive and strict governance of the Party has been deepened. These achievements are hard-won. ，，，，、，，。，，，，。. Politburo comrades unanimously believe that the centralised unified leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well, ensuring that the ship of Chinese-style modernisation breaks waves and maintains steady progress. The whole Party must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the two safeguards', and unswervingly implement the principles, policies and work arrangements of the Party Central Committee. Next year is the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan; it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, promote sustained economic recovery and improvement, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, unswervingly comprehensively and strictly govern the Party, and complete the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start of the 15th Five-Year Plan. ，，、。--，--、--、--，。--，，、，，，，，，，，，，，--，--. Following this, the report details Xi's remarks, who began commenting on the self-examination speech by each Politburo member, offering -specific requirements for each, and delivering a summary.- He then said that -this democratic life meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee was very effective, achieving the purpose of exchanging ideas, examining problems, and clarifying directions, which is conducive to the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee to enhance unity, improve work, and fulfil its mission.- 、，。，，、、，、、. Xi Jinping emphasised that this Party discipline study and education campaign had effectively solved some problems of Party members and cadres being indifferent, not understanding, and not mastering Party rules and discipline, promoted Party organizations and leadership groups at all levels to strictly manage Party discipline building, promoted the broad masses of Party members and cadres to consciously become loyal, clean, and responsible, achieving obvious results. The awareness of discipline and rules and the consciousness of integrity and self-discipline among the broad masses of Party members and cadres has been effectively enhanced, the endogenous motivation for taking responsibility and doing practical work has been further stimulated, the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere have been further strengthened, and the effectiveness of rectifying formalism to reduce grassroots burden has been further demonstrated. ，、、、，，、，。、、，、，、、，. Xi Jinping noted that cultivating a strong Party spirit will naturally lead to more conscious observance of Party discipline and rules. Leading cadres must treat cultivating Party spirit and enhancing ideological consciousness as lifelong pursuits, living to old age, learning to old age, cultivating to old age. Political cultivation should be the top when it comes to Party spirit cultivation, and Party spirit should be nourished through the Party's innovative theories, and take learning, observing, and implementing Party constitution, Party rules, and Party discipline as important content of Party spirit cultivation. Politburo comrades must adhere to strictly requiring themselves to measure up to the standards of Marxist politicians, take the lead in studying the Party's innovative theory, take the lead in implementing democratic centralism, take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, take the lead in strictly observing Party discipline and rules, take the lead in promoting the Party's fine traditions and work style, truly achieving ideological beliefs as firm as rock, absolute loyalty to the Party, and selfless dedication to the cause of the Party and people. ，、，。、，、、。，，。，，，，，，，，. Xi Jinping emphasised that Party discipline has both an educational and restraining function, as well as a guarantee and incentivising role. Party discipline and doing practical work are internally unified. Discipline not only clarifies the bottom line and boundaries that cannot be touched, but also provides a code of conduct for Party members and cadres to do things cleanly and boldly. If you abide by the rules and disciplines, you will have full freedom and broad space to do things and be entrepreneurial. Politburo comrades should set benchmarks and set examples. They should not only become models of abiding by discipline and rules and doing practical work, but also establishing clear orientation, supporting and encouraging those who dare to take responsibility, fostering a dynamic atmosphere of striving forward with determination and competing for progress. ，，。。，、、。，。、，、，，，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that Party discipline draws bottom lines and sets forbidden zones for correctly exercising power and preventing the abuse of power for personal gain, serving as a safety guardrail for Party members and cadres to maintain integrity and honesty. Revering discipline and observing discipline enables one to resist corrosion and be immune to all poisons. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption still exist, the anti-corruption struggle will always be ongoing. We must remain extremely clear-headed and resolute in the fight against corruption, and never slacken or hesitate. Politburo comrades shoulder heavy responsibilities and must be more strict with themselves and be extremely cautious with the power they command. It is necessary to focus on strengthening the Party work style and clean governance construction in the areas under one's supervision or regions under one's leadership, resolutely fight against various unhealthy trends and corruption phenomena, and strengthen the education and management of family members and surrounding staff. ，、、，、。、，、。，。、，，。，，。，，. Xi Jinping stressed that strictly enforcing and maintaining Party discipline is the common responsibility of the whole Party. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must assume the main responsibility, Party organisation secretaries must perform the duties of the first responsible person, and other members of the leading group must perform ‘one post, two responsibilities,' with each level leading the next, and ensure that the Party's discipline construction continuously achieves new results. Politburo comrades must earnestly shoulder the political responsibility for the Party's discipline construction, understand discipline construction situations in their supervising fields or governing localities in a timely and comprehensive manner, dare to manage and address problems within their scope of responsibilities with strict governance They have no choice but to be the leaders, executors, and dutifully serve as leaders, implementers, and promoters of strengthening Party discipline construction. ，，。（），，--，，。，，、，、、. Xi Jinping finally emphasised that next year's reform, development, and stability tasks are very heavy, leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots and masses, strengthen investigation and research, figure out the urgent difficulties and anxieties of the people, figure out prominent problems urgently needing solution at the grassroots level, and study to solve them in a targeted manner. ，，、，，，，.

Ideology Matters: My Review of Kevin Rudd's 'On Xi Jinping'	Welcome to Books and Ideas, a space dedicated to exploring thought-provoking concepts and writing. This section is designed as a platform for deeper dives into ideas that I encounter and engage with, whether they are China-specific or have broader significance. This section is also a personal challenge and commitment. By curating and sharing my perspectives on books from various genres, I aim to push myself toward a more disciplined and diverse reading habit. Perhaps, it's also a firewall against being numbed by the constant engagement with Chinese official discourse. My immediate goal is to read and review two books a month. Over the years, I have found that writing detailed reviews allows me to retain the key insights. They also become useful when I'd want to refer to some specific aspects of the argument that someone has made in the past. Finally, I would also like this is to become a collaborative space for conversations and ideas. So I welcome engagement, and if there is a book that you would like to recommend, please feel free to do so. Cheers, Manoj Kewalramani Over the past decade, policymakers, scholars, and analysts have been grappling with a particularly difficult puzzle amid China's emergence as a global power. Could the trajectory of China's rise have unfolded differently? Were there alternate pathways that Xi Jinping could have taken to ensure that the country kept growing economically and accumulating international influence, while maintaining the Communist Party's unrivalled control over political power and the military instrument? Furthermore, could such a path have minimised or even avoided the intensifying strategic competition with the United States—a competition that is likely to shape the future of the world order? Addressing these questions require deep consideration of individual and systemic motivations, impulses and constraints. Are the sweeping changes in policies—from the centralisation of power, intensified Party-state intervention in the economy and society, and assertive foreign and security policies—the product of Xi's ambition and ideological convictions? Or have they been a rational political response by a Leninist Party-state system to internal and external circumstances? This further leads to a deeper theoretical consideration: in a Leninist Party-state system, can one meaningfully distinguish between the leader and the structural logic of survival of the system? In other words, is Xi Jinping's emergence as a dominant and transformative figure a product of his peculiarities or an inherent design flaw of the Marxist-Leninist Party-state system? In his new book, On Xi Jinping How Xi's Marxist Nationalism is Shaping China and the World, Kevin Rudd essentially contends that it is the man that matters today. Rudd's argument is that China under Xi has witnessed the -unalloyed rebirth- of the -ideological man.- Xi, as per Rudd, is a -convicted Marxist-Leninist-, who is driving China's politics and policy towards what he envisions is the goal of national rejuvenation. Understanding his ideological positions and prescriptions for China are, therefore, essential. Or as Rudd, rather helpfully summarises: -Xi's ideological worldview offers us a unifying ‘red thread', providing a useful, albeit incomplete, illumination of the unfolding contours of Xi's plans for China and the world.- Essentially, he argues that in China today, ideology is -a real barometer of much deeper change.- That it -represents a new and significant driving force, which we ignore at our peril.- -Understanding Xi's ideational world a useful guide to understanding the ‘real world' of politics and public policy- within Zhongnanhai. Another reason why understanding ideological shift matters is because in the Chinese system, ideological messaging -sets the parameters within which a more granular, internal political and policy discourse can proceed.- The ideological framework that Rudd ascribes to Xi is one of ‘Marxist-Leninist Nationalism'. He argues that in his approach, Xi has moved China to a Marxist and Leninist left along with a Nationalistic right. In particular, he describes Xi Jinping Thought as follows: -It does not offer an alternative epistemology or methodology to that of classical Marxism-Leninism as interpreted through Mao Zedong's principal works on historical and dialectical materialism, contradiction, and practice. Indeed, Xi explicitly affirms these previous approaches but is critical of the party for not having rigorously applied classical Marxist methodologies to the contradictions confronting it under his immediate predecessors. As noted previously, where XJPT does differ significantly from the past is in its periodization of recent Chinese history, its redefinition of the party's principal contradiction, and its articulation of the party's more detailed policy challenges arising in this new era. Beyond these three major changes, however, XJPT does not offer the party a new, free-standing ideological system. Rather, XJPT is highly elastic, building on the ideological inheritance of Mao and Deng, albeit with a decidedly stronger preference for the methodological approach and many of the conceptual conclusions of the former. And, as with Mao Zedong Thought, XJPT can be moulded to meet the party's future political needs by legitimizing actions that Xi may need to take in response to as-yet-unknown policy pressures in the years that lie ahead.- At this point, it is useful to unpack some of the key concepts that help one understand the argument. The author does in the early chapters: Ideology: Rudd defines it as -a systematic body of ideas that provides an organization with a defined unity of purpose, giving rise to a program of action, irrespective of whether those actions arise as a direct or indirect consequence of that body of ideas.- Worldview: When exploring the concept of worldview, Rudd engages in a discussion on the distinction between pure and practical ideology. This is because -a world view may give the individual a certain outlook, but it does not indicate to him how he should act. Therefore, he distinguishes pure ideology from practical ideology. -Pure ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual a unified and conscious world view; practical ideology is a set of ideas designed to give the individual rational instruments for action…of practical ideology have no legitimation. But without practical ideology, an organization cannot transform its Weltanschauung into consistent action.- In his analysis, Rudd eventually brings these two concepts together: -China's ideological worldview should therefore be defined as the CCP's analytical methodology for understanding the world both at home and abroad and its conclusions about the changing nature of the world they face, including the range of strategic threats and opportunities they identify as a result of this analysis. It also includes their view on how the Chinese party and state should respond to these changing circumstances through political and policy action.- Let's now turn to some of the other concepts from the book. The Leninist Party: Rudd defines a Leninist party -as a political organization that applies the disciplines of historical and dialectical materialism, the theory of contradiction, and the targeting of political struggle, on the one hand, to the praxis of current, real-world circumstances, on the other. It therefore analyses where contradictions exist, whether they are major or minor, whether they are violent or non-violent, and what form of struggle is required in order to achieve resolution and progress. The Leninist party is also responsible for maintaining both ideological and organizational discipline within the party so that revolution at home and abroad can be achieved without internal political dissolution, or through deviation from the agreed ideological line. These form the core tenets of Chinese Leninism.- Left &amp; Right in CCP Context: This is an important explanation. -In CCP history, ‘left' and ‘right' as political labels have been shaped around several recurring, core issues within the party's debates over more than a century. Principal among these are: the scope of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the dangers of bourgeois liberalism and democracy; the primacy and permanency of class struggle; the centrality of the relations of production over the factors of production; the importance of equality and inequality; deep questions of the periodization of party history, including the primary stage of socialism; the socialist law of value; the socialist market economy; the relative roles of the party, the government, and the state; and the legitimacy of supporting world-wide revolution beyond China's borders. In other words, the ideological epithets of ‘left' and ‘right' are therefore not simply hollow phrases designed for prosecutorial purposes and devoid of substantive meaning. Indeed, throughout party history, they have been both tools of intra-party politics as well as means of expressing real-world ideational, political, and policy divergence.- The Leninist Left in his view, encompasses -reasserting the leader's power over the party's collective leadership, redeploying a Mao-like party rectification movement to restore party discipline, and reinforcing the dominant role of the party over the professional technocratic machinery of the Chinese state.- The Marxist Left: Rudd also identifies 7 essential feature of Chinese Marxism. Key among these is that Chinese Marxism is fundamentally -materialist rather than idealist,- and that its -machinery of change- -is dialectical materialism, based on the concept of the unity of opposites, the inter-permeation of phenomena, and the theory of contradiction.- He defines the shift to Marxist Left essentially in the context of the economy. Rudd argues that Xi has done so by -asserting the primacy of state planning over market forces, the state-owned enterprise sector over private firms, and greater income equality over rampant inequality.- Nationalistic Right: This refers to the changes in Chinese foreign and security policy. This, he argues, is reflected in increasing, top-down, nationalist campaigns about Chinese civilisational centrality, an enhanced grievance culture about the West's past occupation and continued containment of China, the prospect now for the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation', articulated by a new ‘wolf warrior' diplomacy legitimizing a more assertive and aggressive posture towards the world, all harnessed by a new, ideological assertion that China's time has now come with ‘the rise of the East, and the decline of the West'.- Importantly, Rudd contends that -Xi's nationalism is sui generis—it differs significantly from the forms of defensive nationalism often found in the Deng-Jiang-Hu era, but neither is it a simple reprise of Mao-type revolutionary nationalism. Although the nationalist component of Xi's overall ideological worldview is clearly driven by a number of revisionist ambitions from ‘the right', there is also evidence of a number of residual Marxist-Leninist concepts. These are further reinforced by certain classical Chinese ideations of the ‘Middle Kingdom', all combined in an eclectic vision of a form of future Chinese-led international order. In other words, Chinese nationalism under Xi is emerging as a composite of three inter-connected traditions. It evidences: a nationalist-revisionist core; a Marxist, historically determinist rationale concerning the inevitable collapse of the international capitalist order led by the United States; while also wrapping itself in the classical garmentry of universal Confucian values, Tianxia, and other forms of more ancient Sino-centrism.- Next, I'd like to highlight two key arguments from the book, which I found deeply thought-provoking. One of the most intriguing arguments in the book deals with changes in China's economic policy under Xi. Rudd argues that Xi believes that -the analytical paradigm of dialectical (and historical) materialism was important for China's ‘strategic thinking' across the board.- In other words, it is an essential tool to analyse and respond to the changes in China's internal and external environments. In discussing China's shifting policies, Rudd explains that it is not his view that Marxist-Leninist ideology or the instrument of dialectical materialism did not matter during the Deng-Jiang-Hu era. He says that it mattered -in terms of the party's ongoing claims to national political legitimacy in the eyes of its membership and the people- and -it mattered as a central medium for both internal party discourse and as a guide to substantive policy action by the Chinese state.- The key difference, however, was that Deng, Jiang, and Hu -remained ideologically disciplined in their respective levels of policy activism- for a variety of reasons. This is not the case with Xi, who is the first leader since Mao -to deliver speeches explicitly dedicated to Marxist analytical methodology.- Xi's policy activism is primary due to his assessment of the changes in China's domestic and external contradictions. In addition, something about the 2015-16 stock market crash also seemed to leave a deep impact on Xi. From the perspective of the economy, Rudd explains that the change in the understanding of China's principal contradiction at the 19th Party Congress in 2017 was incredibly important. He argues that Xi seems to have assessed that although China continues to remain in the primary stage of socialism, the progress made since the era of Reform and Opening up has brought it to towards latter phase of this stage. Discussing the concept of periodising development into different stages of socialism, Rudd explains: -The underlying ideological logic of this official periodization of China's development trajectory is that it determined the level of class inequality to be tolerated at each stage in order to raise the people's overall living standards. But, in Xi's logic, the ideological purpose of generating greater wealth was not to permit higher levels of inequality forever; it was to accelerate the overall economic development process towards higher levels of socialism. In the primary stage of socialism, higher levels of class inequality have been permitted in order to generate more rapid economic growth. However, as the party moved towards more advanced levels of socialism, that inequality must be moderated before being eliminated altogether under communism.- This requires purposeful action to correct the imbalances that decades of pro-market policies had generated. Xi's answer to this challenge is the New Development Concept, which Rudd says -represents his overarching ideological alternative to Deng's concept of ‘reform and opening'.- He adds: -It is designed for the ‘new era' that had been heralded by the ‘higher phase' of the primary stage of socialism that Xi believed China had now reached, as the country proceeded along its pre-ordained path—one that had been determined long ago by the ineluctable forces of historical materialism.- Interestingly, examining Xi's speeches, Rudd concludes that Xi seems to be suggesting that the -mid-century goal (2049 goal of modernisation) as the official benchmark for formally ending the primary stage of socialism-. It is within this context that Rudd also characterises Xi's drive for common prosperity, which the Chinese leader has classified as an essential aspect of Chinese-style modernisation. A direct consequence of this assessment is intensified intervention in the markets and the need to constrain and direct the growth of the private sector and wealth creation. Rudd is rather clear-eyed in his assessment of Xi's global ambitions. Examining Xi's speeches, he concludes that the Chinese leader views foreign policy and the shape of the international order within the context of his broader goal of national rejuvenation. In this context, he views competition with the US as an inevitable contest between national systems. He also appears to believe that in this regard, China's Party-state system enjoys superiority. This not only has implications for domestic policy and bilateral relationships with other countries but also for the future of the world order. Rudd argues: -Xi Jinping is signalling loudly and clearly through his expanding nationalist narrative that the time has come to take active measures to change the international status quo in a direction that is more compatible with Chinese national interests, values, and power. This includes consciously and actively reshaping the international rules-based order. It also means resolving outstanding challenges to China's perception of its territorial integrity.- He further writes that in Xi's view, going forward, -China's growing national power would be the fulcrum of the emerging international system; it would not be an international structure still underpinned by historical American power—or by some loose, power-sharing arrangement with others.- Rudd argues that Xi's vision for the world order is that -China should lead the building of this order, and that it should draw on its own reservoir of national wisdom in doing so.- This vision for order is encapsulated in the concept of the community of common destiny for mankind. -These propositions-, Rudd writes, -represent a major departure from Deng's underlying argument that Beijing should work within the framework and structures of the existing international order as a continued precondition for maximizing China's national economic development.- From Rudd's perspective, this is a product of a sense of new nationalism but also the outcome of Xi's assessment of the state of the world through the methodology of dialectical and historical materialism. He adds: -the central ideological construct of ‘struggle' unifies both Xi's domestic and international missions. Xi also refers to Marxist understandings of the ‘underlying trends' that warrant this new exercise in international institutional reform or ‘struggle', as an old, American-led order passes away and a new Chinese-led order comes into being.- On Xi Jinping is a truly compelling read. Rudd has waded through vast amounts of Xi Jinping's writings, official discourse and scholarly work distilling important insights for analysts and policymakers around the world. Indeed, we are in an era where tracking ideological discourse is critical to understand the long-term, strategic policy trends. However, ideological clarity from Xi Jinping does not necessarily imply rigidity in policymaking. In fact, at different points in the book, Rudd argues that Xi himself does not view Marxism as a rigid, dogmatic ideology. Furthermore, towards the latter part of the book, Rudd delves into Xi's discourse on strategy and tactics. Xi has argued that -strategy and tactics are powerful weapons for our party to lead the people to transform the world, change practice, and promote historical development. The correct application of strategy and tactics is the secret of our party's success in creating a glorious history…To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must pass on, apply, and develop this successful secret well.- The secret essentially implies persisting with strategic objectives while maintaining tactical flexibility because the -environmental conditions for implementing the strategy change at any time-. Of course, this proposition does not take into account the elephant in the room, i.e., there can always be a moment when tactical changes acquire critical mass thereby having a strategic effect. Anyway, while I am not going to detail it, Rudd's eventual prognosis for China and the world is not terribly optimistic. He believes that Xi is set to hold the reigns of power for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will continue to yield tumult and turbulence at home and abroad. Beyond this, as an analyst studying Chinese politics and policy-making and as someone who reads an unhealthy amount of official discourse, there are five practical lessons that I would like to draw from the book. First, while official language and discourse is often dull, repetitive and exhausting, it is important to go slow and take your time with it. Often the difference lies small changes in language or the use of certain adjectives and adverbs. These can be significant. Analysts tend to be most acutely aware of these changes when examining language related to monetary or fiscal policy, but even on ideological issues, it is important to not glaze over such changes. Second, ideological framing of policy shifts might take place after the fact but that does not render ideological discourse meaningless. It is still critical to continue deciphering the ideological casting of real-world policy changes because it sets the parameters for and can circumscribe the scope of action. More importantly, it sets the terms of debate for the future. This is because demonstrating ideological continuity even when breaking from the past is critical to the party's legitimacy. Therefore, understanding the codes of communication within the Marxist-Leninist system is critical for any analyst of China. Third, when engaging with the system's codes of communication, it is important to unpack how certain terms are understood within the Marxist ideological worldview. For instance, what does Xi mean when uses terms like modernisation, democratisation or common prosperity? What are the constituents of national rejuvenation, and what is its linkage with an emerging trend of global interventionism by China? This underscores the importance of work like The Decoding China Dictionary that the good folks at MERICS have put together. Fourth, analysing the use of banner terms is important. I have often been guilty of underplaying some of this in my assessments. For instance, I have seldom put as much stock in counting the number of references to terms like security or development in key speeches. But, after reading Rudd's book, I think it is worthwhile to take this into account far more than I have, particularly through the use of historical comparisons. In other words, changes in the number of times a concept is mentioned by Xi in comparison to his predecessors is useful. Likewise, increased references to a certain concept in speeches at recurring forums or changing prioritisation of tasks compared to the past can be useful markers of shifting objectives. It doesn't tell the whole story, but it is an important data point. Finally, everything has a purpose, and timing matters. This is perhaps one of the most significant analytical tools that I draw from Rudd's work. Editorial decisions taken by the Chinese media and theory ecosystem are not ad hoc, driven by market demands or conventional metrics of newsworthiness of a development. These are purposeful choices to communicate primarily to a domestic and, more narrowly, a party audience. It is, therefore, important to understand the timing and context within which a certain speech delivered or made public through Qiushi months or even years after it was delivered. Understanding the thought-process behind such communication and how it intervenes in or shapes ongoing debate on an issue is essential. One must also view this from the perspective of different stakeholders, i.e., officials, bureaucracies, cadres and private sector actors.

Analysis of India-China SRs Meeting	Hello everyone, Xi Jinping's in Macao marking the 25th anniversary of the region's return to China. Today's paper is essentially full of the coverage of that trip. If you are interested, Xi's speech at the dinner last night is available via Xinhua English. Alas, I am unable to do the full newsletter owing to personal commitments. And I am going to take a break till the end of the year, unless something really significant develops. For the moment, I am leaving you with a brief discussion I had last night with StratNews Global on the meeting between the Indian and Chinese special representatives on the boundary issue in Beijing. Hope this is useful for those watching India-China ties. Wish you all a very happy holiday season! Manoj Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

New Survey on India-China Relations - Xi Visits Sanya - Wang Yi on China's Global Outlook in 2025 - Li Qiang on Plan to Ease Law-enforcement Challenge...	Hi folks, In today's People's Daily, there is a brief report confirming that India and China will be holding a meeting of the Special Representative on the India-China boundary question in Beijing today. This is a key outcome from the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October. So I guess this is an opportune moment to share that last night, the Takshashila Institution released a new public opinion survey report on India-China ties. And not surprisingly, the report found that over half of Indians believe that the boundary issue is the biggest stressor between India and China. The report also has some rather counter-intuitive findings on issues related to trade, investment and skilled talent. But let me leave you with this bit, which I thought was rather interesting and perhaps said more about Indians' positive assessment of the system of multi-party democracy Cheers, Manoj Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 18, 2024. Page 1: The main report on the page is on Xi Jinping's visit to Sanya, where he heard work reports of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. Xi -affirmed the achievements made in Hainan's various work, and put forward clear requirements for the next step of work.- In his speech, Xi first called for efforts -to build a modern industrial system- with local characteristics and strengths. -Promote the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and promote the extension of industrial chains of leading industries such as tourism, modern services, high-tech, and tropical high-efficiency agriculture and to promote their optimization and upgrading. Actively align with the national strategic scientific and technological forces, strengthen international scientific and technological cooperation, build a more open talent attraction mechanism, create a multi-level scientific and technological innovation system, increase efforts to tackle core technologies, strengthen the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. Adhere to prioritising the environment and green development, strengthen the rectification of prominent environmental problems, and safeguard lush mountains, clear waters, and blue seas and skies.

Accelerate the implementation of the core policies of the Hainan Free Trade Port, carefully make all preparations, and ensure the smooth and orderly operation of customs clearance. ，。，。、、、、，，，、、。，--。，、。，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out the need to continuously enhance the civility of residents and the level of social civilization. Persistently use the Party's innovative theories to unite minds and forge souls, cultivate and promote socialist core values, extensively carry out mass activities for spiritual civilization building, and strive to achieve simultaneous improvements in material and spiritual civilization. Effectively protect, utilize, and inherit historical culture, revolutionary culture, marine culture, and folk culture resources, enhance cultural innovation and creativity, and develop and expand the cultural industry. Improve the public cultural service system in urban and rural areas, enrich the spiritual and cultural lives of urban and rural residents, and continue to promote the transformation of outdated customs and practices.- ，。，，，。、、、，，。，，. -Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to comprehensively improve the level of people's livelihood security and social governance. Strengthen the basic, universal and bottom-line/safety-net (、、) livelihood construction, improve the urban and rural public service system and social security system, and solve the urgent problems of the people. Enhance support for employment and entrepreneurship among key groups, and maintain overall employment stability.

Strengthen the urban and rural community governance system, normalize efforts to combat organized crime and eliminate evildoers, and punish all illegal activities according to law.- ，。、、，，。，。，。，。，，，。，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the Party's political building should guide all Party building work and promote the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party to a deeper level. Consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education campaign, promote the normalization and long-term effectiveness of Party discipline learning and education, continue to implement the spirit of the Central Committee's eight-point regulation to promote the transformation of work conduct, encourage the majority of cadres to continue to carry forward the special zone spirit of daring to explore, daring to be pioneers, and working hard with their heads down, and to establish and practice a correct view of political achievements. Unremittingly grasp the anti-corruption struggle and strive to eradicate the soil and conditions for the breeding of corruption. Strengthen the restraint and supervision of exercise of power, and educate and guide cadres to enhance their ability to resist and prevent corruption.- ，，。，，，、、，。，。，. He ended by talking about the need to implement the priorities from the CEWC and ensure social stability, food and energy supplies, etc, ahead of the New Year and Spring Festival. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the State Council study session, which discussed the need to strengthen enforcement procedures, improve methods and enhance supervision to boost the quality and effectiveness of administrative law enforcement. Professor Hu Jianmiao of the Central Party School was the guest speaker at the session. Li Qiang then spoke. He said -that administrative law enforcement is an important means for the government to perform its duties according to law and manage economic and social affairs, and promoting strict, standardised, impartial, and civilised law enforcement is a key aspect of building a law-based government. Currently, there are still instances of abuse of administrative discretion and unjust law enforcement in certain areas and localities. Efforts must begin with issues strongly raised by the public and businesses, further improving the benchmark system for administrative discretion and standardising the operation of power. To address the issue of incomplete benchmark coverage, it is necessary to promptly improve benchmarks for discretion in areas such as licensing, collection, enforcement, and inspection. To resolve the problem of unreasonable discretion ranges, the severity of violations by business entities and their capacity to bear penalties should be considered, and the principle of ‘proportionality of offence and punishment' should be followed to determine penalty limits. Regarding the issue of inconsistent local standards, coordination and guidance should be strengthened, and timely adjustments should be promoted.- ，、，。、。，，。，、、、。，，--。，，. -Li Qiang pointed out that next year will launch a special action to standardise law enforcement involving enterprises, continuously optimise the business environment, promote stable expectations and strengthen confidence. It is necessary to standardise the law enforcement procedures, fully implement the publicity of administrative law enforcement, the record of the whole process of law enforcement, and the legal review system of major law enforcement decisions, unblock the channels of appeal, and protect the appeal rights of those being supervised according to law. In improving enforcement methods, flexible measures can be applied to minor offences that involve no intent and pose limited social harm. Strengthen law enforcement supervision, pay attention to abnormal growth in fines and confiscations, a large number of off-site law enforcement (this is largely about issues of jurisdiction), and large-scale maximum penalties, review and verify relevant law enforcement behaviours, and correct any problems in a timely manner. Strengthen the use of information technology to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement supervision.- ，，，。，、、，，。，、、，。，、、，，。，. Li ended with the need to -safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the people and enterprises, and maintain a fair and competitive market order.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a brief report on Wang Yi's speech on China's diplomacy in 2024. The full English version of the speech is available on the Ministry's website. Let me highlight key excerpts. Wang began by talking about Xi Jinping's head of state diplomacy. He then said: -Over the past year, new breakthroughs have been made in building a community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village…In the course of 2024, China and Brazil have announced joint efforts to build a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as two emerging countries; China and Serbia have launched efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the first of its kind in China's relations with European countries. Globally, a growing number of countries have pitched in to build a community with a shared future. What's worth mentioning in particular is that Chinese and African leaders have agreed to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, giving expression to the shared desire of the 2.8 billion Chinese and Africans to pursue common development in greater solidarity. China has also made efforts to build communities with a shared future with particular regions, including with Central Asia, ASEAN, countries in the Lancang-Mekong river basin, Arab states, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. These efforts are opening up new vistas of harmonious coexistence between different civilizations…With the joint efforts of China and other countries, the notion of humanity sharing a common future has been written into multiple resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (U.N.) and multilateral documents, and the goal of building a community with a shared future has been established in various fields such as cybersecurity, climate change, and health. We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N., supported the U.N. in holding theSummit for the Future, and endeavored to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We have accelerated the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives. To date, 82 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, 119 countries and international organizations have given support to the Global Security Initiative, and the 78th U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China to establish an International Day of Dialogue among Civilizations. Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been established as the noble goal for practicing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.- -We have actively worked for the restoration of world peace and endeavored to save human lives. On the Ukraine crisis, we have always maintained an objective and impartial position, and actively pushed for peace talks. Over the past year, our special envoy conducted three rounds of shuttle diplomacy. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We also brought other Global South countries together to launch the group of ‘friends for peace' to gather consensus for finding a path to peace. The Gaza conflict has taken too many civilian lives. The immediate priority is a comprehensive ceasefire, the key is to ensure humanitarian assistance, and the fundamental way out is to realize the two-state solution. Over the past year, we have pushed for the adoption of the first resolution by the Security Council on a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitated the reconciliation dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration by various Palestinian factions, and delivered multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. We will continue to make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. We have mediated peace in northern Myanmar and facilitated multiple rounds of peace talks among conflicting parties. We have supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and realizing peace and reconstruction. We have also made consistent efforts to promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. Facing the dramatic change in Syria, China will continue to stand with the Syrian people and uphold the ‘Syrian-led and Syrian-owned' principle. China opposes the attempt of terrorist forces to exploit the situation to create chaos, and will help Syria maintain its sovereignty and restore stability.- He then talked about how Chinese modernisation has created opportunities for the world. Under this, he said that 155 countries had joined BRI. The next bit was on the Global South. Wang said: -The collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. China promoted new proposals and new developments of mechanisms and strengthened the force for unity and progress in the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations, so as to leave their mark on the progress of humanity. Building on its historic expansion last year and setting off this year from the new starting point of greater BRICS cooperation, BRICS is bringing more partners into its big family to make the platform a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations. Considering the reasonable concerns of developing countries, China promoted the adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building, proposed the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, worked with fellow Global South nations to jointly launch an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science with fellow Global South nations, and pushed for the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance at COP29. China called on developed countries to take concrete actions to earnestly fulfill their due responsibilities, provide sufficient financial support to developing countries, and uphold global climate justice. China has stayed committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and helped fellow developing countries move faster in rejuvenation. At FOCAC, China and Africa agreed on the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan for stronger cooperation between the two sides in the next three years, and agreed on ten partnership actions for modernization covering 10 key areas such as trade and investment, industrial chain cooperation and green development in an all-dimensional boost to Africa's development. China and Arab states saw significant early harvests from the ‘eight major cooperation initiatives' and went on to develop ‘five cooperation frameworks' in five dimensions: innovation, finance, energy, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchanges. China deepened the synergy of development strategies with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and continued to upgrade its cooperation with Pacific island countries.- Then Wang talked about specific relations. He cast this in terms of -all-round diplomacy, which has built up the trend toward a new type of international relations-. One of the goals for this is to build a -amicable and harmonious home in Asia-. He said that China-Russia ties had -grown more mature and stable, demonstrated in a clearer way its independence and resilience, and set an example of friendly exchanges between major countries and neighbors.- He added: -China-Russia relations are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party, and are not subject to interference or coercion from any external factor. Amid shifting global dynamics, China and Russia will maintain a high degree of strategic mutual trust, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard global strategic stability.- On Europe, he said: -Europe holds an important position in China's diplomatic agenda. A healthier and more stable China-Europe relationship serves the fundamental interests of both sides and the common aspiration of the world.- During engagements with European leaders, Xi -encouraged the European side to take a long-term and strategic perspective, see China as a partner and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to the benefit of both sides and the world at large. China and Europe are two great civilizations of the world and two major forces of the times. China stands ready to work with the European side to handle differences and disputes properly, seek win-win solutions, and jointly safeguard free trade and multilateralism.- This is the paragraph on India and Japan, which are clubbed together. -China is having more trust and less suspicion with major countries in this region. When meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping put forth important propositions on improving China-India relations, which received positive response from Prime Minister Modi. The two sides agreed to step up strategic communication, safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas, and strive to bring the bilateral relationship back to the track of stable development at an early date. China and Japan reaffirmed the commitment to promoting the China-Japan strategic relationship of mutual benefit in an all-round way, and to building a constructive and stable relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. In line with Japan's commitment on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water, China has recently started independent sampling and monitoring and will work with the international community to urge the Japanese side to earnestly fulfill its international obligations and responsibilities.- Share Tracking People's Daily Then there are two paragraphs dealing with the US. -There is a lot of interest in China-U.S. relations. How China and the United States get along concerns the well-being of the two peoples and also the future of the world. This year, we have followed the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, focused on implementing the San Francisco Vision, and worked to maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations. China and the United States held two rounds of strategic communication and five meetings of the Financial Working Group and the Economic Working Group respectively. The two sides advanced practical cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, law enforcement and climate change,extended the science and technology agreement, and co-signed each other's resolution on artificial intelligence at the U.N. General Assembly. Nearly 15,000 young Americans visited China through the initiative of ‘50,000 in five years', sowing the seeds of friendship between the two countries. Such progress has been widely welcomed by Chinese and Americans across the sectors as well as the international community at large. This fully shows that as long as China and the United States cooperate with each other, they can accomplish many great things together. In the meantime, China firmly safeguards its sovereignty, security and development interests, and firmly opposes the illegal and unreasonable suppression by the U.S. side. In particular, with regard to the U.S.' gross interference in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan, China has to make a firm and robust response to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests and safeguard the basic norms governing international relations. Last month, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden and sent a congratulatory message to President-Elect Trump, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-U.S. relationship at this critical juncture. President Xi Jinping summed up seven pieces of experience and inspiration based on a thorough account of bilateral exchanges in recent years, and drew four clear red lines that must not be challenged, namely, the Taiwan question, China's path and system, democracy and human rights, and China's development right. He stressed that China's goal of a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged; its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged; its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged; and its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remains unchanged. This is not only the authoritative interpretation of China's U.S. policy, but also our earnest expectation on future China-U.S. relationship. The fact that China has maintained its U.S. policy stable and consistent demonstrates its firm strategic resolve and broad-mindedness as a major country. We will engage in dialogue, manage differences, enhance mutual trust, remove misunderstandings and expand cooperation with the U.S. side, and work with the U.S. to explore the right way for our two major countries to get along with each other on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world.- Subscribe now Wang then made three points about China's diplomacy: First, China's diplomacy upholds Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy -as the fundamental guideline- and that -the Party's leadership is the most defining feature of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and our greatest political strength to overcome all risks and challenges.- Second, China's diplomacy is -people's diplomacy.- Third, -China's diplomacy is always about standing up for responsibilities-, i.e., -We have resolutely countered the attempt of using Taiwan to contain China and the myth of seeking U.S. support for ‘Taiwan independence', firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and effectively strengthened the international community's commitment to the one-China principle. We have taken justified and firm measures to safeguard China's rights against certain countries' provocations in the South China Sea, and worked with ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have refuted false narratives hyping up the so-called ‘human rights issues', set the record straight, and gained overwhelming support from over 100 countries for China's just position. More countries have come to realize that playing double standards will only disgrace oneself and interfering in others' internal affairs is ultimately unpopular.- Leave a comment He then made five points about China's diplomacy for 2025. Before doing so, this is how he assessed China's global standing. -China today is already a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to lead new endeavors, and greater moral appeal.- First, China will be a firm force for peace in a world of turbulence and conflicts. We hope the incoming U.S. administration will make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions, overcome obstacles, and achieve the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. We will deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and all-round practical cooperation with Russia, and work for steady progress in China-EU relations toward independence, mutual success and benefit to the world. Stability in China will provide a strong underpinning for global strategic stability, and certainty in China will help cushion uncertainties in other parts of the world. We will carry forward the Chinese way of settling hotspot issues and continue our constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and other hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar. Second, China will be a firm force for unity in the face of division and confrontation. We support the holding of the second China-Central Asia Summit, and will work for the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Protocol. We have properly handled differences and are working with India to find the right and bright path for big, neighboring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side. We will partner with Africa in implementing the ten partnership actions for modernization, expedite the building of ‘five cooperation frameworks' with Arab states, and use the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum as an opportunity to open a new chapter of cooperation. We will continue to pool the collective strength of the Global South through unity. Third, China will be a firm force for openness in the face of decoupling and severing supply chains. We will deliver on the eight major steps of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, advance both the major flagship projects and the ‘small and beautiful' livelihood programs, and create new space for win-win cooperation of higher quality, enhanced resilience and greater sustainability. We are determined to pursue higher-standard opening up, accelerate the development of the FTAAP, and safeguard the global free trade system as well as the stable and unimpeded functioning of the industrial and supply chains. We advocate a world economy that is cooperative, stable, open, innovative and eco-friendly, and we are ready to join hands with all countries on the path toward modernization. Fourth, China will be a firm force for justice in the face of the counter currents of unilateralism and bullying. We will hold solemn commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war, promote a correct view of history, uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We will effectively fulfill the role as the SCO rotating chair, support Brazil in hosting the BRICS summit and the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), support South Africa in hosting the G20 summit, and work for a more just and equitable international order. Fifth, China will be a firm force for inclusiveness in the face of ideological differences. We will promote the common values of humanity, deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries, join forces for the progress of human civilization, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship among people of different countries. We will step up experience-sharing on governance and development, tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and cement China's friendship with countries around the globe. We will expand two-way exchanges between the Chinese people and people elsewhere, and do our best to stage a successful Asian Winter Games to showcase a diverse China through the charm of ice and snow.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) foreign ministers' meeting. Xinhua reports: -Emphasizing that ensuring security, promoting development, pursuing cooperation and seeking win-win results are the urgent aspirations of the overwhelming majority of countries, Wang called on CICA to play a unique role in this regard, build an Asian community with a shared future and expand new space for win-win development. Wang called on CICA member countries to adhere to peaceful coexistence and seek common security; jointly advance Belt and Road cooperation to promote prosperity and development; respect diverse civilizations and promote exchanges and mutual learning; practice multilateralism and build a beautiful home together. Noting that Chinese modernization is a modernization that follows the path of peaceful development and brings more opportunities to Asian countries, Wang said that China stands ready to work with CICA member states to forge a new form of Asian civilization featuring win-win development through solidarity and coordination.- Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report with data from China's National Energy Administration.

Xi's Lessons from Qiao Shi's Life - State Council Plans CEWC Agenda Implementation - Change in Macroeconomic Policy Mainly Due to External Environment...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, December 17, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is on the event held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of late top legislator Qiao Shi. Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the event. Xi's full speech is available on Page 2. In the first part of the speech, Xi outlines Qiao's accomplishments and the positions he held. Some key points in this: Xi said that Qiao was -an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a time-tested and loyal communist fighter, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary and politician, and an outstanding leader of the Party and the country-. ，，、，... -During the ‘Cultural Revolution', Comrade Qiao Shi suffered severe persecution. He adhered to the Party's principles, sought truth from facts, and carried out a tenacious struggle. --，。，，. Xi said that during his tenure as the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Qiao -attached great importance to maintaining national security and unity, resolutely opposed ethnic separatist activities, and made important contributions to maintaining national political stability and social order.- ，，、. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 13th Central Committee, Secretary of the Central Secretariat, and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Comrade Qiao Shi conscientiously implemented the principle of strict Party governance, emphasised strengthening the discipline awareness of the whole Party, strengthening Party conduct and clean governance, and fully utilising the important role of discipline inspection in promoting reform, opening up, and economic development. He attached great importance to the strict enforcement of the Party's political discipline and severely investigated and dealt with serious violations of the Party's political discipline. He resolutely opposed corruption, made great efforts to correct unhealthy tendencies within the Party, promoted the formulation and improvement of laws and regulations on clean government construction, led the formulation of a series of Party discipline regulations and provisions, and promoted and guided the establishment of the Ministry of Supervision. While serving as the president of the Central Party School, he vigorously deepened the reform of the party school and promoted the work of the party school into a new period of development. 、、，，，，。，。，，，，。，，. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 14th Central Committee and Chairman of the NPCSC, Comrade Qiao Shi devoted significant effort to upholding and improving the people's congress system. He emphasised combining the strengthening of democracy with the strengthening of the rule of law, advancing the orderly development of democratic political construction along the direction and path of socialism with Chinese characteristics…He attached great importance to the implementation of the Constitution and focused on strengthening supervision over the implementation of the Constitution and laws. He also attached great importance to legislative work, proposing that the NPC ‘make accelerating economic legislation its primary task', which promoted the initial establishment of the socialist market economy legal framework and laid a solid foundation for forming the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He emphasised the lawful exercise of supervisory powers, advancing the standardisation and institutionalisation of supervision work. After retiring from his leadership positions, he firmly supported the leadership of the Party Central Committee and remained committed to the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, with particular attention to democratic and legal development, Party conduct and clean governance, and the fight against corruption. 、，。，。，。，。，--，，。，。，，，、. In the next bit, Xi talks about what must be learned from Qiao's life. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his noble character of adhering to beliefs and dedicating himself to ideals. Comrade Qiao Shi was unwavering in his belief in the lofty ideal of communism and infinitely loyal to the Party and the people. In 1991, in response to the setbacks and low ebb in international communism at the time, he clearly pointed out that ‘the communist ideal is our spiritual pillar and the driving force for the advancement of our cause. Holding firm to communist beliefs is the most basic requirement for Communist Party members.' ‘The development of human society from lower to higher stages will ultimately lead to a communist society; this is the inevitable course of historical development'. He emphasized: ‘to persist in the cause of socialism on the land of China and continuously achieve new victories is of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to all mankind'. Ideals and beliefs are the foundation for the Party's establishment and development, as well as the anchor for Party members and officials. All Party members must regard strengthening their ideals and beliefs as a lifelong task, constantly cultivating, refining, understanding, and progressing in upholding the lofty communist ideal and the shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, standing firm like a mountain in both favorable and adverse circumstances, and able to withstand the test of great waves.- ，、。，。1991，、，，-，。-，-，-。：-，，，。-，。，、，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his strong Party spirit of upholding the Party's work conduct and discipline. Comrade Qiao Shi always unwaveringly adhered to Party leadership, gave high importance to the issues of work conduct and Party building, and continuously strengthened Party discipline construction. He clearly stated that ‘anyone who does not execute or covertly resists the Party Central Committee's decisions, who damages the Party's centralization and unity, who violates Party discipline - this is absolutely unacceptable.' He deeply despised corruption and unhealthy practices. During his time leading the CCDI, he intensified efforts to investigate and handle cases, focusing on bureaucratism, formalism, abuse of power for personal gain, and other issues that seriously affected relations between the Party and the masses, achieving significant results. Party spirit, Party conduct, and Party discipline are an organic whole, wherein the Party spirit is the root, Party conduct is the manifestation, and Party discipline is the guarantee. We must always adhere to the Party's comprehensive leadership and the Party Central Committee's centralized and unified leadership, unwaveringly comprehensively enforce strict Party governance, unswervingly enforce strict Party governance, advance the building of Party integrity and the anti-corruption struggle, and maintain the Party's advanced nature and purity, ensuring that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- ，、。，，。：-，，。。-，，，、，。、、，，，。，，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his precious quality of maintaining his original aspiration and diligently serving the people. Comrade Qiao Shi always placed the Party's cause and people's interests first, fulfilled his duties, and devoted himself entirely to public service. He held profound feelings for the people, clearly pointing out that ‘people from all walks of life across the country, the vast majority of ordinary people, regardless of gender or age, are the ones we serve'. While leading the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, he emphatically stressed that we should ‘take protecting the people, serving the people, being the people's servants as the fundamental starting point and the important standard for measuring the work of every political and legal cadre', and ‘only by constantly thinking about what the masses think about, being concerned about what the masses are concerned about, can we truly work wholeheartedly and make our team a team truly loved by the people'. The country is the people, and the people are the country. We must always adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, uphold the people-centered development philosophy, earnestly safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, strive to bring benefits to the people, and let the fruits of modernization benefit all people more fully and fairly.- ，、。，，。，：-，，，。-，，-，，，，-，-，，，-。，。，，、，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his political commitment of actively pursuing reform and daring to act. Comrade Qiao Shi resolutely supported and implemented the line, principles, and policies advanced since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, unwaveringly advancing reform and opening up. In the early period of reform and opening up, he clearly pointed out that ‘we must be determined to run the special economic zones well; it simply has to be done well, and running the special economic zones well will not be a mistake'. Regarding political and legal work in the new period, he emphasized that ‘everything conducive to reform and opening up and conducive to the development of productive forces must be protected and supported by law; everything detrimental to reform and opening up, detrimental to the development of productive forces, must be opposed and restricted by law; everything undermining reform and opening up, democracy and rule of law, and the development of productive forces must be struck down and punished by law.' In 1992, he emphasized the need to deeply study and implement the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour from the height of it being ‘another great liberation of thought'. Reform and opening up is the important magic weapon for the Party and people's cause in order to make great strides to catch up with the times. We must unwaveringly hold high the banner of reform and opening up, adhere to maintaining integrity while innovating, take the reform of the economic system as the guide, promoting social fairness and justice and improving people's well-being as the starting point and foothold, closely focus on Chinese-style modernization to further comprehensively deepen reform and promote high-level opening up, and strive to compose a new chapter of reform and opening up.- ，、。，。，：-，，。-，：-、，；、，；、、，。-1992，--。。，，，、，、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his persistent pursuit of respecting the rule of law and enforcing the rule of law. Comrade Qiao Shi was a faithful practitioner of democratic legal system construction. He clearly pointed out that ‘we must recognize that the legal system is absolutely not something optional or dispensable. Strengthening material civilization and spiritual civilization construction must rely on legal system guarantees; ensuring the economy does not distort and the country remains stable for a long time must also rely on legal system guarantees, thereby overcoming tendencies to slight or despise the legal system, and improving the consciousness of establishing and maintaining the legal system.' Under his leadership and effort, the 8th NPC and its Standing Committee issued a batch of important economic laws, creating a good legal environment for establishing and developing the socialist market economy. The rule of law is an important guarantee for Chinese-style modernization. We must always adhere to the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the joint promotion of ruling the country according to the law (reference to an overarching principle), governing (Party and state's processes and exercise of power within the boundaries of the legal framework) according to the law, and administering (rules for the actions of departments, ministries, officials, etc.) according to the law (、、), adhere to simultaneously building a law-based country, law-based government, and law-based society, comprehensively promote scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and adherence to the law by all people, and comprehensively build a socialist modern country on the track of the rule of law. ，、。。：-、。，；，，，、，、。-，，。。，、、，、、，、、、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his work style of seeking truth from facts and being pragmatic. No matter which position he worked in, Comrade Qiao Shi always attached importance to integrating theory with practice and creatively used Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods to analyse problems. During his investigation of the Dabie Mountain area, he said that ‘when researching economic development in mountain areas, borrowing experiences from other places is necessary, but one must definitely be grounded in local conditions, adapt to local circumstances, and absolutely must not blindly compare with big cities or coastal regions.' He emphasised that ‘we must be truly responsible to the people, always adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, do not engage in empty talk, do not practice formalism, do not engage superficial actions/going through the motions, and practically fulfill responsibilities on the ground'. Seeking truth from facts is the fundamental requirement of our Party for understanding and transforming the world. We must always adhere to connecting theory with reality, persist in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, keeping pace with the times, being practical and realistic, resolutely oppose formalism and bureaucratism, concentrate our hearts and strength to promote development, and solidly advance the construction of Chinese-style modernisation.- ，、。，，。：-，，，，、。-：-，，，，，。-。，、、、，、，，。 If you are interested in others' speeches, they are available on Page 6. Next, there's a report (English report) on the State Council's Executive Meeting. This is the first meeting after the CEWC. The report says that the meeting was held -to study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference and make arrangements for the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference.- 1216，，. -The meeting emphasized the need to align thoughts and actions with the Party Central Committee's scientific assessment of the economic situation and its decisions and arrangements for next year's economic work, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility, urgency and initiative for implementation. All departments of the State Council must fully align themselves with the various arrangements determined by the Party Central Committee, be proactive, formulate implementation plans, and produce specific task lists, timelines, and roadmaps to ensure that all work progresses in an orderly manner. Focus on grasping and implementing, if something can be done early then do it early, rather early than late, unite and work together, take positive action, with solid and effective work contribute more to the overall situation.- ，，、。，，，，、、，。，、，、，。 -The meeting made arrangements for optimising and improving the management mechanism of local government special bonds, pointing out that it is necessary to implement ‘negative list' management of local government special bonds in the investment field, permitting special bonds to fund land reserves, support the acquisition of existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing, and expanding the scope of special bonds that can be used as project capital. Efforts should focus on improving the project review and management mechanism, moderately increasing the autonomy and flexibility of local governments, and enhancing the efficiency of bond issuance. It is necessary to strengthen the full process management of special bonds, and improve the fund supervision mechanism and repayment mechanism. It is necessary to do a good job in the issuance and use of special bonds next year, doing so as soon as possible, and provide strong support for promoting a sustained economic recovery.- ，--，、，。，，。，。，，. -The meeting studied policy measures to promote the high-quality development of government investment funds, pointing out that it is necessary to build a scientific and efficient management system, highlight government guidance and policy positioning, and operate government investment funds in a market-oriented, law-based and professional manner in order to better serve the overall national development. It is necessary to develop and expand long-term capital and patient capital, improve the differentiated management mechanism of different types of funds, and prevent the crowding-out effect on social capital. It is necessary to improve the responsibility mechanism with consistent rights and responsibilities and compatible incentives and constraints, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure.- ，，，、、，。、，，。、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily In addition, the meeting heard a report on a three-year campaign to improve work safety, emphasising the importance of investigating major risks and hidden dangers thoroughly. It called for strengthened measures at the turn of the year to protect the safety of people and their property. the meeting also discussed the revitalisation of the football industry, seeing it as key in transforming China into a strong sports nation. The meeting urged intensified efforts to implement measures aimed at advancing work on football development. the meeting also deliberated and approved the adoption of a draft regulation on the management of China's public security video image information system. Subscribe now Third, there's a commentary drawing from the CEWC meeting. It says that the CEWC made a systematic deployment and put forward the overall requirements and policy orientation for economic work next year. -Currently, the most important things are: first, carefully study and comprehend, accurately understand the Party Central Committee's decision-making intentions; second, implement without deviation, and thoroughly integrate all requirements into doing well next year's economic work.- ，，，，. It adds that: -Economic and social development goals have strong guiding significance. The conference proposed the main expected objectives for next year's economic and social development, pointing out the need to maintain stable economic growth, maintain overall stability in employment and prices, maintain basic balance in international payments, and promote synchronized growth of resident income and economic growth. These were proposed based on in-depth research, accurate judgment, and scientific analysis, considering both the present and the long-term, releasing a strong signal of promoting continuous economic improvement, and powerfully boosting confidence and motivation. Economic growth is a fundamental and highly correlated indicator. Whether stabilizing employment, preventing risks, benefiting people's livelihood, strengthening confidence, or effectively responding to external environmental changes and challenges, resolving various contradictions in development requires maintaining a certain economic growth rate. Placing stability in growth, employment, and prices in a prominent position, while simultaneously proposing ‘seeking progress in stability, promoting stability through progress, maintaining integrity while innovating, establishing before breaking, systematic integration and collaborative coordination' provides a clear direction and scientific methodology for doing next year's economic work well.- 。，，、，，。、、，、，，。，、、、，，，。、、，-、，、，、-，，。 Scientific and effective macroeconomic regulation is an important guarantee for the steady and healthy development of the economy. The meeting emphasized that ‘more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies should be implemented next year'. It is clear that a more proactive fiscal policy will be implemented, the fiscal deficit ratio will be increased, the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds will be increased, and the issuance and use of local government special bonds will be increased. The tone of monetary policy has been adjusted from ‘prudent' to ‘moderately loose', which is the first time in 14 years. The tone of macroeconomic regulation has changed significantly, mainly due to the deepening of the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment. China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges. To do a good job in economic work next year, we must face up to the difficulties and take positive actions, increase the intensity of counter-cyclical regulation, further enrich and improve the policy toolbox, and provide strong policy support for promoting the continued improvement of the economy.- 。--。，、、。----，。，，，、，，，.

Xi on Self-Revolution - What the Party is Thinking about When Coordinating the Relationship between Demand & Supply	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 16, 2024. Just about the entire paper today is dedicated to featuring announcements of candidates for national moral models. Consequently, there are only two pieces that are worth noting in today's edition. First, there is a report on Qiushi publishing an article drawn from Xi Jinping's speech at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI on January 8, 2024. This was the meeting that framed Xi Jinping's thoughts on Self-Revolution. In the Qiushi piece, Xi begins by framing the self-revolution of the Party as the second answer for the Party to successfully break free from the historical cycle of rise and fall, and ensure that it never degenerates, changes color or flavor. The first answer, of course, was Mao's framing that -let the people supervise the government-, i.e., democracy. Xi said: -The ideals pursued by our Party are lofty and sacred, and the missions it shoulders are arduous and demanding. Only by examining ourselves against the requirements of the times, remaining vigilant with a strong sense of crisis awareness, and forging ourselves with the spirit of self-revolution can we continuously enhance our leadership capacity and governance level, ensuring that the Party never degenerates, never changes colour, never loses its flavour, and always remains the strong leadership core of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, it must be recognised that, with changes in the situation and tasks, shifts in the external environment, and transformations within the Party's membership, various contradictions and problems will inevitably arise within the Party. It is essential to have the courage to turn the blade inward, promptly eliminate various negative influences, and ensure that the party always remains full of vigorous life and exuberant vitality. This is the reason why we must advance the Party's self-revolution.- ，，，，，，、、，。，、，，，，。. Xi added: -The courage to carry out self-revolution is the most distinctive character and greatest strength of our Party. The nature, purpose, original intention and mission of the Party determine that our Party always represents the fundamental interests of the broad masses. By not seeking private interests, we gain the thorough spirit of self-revolution, enabling us to seek the root and greater good, adhere to truth and correct mistakes, and dare to examine ourselves and constantly reflect on our shortcomings. By not shying away from the truth or glossing over mistakes, and by promptly discovering and solving our own problems, we can effectively fight back against the ‘entrapment/hunting' and corruption from all interest groups, power cliques, and privileged classes. This is the secret behind our Party's ability to maintain its advanced nature and purity and the source of its confidence to carry out self-revolution. To deeply advance the Party's self-revolution, it is necessary to address the following issues in practice.- 。、。，、，、，、；、，，、、--。、，.，. Share Tracking People's Daily Then Xi highlights the 9 issues that needed to be grasped () in order to promote self-revolution. These are: Taking the upholding the centralised and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee as the fundamental guarantee Taking leading the great social revolution as the fundamental purpose. Under this, he said: Plan the self-revolution of the Party in light of the new requirements of the practice of the great social revolution, use the new achievements of great social revolutionary development to examine the actual effectiveness of the Party's self-revolution, and strive to achieve: leading the great social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, and promoting the Party's self-revolution through the great social revolution. At present, we should plan and promote the self-revolution of the Party closely around the central tasks of the Party, so that the self-revolution of the Party can better serve the central tasks of the Party. ，。，，、。，，. Taking the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the fundamental guideline that must be adhered to Taking breaking free from the historical cycle of rise and fall as the strategic goal. Under this, he said: -Advancing the Party's self-revolution is a magic weapon for breaking free from the historical cycle of dynastic rise and fall. To focus on this strategic goal, we must maintain a high level of political vigilance, promptly eliminate the viruses eroding the Party's healthy body, and promptly remove various hidden dangers that undermine the Party's governing foundation, thereby ensuring the Party's continued health and continuously consolidating its long-term governing position.- ，。。，，，，，. Taking solving the unique problems of a big Party as the main direction. Under this, Xi tells us that the unique problems of a big Party are encapsulated in the -six how to always .- Xi had articulated this in the January 2023 CCDI plenary session. Xi says: Solving these difficulties is definitely not the work of a single day or a moment. In advancing the Party's self-revolution, we must adhere to the problem-oriented approach, maintain strategic determination, treat both the symptoms and root causes, adopt comprehensive measures, coordinate efforts, persist unyieldingly, work persistently and long-term, transform small victories into great victories, and demonstrate the advantages of a big party through continuously resolving its unique challenges. ，。--，。，，、、、、，，. Taking establishing a sound system for comprehensive and strict Party governance as an effective approach to achieve objectives. Under this, Xi writes: -It is necessary to closely follow the general requirements of Party building in the new era, ensuring comprehensive coverage in content, universal coverage of targets, a full chain of responsibilities, and thorough integration of systems. Persist in governing the Party through systems and rules, continuously improve the Party's self-revolution system and normative framework, and further form a positive cycle of relying on the Party's own strength to discover problems, correct deviations, drive innovation, and achieve an overall enhancement of governing capabilities.- ，。，、、、，、，，、、、. Taking the forging of a strong organisation and building an excellent team as a key emphasis/focal point. Under this, Xi writes: Deeply implement the Party's organisational line in the new era, improve the organisational system that is connected from top to bottom and has strong execution, enhance the political and organisational functions of Party organizations, focus on resolving issues such as weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffective Party management, and promote comprehensive improvement and comprehensive strengthening of Party organizations at all levels. Adhere to implementing the new era's standards for good cadres, strictly control the political gate, capability gate, and integrity gate, ensuring that the broad masses of Party members and cadres are loyal, clean and responsible. ，、。，、，，、、，、。，、、，. Taking rectifying discipline, upholding integrity, and combating corruption as an important starting point. Taking combining self-supervision with people's supervision as a powerful driving force. Under this, Xi said: -We must consciously accept supervision by the people, and effectively integrate intra-Party supervision with supervision by state organs, democratic supervision, judicial supervision, mass supervision, and public opinion supervision, so as to achieve a virtuous interaction and mutual gain between self-discipline and external discipline.- ，、、、、，、.

How to always unify thoughts, will and actions? How to always ensure that we maintain a strong governing ability and leadership level? How to always maintain the entrepreneurial spirit? How to always identify and solve problems in a timely manner? How to always maintain a clean and upright political ecology? Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there is a commentary drawing from the conclusions of the CEWC. The article begins by talking about the need to coordinate the five important relationships that were highlighted in the CEWC readout. These are: It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalising existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving quality and expanding total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernisation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The commentary then takes the case of the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It says: China has the world's largest and most comprehensive manufacturing system. Among 500 major industrial products, over 220 rank first globally in production output. This robust supply capability not only supports steady growth in foreign trade, with China's share of global goods exports ranking first for 15 consecutive years, but also continuously generates effective demand through high-quality supply, providing a constant driving force for economic growth. 、，500，220。，，15，，. -Supply creates demand. Focusing on improving the quality and efficiency of the supply system can create and stimulate new demand. Taking the NEV industry as an example, it took 6 years from annual production of over 10,000 vehicles to annual production of over 1 million vehicles for the first time. It also took only 6 years for China's NEV industry to achieve a leap from annual production of 1 million vehicles to 10 million vehicles. Since July, retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles have begun to exceed fuel vehicles. The reason why NEVs have gained market favor and achieved overtaking opportunities by both continuously improving quality through technological innovation and meeting people's expectations for a high-quality lifestyle.- 。，。，，，6。6，。7，。、，，. -The core of deepening supply-side structural reform is to advance industrial innovation with scientific and technological innovation. This Central Economic Work Conference made important arrangements around leading the development of new quality productive forces through scientific and technological innovation, and proposed to carry out large-scale application and demonstration actions of new technologies, new products and new scenarios. Looking to the future, creating new consumer demand through high-quality supply and promoting the upgrading of consumption quality will surely achieve a virtuous cycle and coordinated efforts.- ，。，。，、，、. Demand drives supply. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has coordinated the expansion of domestic demand and the deepening of supply-side structural reforms, firmly grasped the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, and promoted a smoother domestic circulation and more efficient connection between domestic and foreign markets. Especially since this year, the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' policies have continued to exert their strength, continuously releasing consumption potential and driving investment growth. The overall policy of replacing old consumer goods with new ones has driven the sales of related products to exceed 1 trillion yuan. From January to October, national fixed asset investment increased by 3.4% year-on-year. Among this, infrastructure investment increased by 4.3% year-on-year, 0.2 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months; manufacturing investment increased by 9.3%, 0.1 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months. 。，，，、。，----，、。1。1103.4%。，4.3%，90.2；9.3%，90.1. -The Central Economic Work Conference has deployed the key tasks for next year, with ‘vigorously boosting consumption, improving investment efficiency, and expanding domestic demand in all directions' as the top priority. This reflects an efficient coordination of total supply and demand and a deep understanding of economic laws. Implementing special action to boost consumption, expand and strengthen the implementation of ‘two new' policies, provide greater support for ‘two heavy' projects, these policy measures, both grounded in the present and looking toward the long-term, will inevitably effectively stimulate domestic demand potential, consolidate and expand domestic circulation, and better drive the domestic and international dual circulation.- ，-、，-，，。，--，--，、，，，. -Currently, China's economic operation faces numerous difficulties and challenges, including insufficient domestic demand and the adverse impact of an unstable and uncertain international environment on external demand. It is essential to recognise that expanding domestic demand is not only crucial for economic stability but also for economic security; it is a strategic move, not temporary expediency. In this context, it is particularly urgent and important to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand.- ，，。，，，，。，. -Practice has shown that achieving a virtuous cycle of the national economy requires coordinated efforts and dynamic balance between supply and demand. On one hand, it is necessary to focus on the supply side, continuously deepen supply-side structural reform, making advancements and retreats, providing support and applying pressure to enhance the alignment and balance between supply and demand. On the other hand, attention must be directed toward the demand side, accelerating efforts to address shortcomings in domestic demand, particularly in consumption, so that domestic demand becomes the primary driver and stabilising anchor of economic growth. Only by acting in accordance with economic laws can better outcomes and results be achieved. The ‘five must-coordinate' principles are an important understanding of economic work laws that must be firmly grasped. By studying, understanding, and applying Xi Jinping Economic Thought and using scientific methods to plan and promote economic work, we can surely take the initiative in development and achieve steady and long-lasting progress.- ，，、。，，、，、。，，。，。--，。、、，，、.

2024 CEWC Readout & Assessment - Xi Calls for 'Equal-footed Consultation' with US - Xi Meets Dmitry Medvedev	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, December 13, 2024. Page 1: The front page is all Xi Jinping, including the Central Economic Work Conference readout. So let's begin by breaking down the 2024 CEWC readout. In his speech at the CEWC, Xi reviewed the country's economic work in 2024, analyzed the current economic situation and arranged next year's economic work. My Note: I have some initial thoughts going through this readout, although I am sure I haven't spent enough time with it to come up with a detailed assessment yet. But here goes. First, there is a reaffirmation that the economic goals for the year will be achieved. I am highlighting this in light of recent discourse on Beijing wavering on the GDP target. Second, compared to last year's readout, this one talks about having a -more proactive fiscal policy- and specifically to -raise the fiscal deficit ratio.- Last year, the objective outlined was to -appropriately intensify- fiscal policy. In terms of fiscal policy changes, the document calls to increase the issuance and use of special bonds by local governments, expand the scope of investment domains, and broaden the use of these bonds as project capital. Third, also compared to last year, the document this time talks about implementing -a moderately loose monetary policy- from an earlier -prudent monetary policy-. This phrase was used in the Politburo meeting earlier this week. As reports have informed, this is the first time we are seeing such language since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The document also calls to reduce the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates in a timely manner. Fourth, the requirement of boosting domestic consumption is once again on the top of the list of tasks for next year. Last year's CEWC had it second among the nine tasks. The top task was to focus on technology. In 2022, domestic demand was the top priority in the CEWC readout. The document calls to -vigorously boost consumption- and support the two new policies and two heavy projects, through more central funding. Towards the end of the document, this is a very clear statement of intent: -It is necessary to closely grasp key links to complete the key tasks of economic work next year, targeting the prominent issues of insufficient demand by focusing on boosting domestic demand, especially residential consumption demand; address deep-seated development constraints and external challenges by unwaveringly deepening reforms and expanding opening up…- Fifth, the second priority in the list is to focus on technology linked to industrial development. In contrast, there's no real emphasis on consumer technology or platform economy, although it does get a mention. One noteworthy aspect of this is the call to -comprehensively rectify ‘involution-style' competition and standardize the behavior of local governments and enterprises-. This is indicative of far more intervention by the state, particularly through the central government and regulatory changes to ensure what it contends is market order. Sixth, with regard to the real estate sector, the readout calls to -reasonably control the supply of new land for real estate projects, revitalize existing land and commercial and office buildings, and promote the disposal of existing commercial housing. Promote the construction of a new model of real estate development and build relevant basic systems in an orderly manner.- This is somewhat different from the readout last year, which had called to -meet the reasonable financing needs of real estate enterprises of different ownerships equally-. The readout this year essentially entails a continuation of the policies that have been enacted this year. Seventh, I thought this was worth noting: -Support economically developed provinces to take the lead, and encourage other regions to adapt to local conditions and showcase their strengths. Deepen industrial cooperation among the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions, and vigorously develop the marine economy and bay area economy-. I wonder if this is also somewhere a concern with regard to low-end industrial capacity being outsourced beyond China's border, and therefore, a call to transfer capacity to the interiors. Eighth, the exclusion of some ideas is interesting. For instance, there is a reference to balancing the relationship between total supply and total demand, but there is no mention of supply-side structural reform; it was mentioned in 2022 and 2023. Also, there's not really any substantive space given to boosting private sector confidence compared to last year's readout. There's no mention of the ‘Two Unswervings', which again was something that was referenced in 2022 and 2023. Finally, towards the end, the paragraph on implementation is rather scathing, and a reflection of systemic inertia and the frustration of the top leadership. Subscribe now Share Tracking People's Daily With that done, here's what the readout says: -The meeting held that this year was a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. In the face of the complex and severe situation characterized by increasing external pressures and mounting internal difficulties, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core united and led the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to respond calmly and adopt comprehensive measures. Economic operation is generally stable while making steady progress, high-quality development is solidly advancing, and the main economic and social development goals and tasks are about to be successfully achieved. New quality productive forces have steadily developed, reform and opening-up have been continuously deepened, risks in key areas have been mitigated in an orderly and effective manner, work on people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and solid strides have been made in Chinese-style modernization. The development journey over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements have been encouraging, especially the decisive deployment of a package of incremental policies at the meeting of the Politburo on September 26, which effectively boosted social confidence and significantly led to economic recovery.- ，--。、，，、，、，，。，，，，。，，926，，. -The meeting pointed out that the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment have deepened, and China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges, mainly due to insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, pressures on employment and income growth for the people, and numerous risks and hidden dangers that still remain. At the same time, it must be seen that China's economic foundation is stable, has many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential, and the long-term supporting conditions and basic trends have not changed. We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence, and strive to transform positive factors in all aspects into development results.- ，，，，，，。，、、、，。、，. -The meeting held that in practice, we have continuously deepened our understanding of the laws of economic work. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for doing economic work well. At critical moments and important junctures, the Party Central Committee has promptly assessed the situation and made decisions and deployments, ensuring that China's economic ship can brave the waves and move forward steadily. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'().

Expand the issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds to continue supporting the implementation of ‘two heavy' projects and ‘two new' policies.

Optimize the structure of fiscal expenditures, improve the efficiency of fund utilization, pay more attention to benefiting people's livelihoods, promoting consumption, and enhancing long-term momentum, and firmly grasp the bottom line of the ‘three guarantees' at the grassroots level. Party and government agencies must adhere to the principle of frugality.- 。，、。，。，----。，。，，、、，--。. -It is necessary to implement a moderately loose monetary policy.

Xi said both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, adding China is prepared to stay in communication with the United States to expand cooperation, manage differences, continue exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era, and realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.- -Economic and trade relations are an important part of bilateral relations, Xi said, noting the interests of the two countries are closely intertwined, and the room for cooperation is infinitely vast. The two sides should properly handle differences through equal-footed consultation, and make the pie of cooperation bigger based on their complementary advantages, said the Chinese president. The success of one side should be an opportunity rather than a challenge for the other, and one's achievement should help rather than hinder the development of the other, he added.

Xi emphasized that in a world marked by intertwined changes and turmoil, peace and development remain the shared aspirations of all peoples. China stands ready to work with other countries in the spirit of ‘promoting global solidarity', upholding fairness and justice to safeguard global peace and stability, adhering to win-win cooperation to promote sustainable global development, and committing to inclusiveness and mutual learning to advance human civilization to new heights, Xi said.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with Chairman of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev. Xinhua says: -Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 75 years ago, China and Russia have blazed a new path featuring mutual respect, harmonious coexistence and win-win cooperation between major and neighboring countries, setting an example of new-type international relations as well as relations between major neighboring countries, Xi said. He said China is willing to work with Russia to strengthen the synergy of development strategies, tap the intrinsic momentum of bilateral cooperation, and continuously bring benefits to the two countries and peoples. China and Russia should strengthen communication and coordination within such multilateral frameworks as the United Nations (UN), the BRICS cooperation mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core, and practice true multilateralism so as to make the international order more just and equitable and jointly safeguard global strategic stability and international fairness and justice, Xi said.

As important forces promoting human progress, the two parties should further coordinate and cooperate closely, lead the global governance in the right direction, and pool the consensus of friendly political parties in countries around the world, especially in the Global South countries, to push the world forward in the right direction, Xi said. On the Ukraine crisis, China has repeatedly emphasized the need to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, to promote the easing of the situation as soon as possible, Xi said. He added that China will continue to adhere to its consistent position and work with the international community to create favorable conditions for the political settlement of the crisis.- The report adds: -Medvedev delivered a signed letter to Xi from Russian President Vladimir Putin-. -Noting that the exchanges and cooperation between the United Russia party and the CPC bear special responsibilities in the relations between the two countries, Medvedev said the United Russia party is willing to promote pragmatic cooperation and youth exchanges through the dialogue mechanism between the ruling parties of Russia and China, strengthen education on traditional values such as patriotism and promote the long-term development of bilateral relations. Medvedev said that the Russian side speaks highly of China's position on the Ukraine crisis, pays attention to the Group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis, an initiative put forward by China, Brazil and other countries, and is willing to actively promote the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with foreign envoys.

He hoped that the envoys will visit more parts of China, listen more to the voices of the Chinese people, fully understand the China of the past, the present and the future, objectively reflect China's contemporary outlook, development path and direction, and actively play the role of bridge builders, promoters of cooperation and inheritors of friendship between China and the world … Chinese-style modernization is not a modernization pursued in isolation. China is willing to share its development opportunities with all countries, achieve mutual benefit and mutual success, and work together to achieve the modernization of all countries in the world with peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- ，、。，，、、，、、，、、...。，、，、、.

Share Tracking People's Daily The other lead report on the page is on Xi's remarks when meeting with the heads of major international economic organizations, who were in Beijing to attend the ‘1+10' dialogue. Xinhua says: -Xi briefed the guests on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially the important measures recently adopted by China. He said that after more than 40 years of sustained and rapid development, the Chinese economy has ushered in a phase of high-quality development, contributing around 30 percent to the world economic growth. China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and continuing to play the role of the largest engine of world economic growth. China's development is open and inclusive. China will further opening-up to the outside world, proactively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and build a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for and share more development dividends with other countries, he said.- -Noting the progress in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) over the past decade, Xi welcomed international economic organizations to continue actively participating in the BRI cooperation and promote the modernization of all countries that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- Regarding global economic governance, Xi stressed that promoting world economic growth is inseparable from effective and proactive global economic governance. International economic organizations should keep pace with the times, respond to the call of the times and the expectations of the people of the world; they should actively participate in and promote the reform of the global economic governance system, build a more fair and reasonable global economic governance system, reflect the development and changes in the global economic structure, and increase the representation and voice of the Global South. All parties have already reached some consensus in this regard; the key is to turn the vision into reality. Regardless of how global economic governance is reformed, it must adhere to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and ensure equality of rights, opportunities, and rules for all countries. ，，，、。，，，，，。，。，，，、、. The on ties with the US, Xi said: -China is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with the U.S. government, and push bilateral relations forward in the direction of steady, healthy and sustainable development, Xi said, expressing the hope that the U.S. side will work with China in the same direction. ‘Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners,' he said. China will always focus on doing its own things well and resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests. At the same time, China's determination to promote high-level opening up will not change. ，、、，、、，。、、，。，、、。. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a very long feature article that says that as 2024 draws to a close -China's economy is entering a new and critical phase-, which will require critical decisions. It says that: -The road ahead is by no means smooth. Looking at the outside world, the international environment is more severe and complex, the global economic growth momentum is insufficient, and some countries continue to increase their containment and suppression of China. Looking inside, domestic effective demand is insufficient, economic performance shows divergences, there are still several risks and hidden dangers in key areas, and there are pains associated with the transition between old and new drivers of growth … At present, China is at a critical stage of accelerating the pace of transformation and upgrading, striving to advance high-quality development. It is at a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Critical periods require critical decisions. Facing various risks, challenges, and uncertainties, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has taken a comprehensive view and courageously taken on responsibilities, uniting and leading the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to tackle difficulties and forge ahead, steering the giant ship of China's economy fearlessly and bravely.- 。，，，。，，，，。-、，。-。，、，、。。，、，、，、. The first section of the article talks about the significance of the September 26 Politburo meeting. It says that the meeting sent -a strong signal to stabilize the overall economic development and continue the long-term positive trend.- It adds that -before and after this meeting, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the State Financial Regulatory Administration, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments released a package of incremental policies.- There's a detailing of some of the steps that have been announced since September. But the focus of this section is essentially Xi's leadership. The second section talks about the development of new quality productive forces. It says: -At present, the world is at a new stage where informatization fully drives innovation and serves as the foundation for reshaping a nation's core competitiveness. Whoever can better understand and grasp this trend, better adapt to and lead the direction of productivity development, will be able to comprehensively enhance their overall national strength.- ，、。，，. This section essentially reiterates the importance of transforming traditional industries, focussing on emerging industries, and building a modern industrial layout with a focus on technology, along with the agenda of green transformation. For instance, it says: -Green development is the underlying color of high-quality development, and the new quality of productivity itself is green productivity.- ，. The third section discusses the need to focus on livelihood issues. It acknowledges that: -At present, some local governments are facing financial difficulties, incidents of companies laying off workers and delaying wages are increasing, employment pressure is rising, and the task of improving people's well-being has become even more arduous and challenging.- ，，，，. The section also touches on the issues of demographics, food security, urbanisation, etc. The fourth and final section discusses opening up. The basic idea here is that reform and opening up is a -firm choice- that comes from the Party's and Xi's -scientific assessment-. At one point, the article also says: At present, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and transformations of the world, the times, and history are unfolding in unprecedented ways. A few countries are engaging in ‘decoupling and breaking chains' and building ‘small yards with high walls', while protectionism, unilateralism, and hegemonism continue to rise. The more we encounter countercurrents, the more we must actively embrace and promote economic globalization. At the crossroads of choices in this era, China consistently stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress.- ，，、、，----，、、。，。，，. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

All parties should further focus on development, jointly foster a peaceful and stable development environment, advance the improvement of global governance, maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain, and cultivate new momentum for economic growth.- ，，，。，、。，，，，. He added that -China is a staunch defender of economic globalization and multilateralism. Over the long term, China's economy has continuously injected strong momentum into the global economy, increasingly demonstrating its distinct characteristics of development.- He then made three points with regard to China's economic policy going forward: First, there is an operating mechanism for stable growth, adhering to the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability and long-term planning. We will increase counter-cyclical adjustments, step up the implementation of macroeconomic policies, do everything possible to expand domestic demand and boost consumption, make greater efforts to solve outstanding problems, and promote the continued recovery of the economy. Second, there is incremental space for sustained growth, and new demands and new momentum will continue to form. We will further comprehensively deepen reforms, accelerate the construction of a unified national market, focus on promoting scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and continuously enhance the endogenous driving force of the economy. Third, there are positive spillover effects, and we will always share development opportunities with the world. We will unwaveringly promote high-standard opening up, introduce more self-initiated and unilateral opening policies,expand a global network of high-standard free trade zones, and continue to create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. Li added: -China is willing to work with all parties to safeguard the basic norms of international relations and the multilateral trading system. China supports international economic organizations in playing an important role in global governance and will actively assume international obligations that match its own capabilities to jointly promote the healthy and stable development of the world economy.- ，、。，，。，、。，，、，，。，、。，，，。，。，，，、、。，，。，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua English's report also says that: -‘This year the Chinese economy has enjoyed generally stable growth, and recently we have unveiled a package of incremental policies. Market confidence and expectations have been significantly enhanced,' Li said, adding that China will work to inject more impetus and certainty into the recovery and growth of the world economy. China supports the continuous expansion of the New Development Bank and is willing to expand project and financing cooperation between the two sides to jointly contribute more to the economic and social development of BRICS countries and developing countries. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with the World Bank in international development, loans, knowledge and other fields to improve the quality and efficiency of cooperation, he said. China supports the WTO in carrying out necessary reforms, promoting the vitality of the multilateral trading system, and safeguarding economic globalization and free trade, and China is willing to deepen cooperation with the IMF and make greater contributions to maintaining global financial stability, promoting common development and tackling climate change, Li noted. Finally, there's a report on Wang Huning's comments at the 2024 annual conference of the Cross-Strait CEO Summit. Wang praised the summit for having -united enterprises and business people on both sides of the strait- and for making -important contributions to promoting the peaceful development and integrated development of cross-strait relations-. The report adds: Wang said that -we will thoroughly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, adhere to the one-China principle and the ‘1992 Consensus', resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence' separatism and external interference, promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, deepen cross-strait integration and development in various fields, support Taiwan compatriots and enterprises to participate in Chinese-style modernisation, share the fruits of development and progress of the motherland, and enhance the sense of kinship and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait. Wang Huning expressed the hope that compatriots and entrepreneurs on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will uphold righteousness, follow the trend of the times, grasp the correct direction of the development of cross-strait relations, firmly grasp the destiny of the Chinese nation in the hands of the Chinese people themselves, and jointly write a brilliant chapter of national reunification and national rejuvenation.- ，--，--，，，，，。，、，，，，、.

Another report informs that China will provide special training for 1,300 TCM talents from BRI partner countries in the next three years. Finally, there's a report on Wang Yi's message to the Hernán Santa Cruz Dialogue on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights held in Hangzhou. Xinhua says: -China will continue to work with all countries and UN agencies to pursue the common values of humanity, safeguard human rights with security, promote human rights with development, and advance human rights with cooperation, to contribute to sound and sustainable development of the global human rights cause … Wang said that the world is undergoing profound transformation of a scale not seen in a century, with geopolitical conflicts flaring up, global economic recovery remaining weak and deficit in human rights governance widening. Noting that ensuring the equal enjoyment of the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR) by all is an important goal for the realization of all human rights, Wang said it is important to uphold true multilateralism, adhere to a people-centered approach, and strengthen solidarity and coordination. Committed to putting the people first, China has found a path of human rights development that is in line with the trend of the times and suits its national conditions. Historic achievements have been made in China's human rights cause, and the protection of the ESCR has reached new heights, he added. Wang noted that the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization, and will provide favorable conditions for the equal enjoyment of the ESCR of Chinese people at a higher level.

Chinese enterprises ‘going global' are continuously introducing new offerings to the global market with higher-quality goods, services, and technologies.- ，，，。--，、，--. -In the first 10 months, China's import and export of goods increased by 5.2% year-on-year, among which the export of automatic data processing equipment and its parts, integrated circuits and automobiles achieved double-digit growth. In the same period, China's import and export of services increased by 14.6% year-on-year, among which the export of services increased by 16.6% year-on-year; non-financial ODI increased by 10.6% year-on-year, and the newly-signed contract value of contracted projects in the BRI partner increased by 15.7% year-on-year.

At the same time, they are actively fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities, creating jobs, providing vocational training, improving infrastructure, and integrating into local communities, making positive contributions to local economic and social development and improving people's well-being. In 2023, Chinese companies overseas paid a total of $75.3 billion in various taxes to the countries (regions) where they invested, an increase of 0.3% over the previous year.

For the global economy, as Chinese enterprises ‘go global', their products, technologies, business models, and management expertise promote connectivity in trade, economics, and other fields.

Hello everyone, Let me begin today by sharing that the applications for my Watching China course are now open. The course will run every Saturday from February 1, 2025 to March 1, 2025. All the details with regard to the curriculum, learning outcomes, admissions process and fees are available on this page. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any specific questions. Warmly, Manoj Kewalramani Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 09, 2024. Page 1: We have a report on the publication of a new book of Xi Jinping's discourses. This one deals with his remarks about upholding and improving the system of people's congresses. Xinhua says: -The book features a collection of 37 important works by Xi expounding on the theme between December 2012 and October 2024. Some of these works are made public for the first time. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has comprehensively strengthened the Party's leadership over the work of people's congresses and vigorously promoted whole-process people's democracy. Xi has integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture, systematically summarized the practical experience of the CPC in strengthening socialist democracy, continuously advanced theoretical and practical innovations of the system of people's congresses, and put forward a series of new thinking, new ideas and new requirements, thus providing the fundamental guidance for upholding, improving and running well the system of people's congresses.- Subscribe now Next, today marks the beginning of a new series on the Chinese economy. It says that the -overall economic operation is stable- and -high-quality development is being steadily promoted.- It says that -in the first three quarters, China's GDP grew by 4.8% year-on-year, laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual target. ‘China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and continuing to serve as the biggest driver of global economic growth'.- ，4.8%，。-，.- The first section of the article says that through this year -stability has been consolidated.- The key points made are: Although the growth rate has fluctuated through the year, it has remained near the expected target 10.49 million new jobs were created in urban areas across the country in the first three quarters. The employment situation is -generally stable.- Prices have risen -moderately- Balance of payments has been maintained In October, China's manufacturing PMI returned to expansion range, at 50.1%; and the consumer confidence index rebounded by 1.2 percentage points from the previous month, the first rebound after a continuous decline for 6 months. The annual railway passenger volume exceeded 4 billion people The annual express delivery business volume exceeded 150 billion pieces -Looking back, this year's economic achievements in China have not come easily. A series of existing policies and new measures have worked in synergy and delivered sustained results, helping the economy stabilise, and continue improving.- ，。、，、. Then the piece talks about the policy steps that have been taken. Among these, it says: -The issuance of new special bonds reached 3.9 trillion yuan; 10 trillion yuan in local debt resolution resources were added, forming a ‘combination punch' for debt resolution; starting September 27, the RRR was lowered by 0.5 percentage points, releasing approximately 1 trillion yuan in long-term liquidity ... With the effective implementation of proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies, positive factors are continuously increasing.- 3.9；10，--；9270.5，1……，. The piece mentions policies related to the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' goals, real estate policies, etc. The second section talks about the focus on technology and innovation. It says: In the first 10 months, investment in high-tech industries increased by 9.3% year-on-year, and the number of invention patents authorised was 889,000; in October, the added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.4% year-on-year. 10，9.3%，88.9；109.4%. The piece highlights some breakthroughs, such as the formal commercial operation of China's first self-developed F-class heavy-duty gas turbine. This happened in late November. It mentions the C919 aircraft being picked up by three airlines and Origin Wukong, China's third-generation superconducting quantum computer, going into operation. It adds: -In the first three quarters, listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D, up 3.9% year-on-year; by the end of October, the number of domestic valid invention patents reached 4.66 million ... R&amp;D investment increased, innovative achievements emerged, and industrial upgrading took solid steps.

Emerging industries are developing rapidly, and new drivers of growth are continuously accumulating.- 5G414.1，-5G+-1.5，4500……、、，，。 The final section talks about policies related to reform and opening up. Finally, there's a report informing that -as of 24:00 on December 6, 29.638 million consumers had purchased 45.85 million units of eight major categories of home appliances, driving sales of 201.97 billion yuan, with over 90% of the sales revenue coming from first-level energy-efficient products. Recently, various regions have actively promoted home appliance trade-in programs, with policy effects becoming increasingly evident. Nationwide, it took 79 days for trade-in sales to surpass 100 billion yuan, while the jump from 100 billion to 200 billion yuan took only 40 days, accelerating the release of consumption potential for upgrades.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 6: Today's Xinhua piece on the economy deals with the policy shifts in the property sector since the September 26 Politburo meeting. The first sentence says that -the housing issue is both a people's livelihood issue and a development issue.- ，. The article says that after the Politburo meeting, -multiple departments introduced policies to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, summarised as ‘Four Cancellations', ‘Four Reductions', and ‘Two Increases.' Many regions, especially first-tier cities, have actively adjusted and optimized related policies to help the market recover…Local governments have implemented city-specific measures to cancel or reduce restrictive policies, unlocking housing demand; tax policies have been optimized to lower transaction costs; land policies have been adjusted to control new supply and manage existing inventory, enhancing the ‘reservoir' function of land reserves; and financial support has been increased, injecting liquidity into the sector. How effective have these policy combinations been? Let's observe several key indicators.- The first indicator is sales data: -The latest data from the NBS shows that, from the sales situation of 40 key cities monitored, second-tier cities that previously had experienced larger declines earlier showed significant marginal improvement, with monthly sales area in October achieving positive growth, and the decline in sales volume narrowing significantly. From January to October, the nationwide newly-built commercial housing sales area year-on-year declined by 15.8%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.3 percentage points compared to January to September; newly-built commercial housing sales amount year-on-year declined by 20.9%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.8 percentage points compared to January to September. The online signing data of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development showed that in October, the online signing volume of newly-built commercial housing transactions in China increased by 0.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 15 consecutive months of decline; the total transaction volume of newly-built commercial housing and second-hand housing increased by 3.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 8 consecutive months of decline. 926，--，，------。，。，，----：，；，；，、，--；，--……--？。——，40，，10，。110，15.8%，191.3；20.9%，191.8。，10，0.9%，15；3.9%，8. The second indicator is that the number of visits to first-hand houses and the number of viewings of second-hand houses have increased significantly. The third indicator is market confidence. It says that -According to the PMI survey, the real estate business activity index in October rebounded by 2.5 percentage points from the previous month, and the market expectation index rebounded by 1.8 percentage points. This indicates that under the influence of various policies, the real estate market's prosperity has begun to recover.- PMI，102.5，1.8。，。 The section ends by quoting the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development as assessing that: -‘Overall, the comprehensive set of measures to promote the stabilisation of the real estate market has shown effectiveness, with positive changes appearing in the real estate market in October. As the policy effectiveness of various measures continues to be released, the momentum to drive real estate market stabilisation will strengthen' … ‘Under the effect of a series of policies, after three years of adjustment, China's real estate market has begun to bottom out'.- -，，10。，。--，，.- The second section argues that: -On the one hand, we should see that the package of policies has begun to take effect; on the other hand, we should also see that the bottoming out of the real estate market is a process that requires a combination of long-term and short-term measures, addressing symptoms and root causes.- First, we must ‘adapt to the new situation in which the supply and demand relationship of China's real estate market has undergone major changes'. This was a major judgment made by the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee on July 24, 2023. To understand the current real estate situation, we must first grasp this change. The supply and demand relationship is a key factor affecting market prices, which is one of the basic principles of economics. Over the past 20-plus years, China's real estate market has generally shown an upward trend, playing an important role in guaranteeing and improving people's livelihood and supporting China's economic and social development. At the same time, the rapid expansion of the real estate market also saw some issues such as excessive capital concentration in real estate, and some real estate enterprises exhibiting ‘high debt, high leverage, high turnover'. From the past, when supply fell short of demand, leading to a booming market and even price distortions, to recent years, where the main contradiction has shifted from total quantity shortage to basically balanced total quantity with structural supply insufficiency, the underlying logic of the real estate market has changed. (Note: My understanding of this is that there are enough units available in the market but these do not match with consumer demand requirements, either in type, quality or price, etc.) Therefore, to further stabilize and improve the real estate market, commercial housing construction must focus on ‘strictly controlling new supply, optimizing existing inventory, and improving quality'. From the perspective of existing stock, China's new commercial housing supply scale is large, and stock digestion is an important adjustment direction. At the policy level, it has been clearly stated that in cities with relatively large commercial housing inventory, the government can purchase as needed, actively supporting the acquisition of existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing. Currently, various regions are accelerating the process of acquiring existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing, and special bond support for reclaiming idle existing stock land and adding new land reserves is also being rapidly implemented. From the perspective of increments and quality, people's housing demand has transformed from focussing on whether one has or not to quality, and meeting this market demand is an important direction for adjusting increments and improving quality.- ，；，，、。，--。724。，。，。20，，、。，，，-、、-。，、，。，，-、、-. ，，。，，，。，，、。，----，. -Secondly, it is essential to repair the credit chain, rebuild market confidence, and promote a virtuous cycle between finance and real estate. Winning the battle to ensure housing delivery is the top priority among these. For some time, during the adjustment of the real estate market, some commercial housing projects that are under construction or have been pre-sold have faced difficulties in delivery due to funding and debt problems. This phenomenon not only seriously damages the rights and interests of home buyers, but also affects market confidence and hinders the orderly operation of the market. In response to this ‘pain point', the work of ensuring the delivery of houses has been steadily promoted, and the urban real estate financing coordination mechanism has been launched in a timely manner — incorporating compliant real estate projects into a ‘white list', ensuring all eligible projects receive loans, satisfying projects' reasonable financing needs. This has become an important measure and strong guarantee for achieving a virtuous cycle between financial and real estate and improving market expectations. At present, 297 cities at or above the prefecture level across the country have established a real estate project financing coordination mechanism. As of October 31, 2024, the amount of loans approved for ‘white list' projects exceeded 3 trillion yuan. By the end of the year, as the ‘white list' is expanded in an orderly manner, this scale will increase to 4 trillion yuan. The increase in the scale of credit indicates that the financing of real estate projects is picking up pace and becoming more convenient, and the continued advancement of guaranteed housing delivery is increasingly secure. As of November 13, 2024, the battle for guaranteed housing delivery has been vigorously promoted, and 2.85 million units have been delivered nationwide. This has not only protected the legitimate rights and interests of home buyers, but also effectively improved market expectations. In addition, it is necessary to release the potential demand of the market and further activate the real estate market from both the supply and demand sides. Based on the current main contradiction in the real estate market, in terms of supply structure, the supply of affordable housing is relatively insufficient, housing prices in large cities are high, and the housing burden of new citizens and youth is relatively heavy. In terms of housing demand, improved housing demand continues to upgrade, with residents' desire to enhance living quality becoming stronger. Therefore, by ‘four cancellations' and ‘four reductions' to lower purchasing costs and increasing affordable housing construction and urban village transformation will inject new demand into the real estate market. From the medium and long-term trend of the real estate market, there is still development space in meeting the rigid and improved housing needs. China is still in the middle to late stages of urbanization, and continuously promoting people-oriented new-type urbanization will release greater real estate market demand potential.- ，，，。。，，、，。，，。--，，——--，、，，、。，297。1031，--3。，--，4。，，。1113，，285，，。，，。，，，，、。，，。，----，，。，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The final section says that the earlier real estate sector -development model is no longer adapted to the new requirements of high-quality development-. It adds that -accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model is the fundamental solution for stable and healthy real estate market development. Better satisfying rigid and improved housing needs, perfecting real estate development, transaction and usage systems, establishing a new mechanism for coordinated linkage of the factors of ‘people, houses, land, and money' are important aspects of accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model.- ，。，、，-、、、-，. -Creating safe, comfortable, green, and intelligent houses has become an important path to meet people's beautiful life needs, and is also the rightful meaning of promoting high-quality development of the real estate industry. From supporting urban expansion to participating in urban renewal, from driving growth through new supply to linking new supply with existing stock... Real estate development must focus on the diversified housing needs of the people in the new development stage, addressing aspects such as outdoor environments, age-friendly design, and green low-carbon features, and promoting a comprehensive upgrade in the quality of housing construction. At present, the policy support scope for urban village renovation has expanded from only 35 major cities at the beginning to all cities at prefecture level and above. A total of 1,632 urban village renovation projects have been implemented in major cities. From January to October, 3.17 million sets of affordable housing and urban village renovation resettlement housing have been built and raised nationwide; by the end of this year, more than 10 million people in need can be helped to improve their housing conditions. Actively implementing urban renewal actions is an important measure to transform urban development methods and achieve high-quality development. Systematically promoting ‘four good' construction, i.e., construction of good houses, good neighborhoods, good communities, and good urban areas, is the focus of real estate industry's future development. The nation has implemented over 66,000 urban renewal projects, with cumulative investment of 2.6 trillion yuan. The comprehensive effectiveness brought by urban renewal actions is gradually emerging. In 2024, the plan was to begin renovation of 54,000 old urban residential areas; 53,000 of these have already started in the first 10 months. Coordinated linkage and preventing dramatic fluctuations are key to achieving stable, healthy, and high-quality real estate market development.- 20，，。、、、，，。，……，、、，。，35。1632。110，317（）；，1000。，、。、、、--，。6.6，2.6，。2024，5.4，105.3. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Ding Duo, deputy director of the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy, the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. Ding's basic argument is that -the Philippines' violations of China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, as well as other practices that deviate from the track of resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation and maliciously escalate the situation, violate international law, including the UN Charter, go against the spirit of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea and the region.- The specific things that he points to are: -Instigated by extra-regional countries, the current Philippine government has frequently infringed, provoked and created trouble at at Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal), Ren'ai Reef (Second Thomas Shoal), Xianbin Reef (Sabina Shoal), Tiexian Reef (Sandy Cay) and other places, hyping the so-called illegal arbitration ruling of the South China Sea case in the international public opinion arena, disguising itself as a victim to deceive the world. Such manipulation cannot change the mainstream perception of the South China Sea issue within the international community, nor can it change China's firm will to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.- ，、、、、，，。，. Ding ends with this: -For a long time, China has resolutely safeguarded its legitimate rights and interests in the South China Sea, firmly maintained peace and stability in the South China Sea, and insisted on resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation. China's claims and position will not change due to fluctuations in the maritime situation, and China's determination and will will not be shaken by external interference. The Philippine side should abandon any baseless, unreasonable, and unhelpful fantasies, and work with China to seek a stable and long-term solution to the South China Sea issue.- ，，，。，。、、，，. Finally, there's a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the developments in Syria. It said: -China is closely following the situation in Syria and hopes that stability will return as soon as possible. The Chinese government has been actively helping Chinese nationals who wish to leave the country to do so in a safe and orderly way, and staying in contact with those Chinese still in Syria and offering them advice on how to stay safe. We urge relevant parties in Syria to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria. The Chinese Embassy is still up and running and carrying out its duty in Syria.

Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's inspection of the Information Support Force of the PLA on Wednesday. Zhang Youxia, He Weidong, Liu Zhenli, and Zhang Shengmin were present for this. Xi emphasized that -it is necessary to implement the thought of strengthening the army in the new era, implement the new era's military strategic guidelines, strengthen mission responsibility, bravely innovate and break through, consolidate the foundation of the military, strive to build a powerful modern information support force, and realize the leapfrog development of the Chinese military's network information system.- ，，，，，，，. The report says: -Xi Jinping listened to the work report of the Information Support Force and delivered an important speech. He pointed out that currently, a new round of technological revolution and military revolution is developing rapidly, war forms are accelerating their evolution, and the position and role of network information systems in modern warfare are unprecedented. The Information Support Force is first and foremost a combat force. It must stand at the height of strengthening the military and being victorious in war, fully recognize the extreme importance of network information system construction, understand the historical mission it bears, and rapidly advance the construction of network information systems and service support capabilities for the military's combat readiness.- ，，。，，，，。，，，，. -Xi Jinping emphasized that it is necessary to persist in emancipating thinking, seeking truth from facts, keeping up with the times, strengthen overall planning, innovate development models, actively explore and practice, and solidly carry out various network information system construction tasks. It is necessary to focus on being able to fight and win wars, optimize information service guarantee methods, steadily promote the construction of network information public service platforms, integrate and make good use of various types of data and information, attach great importance to network information security protection, quickly integrate into the system, drive the system, and empower the system, and lead innovations in command models and transformations of combat methods. It is necessary to continuously promote the implementation of reform tasks, establish and improve work operation mechanisms, improve relevant laws and regulations, create a good ecology of co-construction and sharing, and improve the quality and efficiency of network information system construction.- ，、、，，，，。、，，，，，、、，、。，，，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the Information Support Force is currently in its initial creation period and must comprehensively strengthen self-construction, pay attention to laying foundations and planning for the long term, and solidify the developmental roots of the force. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Military Commission's Political Work Conference, uphold the fundamental principle and system of the Party's absolute leadership over the military, strengthen its arming with the Party's innovative theories, focus on deepening ideological rectification at the root of thought, strictly maintain political discipline and combat corruption, and ensure the force remains absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable. The first Party Committee of the Information Support Force must strengthen the sense of entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit, take on their first responsibilities, select and strengthen Party committees at all levels, build strong front-line command posts and front-line combat fortresses, and improve the leadership, organizational, and executive capabilities of Party organizations. It is necessary to implement the whole-chain construction concept, innovate talent cultivation models, and build a high-quality professional network information talent formation. It is necessary to adhere to precise construction, strengthen scientific management, focus on classified guidance, solidly promote grassroots construction, and maintain the force's normal order and stability.- ，，，、，。，，，，，、、。，，，，、、。，，。，，，，. Xi Jinping finally emphasized that the CMC should strengthen overall coordination, the relevant departments of the Commission should take the initiative to provide guidance, and all units should actively cooperate to jointly build the Information Support Force and create a new situation in the construction of the military's network information system. ，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory letter to Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on her election as president of Namibia. Xinhua reports: -Noting that China and Namibia enjoy a long-standing traditional friendship, Xi said that in recent years, the two countries have strengthened their political mutual trust, achieved fruitful outcomes in practical cooperation, and firmly supported each other on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns. Also in the message, Xi said that he highly regards the development of China-Namibia relations, and stands ready to work with Nandi-Ndaitwah to take the implementation of the outcomes of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit as an opportunity to carry forward the traditional friendship, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples.- Third, there's a report on Wang Huning meeting a Vietnamese delegation led by Nguyen Xuan Thang, a member of the Politburo of the CPV Central Committee, president of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics and chairman of the Central Theoretical Council. Xinhua reports: Wang said that -China will work with Vietnam to follow through on the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties, said Wang, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC National Committee is willing to maintain close communication and cooperation with the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Wang said. The CPV hopes to continuously learn from the CPC experience in national governance, strengthen the overall leadership of the party, and improve Vietnam's socialist development system, head of the delegation Nguyen Xuan Thang said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, there's a report on Han Zheng meeting with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez. Xinhua reports: -Han said China is willing to work with Venezuela to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, continue to firmly support each other on issues that bear on each other's core interests and major concerns, strengthen practical cooperation, promote greater progress in bilateral relations, and uphold the common interests of developing countries. Rodriguez said that Venezuela firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports the series of major initiatives put forward by China and is willing to learn from China's successful experience in governance. Moreover, the country aims to strengthen bilateral cooperation and multilateral coordination, oppose unilateral illegal sanctions, and safeguard national security and development, as well as international fairness and justice.- Subscribe now Fifth, there's another commentary drawing from Xi's speech on BRI. It says: -In October 2023, President Xi Jinping announced eight action items at the Third BRI Forum, indicating that the joint construction of BRI has entered a new stage of high-quality development. This new stage of high-quality development is a new stage of three-dimensional connectivity across the Eurasian continent, led by the Green Silk Road, and empowered by the Digital Silk Road, marking a new starting point for China and all parties to make unremitting efforts to achieve modernization for countries worldwide, demonstrating the broad-minded approach of seeking progress for humanity, pursuing great harmony for the world, and showcasing the great power responsibility of having a global perspective and leading the era.- 202310，--，--。、、，，、、. General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly elaborated on the overall requirements, guiding principles, practical paths, and key work for high-quality joint construction of BRI, providing important guidance and pointing out the direction for promoting high-quality development in the new stage. We must deeply recognise that seeking progress while maintaining stability is an important principle of our Party's governance. The more complex the international situation becomes, the more we must adhere to the work guideline of seeking progress while maintaining stability, steadily and cautiously advance project construction, and gradually expand new areas of cooperation. Adhering to consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, openness, greenness, integrity, high standards, and benefiting people's livelihoods in a sustainable way; these are the guiding principles for the high-quality joint construction of BRI. We must actively advocate the concept of win-win cooperation and a correct view of righteousness and gain, uphold the essence of openness, the foundation of greenness, and the highlight of integrity, seek the points of intersection of interests and the greatest common divisor of cooperation, and continuously expand new spaces for win-win cooperation and development.- --、、、，--、。，。，，、，。、、，--。，、、，，. -The joint construction of BRI is a long-term, cross-border, and systemic global project; a century-long project. Looking toward the future, it is necessary to be guided by the eight action items for high-quality joint construction of BRI, take interconnectivity as the main line, combine high-quality development with high-level security, government guidance with market operations, scientific layout with dynamic optimisation, and quantitative growth with quality improvement coordinate the deepening of infrastructure ‘hard connectivity', the ‘soft connectivity' of rules and standards, and ‘heart connectivity' through people-to-people linkages across partner countries, coordinate the promotion of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects, and coordinate the consolidation of cooperation in traditional fields and steady expansion of cooperation in emerging fields. Only then can we promote the joint construction of BRI to continuously advance along the direction of high-quality development.- --，、、、。，--，，、、、，--、----，--，，--. The final bit calls for mechanism or institutional construction. -At the symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a systematic deployment for promoting high-quality joint construction of the BRI mechanism, clearly defining the major requirements for improving the ‘nine mechanisms'. All regions, departments, and units must raise their political standing, focus on implementation and execution, continuously strengthen strategic thinking, security awareness, systemic perspective, and international vision, put more effort into coordination and achieve results practically. It is necessary to focus on advancing systematization and institutionalization, continuously improve top-level design, formulate practical measures, deepen external cooperation, and promote the steady and long-term advancement of high-quality joint construction of BRI.- 、、。，--。，--，--。、，、、、，--，--。，，，，--。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guideline on promoting the construction of new urban infrastructure and building resilient cities is published today. I am not detailing the entire document. Xinhua summarises it as follows: -By 2027, significant progress should have been made in the construction of new-type urban infrastructure, providing ever-increasing support for the development of resilient cities, while a number of experiences and practices that can be copied and expanded should have been established. By 2030, the construction of new-type urban infrastructure should have achieved remarkable results, to help push forward the building of a group of high-level resilient cities, improve urban safety and resilience, and ensure safer, more orderly, smarter and more efficient urban operations. To achieve these aims, major tasks must be fulfilled in 11 aspects, including implementing the building and upgrading of intelligent municipal infrastructure, promoting the coordinated development of smart city infrastructure and intelligent connected vehicles, and developing smart residential quarters, according to the guideline. In addition, there are other important tasks such as raising the intelligence level of housing and building management, carrying out digital home construction, improving city information modeling platforms, and maintaining cyber and data security.- Subscribe now Page 2: Just one report to note. It says that so far, 700 billion yuan of ultra-long-term special government bonds have been issued for the -two heavy- projects, i.e., projects related to major national strategies and those to build up security capacity in key areas. This allocation was done in three batches. Another 300 billion yuan has been allocated to increase support for the ‘two new' work, i.e., large-scale equipment renewal and consumer goods replacement. In all, 1 trillion yuan worth of bonds have been issued so far. ，--7000，3000--，，1. -The ‘two heavy' construction projects focus on supporting the development of railways, trunk highways, and airport construction along the Yangtze River, the construction of the new western land-sea corridor, high-standard farmland construction in the black soil region of Northeast China, the ‘Three-North' project, the public service system for the urbanization of agricultural migrant populations, and the upgrading of higher education quality, among other areas.- --、、，，，--，，. Subscribe now Page 3: China's Minister of National Defense Dong Jun made his first public appearance after the recent rumours about a corruption probe against him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had dismissed those rumours earlier. But then CMC member Admiral Miao Hua was officially removed, and that fuelled further speculation about Dong's fate. So this appearance is a statement of sorts. In the past few weeks, I have had a fair few people ask me what I made of the FT report on Dong and whether he was being probed. It is in such moments that China watchers must look to deeper truths, such as those in poetry. So here's the amateur poetic take that I offered for such questions: Kuch baaten hum hum tab jaan paate hai, jab hum unhe jaan paate hai; tab tak kuch afwah, kuch shikwah, aur kabhi umeed ke beech jeete hai hum Or the English version, which sounds less poetic to me at least: Some things we can only know, when we really know them; until then, we exist in a mist of rumours, grievances, and sometimes, hope. Anyway, back to the report. So Dong Jun met with the heads of delegations from various countries attending the Second Seminar on the Security Situation in the Gulf of Guinea in Shanghai on Thursday. He said that China is willing to work with the armed forces of regional countries to share the responsibility of maintaining security in the Gulf of Guinea. Xinhua reports: -Hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, the seminar brought together maritime armed force leaders and defense attachés from 18 nations, including Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. During the meeting, Dong also called for efforts to promote systematic maritime cooperation, carry forward the traditional friendship with regional countries, and contribute to the building of an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Beijing. Xinhua reports: He said that -China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China … He said China is further deepening the reform of its financial system and steadily expanding the institutional opening up of the financial sector, providing greater convenience for foreign enterprises operating in the country. China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including BlackRock, to invest and do business in China, sharing China's development opportunities, the vice premier said. Fink said that BlackRock is optimistic about the prospects of the development of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to continue to deepen its engagement with the Chinese market and contribute to U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. Xinhua reports: -Zhang emphasized that Iran holds significant regional and international influence and is a key comprehensive strategic partner for China. He highlighted the successful meeting between the presidents of both countries at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, in October, during which they provided top-level guidance for strengthening China-Iran relations. Zhang reiterated China's firm support for Iran in safeguarding its sovereignty, security, territorial integrity, and legitimate rights, expressing Beijing's readiness to implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders and to promote the stable and long-term growth of China-Iran relations. Pezeshkian, in turn, asked Zhang to convey his sincere regards to the Chinese president. He underscored Iran's strong commitment to developing its relations with China, highlighting the strategic importance of bilateral ties. Pezeshkian reaffirmed Iran's readiness to continue mutual support, deepen practical cooperation, and promote further growth in the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Also on Wednesday, Zhang held talks with Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref. The two officials engaged in in-depth discussions on implementing the China-Iran comprehensive cooperation plan.- Although it is not in the paper today, for folks tracking India-China relations, do note that ILD chief Liu Jianchao -met with a delegation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) cadres led by Rama Krushna Panda, a national secretariat member of the CPI, in Beijing on Thursday. Both sides agreed on the necessity of delivering on the latest important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, of strengthening party-to-party exchanges and dialogues, of managing differences properly, and of promoting the improvement and development of China-India relations.- Subscribe now Page 5: Today's Xinhua article on the economy deals with the difficulties being encountered by enterprises. The first bit talks about challenges on the demand and supply side. It says: From a demand point of view, -some business leaders say that competition over ‘quantity' is becoming increasingly fierce, and every day when they open their eyes, they think about how to retain customers. Meanwhile, some companies report that the contest over ‘quality' is becoming more pronounced. With consumer demand growing increasingly diverse and personalized, if they cannot adapt to changes, they risk being replaced ‘at any moment'.- 、，。，--，。，--，、，，--. From the supply side perspective, the article claims: -In-depth analysis reveals that the various difficulties currently faced by enterprises are related to the broader economic development environment: Insufficient domestic effective demand. During the structural adjustment process, on the investment side, fixed asset investment growth has been below expectations; on the consumption side, the total retail sales of consumer goods are in a recovery phase. These factors all impact the sales of enterprise goods and services. Industrial upgrading continues to advance, and the squeeze from new and old momentum conversion is inevitable. On one hand, the development of emerging industries creates certain impacts and substitutions for traditional industries, with the market scale of some traditional industries shrinking; on the other hand, technological changes are accelerating, with time and opportunities waiting for no one. These factors place enterprises both in the midst of adjustment pains and compel them to race towards innovation. Global economic recovery is weak, global trade protectionism is intensifying, and uncertainty and instability are increasing. Some industries are experiencing cyclical fluctuations, and some enterprises have not yet adapted to changes in market and industrial development. These difficulties arise from both external pressures and internal challenges, involving environmental factors and enterprise-specific reasons. They are the result of multiple complex factors and are also the inevitable test that our country's economy must directly face while climbing over obstacles and moving towards high-quality development. ，，：。，，；，。。，。，，；，，、。，。、、。，。，，，，、. Subscribe now Do note that there is no comment or analysis about the Chinese government's policies and their impact on the economic environment. Anyway, the second section offers advice and a bit of a pep talk to enterprises. -The market is found, not waited for. When facing problems in the market, seek answers from the market. Recently, some changes are intriguing: The steel industry has been under short-term pressure, but by focusing on new ‘steel' demand through electric vehicles, high added-value product sales have been robust; the laptop market is approaching saturation, but market segments like gaming laptops and ultra-thin laptops targeting personalised needs have shown significant growth; large-scale performances have driven cultural tourism, with online e-commerce transactions in tourism, sightseeing, and entertainment services increasing by 15.3% year-on-year in the first three quarters...these emerging growth points in niche sectors are precisely the new business opportunities that enterprises have captured by recognizing change, responding to change, and seeking change. Exploring broader markets. In the first 10 months, China's private enterprises' exports increased by 9.3% year-on-year, new energy vehicle exports grew by 6.3%, and mechanical and electrical product exports increased by 8.5% ... behind these numbers are Chinese enterprises going out and battling waves in the international market. Competition is always intense, and difficulties will always exist. What determines an enterprise's development prospects is not the number of difficulties, but the perspective on difficulties, the methods of addressing difficulties, and the determination to resolve difficulties.- ，。，。，：，--，；，、；，15.3%……，、、，。。10，9.3%，6.3%，8.5%……，，。，。，，、、. The other piece of advice is to focus on innovation. Some useful data here is that -in the first three quarters, China's listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D. The R&amp;D intensity of companies on the ChiNext Board, the STAR Market, and the Beijing Stock Exchange was 4.74%, 9.94%, and 4.73%, respectively, indicating strengthened innovation efforts. In the first three quarters, 6.191 million new private enterprises were established nationwide, with 40% of them belonging to the ‘four new' economy, signifying an expansion in business fields.- ，1.10。、、4.74%、9.94%、4.73%，。，619.1，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The third and final section deals with the policy steps that have been taken to support enterprise. It says that steps have been taken to Effectively reduce the burden on enterprises: establish a coordination mechanism to support the financing of small and micro enterprises, promote the further reduction of the comprehensive financing costs of enterprises, maintain policies such as the tax deduction of R&amp;D expenses, and introduce a series of measures to effectively reduce the logistics costs of the whole society. Strictly regulate law enforcement supervision: improve the legal system and judicial mechanism for clearing enterprise account arrears, establish a cross-regional administrative law enforcement assistance system, improve a normalized mechanism for collecting problem clues, resolutely correct and seriously hold accountable behaviours of arbitrary fee collection, arbitrary fines, and arbitrary levies Precisely support enterprise development: multiple departments have established normalised communication mechanisms with enterprises, a new round of support policies for specialised, refined, and innovative enterprises has been launched, support has been provided to over 1,000 key Little Giant enterprises through central funds. ，，，，；，，，，、；，，，1000--. It also mentions policy support around the two heavy projects and two new work, the work related to the draft law on promoting the private economy, guidelines to support foreign trade and the building of a unified national market. The article adds: -At present, the effects of the policy changes are being released, and the trend of market recovery and stabilizing positive expectations is becoming more obvious. In the first three quarters, the main policies supporting scientific and technological innovation and manufacturing development in the current policies were tax reduction, fee reduction and tax rebate exceeding 2 trillion yuan. In October, nationwide enterprise sales revenue increased year-on-year, rising 1.3 percentage points month-on-month; the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 50.1%, returning to the expansion zone for the first time since May this year; the Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index has remained stable around 50% for several consecutive months; and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Index rose 0.3 points from September, the largest increase this year. Although current difficulties are still numerous, the confidence of economic entities is recovering, and more and more enterprises are moving forward more resolutely.- ，，、。，2。10，，1.3；PMI50.1%，5；50%；90.3，。，，. The piece ends by saying that the -Chinese economy is resilient, has great potential, and is full of vitality-. Its -long-term positive fundamentals will not change.- It also praises Chinese entrepreneurs as -courageous, visionary, brave in innovation, and exceling at taking action…- 、、、，. (My Note: It is noteworthy that the nationalism rhetoric seems to have taken a bit of a back seat when discussing economic issues. This article is an example of that. It argues that the current challenges are a product of several factors, including just something inherent to the stage of development that China is in. It does refer to the external environment as a factor but there's no nationalistic rabble-rousing. I also find it striking that patriotism is not one of the qualities that the authors mention when discussing entrepreneurs; a few years ago, patriotism was the rage.) Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Bobby M. Tuazon, Director for Policy Studies of a Philippine think tank, Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG). He basically says that the Philippines government has adopted a -confrontational and reckless- approach with regard to China on the South China Sea issue. These actions -undermine ASEAN unity, damage its own reputation, and weaken its policy autonomy.- He writes- -The changes in the Philippine government's foreign policy are mainly reflected in three aspects. First, it has abandoned its earlier relatively pragmatic position, ignored China's concerns, and actively moved closer to the United States militarily, offering four more military bases to the United States in the northern Philippines near Taiwan and sensitive areas near the South China Sea. Although the Philippines claims this is -not targeting any third country,- it clearly aims to join the US' so-called ‘defense alliance', raising concerns among regional countries. Second, regardless of the content of the ‘Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' such as -the directly concerned sovereign states shall resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means through friendly consultations and negotiations without resorting to force or the threat of force', it promoted its wrong stance on the South China Sea at the Shangri-La Dialogue and on other occasions, distorted and exaggerated the situation at sea, and held a series of military exercises with the United States and other extra-regional forces, posing challenges to regional peace and tranquility. Third, it has not fully adhered to or has even obscured the 2016 consensus reached between China and the Philippines. Instead, it has leaned toward seeking US ‘assistance', weakening the dialogue mechanisms established between China and the Philippines to peacefully resolve maritime disputes.- 。，，，4。--，--，。-，，-《》，，，，。2016。--，. He further warns: -The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining ASEAN unity. Military adventurism is a dangerous attempt by the US to maintain its global hegemony. The Philippines, disregarding the common interests of regional countries, insisted on establishing a dangerous ‘alliance' with the US, which is more than 10,000 km away from its homeland. This violates the common desire of ASEAN countries to pursue regional peace, security and stability. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining its own reputation. The Philippines has ignored the historical facts that the Chinese people began to sail and engage in production activities in the South China Sea more than 2,000 years ago, and that China was the first to discover, name and develop and utilize the South China Sea islands and related waters. It has continued to escalate tensions and claim so-called ‘Chinese aggression', which has not only affected the peaceful dialogue between the Philippines and China, a major trading partner, but also impacted the credibility of the Philippine government. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining the Philippines' policy autonomy. The Philippines has provided support for the US geostrategy, helped the US military carry out so-called ‘freedom of navigation' operations in the South China Sea, opened additional military bases for the US, allowed the US military to deploy medium-range missiles in the Philippines, and blindly devoted itself to building the so-called ‘US-Japan-Philippines alliance', gradually exacerbating regional tensions and putting the Philippines at risk of becoming a US ‘tool of war'.- ，。。，1--，、。，。2000，、，--，，。，。，--，，，--，，--. To maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, the Philippines needs to work with all parties to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and resolve conflicts and differences through dialogue and consultation.

PD Commentary on BRI Warns of 'Empty Promises' & 'Unrealistic Expectations' - China-Japan Ties - He Lifeng Meets Goldman Sachs COO - Xinhua Series on ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, December 05, 2024. Page 1: There's another BRI-related commentary on the page today. It reiterates Xi's call to maintain -strategic determination- because -opportunities outweigh the challenges.- It says that Xi's speech provided -important ideological guidance and strategic leadership for overcoming various risks and challenges and promoting the steady and long-term development of the high-quality joint construction of BRI.- This bit below in the commentary is worth noting. -General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ‘to promote the high-quality development of BRI, it is essential to appropriately address various risks and challenges and effectively mitigate the impacts of geopolitical conflicts.' At present, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, marked by rising unilateralism and protectionism, frequent local conflicts and unrest, and increasing deficits in peace, development, security, and governance; uncertainty, instability, and unpredictability are on the rise. In this increasingly complex international environment, advancing the high-quality development of the BRI hinges on integrating high-quality development with high-level security. It is necessary to skillfully leverage advantages, avoid pitfalls, turn crises into opportunities, be proactive in analysis and forecasting, strengthen strategic, operational, and adaptive capacities, consolidate the basic foundation of cooperation, and expand new space for cooperation.- ，-‘'，，-。，，、，，、、、，、、。--，。、，，、、，、. -Correctly handling the relationship between enhancing the sense of gain of partner countries and adhering to what is beneficial to us is an inherent requirement for promoting the high-quality development of BRI, and it is also an important principle and direction that must be firmly grasped at all times. It is necessary to persist in doing our best and acting within our capabilities, find the points of cooperation and the intersection of interests, coordinate the construction of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects — helping to jointly build national economic and social development of partner countries and improving people's livelihood—and continuously enhance the sense of participation, gain, and happiness of the people of partner countries. It is necessary to persist in what is beneficial to us, mutual benefit and win-win, do what should be done and not doing what should not be done, do not issue any ‘dishonoured/phony checks/empty promises' () and do not raise appetites/don't create unrealistic expectations (), balance the political, strategic, overall, long-term, and economic accounts, and effectively safeguard China's strategic interests.- ，--，。、，、，--，，、、。、，，--、，、、、、，. -As BRI continues to be further promoted, there is an increase in China's overseas assets. How to better safeguard the security of China's overseas interests is a major issue facing the country. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made arrangements around improving the foreign-related national security mechanism, and proposed a series of reform measures such as ‘establishing and improving the coordination mechanism for peripheral security work', ‘strengthening the system and mechanism for early warning, prevention and control, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks, and deepening international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security'. It is necessary to establish a bottom-line thinking, enhance risk awareness, speed up the improvement of various mechanisms and plans, and carry out risk investigation, monitoring, assessment, and early warning on a regular basis in order to effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons overseas and ensure the security of China's overseas interests.- --，。，。《》，---、、，-。、，，、、、，、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a Zhong Yin commentary, which focuses on the publication of the new reader on Xi Jinping Thought on Culture. It talks about how Xi's thought on this has outlined a -new cultural mission in the new era-. It says that: -Deeply rooted in excellent Chinese traditional culture, drawing on and absorbing all excellent achievements of human civilization, Chinese-style modernization represents the development direction of human civilization's progress, presents a new landscape different from Western modernization models, and creates a new form of human civilization.- ，，，，. It adds that the new reader -systematically expounds the core essence, spiritual substance, rich connotations, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, comprehensively reflecting the original contributions of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the cultural field, and provides an important study guide for us to deeply study and comprehend Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, feel the modern power of Chinese civilization, and consolidate the cultural foundation for national construction and national rejuvenation.- 《》，、、、，，，，、. The commentary is then divided into three parts, each making a specific point. The first of these stresses the importance of the -continuous and unceasing flow of Chinese civilization- which has remained -unbroken- for -thousands of years- and repeatedly encountered challenges yet enduring without decline-, thereby forging a -miracle of human civilization-. 。，，? So what accounts for this? The piece says: -The shared belief that ‘civilization cannot be interrupted' and the cultural consciousness of passing the torch are precisely the important codes for Chinese civilization's continuation to this day. The modern power of Chinese civilization is manifested in the unprecedented strengthening of our confidence, forged into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the entire nation, firmly grasping the fate of the country's development and progress in our own hands.- --、，。，，，. The second point is that -reform and innovation and keeping pace with the times are the eternal spiritual temperament of Chinese civilization.- 、. It adds: -The modern strength of Chinese civilization is manifested in our innovative power continuously condensing, exploring and innovating in frontier practices and unknown domains, continuously expanding new paths to realize modernization.- ，，、，. The third point is the experience of inclusiveness and tolerance. -Chinese civilization is a civilization that originated on the land of China, and it is also a civilization that has been formed through continuous exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations. In the new era, China is embracing the world with a more open attitude and contributing to the world with more dynamic civilizational achievements.- ，。、. In this context, the piece mentions BRI, GCI, GDI and GSI along with the proposal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Finally, there's a report on Zhao Leji meeting Hun Sen. Xinhua reports Zhao said that -China stands ready to work with Cambodia to firmly support each other, deepen practical cooperation and expand people-to-people exchanges in accordance with the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties. The NPC of China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Cambodia's Senate and National Assembly to contribute to the building of the China-Cambodia community with a shared future, Zhao added.- Subscribe now Page 2: A few reports to note. First, Wang Yi addressed (English report) the 20th Beijing-Tokyo Forum via video conference. He said that -not long ago, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met for the first time during the APEC meeting. The two sides agreed to work together to comprehensively promote the strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between China and Japan in accordance with the principles and directions established in the four political documents between China and Japan, and to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. Both sides should be guided by the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, adhere to the original aspirations of relations, follow the right path, seek common ground, and coordinate actions, all with the aim of promoting stable, lasting bilateral relations. He then made four points. First, Wang said that the two sides should understand the correct positioning of bilateral relations. China has always regarded Japan as an important cooperation partner, and hopes that Japan can view China's development objectively and rationally. He also hoped that Japan will work with China to follow the correct positioning of the comprehensive advancement of the strategic, mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan, and implement the important consensus that the two countries should be cooperative partners and should not pose a threat to each other. Second, the two sides should maintain the political foundations of bilateral relations.

Page 3: There's a report informing that in the first three quarters of the year, the scale of agricultural insurance premiums reached 137.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.2%, providing risk protection of 4.3 trillion yuan for 136 million insured farmers. Another report informs that in the first 10 months, the added value of China's machinery industry increased by 5.5% year-on-year, production and sales were generally stable, foreign trade saw accelerated development, and the overall operating situation was stable and improving. Page 5: Yesterday, there was a Xinhua article in the paper discussing the economy. This is a series that is likely to continue. All this leads to the CEWC meeting in the days ahead. The article yesterday did lead to some media kerfuffle, owing to this bit below. I did not find it particularly remarkable, perhaps because I didn't see the novelty in it. To me, this has been the leadership's consensus on the direction of economic development for some time. But it is useful to note it as a signal before the CEWC. -When looking at economic growth rate, we must not only look at the present or the immediate moment, but more importantly look dialectically and long-term. Valuing speed but not being solely focused on speed is the dialectical approach currently followed by China's economic development. GDP and its growth rate are typically used to measure a comprehensive economic strength and level of an economic entity. However, as a quantitative indicator, GDP emphasizes the concept of quantity and cannot comprehensively reflect the quality and efficiency of economic activities. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: Understanding economic development as simply an increase or decrease in quantity and simple repetition is a metaphysical view of development. Since the 1960s, among more than 100 middle-income economies globally, only a dozen have successfully become high-income economies. The ones who were successful have achieved a shift in economic development from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement after experiencing a period of high-speed growth. Those countries that have stagnated or even regressed have not achieved this fundamental transformation. The extensive economic development model once played a significant role in our country, but also made us pay enormous resource and environmental costs, concealing some contradictions and risks. If we do not break the ‘speed worship', and continue to lay out projects and launch initiatives, even if we temporarily increase the speed, we will be overdrawing future growth. ‘No matter how fast the speed, it is not that we cannot, but that we choose not to.' Entering the new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping has distinctly proposed that our economic development has entered a new normal of speed changes, structural optimization, and motivation transformation, making the important assertion that our economy has shifted from high-speed growth to high-quality development stage. Development is a hard truth, and high-quality development is the hard truth of the new era. From comprehensively implementing the new development concept, to accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, to developing new quality productivity according to local conditions, the Chinese economy continues to be injected with new connotations of high-quality development. The current Chinese economy pays more attention to achieving effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth, rather than simply hero-worshipping GDP. This year's annual economic growth target is around 5%, and we have been striving towards this goal. Through effort, whether it's slightly left or right of 5%, is acceptable. Compared to speed, to assess whether the economy is good, we must more importantly see whether the development momentum is strong, whether the economic structure is reasonable, whether the innovation drive is stronger, whether development is more coordinated, whether the green foundation is thicker, whether the opening-up level is higher, and whether the people are happier and more secure. ，、，、。、，。GDP，。，GDP，。：-、，。-60，100。，。，。，，。--，、，，。-，，。-，、、，。，。，，，。，，GDP。5%，。，5%，。，，、，、、、、. Share Tracking People's Daily Today's article deals with boosting domestic demand. Perhaps, the most significant bit to note is that while demand is being seen as a challenge, there are no new ideas being discussed. The article is a re-affirmation of the current policy path. It says: -At present, my country faces a complex and severe international environment, and the challenge of insufficient domestic demand is still significant. Striving to expand domestic demand is an important task of economic work at present and in the future.- ，，.，. The first part of the article talks about improving numbers, such as retail sales, fixed assets investments, and many others. The second part of the article says this: -For a period of time, our economic operation has faced challenges including insufficient domestic effective demand. In the first three quarters, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth was at its lowest level in recent years. Challenges and opportunities coexist. How to respond to challenges and seize opportunities? ... ‘Is Chinese consumption facing a crisis?' Recently, consulting firm McKinsey released a report titled ‘2024 Chinese Consumer Market Truth', responding to misreadings about Chinese consumption. ‘Although the growth rate of domestic consumption has declined, it is still growing, especially in some industries such as the service industry and tourism industry.' From the perspective of investment, the growth rate of private investment in the first 10 months fell by 0.3% year-on-year, the lowest growth rate since the beginning of this year. However, excluding real estate development investment, private investment increased by 6.3% year-on-year, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the overall investment growth rate. Private investment in manufacturing, general equipment manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing and other fields maintained double-digit growth. Understanding the Chinese economy requires not just looking at current data fluctuations, but seeing how challenges are addressed, how obstacles are overcome, continuously striving towards established goals, and solidly taking each step.- -In November, the General Office of the State Council issued the ‘Guidelines on Stimulating the Vitality of the Ice and Snow Economy through the High-quality Development of Ice and Snow Sports'. According to the document, by 2030, the total scale of the ice and snow economy will reach 1.5 trillion yuan. This will be an increase of nearly 70% over 2023. Entering the new era, the primary social contradictions in our country have undergone historic changes. By focusing on meeting people's needs for ‘good or not'/quality, the potential and opportunities of the domestic market are limitless. Cultivate new engines. Since the beginning of this year, from developing the silver economy to stimulating the vitality of the ice and snow economy, from the ‘take-off' of the low-altitude economy to the ‘ignition' of the pioneering economy, efforts on both supply and demand sides are leveraging investment and consumption, continuously upgrading and expanding the ultra-large-scale market. Expanding new spaces. Deeply promoting green low-carbon development, releasing the new-type urbanization strategic five-year action plan, cultivating and developing county-level economies, improving the level of regional coordinated development, promoting comprehensive rural revitalization, there is greater depth in terms of new spaces in the Chinese economy.- ，。，...。、？-？-，《2024》，：-，，。-，100.3%，。，6.3%，3，、、。，，、，，。11，《》。，2030，1.5。2023。，。--，、。。，，----，、，，。。、、、、，. Subscribe now It then adds: -At the same time, it should be noted that the current consumption capacity and willingness of residents are still insufficient, private investment expectations are weak, the real estate market is still in deep adjustment, and the overall price level continues to run at a low level. Facing new situations and problems in economic operation, the Party Central Committee made decisive decisions, with a coordinated package of policies working in the same direction, with a very clear orientation of expanding domestic demand. The 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds for the ‘two heavy' construction and ‘two new' work have already been all issued. The 100 billion yuan central budget investment plan for next year and the 100 billion yuan list of -two-heavy- construction projects were issued ahead of schedule this year. Research and proposals have been made to further strengthen support for the ‘two new', expand the scope of support policies, and intensify efforts to boost investment and promote consumption. The reserve requirement ratio and policy interest rates were reduced, structural monetary policy tools to support the stable development of the stock market have been put in place, and greater support has been provided for the financing and investment activities of business entities. The most significant debt optimization measures in recent years to enhance local governments' spending capacity have been introduced, directing more resources toward expanding investment, promoting consumption, and safeguarding livelihoods. A ‘combination punch' to reduce home purchase costs, stimulate housing demand, and increase support for specific groups has been implemented. Going forward, we must strive at the key points of the national economy and people's livelihood, continue to stimulate potential consumption, and expand effective and profitable investment. International organizations have assessed that the package of policies aims to improve social welfare, ensure the healthy operation of local governments, and bring price and asset price expectations into a positive cycle. It is beneficial for clearing bottlenecks in economic development, livelihood, and employment, promoting a smoother economic rebalancing process, and reflecting further innovation and breakthroughs in China's economic policy approach.- ，，，，。，，、，。----1，10001000--，--、，；、，；，，、、；--、，……，、。，、、，，，.
